  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toxoplasma gondii infects over one third of the global human population. Cerebral
      toxoplasmosis is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV patients resulting in up to
      50% of mortality with proper treatment and 80% without it. The fatality mainly due to the
      brain edema resulted from the mass effect lesion. In addition of anti toxoplasmosis given,
      adjunctive therapy such as steroid is recommended in order to reduce brain edema, but the
      dose and duration of administration in cerebral toxoplasmosis has not been evaluated in a
      clinical trial. Adjunctive therapy given in cerebral toxoplasmosis patients still remains
      unclear. Moreover, its safety in immunodeficiency cases is still debatable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Steroid produces a raising expression of anti inflammation genes (NF-κB, IκB-α and antagonist
      receptor IL-1) and inhibits pro inflammation cytokines ( TNF-α and IL-1β). It also works as
      anti edema by correcting the disrupted blood brain barrier during infection process.
      Dexamethasone is considered to be chosen in this clinical trial due to the long half life
      among steroids, the strongest glucocorticoid effect comparing other steroids, and easy
      prepared and used on daily practice.

      There are limited data from using adjunctive steroid for treatment of HIV-associated with
      cerebral toxoplasmosis. Previous study in France published in 2012 showed steroid did not
      give any significant improvement for patients' neurological outcome and did not worsen
      patients' condition such as getting nosocomial infection. Meanwhile comparing previous study
      by Arens et. al in 2007, there was an increasing mortality rate on adjunctive steroid used in
      cerebral toxoplasmosis patients.

      As result of limited data, our trial is looked forward to answer about the efficacy of
      dexamethasone treatment in reducing mortality rate of cerebral toxoplasmosis patients.

    <description>Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) will be used to quantify the level of consciousness. GCS is a continuous scale ranging from 3 - 15 with higher scores represent better outcome
GCS will be recorded every day until day 14 of hospitalization</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological response (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological responses that show both improvement (e.g. regaining consciousness) and worsening (i.e. decreasing of consciousness, development of new neurological deficits) will be measured and recorded at days 3, 7, 30, 60 and 90.
Neurological response will be measured by serial assessments of Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).
GOS is a scale that measures objective degree of recovery. It has 6 degrees of measurement ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 equals death and 5 full recovery.</description>

    <measure>Neurological response (2)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological responses that show both improvement (e.g. regaining consciousness) and worsening (i.e. decreasing of consciousness, development of new neurological deficits) will be measured and recorded at days 3, 7, 30, 60 and 90.
Second neurological response measurement will be using serial assessments of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is commonly used for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0 to 6, with 0 equals to perfect health without symptoms, and 6 equals to death; i.e. the higher the score, the worse the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be measured by using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) as early as the subjects regain consciousness and at day 7, 30 and 90.
MMSE is a continuous scale with values from 0 to 30, and considered normal if the value is more than or equal to 28</description>

MoCA-INA is a continuous scale with values from 0 to 30, and considered normal if the value is more than or equal to 26</description>
