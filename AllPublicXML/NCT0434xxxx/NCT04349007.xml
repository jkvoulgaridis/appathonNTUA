  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-phase protocol. Phase 1 will include the development of the peanut-based
      school food, and a small formative research study on the acceptability and consumption of the
      school food study intervention. This will occur at 1 of the 5 schools in the Mion district,
      60 school aged children between 6-9 years old will be recruited to participate in a 3 week
      consumption and acceptability study. An integral part of the food development process is
      acceptability testing. A child must like and want to eat a new food if it is to be consumed
      as prescribed and effective in potential improving linear growth and cognitive performance.
      This study will confirm that food developed for the school feeding clinical trial will be
      consumed as dosed and what additional snack food offerings may be useful in encouraging
      consumption. Phase 2 will be a randomized, investigator blinded, controlled clinical
      effectiveness trial of a peanut-based school meal with and without milk powder compared to a
      control meal on linear growth and cognitive performance. Up to 1,000, 6 to 9 years old,
      healthy, enrolled in P1 or KG2 level classes at 5 selected schools in the Mion district will
      be randomized to receive one of three school foods, a peanut-based food with milk, the same
      peanut-based food without milk and a control group composed of commonly available
      tuber/cereal. The sample size accounts for 25% attrition for a final sample size of 750 with
      a total 250 eligible children enrolled in each group. Enrolled children will receive the meal
      daily during the school lunch period for an entire school year. At enrolment, anthropometric
      measurements and body composition data will be collected and a tablet- based and language
      independent cognitive test will be administered. Participants will receive a token of
      appreciation at after their enrolment testing and at the completion of the study. The primary
      outcomes will be change in height-for-age z score and change in cognitive performance on
      tests using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated battery. The secondary outcomes
      will be change in body mass index, change in anthropometric measurements, and change in other
      body compositions measurements measured by bioelectrical impedance.
