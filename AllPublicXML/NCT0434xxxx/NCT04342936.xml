  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      Camrelizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. Participants
      will be randomized to receive either Camrelizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy of
      investigators' choice.

      The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with Camrelizumab prolongs
      Progression-free Survival (PFS) in participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin
      Lymphoma compared to treatment with Chemotherapy.
