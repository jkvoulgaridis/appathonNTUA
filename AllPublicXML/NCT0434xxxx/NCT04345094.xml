  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photoaging is a common concern within the cosmeceutical industry with many products that are
      available. One frequently used product is hydroquinone that is used to even skin tone.
      However, hydroquinone has several shortcomings. The ingredient is controversial for its
      potential safety issues and it has been banned in Europe. An alternative ingredient that has
      emerged for its potential use is hexyresorcinol for evening skin tone. Additionally,
      hexylresorcinol may have other photoaging benefits such as the reduction in the appearance of
      fine lines.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess how hexyresorcinol may compare to the use of
      hydroquinone in the setting of photoaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females aged 35-65 (limiting to females so that there is not heterogeneity with the
             influence of hormones. Also, females are a much larger user base of skin care
             products)

          -  Individuals who have not participated in any other clinical studies using the same
             test sites (face) and hand in the past 14 days

          -  Individuals with Fitzpatrick skin type I-IV

          -  No known medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with
             study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Individuals who have been on any medication that has caused a change in skin
             pigmentation based on the opinion of the investigator

               -  Individuals who have history of acute or chronic disease that would likely
                  interfere with or increase the risk on study participation at the discretion of
                  the investigator

               -  Female volunteers who are pregnant or are actively breastfeeding or planning a
                  pregnancy within two months. (There is no concern for risk to fetus but pregnancy
                  can alter skin pigmentation)

               -  Female volunteers who have started a new hormonal birth control agent or switched
                  to a hormonal birth control agent within the past 60 days

               -  Individuals who have had any medical or cosmetic procedure, such as laser
                  resurfacing, or plastic surgery to the test site (face) within the last 6 months.
                  This includes botulinum toxin, dermal fillers, collagen or other similar cosmetic
                  procedure

               -  Individuals who are currently using or during the past 30 days have used
                  hydroquinone, or a retinoid such as Retin A, or other Rx/OTC Retinyl A.

               -  Individuals who have used salicyclic acid, beta hydroxy acid, vitamins A, C, E in
                  the 14 days prior to first visit.

               -  Individuals with a known history of hypersensitivity to any ingredients to the
                  cosmetic agent that is being assessed

               -  Individuals who are pregnant, breast feeding or planning a pregnancy.

               -  Individuals who have history of a psychological illness or condition that would
                  interfere with their ability to understand and follow the requirements of the
                  study at the discretion of the investigator
