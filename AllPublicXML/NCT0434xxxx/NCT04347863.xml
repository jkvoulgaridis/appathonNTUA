      This is a randomized controlled behavioral intervention trial to assess the efficacy of
      investigating program of food preparation on diet improve patients with stroke. Subjects will
      be randomized to intervention group and control group.The primary outcome included seven
      measures, Functional oral intake scale, Mini Nutritional Assessment, Council on Nutrition
      Appetite Questionnaire, Dietary Well-Being Scale, Swallowing Quality of Life questionnaire,
      WHO Quality of Life-BREF and Eating Assessment Tool-10.
