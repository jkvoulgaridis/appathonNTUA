  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are eligible only if they meet all the following criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years when they sign the informed consent form;

          2. Subjects are eligible only if they meet the following criteria:

               1. Part A and B: patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are
                  confirmed by cytological or histological examination, who did not respond to
                  standard treatment regimens, or did not tolerate these regimens, or had no
                  effective standard treatment regimens, or refused standard treatment regimens;

               2. Part C:Patients who have experienced disease progression after platinum-based
                  chemotherapy and one other systemic therapy and have cytologically or
                  histologically confirmed stage IV disease or have stage IIIB or IIIC (AJCC
                  Edition 8) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ineligible for local therapy, with
                  EGFR wild type and without ALK gene rearrangement. According to the expression of
                  PD-L1 in the tumor, the subjects are divided into the following 3 groups:

             Group C1: Subjects with disease progression after previous platinum-based chemotherapy
             and one other systemic therapy for NSCLC, with high PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%);
             Group C2: Subjects with disease progression after previous platinum-based chemotherapy
             and one other systemic therapy for NSCLC, with low PD-L1 expression (TPS: 1-49%,
             inclusive); Group C3: Subjects with disease progression after previous platinum-based
             chemotherapy and one other systemic therapy for NSCLC, with no PD-L1 expression (TPS &lt;
             1%); Remarks: Subjects participating in the expansion study should provide archival
             tumor specimens (&lt;6 months) or fresh biopsy specimens within 28 days prior to the
             initial dosing (excluding bone biopsy) to determine the expression level of PD-L1
             before entering the group. Subjects should provide fresh biopsy specimens before
             entering the group if they have received systemic treatment or local treatment (i.e.,
             radiotherapy [RT] or chemoradiotherapy [CRT]) after collection of archival biopsy
             specimens. The archival specimen is a formalin-fixed tumor tissue specimen from a
             tumor lesion that is biopsied at or after the diagnosis of metastatic disease, and
             from a site that has not been previously irradiated. It is not allowed to analyze the
             specimens biopsied prior to dosing in patients who have received any systemic therapy
             for the tumor (including neoadjuvant / adjuvant therapy).

          3. The ECOG score is 0 or 1 point (see the scoring criteria in Appendix 1);

          4. Based on RECIST 1.1 (see the scoring criteria in Appendix 4), subjects of Part C
             should have at least one measurable lesion, and those of Part A or B could have no
             measurable lesion;

             Definition of measurable lesion:

               1. Tumor lesion: The size must be accurately measurable on two mutually
                  perpendicular diameters, and both diameters must be ≥10 mm or ≥2 times of the
                  slice thickness

               2. Lymph node lesion: The size must be accurately measurable on two mutually
                  perpendicular diameters, and both diameters must be ≥15 mm or ≥2 times of the
                  slice thickness

          5. In subjects who had received other treatments, the toxic and side effects should
             return to grade ≤ 1 or to the baseline (NCI-CTCAE 5.0, excluding alopecia);

          6. The expected survival time should be at least 3 months;

          7. The subjects of Part A and B should give their consent to providing blood samples for
             the exploratory analysis and are free to provide tumor tissue specimens; while the
             subjects of Part C should provide sufficient archived sections of tumor tissues or
             fresh tumor tissues for PD-L1 detection；

          8. Subjects should have appropriate organ and bone marrow functions, and have laboratory
             test results within the following ranges before entering the group:

             Bone marrow reserve (within 14 days, no transfusion of blood or blood products, or no
             correction by G-CSF or other hematopoietic stimulate factors): absolute neutrophils
             count (ANC) ≥1.5×109/L; hemoglobin (HB) ≥90 g/L; and platelet (PLT) ≥75×109/L; Liver
             function: ALT≤2.5×ULN; AST≤2.5×ULN; ALP≤2.5×ULN; TBIL≤1.5×ULN (patients with known
             Gilbert's disease are eligible if their serum bilirubin level ≤3×ULN; and patients
             with metastases to liver are eligible if their ALT≤5×ULN, AST≤5×ULN, and ALP≤5×ULN);
             and albumin ≥3 g/dL; Kidney function: creatinine ≤1.5×ULN or creatinine clearance ≥45
             mL/min as calculated according to Cockcroft-Gault formula (refer to Appendix 2); Blood
             coagulation function: INR, PT, and APTT≤1.5×ULN (in patients not on anticoagulants;
             and it is decided by investigators whether patients on anticoagulants are eligible);
             Cardiac enzymes CK and CKMB measures are within the normal range; Thyroid function
             measures are within the normal range or mildly abnormal but requiring no treatment.

          9. Fertile eligible patients (males and females) must give their consent to taking
             reliable contraceptive measures (hormone, barrier, or sexual abstinence) throughout
             the trial and at least 4 months after the last dosing; reproductive-age females must
             have negative blood or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment;

         10. The subjects must give their informed consent for the study and signed ICF voluntarily
             before the trial;

         11. The subjects or the statutory agents should be able to communicate well and complete
             the study complying with the protocol.
