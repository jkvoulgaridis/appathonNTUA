      This study evaluates the prevalence of delayed chemotherapy induced nausea in adult oncology
      patients in real clinical practice of day clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapies are rated to have a high to minimal emetogenic potential in oncology patients.
      Their potential to induce delayed nausea is supposed to often be higher than their emetogenic
      potential. However, data on delayed chemotherapy-related nausea are scarce, which is
      problematic because nausea (a) has a large impact on patients quality of life and treatment
      decisions, (b) is often underestimated by health care professionals, (c) is less responsive
      to commonly used antiemetic medication, and (d) may even be different from rates that have
      been established in controlled clinical trials.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of delayed chemotherappy-induced
      nausea in adult oncology patients in dayclinics.
