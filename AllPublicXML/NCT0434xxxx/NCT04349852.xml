  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine if computerized cognitive remediation will improve working memory
      and attention in 25 adults with moderate to severe brain injury and compared their cognitive
      performance to the control group of 25 adults with moderate to severe brain injury. The
      control group will train on computerized tasks of social awareness. Participants in both
      groups will be assessed prior to training and immediately post-training and one month-post
      training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design will be randomized assignment with a control group.Participants in both
      groups will undergo three cognitive assessments at baseline, at the end of 40 cognitive
      training modules, and 1-month post-completion of the first follow-up assessment.

    <description>The BrainHQ is a computerized training program developed from Posit Science designed to improve multiple cognitive domains. The subtests exercises include 3 modules for the experimental group: 1) Sound Sweeps: which is identify whether sound pitches are going up or down; 2) Memory Grids: matching pairs of words; and 3) Syllable Stack: recognition of sequences of confusable syllables. Since the intervention is presented both visually and verbally through the computer, noise cancelling head phones will also be provided to the participants.</description>

    <description>The BrainHQ is a computerized training program developed from Posit Science designed to improve multiple cognitive domains. The BrainHQ will provide 3 training modules for the control group: 1) Recognition: a picture of a face is presented briefly and then the subject picks the recognized face from 3 pictures. 2) Face to Face: matching the emotional expression of 3 pictures to the emotional expression of the picture previously presented; 3) Face Facts: recalling 3 facts about a person that was previously presented. Participants will spend 45 minutes at each training session. Since the intervention is presented both visually and verbally through the computer, noise cancelling head phones will also be provided to the participants.</description>
