  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of immediate implants in the aesthetic area is a technique widely used in modern
      implantology. The characteristics of the patient, the implant, and the surgical procedure
      used may influence the final results. The aim was to assess whether the implant design
      affects primary (PS) and secondary stability (SS), bone level (BL), and PES/WES evaluation.

    <textblock>
      20 implants with two different designs (n=10) were immediately placed in the upper anterior
      maxilla with no grafting material. ISQ, BL, and PES/WES were evaluated. Results will analyze
      with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (p&lt;0.05).

      The random distribution is made prior to assignment following the internet prgram

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 20 patients, distributed in two groups with ten patient each (experimental and control) were included in this study. All patients signed a double informed consent, one for implant placement and one for their participation in the study. The study follows the Declaration of Helsinki recommendations. The Ethics Committee of the University of Murcia approved the study protocol with ID: 2076/2018.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The bone level (BL) was determined by an intraoral digital radiograph taken parallel to the long axis of the implant.
The distance from the implant neck to the first contact between the bone and the implant was determined. It was measured in both sides, mesial and distal, and the mean between both values was established as the BL value.</description>

    <time_frame>After 12 months of definitive implant load</time_frame>
    <description>Pink Esthetic Score/White Esthetic Score [PES/WES] The parameters evaluated by this index are (1) mesial papilla, (2) distal papilla, (3) curvature of facial mucosa, (4) level of facial mucosa, and (5) root convexity/soft tissue color and texture. Each parameter range between 0 and 2. A maximum score of 10 can be obtained, considering acceptable from 6 The WES focuses specifically on the visible part of the restoration and in base on the following five parameters: (1) tooth form, (2) tooth volume/outline, (3) color (hue and value), (4) Surface texture, and (5) translucency. Each parameter is evaluated by comparison with the adjacent teeth, giving a value ranged from 0 to 2. A total score of 10 can be obtained, considering acceptable from 6</description>

    <description>Patients were treated with implants Inhex Ticare Standard (Mozo Grau, Ticare, Valladolid, Spain). The implants presented a surface treated with Reabsorbable Blast Media (RBM), conical macro-design with non-aggressive threads, internal connection, and platform switching. On the implant shoulder, the beveled design of the platform was characterized by a rounded shape of 45º.</description>
