    <time_frame>Completion of enrollment and treatment of all patients (estimated to be 21 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Feasibility is defined as the ability to receive 3 intra-arterial injections of melphalan per patient.</description>

    <measure>Rate of ocular salvage</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A patient will be considered a successful ocular salvage if the child does not experience enucleation because of disease progression or toxicity during 2 years of follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Rate of metastatic disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Patients will be determined to have metastatic disease if they have received 1 or more administrations of IAC and they are found to have progression of disease or appearance of tumor outside of the eye after protocol therapy. Pineal tumors will not be considered metastatic disease.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma &gt;4 months of age16

          -  Patients whose other treatment options would require systemic chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, or enucleation

          -  Patient or parent/legal guardian must sign a written informed consent

          -  One of a, b, or c:

               -  Patients who have bilateral COG stage B, C, D, or E retinoblastoma (refer to
                  Appendix A) who have undergone systemic chemotherapy without resolution (meaning
                  either has not had CR or has progressed despite systemic chemotherapy) and would
                  have the following treatment options remaining:

                    -  IAC

                    -  enucleation of one eye

                    -  local radiation

               -  Patients with non-germline retinoblastoma with unilateral disease who have COG A,
                  B, C, or D tumors (refer to Appendix A).

               -  Other patients may be considered on a case by case basis after discussion with
                  pediatric ophthalmology, hematology/oncology, and interventional neuroradiology.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Opaque or hazy media which precluded visualization of the fundus.

          -  New or recurrent retinoblastoma that can be controlled with other conservative
             measures such as cryotherapy, thermotherapy, or plaque radiotherapy.

          -  Unilateral COG group E retinoblastoma (refer to Appendix A) with very poor visual
             prognosis as defined by pediatric ophthalmologist.

          -  Patients who would benefit from systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with clinical or radiological evidence suggestive of retinoblastoma invasion
             of the optic nerve, choroid, sclera, orbit or metastatic sites.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to melphalan or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Participants of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are &lt; 350 cells/mcL or
             they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months
             prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS
             treatment guidelines is recommended.
