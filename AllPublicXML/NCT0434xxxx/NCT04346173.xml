  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Cleft palate is a congenital deformity caused by abnormal facial development during
      intra-uterine life. Worldwide, the prevalence of cleft lip/palate is about 1:1000 live
      births.

      The levator vela palatini muscles are malpositioned sagittally, running postero-anteriorly
      and inserted onto the posterior edge of the hard palate in cleft palate patients . This
      configuration prevents the muscle from exerting its upward, backward, and lateral pull.

      Various modalities have been described with major refinements over the past 30 years.
      Gradually, cleft surgeons began to appreciate the importance of dissection and
      retro-positioning of the levator muscle on improving speech outcomes.

      Furlow was the first to describe the palatoplasty technique, in which the levator muscle is
      dissected and freely released from its abnormal position and retro-positioned in a Z-plasty
      lengthening technique without dissection on the hard palate. However , among the problems
      that have been raised concerning the Furlow palatoplasty is the limitation of the procedure
      in wide clefts. Furthermore, the possibility of higher fistula rate associated with the
      technique.

      These considerations have led to modified palatal lengthening by buccinator myomucosal flaps
      which is this study working on.
