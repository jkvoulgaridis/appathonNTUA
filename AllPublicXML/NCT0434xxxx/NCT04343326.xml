  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is aimed to investigate the role of supplemental systemic oxygen therapy during
      accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL).

      In this prospective randomized clinical trial, patients with progressive keratoconus who are
      candidates for receiving CXL will be included. The patients will be randomized and allocated
      to three different CXL protocol. In the first group (OA-CXL), CXL is performed using an
      accelerated protocol (9 mW/ CM2 for 10 minutes) in addition to the delivery of systemic
      oxygen with a rate of 5 liters/min through a nasal mask for 10 minutes during UV-A ablation.
      Patients in the second group (A-CXL) will receive CXL with the same accelerated protocol
      without additional oxygen therapy. Conventional CXL using 30 mW/CM2 UV-A ablation for 30
      minutes is perfomed in the patients of the third goup (C-CXL). Maximum keratometry in Sirius
      corneal tomography as the primary outcome and uncorrected and corrected distance visual
      acuity (UDVA, CDVA) and corneal biomechanical properties including corneal resistance factor
      (CRF) and corneal hysteresis (CH) as secondary outcome measures are followed for a six- and
      12-months period. A P-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significance
      level.
