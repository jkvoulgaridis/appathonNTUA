  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, olanzapine is the most widely used and studied drug for the treatment of
      behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but there are
      significant side effects. Amisulpride is a new antipsychotic that not only controls mental
      symptoms but also improves cognitive function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of both amisulpride and Olanzapine for treating
      the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with dementia of the
      Alzheimer type.
