  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the optimal schedule for three-dimensional verification imaging and necessary
      re-planning of patients undergoing IMPT for a rapidly changing tumor (small cell lung
      cancer).

        -  To determine the rate of cardiac toxicities from IMPT in patients with small cell lung
           cancer compared with historical controls receiving photon-based treatment.

        -  To determine the rate of pneumonitis and esophagitis from IMPT and compare with
           historical controls receiving photon based treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year from study start</time_frame>
    <description>Patients enrolled will experience &lt;35% incidence of cardiac events at 1-year. Cardiac events included are acute heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, heart failure, pericarditis, and pericardial effusion.</description>

    <measure>Determination of the optimal frequency of conebeam CT during treatment and subsequent need for adaptive re-planning</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1,2, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The optimal frequency of conebeam CT during treatment will be determined by a mixed model:
The local control, distant metastases, patterns of failure will be summarized as frequency and percentage.
Chi-square test will be used to test their relationships with other categorical variables.
General linear model will be used to measure their association with continuous covariates with and without adjusting for other factors</description>

    <description>This is the first prospective study to investigate the safety and efficacy of IMPT for the treatment of SCLC. We will utilize adaptive planning throughout the radiation course. In addition, we will study the dosimetric parameters of IMPT and their correlation with treatment-related toxicities, particularly cardiac events.</description>

    <description>The goal of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is to deliver radiation to the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding normal tissues.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed small cell lung cancer, limited or extensive stage.

          -  Patients who are offered thoracic radiotherapy with intensity-modulated proton therapy
             (IMPT) techniques delivering 30-66 Gy in 15-33 fractions at 2 Gy per fraction, at the
             recommendation of the treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Age 18 or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation therapy which would provide significant dose overlap with the planned
             target volume(s)

          -  Pregnancy
