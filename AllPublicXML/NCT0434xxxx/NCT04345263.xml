  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permanent teeth with carious pulp exposure and indicated for full pulpotomy will be treated
      using three different materials using aseptic technique and will be subsequently followed up
      clinically and radiographically at 6 months, 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.

      -  The target sample size is 150 patients medically fit, having vital teeth with carious
           pulp exposure and complaining of pain.

        -  The patients tooth will receive full pulpotomy under aseptic conditions and it will be
           randomly assigned to one of 3 calcium silicate based materials namely, MTA, Biodentine,
           and Bioceramic for capping the full pulpotomy followed by resin composite restoration.

        -  Follow up for pain levels will be done during the first week.

        -  clinical and radiographic examination will be done at 6 months, 1 year and yearly up to
           5 years.

        -  Success of the procedure includes absence of clinical signs and symptoms, with absence
           of pathology in the root and periapex on periapical radiographs.

        -  The 3 materials will be compared in terms of clinical and radiographic outcomes.

        -  demographic data of the three groups will be also compared

        -  predictive factors of success will be also analyzed

        -  tooth color changes will be also measured using vita easy shade and will compared
           between the groups at 6 months and 1 year.
