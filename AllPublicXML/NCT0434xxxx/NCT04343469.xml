  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The investigators have found that obesity and insulin resistance result in
      significantly increased brain insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas in every other
      tissue glucose uptake is lower in the obese compared to lean individuals. One possible
      explanation to this could be central inflammation and activation of brain glial cells, which
      has been shown to occur in animal models of obesity.

      Aims: The objective of this study is to investigate whether there is brain inflammation in
      human obesity, and whether weight loss following bariatric surgery decreases brain
      inflammation.

      Methods: A total of 60 morbidly obese subjects, assigned for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or for
      sleeve gastrectomy according to routine treatment protocols will be recruited for this study.
      A control group of 30 healthy subjects will also be recruited. The following studies will be
      performed to patients and healthy subjects: 1) structural MRI and MRS, 2) functional MRI, 3)
      PET imaging of cerebral inflammation and astrocyte activation using [11C]-PK11195, 4)
      measurement of whole-body and tissue insulin sensitivity by combining hyperinsulinemic,
      euglycemic clamp with [18F]-FDG-PET, 5) neuropsychological testing. The study procedures will
      be repeated for the morbidly obese 6 months postoperatively.

      This is a prospective study, where subjects for the morbidly obese group (N=60) will be
      recruited from the patients undergoing bariatric surgery according to normal treatment
      protocol and the bariatric procedure is decided on clinical data together with the bariatric
      surgeon and the patient. The morbidly obese patients are studied before and 6 months after
      bariatric surgery.

      Results of obese are compared to results of healthy subjects (N=30), who are studied once.

      MRI studies: Brain structural MRI and MRS Structural brain MRI will be performed to obtain
      anatomical reference. The MR part of a 3T PET-MR system will be used for the study . MR
      spectroscopy (MRS) will be used to determine levels of different metabolites.Brain activation
      studies (functional MRI) The aim of the fMRI is to assess how morbid obesity and weight loss
      influence the brain reward system in response to visual cues (not food related); resting
      state fMRI will also be performed.

      Brain inflammation: [¹¹C]-PK11195 tracer with PET/CT is used to determine activation of glial
      cells, or inflammation, in the brain. After intravenous injection of 500 MBq [¹¹C]-PK11195, a
      60-minute dynamic scan on the brain using the same PET/CT cameras will be performed. Both
      ROI- and SPM based statistics will be used in the statistical analyses.

      Whole-body scan with [18F]-FDG and PET/CT during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia used to promote
      tissue glucose uptake and measure insulin sensitivity. After 60 minutes from the start of
      clamp, the subjects will be injected intravenously with 150 MBq of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose
      ([18F]-FDG) Thereafter [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the brain, abdomen, femoral region
      will be measured.
