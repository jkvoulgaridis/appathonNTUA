      This study is monocentric, retrospective and prospective, non-controlled, consecutive series
      Post-Market Clinical Follow-up Study to Provide Safety, Performance and Clinical Benefits
      Data of the Largest Zimmer® Maxera™ Cup (Implants and Instrumentation)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Zimmer Maxera Cup is a monoblock construct that consists of a preassembled shell and
      liner. The ceramic liner articulates with a ceramic femoral head for a ceramic-on-ceramic
      large diameter head articulation.

      The BIOLOX® delta ceramic liner (insert) is preassembled to lock into the tapered shell's
      cavity and articulate with BIOLOX OPTION ceramic femoral heads, sizes 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48
      mm and standard BIOLOX delta ceramic femoral head sizes 32, 36, and 40 mm.

      This is a single center post-market clinical evaluation. A consecutive series of 32 patients
      treated with a Maxera Cup (outer diameter 64 mm or 66 mm) between Nov 2011 and Feb 2018 will
      be identified and invited to participate in the study.

    <description>The THA surgical procedure involves replacing the head of the femur and acetabulum or socket with an artificial prosthesis. This system is composed of a femoral stem that is inserted into the femoral canal, a ball that attaches to the femoral stem, and an acetabular component or shell that replaces the acetabulum.
In this study, the acetabular component is the Zimmer Maxera Cup, which is a monoblock construct consisting of a pre-assembled shell and liner. The ceramic liner articulates with a ceramic femoral head for a ceramic-on-ceramic large diameter head articulation. The Maxera Cup is intended for single use only and is designed for reconstruction of the hip joint for conditions described in the inclusion and exclusion section of this protocol.</description>

        The investigator provided a list of 32 patients operated consecutively between Nov 2011 and
        Feb 2018. These patients received the Maxera Cup of outer diameter 64 or 66 mm. The
        patients have been operated based on the indications and contraindications listed in the
        Instructions For Use (IFUs) of the implant.

        The investigator will contact these patients to propose study enrollment until he can
        ensure 20 consecutive THA procedures. He will get their informed consent and
        retrospectively collect the preop, surgery, immed postop, and 1 year data

        These 20 patients will be followed-up in the frame of the standard clinicla routine and
        clinical data will be prospectively collected by the investigator at the 5, 7 and 10-year
        follow-up visits

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient received a Maxera Cup with an outer diameter of 64 mm or 66 mm.

          -  The Zimmer Maxera Cup is indicated for non-cemented use in skeletally mature
             individuals undergoing primary surgery for rehabilitating hips damaged as a result of
             non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease (NIDJD) including but not limited to
             osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, post-traumatic arthritis, congenital hip
             dysplasia, and inflammatory joint disease (IJD), e.g. rheumatoid arthritis if bone
             quality is adequate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active, old, or remote infection of the hip.

          -  Osteoradionecrosis.

          -  Local bone tumors and/or cysts.

          -  Patients with poor bone quality, where there is inadequate bone to support the
             implant(s).

          -  Neuromuscular compromise, vascular deficiency or other conditions in the affected limb
             that may lead to inadequate skeletal fixation.

          -  Allergy to the implanted material.

          -  Patient's physical conditions that would eliminate or tend to eliminate adequate
             implant support or prevent the use of an appropriately sized implant, e.g. previous
             surgery, insufficient quality or quantity of bone resulting from conditions such as
             cancer or congenital dislocation, metabolic bone disease of the upper femur or pelvis,
             femoral osteotomy revision, girdle stone revision, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis,
             neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the affected limb in sufficient
             degree to render the procedure unjustifiable (e.g. absence of musculoligamentous
             supporting structures, joint neuropathy) or other conditions that may lead to
             inadequate skeletal fixation

          -  Do not use ceramic femoral heads which are not BIOLOX delta or BIOLOX OPTION with
             Maxera components.

          -  Use of this device when a less invasive procedure would be sufficient.

          -  Skeletal immaturity.

          -  Any nerve or muscle disease that may have a negative effect on gait or weight bearing

          -  Loss of abductor musculature in the affected limb.

          -  Poor skin coverage around the hip joint.

          -  Rapid disease progression as obvious by joint destruction or bone absorption seen on
             x-ray.
