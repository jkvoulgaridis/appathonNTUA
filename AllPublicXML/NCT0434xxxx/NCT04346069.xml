  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      maltreatment are particularly vulnerable towards child abuse and developing mental and
      physical health issues.

      parent child interaction therapy (PCIT)) is one of those interventions which can address
      these vulnerabilities by improving parent to child relation and interaction, primarily
      improving parenting skills and helping parents cope with their parenting stress and child's
      behavioral problems.

      PCIT is empirically validated to decrease parenting stress, couple conflict and enhance
      parent child interaction, resulting in better coping skills while parenting for a child with
      disability.

      This research is very vital as it measures the efficacy of parent child interaction.

      In Pakistan mostly parents are bringing their children to clinic without any support from
      government therefore it is not possible for everyone to get daily based therapeutic
      intervention.

      The area of Parent-child Interaction Therapy and the acceptance of these treatments are new
      and emerging in Pakistani Health Care, apart from above; this research will also assist in
      identifying further areas of research.
