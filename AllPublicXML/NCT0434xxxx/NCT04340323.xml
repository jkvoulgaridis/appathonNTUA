  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in incontinence episode frequency (IEF) over one week.</measure>
    <time_frame>change in incontinence episode frequency over 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the number of urinary leakages during the day, measured by the voiding diary.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in performance and endurance of pelvic floor muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in performance and endurance of pelvic floor muscles over 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Performance on five-degree scale of 0-5 is used (no contraction, weak contraction, normal contraction, strong contraction, very strong contraction).
Endurance - the patient is requested to perform a maximum voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor and the contraction weakening time is measured. Time is given in seconds, for a maximum of 10 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hiatal area (HA, in cm2) during the Valsalva manoeuvre, assessed by 3D ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in hiatal area (HA, in cm2) during the Valsalva manoeuvre, assessed by 3D ultrasound over 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Examination will be carried out using a ultrasound console, volume contrast imaging software and a 3D/4D 4-8 MHz probe in the midsagittal plane. Examination will take place with an empty bladder in the lithotomy position. The probe will be placed longitudinally on the perineum. A 3D image will be taken at rest, at maximum contraction and at the Valsalva manoeuvre. The amount of hiatial space at the Valsalva manoeuvre will be measured in cm2.</description>

    <measure>Change in incontinence quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in incontinence quality of life over 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (I-QoL)
The I-QoL is composed of three subscales (avoidance and limiting behaviour; psychosocial impact; social embarrassment) and comprises 22 questions with a total score in the range from 0 (worst quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Change in patient global impression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in patient global impression over 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale (PGI-I)
The PGI-I evaluates the status of urination problems compared to the patient's condition before treatment in the study. Patient impressions are evaluated according to the following scores: 1, much better; 2, quite better; 3, a little better; 4, no change; 5, a little worse; 6, a lot worse; 7, definitely worse.</description>

    <description>The method of first choice in SUI treatment according to the International Continence Society (ICS) is training of the pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a method based on scientific evidence, defined by the ICS as repeated selective voluntary contraction and relaxation of specific pelvic floor muscles. It is important to train the strength and endurance of the pelvic floor muscles but also their relaxation (Abrams, 2018; Arnold, 2014; Bo, 2013).</description>
