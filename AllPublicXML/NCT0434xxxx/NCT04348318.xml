  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to better understand the use of advance directives, their implementation in the
      intensive care unit, and their effects on outcome. Data from the digital medical records of
      all consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit at the University Hospital
      Basel from 2011 to 2019 are retrospectively extracted. Descriptive analyses will be applied
      to report the proportion of patients with an advance directive. In-hospital outcome (defined
      as survival, Glasgow Outcome Score, and return of neurologic function to premorbid baseline)
      will be compared between patients with and without advanced directives

    <description>Descriptive analyses will be applied to report the proportion of patients with an advance directive. The core components of the advance directives will be analyzed regarding their translation into clinical practice. Patient and disease related characteristics will be compared between patients with and without advance directives applying the Chi-square and Fisher's exact test (where appropriate) for comparisons of proportions and the Mann-Whitney-U-test for the comparisons of continuous variables.</description>
