  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if treating patients undergoing arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair with testosterone will allow patients to accelerate their recovery time
      after surgery.

      Specific Aim I:

      To determine if testosterone treatment would provide superior patient-determined
      quality-of-life and activity scores in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair
      compared to a control group at 3 months after surgery.

      Specific Aim II:

      To determine if testosterone treatment would allow for greater postoperative strength
      improvements in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair compared to a control
      group at 3 months after surgery.

      Specific Aim III:

      To determine if testosterone treatment would allow for greater postoperative range of motion
      improvements in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair compared to a control
      group at 3 months after surgery.

      Specific Aim IV:

      To determine if the potentially higher activity levels allowed by the testosterone treatment
      would affect the success of rotator cuff healing as determined by magnetic resonance imaging
      at one year after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

      The hypothesis of this study was that testosterone treatment of patients undergoing
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair would allow patients to achieve 1) better quality-of-life
      and higher activity levels as determined by patient-determined outcome scores, 2) greater
      improvements in strength, and 3) greater improvements in range of motion at three months
      after surgery as compared to the control group. In addition, the authors hypothesize that
      there would be equivalent healing rates at one year after rotator cuff repair as determined
      by magnetic resonance imaging between the testosterone group and the control group.
