  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if the TAP block is an effective form of
      analgesia, in the post-operative period, after gynecologic minimally invasive surgery and if
      there is a difference in the analgesic effect between the way the TAP block is administered -
      ultrasound-guided TAP (UG-TAP) vs laparoscopic-assisted TAP (LA-TAP) blocks.

      Investigators hypothesise that there will be a decrease in pain scores for those who have the
      TAP block verses those who do not. Investigators also hypothesise that patient's will opt to
      take less break through opioid medication in the TAP block groups versus the no TAP block
      group. Finally, Investigators hypothesise that there is no difference in either pain scores
      or number of break through opioid tablets consumed between LA-TAP or UG-TAP groups.

      Investigators aim to answer the above questions through the following primary and secondary
      outcomes:

      Primary outcomes Is there a difference in numeric pain score (NPS) reported by the patient at
      24 hours following UG-TAP versus LA-TAP blocks versus no TAP block? Is there a clinically
      significant difference in opioid consumption by the patient at 24 hours following UG-TAP
      versus LA-TAP blocks versus no TAP block?

      Investigators aim to answer the above questions through the following primary and secondary
      outcomes:

      Primary outcomes Is there a difference in numeric pain score (NPS) reported by the patient at
      24 hours following UG-TAP versus LA-TAP blocks versus no TAP block? Is there a clinically
      significant difference in opioid consumption by the patient at 24 hours following UG-TAP
      versus LA-TAP blocks versus no TAP block? Secondary outcomes Is there a difference between
      study groups in numeric pain score (NPS) at 48 &amp; 72 hours? Is there a difference between
      study groups in total opioid consumption at 48 &amp; 72 hours? Is there a difference between the
      study groups for reported post-operative nausea and vomiting? What is the average time taken
      performing the TAP blocks in each study group? What is the length of Hospital stay between
      study groups, after controlling for the type of gynecologic surgeries? How do complications
      rates compare between study groups? How do patient satisfaction scores compare between study
      groups for both provider and patient?

      Patients will be randomized in three arms , LA-TAP , US-TAP and no TAP block . Each patient
      would fill out the pain score sheet and number of narcotic medications she used in first 72 h
      post operatively .
