  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common and leading cause of cancer deaths among females worldwide.
      Patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) are associated with moderate to severe
      acute postoperative pain and shoulder mobility restriction.

      This study aims to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided PECS block for reducing
      opioid consumption, providing adequate postoperative pain management and improving patient
      satisfaction following breast cancer surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional pain management for patients undergoing MRM has relied heavily on opioids but
      a number of multimodal pain control strategies also exist including combining opioids with
      NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, acetaminophen and regional blocks. Recently, literature
      underlines the importance of performing regional anaesthetic and analgesic techniques for
      postoperative analgesia following breast surgery. PECS block provides analgesia for breast
      surgeries with few adverse effects.

      OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of ultrasound guided pectoral block in reducing
      intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption following modified radical mastectomy.

      The secondary objective is to determine patient satisfaction levels associated with adequate
      pain control.

      HYPOTHESIS Pectoral nerve blocks provides superior analgesia with less opioid consumption and
      improves patient satisfaction in postoperative period compared to conventional pain
      management for modified radical mastectomy patients

    <description>For patients in PECS group (PG), after induction of general anesthesia, the nerve block will be performed using the ultrasound-guided technique described by Blanco and colleagues. Block will be performed with a 22-gauge 100 mm needle (Stimuplex, B. Braun Medical Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) using Mindray M7 imaging system (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., China) with a high-frequency (6-13 MHz) linear array transducer.20 mL of ropivacaine 0.25% in 5-mL increments will be injected, aspirating gently between injections. The needle will be withdrawn to place the tip in the fascial plane between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles and ropivacaine 0.25%, 10 ml in 5 ml increments will be injected. Injectate spread between the muscles will be visualized. For patients in control group, no nerve block will be performed and only intravenous nalbuphine will be given.</description>
