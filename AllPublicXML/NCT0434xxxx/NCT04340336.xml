  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the long term use of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A (BoNT-A)
      in adult subjects affected with upper and/or lower limb spasticity who received treatment
      with BoNT-A for a minimum of three injections cycles at three Italian centers.

      The study has a retrospective design and data relating to subjects' injections cycles
      occurred in the past are collected. Period of observation defined in the protocol is from
      2008 to 2018, but it could change for each subject according to the number of injections
      cycles performed. Time frame for data collection is 12 months from study start.

    <description>The qualitative subjective evaluation of patient treatment satisfaction has to be collected from medical records. The physician registered the level of satisfaction from previous treatment (very satisfied, satisfied, a little satisfied, not satisfied). A numerical value is assigned to each answer in order to obtain a numerical, subjective, GTS scale. It is a 4 point scale easy to use and to elaborate for analysis</description>
