  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some researches have shown surgery may acquire progression-free (PFS) benefit for selected
      patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who received first-line
      imatinib and second-line sunitinib. However, impact of salvage surgery on pre-treated GIST
      patients receiving third-line regorafenib facing progression is not yet reported.
      Investigators retrospectively reviewed patients with regorafenib treatment with salvage
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2014 and 2019, 41 metastatic GIST patients received regorafenib therapy. 35 out of 41
      metastatic GIST patients who were on regorafenib therapy facing progression and 15
      experienced local progression underwent salvage surgery. Thirty-five of 41 (85.4 %)
      pre-treated GIST patients receiving regorafenib who experienced disease progression after a
      median follow-up of 12.4 months of regorafenib use. 15 out of 35 (42.9%) metastatic GIST
      patients receiving regorafenib facing progression underwent salvage surgery.

        Between 2014 and 2019, 41 metastatic GIST patients receiving regorafenib therap at Chang
        Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan were enrolled. All the patients were managed by a
        multidisciplinary GIST team composed of medical oncologists and surgical oncologists.
