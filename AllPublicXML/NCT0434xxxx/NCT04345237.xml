  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled clinical trial, randomized by strata (sex and period of the study), with 6
      parallel branches to the study depending on the type of product consumed and the type of
      physical exercise program performed, double-blind masked for the consumption of the product
      and single-center.

    <textblock>
      The subjects that meet the selection criteria will make a total of seven visits to the
      research laboratory (two of them to collect product) and will carry out the pre-established
      tests in the protocol. Subsequently, a statistical analysis will be carried out with the
      variables measured in the study to obtain results.
