  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a novel project which incorporates clinic and community pharmacists in three aspects
      of the Patient-Centered Medical Home: pre-visit planning, pre-visit care team huddles, and
      chronic care management (CCM). Patients for the project are enrolled in the NEIFPC CCM
      program and have Greenwood pharmacy as their primary pharmacy. Community and clinic
      pharmacists will contribute to pre-visit medication reviews and document their drug therapy
      recommendations in a shared, templated note in the clinic EHR. NEIFPC pharmacists will attend
      pre-visit team huddles to relay drug therapy recommendations to the physician. Revenue from
      CCM services will be prorated and shared between Greenwood pharmacy and NEIFPC. The project
      will last 9 months. Primary aims are to describe the pharmacist pre-visit planning service,
      summarize the billing experience of a community pharmacist providing this service, and to
      describe the drug therapy interventions made by pharmacists.
