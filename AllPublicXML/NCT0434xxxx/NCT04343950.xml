  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to assess the impact on health and economics of the implementation
      of text messaging (SMS) in cancer screening programs. Three interventions with SMS will be
      evaluated through community trials. In the colorectal cancer screening program the following
      interventions will be tested: a) Participation reminder: six weeks after sending the
      invitation letter of the colorectal cancer program if there has not been a response, a
      reminder SMS will be sent in front of the usual method by letter; b) Reminder to return the
      fecal occult blood test: SMS reminder of test delivery versus no intervention. This reminder
      will be sent to the individuals who have gone to the pharmacy to pick up a fecal occult blood
      test and they have not returned it after 14 days. The impact on participation will be
      analyzed and, if applicable, the proportion of advanced neoplasms will be calculated by
      increase in participation. In the breast cancer screening program, the invitation by SMS
      versus the usual invitation by letter will be studied in women who had participated in the
      previous screening round. The impact on participation will be analyzed. A cost-effectiveness
      analysis of the three interventions will be carried out. The incremental cost ratio of the
      interventions between cost variation and effectiveness variation will be calculated.

      Main Hypothesis:

      The implementation of SMS in population-based cancer screening programs will improve
      participation, especially in colorectal cancer screening, will allow a better resource
      management and reduce costs in both programs.

      Specific Hypothesis:

      Sending the reminder SMS will have an impact on participation greater than that obtained with
      the standard reminder (letter) in the colorectal cancer screening program.

      The effect of the colorectal cancer screening reminder SMS will be greater among the
      individuals who have been invited for the first time and not previous participants.

      Participation after receiving the invitation by SMS in breast cancer screening will be equal
      to or better than the letter invitation.

      The alternative that includes sending SMS will be cost-effective in relation to the current
      alternative that you use postal shipping.
