  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorders characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms.
      Actual medical treatments are symptomatic and have little efficacy on late stage axial motor
      symptoms. Non-pharmacological approaches are therefore essential from the disease onset.

      Beside physiotherapy, to practice a regular adapted physical activity is crucial. To
      implement such a practice in everyday life implies to change habits. Patient Education
      programs are useful tools to help changing behaviors.

      The study evaluate the effect of a program aiming to promote adapted physical activity in
      early stage Parkinson's disease by comparing patients receiving the program and patients on a
      waiting list. The hypothesis that the program will increase the one-week mean daily moderate
      to intense physical activity as measured with an actimeter.

    <description>This is a self-evaluation questionnaire, the physical aspects of fatigue and its influence on the everyday functionality and activity. An indication of the presence of clinically relevant fatigue is provided by the mean value calculated from the 16 items. A mean value of &gt; 2.95 indicates the presence of fatigue symptoms</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life as assessed with the PDQ-39 scale</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39): the 39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a commonly used measure of self-appraisal in PD. It is a measure of health status and quality of life, by assessing difficulties in 8 dimensions of daily living: mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional well-being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social support (3 items), cognition (4 items), communication (3 items) and bodily discomfort (3 items). The frequency of each event is determined by selecting one of 5 options: never (scored 0) / occasionally (scored 1) / sometimes (2) / often (3) / always (4). Each dimension total score range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Non-motor symptoms as assessed with the Non Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Non-motor symptoms scale for Parkinson's disease (NMSS). Non-motor symptoms are assessed over the last month. Each symptom is scored with respect to:
Severity: 0 = None; 1 = Mild: symptoms present but causes little distress or disturbance to patient; 2 = Moderate: some distress or disturbance to patient; 3 = Severe: major source of distress or disturbance to patient.
Frequency: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk); 2 = Often (1/wk); 3 = Frequent (several times per week); 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time).
NMSS contains nine dimensions: cardiovascular (2 items), sleep/fatigue (4 items), mood/cognition (6 items), perceptual problems (3 items), attention/memory (3 items), gastrointestinal (3 items), urinary (3 items), sexual function (2 items), and miscellaneous (4 items).
Subscores are calculated through multiplication of frequency x severity. Total score is calculated by adding all subscores, range 0-360.</description>

    <measure>Change in physical activity during one week, assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form measures walking, moderate- and vigorous intensity, and total PA and daily time spent sitting on weekdays. PA was reported in MET·minutes/week and days per week and was scored using standardized IPAQ scoring protocols to yield total metabolic equivalent minutes (MET·minutes/week) of PA per week. Sitting time was reported as the amount of time in hours and/or minutes participants spent sitting on a weekday during the past seven days.</description>
