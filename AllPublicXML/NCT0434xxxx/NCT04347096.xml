  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Studies have shown the negative impact of physical inactivity, sedentary and
      unhealthy eating behavior on worker health and productivity. Sedentary workers are at greater
      risk of developing chronic diseases due to these behavioral risk factors. The literature
      moderately supports mHealth interventions for promoting physical activity and healthy diets.
      However, there is a dearth of research on mHealth interventions targeting the clustering of
      physical activity, sedentary and dietary behavior among sedentary workers in the occupational
      setting. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on its long-term sustainability and
      cost-effectiveness on health behaviors as well as health-related and work- related outcomes.

      Purpose: To evaluate a 12-week theory-driven, tailored mHealth intervention for improving
      diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior among sedentary workers. Three specific aims
      are to: (1) determine intervention participants' perceptions of and engagement with the
      mHealth program components to understand intervention effects by surveys and focus groups;
      (2) determine the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention compared to usual care; and (3)
      determine the cost-effectiveness of the mHealth intervention compared to usual care, using
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

      Methods: This is a three-year research project. Year 1 is mHealth intervention delivery and
      evaluation using a quasi-experimental design. Concepts of social cognitive theory of
      self-regulation and self-efficacy and an ecological model provide the theoretical foundation
      for the intervention. Year 2 will be primarily to evaluate the intervention. Year 3 will be
      primarily an international comparison of cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions to
      improve diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior for employees.

      A total of 100 sedentary workers (50 per condition) will be recruited from two workplaces.
      The intervention group will have access to the Internet for using a newly developed Simple
      health web app and receive an activity tracker. A sample of 100 is required to detect
      differences in primary outcomes: cardiometabolic risk biomarkers, productivity loss, body
      composition, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and dietary behavior; and secondary
      outcomes: self-report self-efficacy and self-regulation, at baseline, 3-, 12-, and 24-month
      follow up. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to examine intervention
      effects over time.

      The Simple health web app will consist of six major components: (1) daily healthy eating
      goals and records; (2) daily physical activity goals and records; (3) daily stand-up goals
      and records; (4) advice and reminder; (5) educational and motivational tools; and (6)
      personal and team health ranking.

    <description>The mHealth Intervention will provide sedentary workers with evidence-based information on diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior, and tailored feedback on their responses to daily records. Key features of this intervention will include individualized feedback and multimedia presentation in the form of web app. The intervention group will also receive a reliable device for wireless physical activity tracking for monitoring step counts.
The web app will consist of seven major components: (1) daily healthy eating goals and records; (2) daily physical activity goals and records; (3) daily stand-up goals and records; (4) advice and reminder; (5) educational and motivational tools; (6) personal and team health ranking; and (7) online social network. In addition, the intervention will be enhanced with follow-up booster coaching calls bi-monthly at 2, 4, 6, 8 months after the 12-week intervention.</description>
