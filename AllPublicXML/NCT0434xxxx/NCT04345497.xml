    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effect of a diabetes-specific formula (DSF) used as a
      (partial) meal replacement on long-term glycemic control and short-term glycemic variability
      in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel study. Eligible participants will be randomly
      allocated (at 1 :1 ratio) to one of two groups: DSF group or control group.The total expected
      duration of the study is 97 days.

      There are two periods in the study:

      i) &quot;Run-in Period&quot; (Study Days -6 to -1): participants will wear the CGMS:Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring System (FreeStyle Libre Pro) and will be asked to follow and track their diet and
      physical activity on a daily basis.

      ii) &quot;Intervention Period&quot; (Study Days 0 to 90): participants will be randomized into one of
      the two groups (n = 125 per group): DSF group or control group.
