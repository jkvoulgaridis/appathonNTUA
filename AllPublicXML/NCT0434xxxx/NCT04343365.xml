    <description>The investigators want to demonstrate the ability of a multidisciplinary group, the ETB, to develop therapeutic strategies in participants without curative options. They plan to enroll 35 patients to this study over 3 years. The primary objective will be successfully met if they can develop an evolutionary based plan that differs from the participants options prior to presentation for at least 80%, or 28 of these participants.</description>

    <description>Participants clinical history, available therapeutic options, and outcome expectations will be presented to the Evolutionary Tumor Board (ETB) along with images and pathology.

    <description>The ETB consists of evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, research scientists, statisticians,data scientists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists (surgical, radiation, medical, and pediatric), and clinical trial coordinators.The ETB will generate hypotheses, mathematical models, and experiments from the discussion towards further integration of evolutionary ideas towards therapeutic strategies for participants. The ETB will collect data through a chart review regarding adherence and results of ETB recommendation</description>

      Peripheral blood collected, and subsequently at designated time points (every 9 weeks from
      ETB result discussion +/- 4 weeks) depending on the upfront treatment protocol, off therapy,
      and at disease relapse. For each collection, a total of 20 mL of blood will be drawn, which
      includes 10 ml of blood in an EDTA tube, and 10 ml in a LBGuardÂ® tube, as described in Lab
      Manual.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be considered incurable given a standard of care. This is inclusive
             of participants in remission but at high risk of recurrence, with suboptimal responses
             to previous therapy, or with many potentially beneficial, but not curative options for
             care.

          -  Participant must have a life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  Participant must have an ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Participant and primary Oncologist are willing to consider the therapeutic strategies
             recommended by the ETB

          -  Willingness to be followed over time and allowing collection of clinical data
             including scans and serial blood sampling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment options with an expectation of cure available.
