  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast implants associated with the installation of a complementary matrix (of dermal or
      synthetic origin), showed satisfactory results in term of post-operative follow-up but also
      aesthetic outcomes.

      The objective of the subcutaneous positioning of this implant, is to reduce the muscular pain
      related to the stretching of the muscular muscle, the deformations related to the muscular
      contraction with an animation of the prothesis, but also the risk of hull when associated
      with a matrix. It also pursues the objective, of obtaining a better aesthetic result, by
      systematically coupling at least one lipo-modelling session.

      For a long time, patients with a history of mastectomy and radiotherapy benefited from
      secondary breast flap reconstruction, in order to reduce the risk of complications and
      achieve a satisfying aesthetic outcome. But the lipo-filling technique allowed to reconsider
      the management of these patients.

      The benefits of fat tissue transplants are know to improve tissue trophicity (flexibility,
      thickness, vascularization).

      The objective of this study, is to evaluate the feasibility of secondary breast
      reconstructions by prepectoral positioned implant after lipo-preparation of the wall.

    <textblock>
      60 women who have had a mastectomy and want a secondary breast reconstruction by implant at
      Institut de Cancérologie de l'Ouest well be included in this study.

      Patients will be recruited in consultation before the start of reconstruction and up to 18
      months after radiation therapy.

      They will be followed for 24 months from the end of the breast reconstruction.

      The following data will be collected indirectly from the clinical medical record (letters,
      reports of examinations, consultations, surgical report, hospitalization) of the patient,
      supplemented if necessary by specific records (radiotherapy records, chemotherapy,
      physiotherapy management) :

        -  Clinical data

        -  Technique-related data

        -  Complication-related data : adverse events will be evaluated at 15 days, 3 months, 6
           months, 12 months and 24 months after reconstruction

        -  Aesthetic results data : aesthetic result will be evaluated by patients and surgeons at
           6 months, 12 months and 24 months after reconstruction

        -  Quality of life data : a questionnaire will be submitted prior to the intervention, at
           12 months and 24 months after reconstruction

      Clinicians at Institut de Cancérologie de l'Ouest may be asked to complete the previous
      informations.
