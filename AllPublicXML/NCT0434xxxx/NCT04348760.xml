  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a widespread disease with variable symptoms that have an
      important impact on the quality of life. Despite the prevalence of IBS, its etiology and
      pathophysiology are still to be fully understood, but immune response is known to be
      involved. In this study, the investigators researched the variation of two specific
      cytokines, B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), the levels
      of food-specific IgG and the symptom severity, using Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Symptom
      Severity Score (IBS-SSS), following a personalized an unrestricted-calorie diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 30 subjects with diagnosis of IBS, according to Rome-IV criteria,
      whose inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of dietary
      intervention. The subjects were monitored in a general practice outpatient setting (GP) and
      nutritional advice was offered remotely via two telephone sessions with a nutritionist. The
      researchers investigated the variation of two specific cytokines, B-cell activating factor
      (BAFF) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), the levels of food-specific IgG and the symptom
      severity, using Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS).

      Data monitoring was ensured by an external monitor (Hippocrates Research, Genova, Italy).

      All data entry was in accordance with GCP protocol, and AE were classified using CTCAE 4.0

    <description>Based on the food-specific IgG measurement and relative distribution, a personalized food profile was created for each subject identifying 1 to 3 relevant food groups/nutritional clusters. Subjects were then instructed to avoid the foods highlighted in their personal food profile in certain days of the week, and to assume them in 7 of the 21 meals of the week. No calorie restriction was imposed in the diet.</description>
