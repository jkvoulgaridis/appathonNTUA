  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this trial enrolled 30 patients to receive Auxora (formerly CM4620) in a 2:1
      randomized, open label trial of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Part 2
      will consist of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled (RCT) study that will evaluate
      efficacy, safety, and the pharmacokinetic profile of Auxora in patients with severe COVID-19
      pneumonia. Four hundred patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive Auxora or matching
      placebo. Patients with an estimated PaO2/FiO2 of 101-200 will be stratified to ensure
      balanced randomization between the Auxora and placebo arms. Subgroup analyses will be
      performed to explore how time to recovery is influenced by baseline variables and to evaluate
      the treatment effect at different levels of each of these variables. The dose of Auxora will
      be 2.0 mg/kg (1.25 mL/kg) administered at 0 hour, and then 1.6 mg/kg (1 mL/kg) at 24 hours
      and 1.6 mg/kg (1 mL/kg) at 48 hours from the SFISD. The dose of placebo will be 1.25 mL/kg
      administered at 0 hour and then 1 mL/kg at 24 hours and 1 mL/kg at 48 hours from the SFISD.
      Both remdesivir and corticosteroids will be allowed. The infusion of Auxora will start within
      12 hours from the time the patient or LAR provides informed consent.
