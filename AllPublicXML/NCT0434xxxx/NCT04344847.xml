  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LSG is thought to be the best choice for obese patients with conincidental GISTs, as a tumour
      can be resected along with resecting the stomach within the same procedure. The primary
      endpoint is that, how much does GIST suppose to be far from a staple line to do safe
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of unsuspected GIST in LSG specimens in our series was high in comparison to
      cases reported in the literature.

      GISTs could be safely removed laparoscopically during LSG surgery with negative microscopic
      resection margins, with 1-2cm safety margin. Margins less than 1cm, high mitotic rate are
      adverse prognostic factors.

      Examining the whole stomach before resection is mandatory and can easily be done during LSG,
      GIST can be removed safely with LSG
