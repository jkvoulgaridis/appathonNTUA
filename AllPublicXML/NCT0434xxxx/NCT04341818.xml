  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention study with parallel groups
      is to investigate the effect of resistance training (2x/week for 10 weeks) with and without
      different goals of vitamin D intake on muscle strength, function and mass, oxidative stress
      parameters and the immune system in community dwelling persons. Participants (n = 100) will
      be community-dwelling older adults. After a preparticipation screening and a vitamin D blood
      investigation (vitamin D status below 75 nmol/L) participants will be distributed randomly
      but stratified by sex, age and initial vitamin D plasma levels to one of the 3 groups
      (Vitamin D daily + strength training, Vitamin D monthly + strength training, no Vitamin D +
      strength training).

      Study participants are eligible if they are male or female with an age between 65 and 85
      years and if their cognitive status as well as their physical fitness level allows to
      participate at the strength training sessions. Exclusion criteria comprise chronic diseases
      which contraindicate the training sessions, serious cardiovascular disease, diabetic
      retinopathy and manifest osteoporosis, a frailty index at or above 3, medication with
      anticoagulants or cortisone drugs, a regular strength training during the last six months and
      a vitamin D plasma concentration of 75nmol/L or above.

      Primary outcome measure is the change in the handgrip strength. Secondary outcome measures
      comprise anthropometric data, functional performance tests, immunological and oxidative
      stress parameters, DNA/Chromosomal damage microbiota, metabolomics and the nutritional
      status.

    <description>Handgrip strength of the right hand will be measured to the nearest kilogram (kg) using a hand Dynamometer. Participants will be encouraged to perform a maximal contraction within approximately 4 to 5 s. After a rest of 60 s, participants will be asked to perform a second trial. The highest score of maximum voluntary contraction will be used for data analyses.</description>
