      To support advances in the understanding of pathophysiology and therapies of kidney diseases
      by creating a BioBank of kidney tissue, DNA, plasma, and urine from patients with kidney
      diseases.

      A biorepository of human samples to support research to advance understanding of human kidney
      diseases will be created. Clinically, kidney diseases are detected by blood and urine
      laboratory tests. However, the underlying cause of kidney disease is often not clear on blood
      and urine tests. In such cases, a clinician may choose to perform a kidney biopsy to
      establish the diagnosis. Patients who are scheduled to undergo a kidney biopsy will be
      invited to participate in this proposed study.

        The biorepository is a prospective cohort study of subjects with kidney diseases, who are
        scheduled to undergo a kidney biopsy at Yale New Haven Hospital (York St. or St. Raphael's
        campus) as part of the routine clinical care and agree to participate in this study.
