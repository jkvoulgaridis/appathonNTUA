  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of unhealthful lifestyle practices including nighttime ingestion and excess
      energy-dense food and beverage intake, college students are presenting with metabolic
      abnormalities and excess weight gain that increases their risk for chronic health conditions
      including cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that prolonging
      nightly fasting intervals can result in health improvements in both animal models and human
      subjects. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), a form of intermittent fasting may offer an
      exciting, non-pharmacologic approach to improve cardiometabolic health in this population by
      restricting food intake to feeding windows that align with circadian biology.

    <textblock>
      This 8-wk randomized-controlled, parallel arm trial will examine the effects of a daily 18 h
      fast (TRF protocol) compared to a daily 8-h (CON protocol) on (1) diet quality, (2)
      cardiometabolic health, and (3) anthropometry in college students enrolled at ASU.
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval will be granted prior to recruitment and
      commencement of trial activities. Participants will be stratified by age, waist
      circumference, gender, and METS (activity score) and randomly assigned to one of two study
      arms: intervention and control. [Women will begin the trial within 5 days of menses.]
      Participants in the intervention arm of the study will consume food and beverages of their
      choice within one hour of waking and the feeding window will extend 6 hours. Beyond these
      hours, participants will observe a prolonged fast (i.e., an 18-h overnight fast).
      Participants in the control arm of the study will fast each night for 8 hours. During fasting
      hours, participants will only be permitted to consume non-caloric beverages (preferably water
      only but unsweetened and non-caloric coffee, tea, etc. will be permitted). Participants will
      adhere to their daily protocol for 8 weeks. Participants will not receive diet instruction
      other than 'to fast' and are told to maintain their typical physical activity patterns for
      the duration of the trial. Participants will choose one 'cheat-day' per week where they are
      excused from the fasting protocols; this day of the week will be consistent throughout the
      8-week trial. Diet quality will be measured by the REAP-S questionnaire, 24-h recalls will be
      obtained by a registered dietitian via a three-step multiple-pass interview method, a
      registered nurse or radiology technician will obtain fasting blood draws for biomarkers, and
      trained research personnel will obtain measures of anthropometry.

    <description>A REAP-S questionnaire will be completed for the previous week's intake during Trial Visits 1-3. The REAP-S questionnaire is a 16-item validated measure of diet quality whereby participants respond to questions that estimate the intake of fruits and vegetables, fiber, sugar, milk, fat, and dietary cholesterol. Responses of 'usually/often' will receive 1 point, 'sometimes' will receive 2 points, and 'rarely/never or does not apply to me' will receive 3 points. Per the REAP-S protocol, responses will be tabulated, and higher scores will indicate better diet quality.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be obtained prior to blood draw. Participants will be instructed to sit quietly with their feet planted flat on the floor. After a 10-minute rest period, a non-invasive Omron auto cuff blood pressure monitor equipped with IntelliSense technology, which allows the machine to inflate and deflate at optimum levels depending on arm size, will be utilized to obtain blood pressure in mm Hg.</description>

    <measure>Blood lipids</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>. LDL and HDL cholesterol will be measured using a commercially available diagnostic test kit on a bench-top, fully automated, clinical chemistry analyzer (Randox Laboratories Ltd, Crumlin, UK), and results will be expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Triglycerides will be measured using a commercially available diagnostic test kit on a bench-top, fully automated, clinical chemistry analyzer (Randox Laboratories Ltd, Crumlin, UK), and results will be expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference will be obtained to the nearest 5 cm using a research-grade ergonomic measuring tape placed horizontally around participants' natural waist (i.e., narrowest circumference above the umbilicus). Waist circumference will be measured twice and averaged unless the difference between the first and second measurement is above 5 cm. In that event, a third measurement will be obtained, and the mean of the nearest two circumferences will be recorded.</description>
