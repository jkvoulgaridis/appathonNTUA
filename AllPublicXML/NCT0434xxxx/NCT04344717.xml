  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is defined as a loss of function of the small intestine resulting
      in a malabsorptive disorder. In SBS, oral drug absorption may be altered due to extensive
      intestinal resection. It remains unclear to what extent apixaban exposure is impacted in
      SBS.Therefore this study tries to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of apixaban in adult
      patients with SBS requiring long-term parenteral nutrition (PN).
