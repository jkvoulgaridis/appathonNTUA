  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different studies have demonstrated that the absence of companionship during labor and
      childbirth may be responsible for a negative birth experience, an increased risk of postnatal
      depression and/or post traumatic stress disorders. These situation may also have a negative
      impact on mother-child interaction, on marital and family relationship and on the rate of
      maternal suicide in postpartum. However, these previous results cannot be extrapolated in the
      current context where the absence of the companionship is imposed by the confinement
      framework. The objective of the CONFINE study is to assess, for the first time, the birth
      experience of women in the context of limited social support in the immediate post-partum
      period due to confinement, as well as the associated over-risk of mental disorders, compared
      to a post-partum without social restriction.
