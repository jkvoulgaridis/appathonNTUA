      The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Kangarooing small babies on the
      back of a mother

    <textblock>
      After the study was explained (risks and benefits) and written informed consent was received
      from participants, an individually controlled randomized crossover clinical trial was
      conducted to examine the effectiveness of Chest-to-Back (CB) skin-to-skin contact (SSC)
      compared with the standard. The trial was done in accordance with the protocol, good clinical
      practice, and the national regulatory and ethics guideline of Ethiopia (which is in line with
      the Helsinki declaration).

    <masking_description>Mothers were masked only for the presence or absence of a sequence in the trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in skin temperature from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>: From the start of SSC (0 hour) to end of SSC (2 hours) per day, assessed for three consecutive days</time_frame>
    <description>Skin temperature values were recorded every 10 minutes. Including the baseline, the 2 hours intervention would provide 13 measurements. A participant who successfully completed the intervention would have78 measurements; 39 for the treatment arm and 39 for the control arm.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in peripheral arterial oxygen saturation on SCRIP Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of SSC (0 hour) to end of SSC (2 hours) per day, assessed for three consecutive days</time_frame>
    <description>Stability of the cardio-respiratory system in premature infants (SCRIP) score is a reliable instrument for determining the stability of oxygen saturation (i.e., peripheral arterial oxygen saturation) in premature infants. Possible scores range from 2 (perfect stability= &gt; 90 %) to 0 (sever instability = any falls below 80%)</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in heart rate on SCRIP Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of SSC (0 hour) to end of SSC (2 hours) per day, assessed for three consecutive days</time_frame>
    <description>Possible scores range from 2 (perfect stability= regular) to 0 (sever instability = ＜ 80/min or＞200).</description>

    <description>length of sleep was defined by the duration between the time of closed eyes, no crying and no movement to the time that at least one of these 3 indicators is absent</description>
