      Background:

      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes the abnormal clotting of blood in a deep vein of the
      upper or lower limbs (deep vein thrombosis) that may travel to and block a blood vessel in
      the lung (pulmonary embolism). Some people with sickle cell disease (SCD)-a red blood cell
      disorder-seem to be at greater risk for developing these blood clots. Researchers want to
      study the blood of people with SCD and VTE as well as healthy people to develop better
      treatments to prevent blood clots.

      Objective:

      To study blood clotting in SCD because it is the most common cause of vascular death after a
      heart attack or stroke.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-80 who have SCD (with or without a history of blood clots) or the trait for
      SCD, and healthy volunteers

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and medical records
      review. They will give blood samples.

      Participants will have phone calls either every 3 months or once a year, for 2 years. They
      will give updates on their health. They may give additional medical records. The phone calls
      may last up to 30 minutes.

      If participants have a VTE or pain crisis episode, they may visit the Clinical Center. These
      visits may last up to 4 hours. They will repeat the screening tests and give blood samples.

      Some participants may be invited to take part in blood studies.

      After 2 years, some participants will have a follow-up visit at the Clinical Center.

      Participation will last for about 2 years.

      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) the third most frequent cause of vascular mortality after
      myocardial infarction and stroke, occurs more frequently among Americans of African descent
      compared with other ethnic minorities in the US. VTEs are provoked by diverse risk factors
      but can be unprovoked in individuals with a hypercoagulable state, in whom there is a
      predisposition for thrombosis. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) have added risk of VTE
      as the disease itself is a hypercoagulable state. VTE frequency is increased across the
      entire spectrum of SCD severity, in those experiencing both mild (HbSC patients) and severe
      sickling symptoms (HbSS/HbSbeta0 thalassemia patients). Studies show that up to 12% of
      patients with SCD have VTE events [deep vein thrombus (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) or
      both] early in life by age 40, most of which are unprovoked. Moreover, owing to a persistent
      hypercoagulable state, SCD patients are at an unacceptably high risk for recurrence,
      particularly those in whom VTE was unprovoked. SCD patients who develop a VTE have a 24.1%
      risk of recurrence over 5 years. A history of a VTE in SCD is associated with greater
      mortality risk (Odd Ratio, OR = 2.88; Confidence Interval, CI = 2.35 - 3.52).

      Our overall hypothesis is that the proinflammatory state associated with SCD perturbs the
      coagulation system and contributes to the thrombotic vascular pathobiology of SCD. Abnormal
      intravascular tissue factor expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and circulating
      tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles released by these cells drive coagulation
      activation in SCD. Specifically, intravascular tissue factor forms the tenase complex
      (TF:VIIa) which converts factor X to factor Xa, generating the initial thrombin burst that
      possibly triggers intravascular thrombosis. Besides, heightened tissue factor exposure during
      acute sickling crises, increased release of tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles and
      inadequate clearance of the latter favors thrombin generation, fibrin deposition and
      thrombosis in the venous vasculature. SCD patients with VTE and/or recurrent VTE are
      therefore more likely to have more tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles and plasma
      tissue factor procoagulant activity compared with SCD patients without VTE.

      Prospective cohort studies of extended duration/indefinite anticoagulation in non-SCD
      patients with an underlying hypercoagulable state have effectively reduced recurrence rates.
      However, similar studies of extended duration anticoagulation in SCD patients are lacking.
      Besides, whether exposing SCD patients to extended/indefinite anticoagulation increases
      bleeding risk to unacceptably high levels is unknown. Studying thrombogenic risk and
      specifically identifying those SCD patients who are at greatest risk for VTE recurrence
      therefore becomes a high priority. In addition, individuals with sickle cell trait are prone
      to thrombosis but few studies evaluate markers of thrombotic risk in these individuals. Such
      studies could provide a rationale for targeted primary or secondary VTE prophylaxis.

      In the current proposal we will test the hypothesis that plasma tissue factor positive
      extracellular vesicles and tissue factor activity are elevated among SCD patients with VTE
      compared with SCD patients without VTE and in individuals with Sickle Cell Trait compared
      with ethnically matched controls.

        The natural history of SCD 04-H-0161 protocol (NCT00081523) will specifically be leveraged
        to recruit participants with VTE. In this study we will assess feasibility of establishing
        a prospective natural history study of thrombosis in SCD. Establishing feasibility could
        lead to recruitment of SCD patients experiencing thrombosis, particularly those that are
        understudied including patients with HbSC disease.
