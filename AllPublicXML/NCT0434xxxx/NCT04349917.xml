  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) are impaired in the ability to flexibly adapt brain network organization in
      response to shifting cognitive demands during the exertion of cognitive control, by assessing
      changes in network dynamics resulting from stimulant administration in children with ADHD,
      and how those changes relate to behavioral and symptom improvements. Subjects will be
      children with ADHD aged 8-12. Subjects will participate in multiple testing sessions that
      include: diagnosis and eligibility screening, neuropsychological and behavioral testing, and,
      if eligible, MRI scans and a medication challenge. Children with ADHD who are enrolled in the
      medication challenge will undergo one MRI scan on placebo and one MRI scan on stimulant
      medication, counterbalanced and double-blind. Functional connectivity will be measured using
      functional MRI and innovative graph theoretical analytic tools will be implemented. Network
      metrics will be related to symptomatology and behavioral testing measures. It is hypothesized
      that stimulant administration in children with ADHD will increase flexibility in network
      reconfiguration in response to changing cognitive control demands as compared to when they
      are on placebo. It is further hypothesized that the degree to which brain network
      organization is changed will be related to the degree of improvement in cognitive control
      performance.
