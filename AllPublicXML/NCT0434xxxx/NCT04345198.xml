  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism(PA) is the most common endocrine cause of resistant hypertension.
      Surgery and medicine are the main treatment for PA by the current guidelines. However,only a
      small part of patients with PA meet the surgical criteria, and most of them have to take
      spironolactone or other antihypertensive drugs for long time. On the other side, long-term
      inhibition of aldosterone receptor may cause hyperkalemia, male breast hyperplasia and other
      adverse reactions. Moreover, hyperaldosterone is still not corrected by spironolactone, which
      cause extensive cerebrovascular damages even though blood pressure and blood potassium had
      been normalized.

      With the development of adrenal vein sampling and adrenal ablation, the precise diagnosis and
      treatment of PA is possible. Selective adrenal artery ablation (AAA) was observed with
      significant decrease of blood aldosterone and blood pressure in patients with PA, which made
      it promissing that primary aldosteronism with resistant hypertension could be relieved by
      adrenal artery ablation.
