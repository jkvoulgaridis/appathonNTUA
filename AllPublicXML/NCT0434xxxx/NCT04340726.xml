      The aim of this study was to compare the influence of the abutment height and insertion
      timing on early marginal bone loss (MBL) in posterior mandibular partial implant-supported
      restorations.

      Material and methods: The study was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled parallel
      group including subjects in need of two implants for the restoration of an edentulous
      posterior mandibular area. Data were gathered on age, gender, attached gingiva height,
      bleeding on probing (BoP), smoking habits and previous periodontitis. The patients were
      allocated into three groups: Group A implants were immediately connected to 2 mm height
      abutments; Group B implants were immediately connected to 1 mm height abutments; Group C
      implants were left to heal in a sub-mucosal position and 2 mm abutments were inserted in a
      second stage surgery. Peri-apical radiographs were taken at the implant surgery (baseline), 4
      weeks after surgery (T1), 16 weeks after implant placement at the final restoration delivery
      (T2) and 1-year after implant placement (T3).
