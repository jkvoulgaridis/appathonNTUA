      Japanese Lead Extraction (J-LEX) Registry is an observational nationwide registry, performed
      by Japanese Heart Rhythm Society, collaborated with the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular
      Center. The acute success rate at discharge and the complications associated with transvenous
      lead extraction will be collected. J-LEX registry will provide a reliable information on
      indications, methods, the success rate, complications and the prognosis at 30 days prognosis.

      Japanese Lead Extraction (J-LEX) Registry is a nationwide, multicenter, observational
      registry, performed by Japanese Heart Rhythm Society, collaborated with National Cerebral and
      Cardiovascular Center. This study is a voluntary nationwide registry and data are collected
      prospectively using a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system until 30 days after
      the lead extraction. The investigators will collect the data regarding patient's background
      and lead characteristic, medical history, details about lead extraction procedure, lead
      characteristics, and outcomes. The data were anonymized in a linkable manner at each study
      site before they were sent. Based on the provided information, the annual incidence and
      predictive factors for outcome will be investigated by the event assessment committee.
