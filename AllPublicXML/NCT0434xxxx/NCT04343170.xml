  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a condition in which there is curvature of the spine occurring in the lateral
      plane. It occurs in structural forms, characterized by a fixed curve, and &quot;functional&quot; forms,
      characterized by a flexible or correctable curve. By anatomic necessity, this lateral
      deviation is associated with vertebral rotation, such that when this deformity occurs in the
      thoracic spine, a chest wall deformity, or &quot;rib hump,&quot; develops.

      Often there is a primary structural curve with an adjacent secondary compensatory curve. Most
      cases of structural scoliosis are idiopathic and have their onset in early adolescence.
      Females are affected more often than males, and their curvature is more likely to worsen.

      Lumbar fusion surgery is usually associated with massive blood loss. In clinical practice the
      surgeon might measure the visible peri-operative bleeding including intra- and post-operative
      drainage, but ignore blood component penetration into the tissues, residual blood in
      vertebral canal and loss due to haemolysis, which are also known as hidden blood loss.

      In patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), surgical treatment involves a
      posterior approach with multi-segmental pedicle screw fixation. Although this procedure is
      generally considered safe with few surgical complications, there are considerable variations
      in fusion length, surgical time, and the extent of soft-tissue exposure. Consequently,
      perioperative blood loss can be substantial, and the use of intraoperative and postoperative
      RBC transfusions are frequently required.

      Patient blood management (PBM) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach developed
      over the last 10 years focusing on improving patient outcomes as well as reducing the use of
      RBC transfusions. PBM includes several preventive measures to manage bleeding risks, reduce
      iatrogenic blood loss, and modify decision thresholds for the appropriate administration of
      blood therapy.

      All patients for elective surgery in whom blood loss is expected to be &gt; 500 ml should have
      their hemoglobin checked pre-operatively and be investigated if they are found to be anemic.
      In the general population, anemia is defined as a hemoglobin less than 130 g. in men and less
      than 120g. in women by the WHO. It was proposed that the cut-off value/trigger be changed to
      hemoglobin more than 130 g for both men and women. Women with hemoglobin levels between 120
      and 129 g. are not considered to be anemic according to the WHO definition, leaving them at a
      potential disadvantage when undergoing major surgery

      44 Patients will be randomly classified into two equal groups each of 22 patients Group I:
      Patients of this group received Combination treatment consisted of a slow (30 min)
      intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg ferric carboxymaltose (maximum of 1000 mg), 40 000 U
      subcutaneous α erythropoietin,1 mg subcutaneous vitamin B12(, and 5 mg oral folic acid
      (acidum folicum) Group II: Patients of this group received placebo treatment consisted of two
      subcutaneous injections of 1 mL saline and an oral placebo. Either iron or placebo (0•9%
      saline) were given intravenously via a black infusion set from behind a screen to assure
      blinding of the patient by a person not involved in data capturing or data entering.

      Patient's vital signs will be monitored during and at least 15 min after drug application.
      Treatment will be given one day before the operation

      Measurements:

        1. Demographic data

        2. The number of RBC transfusions during the first 7 days.

        3. Perioperative course of Hb, (reticulocyte count, reticulocyte Hb content).

        4. The need of fresh frozen plasma units transfused in first 7 days

        5. The need of platelets units transfused in first 7 days

        6. Platelet count.

        7. Total leucocyte counts.

        8. International normalized ratio.

        9. Serum creatinine.

       10. C-reactive protein,

       11. Calculated RBC loss (preoperative RBC mass minus RBC mass at postoperative fifth day
           plus transfused RBC mass)

       12. Length of ICU stay.

       13. Incidence of acute kidney injury

       14. Infections requiring antibiotics
