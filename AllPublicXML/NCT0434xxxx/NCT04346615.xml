  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a CGRP receptor antagonist may potentially blunt
      the severe inflammatory response at the alveolar level, delaying or reversing the path
      towards oxygen desaturation, ARDS, requirement for supplemental oxygenation, artificial
      ventilation or death in patients with COVID-19 on supplemental oxygen.

      * BHV-3500, formerly &quot;vazegepant&quot;, is now referred to as &quot;zavegepant&quot; (za ve' je pant). The
      World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee
      revised the name to &quot;zavegepant&quot; which was accepted by the United States Adopted Names (USAN
      ) Council for use in the U.S. and is pending formal adoption by the INN for international
      use.
