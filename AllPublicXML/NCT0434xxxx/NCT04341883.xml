    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II, multi-center clinical trial. Subjects can only
      enter this study after they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All enrolled patients
      will receive the treatment with anti-PD-1 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel, every 3
      weeks, until progressive disease, initiation of new anti-tumour therapy, death, intolerable
      toxicity. Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be used for up to 6 cycles and anti-PD-1 for up to 2
      years.
