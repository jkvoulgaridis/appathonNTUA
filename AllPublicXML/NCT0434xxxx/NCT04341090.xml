    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of high-fat and low-fat meal on
      the pharmacokinetics of apatinib mesylate in Chinese adult healthy subjects.

      The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of apatinib mesylate
      administered in adult healthy subjects.
