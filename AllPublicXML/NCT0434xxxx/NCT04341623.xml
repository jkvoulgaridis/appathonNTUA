  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that routine measurement of trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) rates
      and stratum corneum (SC) hydration levels will promote patient adherence to maintenance
      moisturizer therapy and prevent disease relapse. The project will consist of a trial in which
      thirty subjects with xerosis receive moisturizer therapy and are randomized to receive either
      no intervention, a weekly electronic survey to assess patient's response to daily
      moisturizer, or daily monitoring of the effectiveness of a moisturizer with a portable
      hydration measurement device. The study team will measure adherence to daily moisturizer use
      objectively in all three groups with electronic monitors attached to the containers of the
      moisturizer. The adherence measure will allow the study determine how well moisturizers work
      for xerosis when that are well used. The study team anticipate that in the no intervention
      group, adherence will be abysmal and that in the group reporting their response to treatment
      weekly, adherence will be much better. This will give the study team negative and positive
      controls for assessing the effect of home barrier monitoring on treatment adherence.

      Adult subjects will be offered an opportunity to participate in the study. Subjects will have
      a diagnosis of xerosis in the context (current or historic) of atopic dermatitis. A total of
      30 subjects will be enrolled. After consent and basic demographics, a study team member will
      use the GPSkin Barrier速 device to measure the baseline moisture level of the inner wrist,
      inner elbow, and dorsal hand of all subjects. Subjects will also fill out questionnaires
      pertaining to quality of life, measures of predictors of adherence, and severity of xerosis.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of three arms: the control group (n= 10), the electronic
      interaction group to assess patient's response to daily moisturizer (n=10), or the GPSkin
      group (n=10). All patients will receive Cetaphil Pro Eczema moisturizer equipped with an
      electronic monitor to measure adherence to daily treatment of xerosis. The digital
      interaction group will receive a survey by email each week asking about their Cetaphil use.
      The patients in the GPSkin group will receive the GPSkin Barrier速 to measure the moisture
      level of their inner wrist, inner elbow, and dorsal hand daily. Subjects will be instructed
      to use the Cetaphil once daily. Subjects will return at 3 months. At this visit, the data
      from the electronic adherence monitoring will be downloaded, the Cetaphil will be weighed,
      the patient will fill out the same questionnaires (quality of life, measures of predictors of
      adherence, and severity of xerosis), and the stratum corneum hydration level will be
      measured. The intervention subjects will be evaluated on their use of the GPSkin Barrier速 to
      measure their stratum corneum hydration
