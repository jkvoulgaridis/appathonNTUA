      This study investigates an innovative treatment for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) exploiting administration of ex vivo-generated allogeneic natural killer (NK)
      cells with preceding non-myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy with or without subsequent
      in vivo IL-2 cytokine support.

      This is a prospective phase I/IIa study. The first phase is a IL-2 dose-escalating safety
      study in nine patients. The second phase of the study is designed as a Simon's optimal
      two-stage single-arm phase IIa study, comprising eighteen patients. Prior to NK cell
      infusion, all patients will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Cy/Flu) based
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy. On day 0, all patients will receive a fixed dose of 1.0-3.0 x
      10^9 allogeneic umbilical cord blood-derived NK cells (UCB-NK cells). These cells are
      generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from an allogeneic UCB
      unit.

      In phase I of the study patients will receive UCB-NK cells without subcutaneous (SC) IL-2,
      with lower dose SC IL-2 or with higher dose SC IL-2 (n=3 per treatment group). After
      establishing the safety of UCB-NK cells combined with SC IL-2, we will continue with phase
      IIa of the study, with eight patients in the first stage (including the three patients from
      phase I with comparable IL-2 dose) and if clinical efficacy is achieved an additional ten
      patients in the second stage.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is divided in two phases. In phase I, we will determine the safety of our UCB-NK cell product with or without sc IL-2, following a non-myeloablative immunosuppressive conditioning regimen in patients with AML. Three patients will receive NK cells without IL-2. If no dose limiting toxicities occur another three patients will receiving NK cells with a low dose IL-2, and if safe, another three patients will receive NK cells with a higher dose IL-2.
The primary objective of phase IIa of the study is to evaluate the effect of UCB-NK cell adoptive immunotherapy in combination with SC IL-2 following a non-myeloablative immunosuppressive conditioning regime on disease activity in patients with AML. Therefore 18 patients will be evaluated using a Simon's optimal two-stage single-arm study design, with 8 patients in the first stage and an additional 10 patients in the second stage. These patients will receive NK cells with the highest tolerable dose IL-2, established after phase I.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Phase I: Evaluate Safety and Toxicity using the CTCAE toxicity criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be evaluated intensively using the CTCAE toxicity criteria and graft versus host disease (GvHD) classification criteria, defining dose limiting toxicities (DLTs): 1. Any treatment-emergent non-hematologic grade 3 toxicity lasting &gt;72 hours, except for transient constitutional symptoms, diarrhea, fatigue or skin rash not requiring systemic steroid therapy. 2. Acute GvHD &gt;grade 2 within 6 weeks of the first IL-2 dose. If in any of the three patients of each individual cohort of the phase I study a DLT occurs, the cohort will be extended to 6 patients. If 2 patients experience DLT within a cohort of 3 or 6 patients the study will be stopped in case the patients were only receiving NK cells or the study will be continued without IL-2 or the lower dose of IL-2 in case the patients were receiving NK cells in combination with IL-2. Serious, life threatening adverse events or grade 4 toxicity will be a reason to terminate the study or continue without IL-2 cytokine support.</description>

    <measure>Phase IIa: % blasts or % minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of phase IIa of the study is to evaluate the effect of UCB-NK cell adoptive immunotherapy in combination with SC IL-2 following a non-myeloablative immunosuppressive conditioning regime on disease activity in patients with AML. At day 28 a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to evaluate % blasts or % minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow. A complete remission is defined as BM blasts &lt;5%; marrow should not be merely 'aplastic': at least 200 cells should be enumerated or cellularity should be at least 10%. MRD will be evaluated by flow cytometry (leukemia associated phenotypes (LAPs)) and/or molecular quantification of patient specific mutations (PCR).
For phase IIa of the study the clinical evaluation data (% blasts and % MRD positivity) will be translated in a clinical response (stable disease, partial remission, complete remission) and quantitative presented.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the in vivo lifespan and expansion potential of the NK cells following adoptive transfer and IL-2 administration.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the percentage and absolute number of donor-derived NK cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow after infusion using flow cytometry and DNA chimerism analysis. A positive expansion rate of the infused NK cells requires an absolute number of ≥100 donor-derived NK cells per μl blood at day +7 and/or +14.</description>

    <description>NK cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow will be obtained. These cells will be stimulated in vitro for 4 hours and subsequently the degranulation marker CD107a and immunoregulatory marker IFNy will be measured by flow cytometry. These results can be compared between patients that did receive IL-2 or did not.</description>
