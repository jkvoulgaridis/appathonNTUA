    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of copanlisib and how well it
      works when given together with eribulin in treating patients with triple negative breast
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced stage). Copanlisib stops the
      growth of a protein called PI3K, which is often changed in tumor cells and causes resistance
      to treatment. Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving copanlisib and eribulin may work better in treating advanced
      stage triple negative breast cancer compared to eribulin alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of copanlisib hydrochloride (copanlisib) in
      combination with eribulin mesylate (eribulin) in metastatic triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC). (Phase I) II. To compare progression free survival (PFS) between eribulin and
      eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with prior taxane and
      anthracycline. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of the
      combination. (Phase I) II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) III. To
      compare the ORR, CBR (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD] &gt;= 24
      weeks) and safety of eribulin and eribulin plus copanlisib arms. (Phase II) IV. To compare
      the ORR, CBR, PFS of eribulin and eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with tumors
      harboring mutations in PIK3CA/ PTEN or with loss of PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) on baseline tumor biopsy. (Phase II) V. To compare the ORR, CBR, PFS of eribulin and
      eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with tumors lacking PIK3CA/ PTEN pathway
      alterations. (Phase II) VI. To compare the ORR, CBR, PFS of eribulin and eribulin plus
      copanlisib arms in patients with tumors harboring loss of PTEN expression by IHC in
      pre-treatment metastatic site (in patients with available tissue from metastatic site).
      (Phase II) VII. To compare PTEN IHC results between paired archival primary tumor vs.
      baseline tumor biopsies. (Phase II) VIII. To assess targeted inhibition by copanlisib and
      eribulin by measuring treatment induced changes in phosphorylated (phospho)-AKT (T308),
      phospho-AKT (S473), phospho-histone H3, and inhibition of apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3)
      between post-treatment tumor (C2D1-2) versus baseline. (Phase II) IX. To compare the ORR,
      CBR, PFS of eribulin and eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with tumors harboring
      mutations in PIK3CA/PTEN by circulating tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at
      baseline, and potential changes over time. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare PTEN IHC results between paired baseline tumor biopsy versus at time of disease
      progression.

      II. Assess baseline (pre-treatment) tumor tissue mutation or gene expression profiles to
      correlate treatment response.

      III. Assess intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms by analyzing pre and post treatment
      biopsies for gene expression and proteomic changes.

      IV. Determine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation profiles at baseline and changes in
      mutation profile and variant allele frequencies (VAFs) on cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1) and at disease
      progression compared to baseline to correlate with treatment response.

      V. Assess circulating biomarkers predictive of treatment response. VI. Assess plasma and
      serum proteomics and metabolomics predictive of treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of copanlisib and eribulin followed by a
      phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and eribulin IV over
      2-5 minutes on days 1 and 15 or days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 or 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive eribulin IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive copanlisib IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and eribulin IV over
      2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 or days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 21 or 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.

             interval &gt; 480 msec or history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (i.e.
             congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradyarrhythmias, family
             history of long QT syndrome)

          -  Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of grade 2 or higher

          -  Myeloid growth factors within 14 days prior to treatment start

          -  Platelet transfusion within 7 days prior to treatment start

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy is not allowed while on study

          -  Known tumor AKT mutation from archival tumor tissue analysis

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to copanlisib, PI3K inhibitors, or other agents used in study

          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) are not permitted
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study. Other medications that
             are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:

               -  Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)

               -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 15 mg prednisone or
             equivalent is not permitted while on study. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be
             stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the computed
             tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) screening. If a patient is on chronic
             corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed
             dose before the screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids.
             Short-term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids above 15 mg prednisolone or
             equivalent will be allowed for the management of acute conditions (e.g., treatment
             non-infectious pneumonitis). The use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to
             copanlisib administration will not be allowed

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Patients with active, clinically serious infections &gt; grade 2 (Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 [CTCAEv5.0]) (viral, bacterial or fungal
             infection)

          -  History of known Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection

          -  Patients with arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular
             accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary
             embolism within 3 months before the start of study medication

          -  Concurrent diagnosis of pheochromocytoma due to risk of hypertension with copanlisib

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as blood pressure &gt;= 150/90 mm/Hg) despite optimal
             medical management (per investigator's opinion)

          -  Proteinuria estimated by urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 3.5 on random urine sample

          -  Patients with history of or current autoimmune disease

          -  Patients with congenital QT prolongation

          -  The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden
             cardiac arrest

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib is a PI3K inhibitor
             agent and eribulin is an anti-tubulin agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with copanlisib and
             eribulin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             copanlisib and/or eribulin. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used
             in this study
