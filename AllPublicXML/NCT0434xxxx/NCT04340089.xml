      This study evaluates the effect of squatting on the toilet on gastric transit time and
      complete examination rate of capsule endoscopy.In the observation group, the patients could
      go to squatting on the toilet at any time as they want to after taking the capsule.

      The subjects were divided into a control group and an observation group according to whether
      the patient squatted in the toilet, In the control group, the patients took discontinuous
      right lateral position, walked on a flat road and climbed the stairs alternately. In the
      observation group, in addition to the above ways, the patients could go to squatting on the
      toilet at any time in the first hour after taking the capsule. The operator observed the
      position of capsule every one hour. The examination was over when capsule endoscopy entered
      the colon. If the capsule remained in the small intestine, the examination continued until
      the capsule ran out of power.
