  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      protection of the palatal wound is an essential step following harvesting a palatal soft
      tissue graft. During the last decades, several materials were used to avoid protect against
      the post-operative problems as bleeding, pain and possible infections. The aim of this
      randomized clinical trial was to assess the usage of polypropylene mesh, compared to the
      conventional custom-made acrylic stent for efficacy in protection of the palatal wound and
      reducing the bleeding tendency and post-operative pain. propylene mesh is a promising
      material for protection of the palatal wound due to its light weight, limited bacterial
      wicking, tissue compatible properties, however, the custom made acrylic palatal stent
      provides a more precise mechanical . More studies are required to deeply assess the benefits
      of this material in the periodontal plastic surgeries.

      Background: protection of the palatal wound is an essential step following harvesting a
      palatal soft tissue graft. During the last decades, several materials were used to avoid
      protect against the post-operative problems as bleeding, pain and possible infections. The
      aim of this randomized clinical trial was to assess the usage of polypropylene mesh, compared
      to the conventional custom-made acrylic stent for efficacy in protection of the palatal wound
      and reducing the bleeding tendency and post-operative pain.

      Patients and methods: A single blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial took
      place. Twenty sites were approved to be treated using soft tissue grafting technique with the
      need for a palatally harvested free graft. The palatal wounds were protected with propylene
      mesh and custom-made acrylic palatal sten. Participants were qualitatively assessed for
      bleeding duration, bleeding amount, pain duration, infection possibility, inflammation at 2,
      4, 6, 8, 14 days post-operatively. The patient acceptance was also evaluated.
