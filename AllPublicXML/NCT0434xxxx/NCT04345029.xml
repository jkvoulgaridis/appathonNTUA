  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, double-blind, double-crossed, randomized controlled clinical trial with two
      crossed branches, designed with the objective of evaluating the effect of the investigational
      product on satiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet the selection criteria will make a total of five visits to the research
      laboratory and will carry out the tests established in the protocol. Subsequently, a
      statistical analysis will be performed with the variables measured in the study to obtain
      results.
