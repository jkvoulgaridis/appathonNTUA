      The ProTarget study is a phase II, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial with the
      primary purpose of investigating the safety and efficacy of commercially available cancer
      drugs that target specific changes in cancer cell DNA to treat patients with advanced cancer.
      The primary endpoint is anti-tumor activity or stable disease documented after 16 weeks of
      experimental drug treatment. The drugs used in the trial have been approved by EMA/FDA for
      the treatment of certain cancers. Choice of drug is based on whether the patient's cancer
      cells contain precisely the DNA change (i) targeted by the EMA/FDA-approved drug or (ii)
      related to sensitivity to the EMA/FDA-approved drug. The trial drug is thus not approved by
      the EMA/FDA or in Denmark for the treatment of the patient's cancer - it is so-called
      &quot;off-label use&quot;. The secondary purposes are:

        -  To detect side effects in patients treated with commercially available targeted cancer
           drugs.

        -  Performing biomarker analyzes, including (but not limited to) whole-genome analysis
           (WGS) on a fresh tumor tissue sample (biopsy) at baseline and progression.

        -  To investigate mechanisms of resistance using recurrent / serial fresh tumor biopsies
           for WGS and so-called liquid biopsies, which are blood samples in which the cancer cell
           DNA is analyzed.

      The secondary endpoints include response duration, progression-free survival, and overall
      survival.

      The ProTarget study is a phase II, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to
      describe the safety and efficacy of commercially available, targeted anti-cancer drugs
      prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer having a potentially actionable
      genomic variant revealed by a genomic test or immunohistochemistry test for protein
      overexpression performed in a laboratory accredited by the competent local regulatory
      authority. The study also aims to catalogue the choice of genomic test by clinical
      oncologists and learn about the utility of data collected through this study to develop
      hypotheses for future clinical trials. Eligible patients will have an advanced malignant
      disease with molecular aberrations for which standard treatment options are no longer
      available or feasible and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic test or
      immunohistochemistry test for protein overexpression must have been performed on a specimen
      of the tumor selected by the investigator in a laboratory accredited by the competent local
      regulatory authority and the test must identify at least one potentially actionable genomic
      variant as defined in the protocol. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma or
      other body fluids (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is
      performed in a laboratory that meets the requirements described above. The investigator will
      select an appropriate drug from among those available in the protocol that targets the
      identified genomic variant and begin treatment once any drug-specific eligibility criteria
      are confirmed. If an eligible drug-variant match is not listed in the protocol, the physician
      may submit a proposal to treat with a drug available in the protocol, along with relevant
      clinical information and the genomic test results, to the study Molecular Tumor Board for
      review. The investigator may also choose to request options from the Molecular Tumor Board on
      treatment selection. The Molecular Tumor Board will return to the physician a list of
      potential treatment options. If the physician's choice of drug is among those available in
      the protocol and also one of the options provided by the Molecular Tumor Board, the
      protocol-specified treatment may be administered to the patient once any drug-specific
      eligibility criteria are confirmed. The investigator may not enroll a patient on a ProTarget
      study drug if it is not among the options listed in the protocol or provided by the Molecular
      Tumor Board. In this case, the non-ProTarget treatment and follow-up will be at the
      investigator's discretion. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the
      protocol will be followed for standard toxicity and efficacy outcomes including tumor
      response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment and high
      grade or serious adverse events.

      Study Objectives:

        -  To describe in different types of population the anti-tumor activity (efficacy) and
           toxicity (safety) of commercially available, targeted anti-cancer drugs used for
           treatment of patients with advanced disease with a genomic variant known (i) to be a
           target of an EMA-approved anti-cancer drug or (ii) to predict sensitivity to an
           EMA-approved anti-cancer drug.

        -  To record the site investigator determination treatment-related adverse events
           experienced by patients receiving treatment with commercially available, targeted
           anti-cancer drugs.

        -  To perform refined biomarker analyses, including (but not limited to) whole genome
           sequencing, on a fresh tumor biopsy specimen at baseline and at progression.

        -  To study mechanisms of resistance by the use of serial fresh tumor biopsies for WGS and
           liquid biopsies.

      Study Population: Eligible patients will have an advanced malignant disease for which
      standard treatment options are no longer available or feasible and acceptable performance
      status and organ function. A genomic profiling test or immunohistochemistry test for protein
      expression or overexpression must have been performed on a specimen of the tumor in a
      laboratory accredited by the competent local regulatory authority. The results must identify
      at least one potentially actionable genomic variant that is targeted by a ProTarget Study
      drug, as defined in the protocol. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma
      (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is performed in a
      laboratory that meets the requirements described above.

      Intervention: Treatment with a commercially available, targeted anti-cancer drug matched to a
      genomic variant identified in a tumor biopsy specimen.

      Study endpoints: Objective tumor response (complete response - CR or partial response- PR) or
      stable disease (SD) at 16 weeks or later after treatment initiation and safety are the
      primary study endpoints; progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of treatment
      on study and treatment-related high grade and serious adverse events will be collected.

      Patients from Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA will be included in three similar though
      independent protocols (ProTarget, DRUP and TAPUR, respectively), allowing data-exchange and
      empowering of the trials.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient (age≥ 18 years) with a histologically-proven locally advanced or metastatic
             malignant disease who is no longer benefitting from standard anti-cancer treatment or
             for whom, in the opinion of the investigator, no such treatment is available or
             indicated.

          2. ECOG performance status 0-2

          3. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below. However, as noted
             above, drug-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the appendix for each
             agent will take precedence for this and all inclusion criteria:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 µl

               2. Hemoglobin &gt; 5.6 mmol/l

               3. Platelets &gt; 75,000/µl

               4. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               5. AST (SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or &lt;
                  5 x ULN in patients with known hepatic metastases)

               6. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          4. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease (per RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor),
             defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for
             nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT
             scan, MRI, or a subcutaneous or superficial lesion that can be measured with calipers
             by clinical exam. For lymph nodes, the short axis must be ≥15 mm. Patients who have
             assessable disease by physical or radiographic examination but do not meet these
             definitions of measurable disease are eligible and will be considered to have
             evaluable disease. Patient's whose disease cannot be objectively measured by physical
             or radiographic examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only) are NOT eligible,
             with the exception of CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer.

          5. Results must be available from a genomic test or immunohistochemistry (IHC) test for
             protein expression performed in a laboratory accredited by the competent local
             regulatory authority. The genomic or IHC test used to qualify a patient for
             participation in ProTarget may have been performed on any specimen of the patient's
             tumor obtained at any point during the patient's care at the discretion of the
             patient's treating physician. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma
             (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is performed in a
             laboratory accredited by the competent local regulatory authority.

             A new biopsy must be performed if possible, for central confirmation by WGS (the
             result may be awaited and is not required before first dosing).

             Note: Eligible genomic tests may include any of the following technologies:
             fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
             comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), next generation sequencing (NGS), whole exome
             sequencing (WES). The test may have been performed on a fresh (frozen or in RNA-later)
             or paraffin-embedded specimen of the primary tumor or a metastatic deposit or on cell
             free DNA derived from plasma, as determined by the treating physician, and must reveal
             a potentially actionable genomic variant as defined in Section 5.0, or protein
             overexpression by IHC.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent/assent
             document

          7. Have a tumor genomic profile for which treatment with one of the approved targeted
             anti-cancer therapies included in this study has potential clinical benefit based on
             the criteria described in Section 7.0.

          8. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral
             medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.

          9. Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing fetus, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) in combination with inhibition of
             ovulation (intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system ( IUS),
             bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence) for the duration
             of study participation, and for four to 24 months following completion of study
             therapy (depending on SPC from individual drugs). Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study or if she is the partner of
             a male participant in this study and becomes pregnant while he is participating in
             this study, she should inform her or her partner's treating physician immediately as
             well as her obstetrician. Female study patients who become pregnant must immediately
             discontinue treatment with any study therapy. Male patients should avoid impregnating
             a female partner. Male study patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e.
             post-vasectomy) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier
             contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the
             last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing toxicity &gt; CTCAE grade 2, other than peripheral neuropathy, related to
             anti-tumor treatment that was completed within 4 weeks prior to registration. Patients
             with ongoing peripheral neuropathy of ≥ CTCAE grade 3 will be excluded.

          2. Previous treatment with the selected study drug for the same malignancy.

          3. If the patient's tumor has a genomic variant known to confer resistance to an
             anti-cancer agent available in this study, the patient will not be eligible to receive
             that agent but will be eligible to receive other drugs available in this study if all
             inclusion and exclusion criteria are met for that drug.

          4. Patient is receiving any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or
             hormonal other than for replacement) except for medications that are prescribed for
             supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol
             acetate, bisphosphonates) or ongoing castration-intent therapy for prostate cancer.
             These medications must have been started ≥ 1 month prior to enrollment on this study.
             Patients may be on warfarin, low molecular weight heparin or direct factor Xa
             inhibitors, unless such therapies are prohibited by drug-specific exclusion criteria.

          5. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing. Male and female patients who refuse to
             practice highly effective contraception methods.

          6. Patients with known progressive brain metastases determined by serial imaging or
             declining neurologic function in the opinion of the treating physician are not
             eligible. Patients with previously treated brain metastases are eligible, provided
             that the patient has not experienced a seizure or had a clinically significant change
             in neurological status within the 3 months prior to registration. All patients with
             previously treated brain metastases must be clinically stable for at least 1 month
             after completion of treatment and off steroid treatment for one month prior to study
             enrollment.

             Additional exclusion criteria specific for GBM patients:

               1. Patients who require anti-convulsant therapy must be taking non-enzyme inducing
                  antiepileptic drugs (non-EIAED). EIAED are prohibited. Patients previously on
                  EIAED must be switched to non-EIAED at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.

               2. No radiotherapy within the three months prior to the diagnosis of progression.

               3. No radiotherapy with a dose over 65 Gy, stereotactic radiosurgery or
                  brachytherapy unless the recurrence is histologically proven.

          7. Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including uncontrolled or symptomatic
             angina, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or symptomatic congestive
             heart failure are not eligible.

          8. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) known to be &lt; 40% are not
             eligible.

          9. Patients with stroke (including TIA) or acute myocardial infarction within 4 months
             before the first dose of study treatment are not eligible

         10. Patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 month of start of treatment are
             not eligible.

         11. Patients with any other clinically significant medical condition which, in the opinion
             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, severe
             psychiatric illness situations, or anticipated or planned anti-cancer treatment or
             surgery.

         12. Patients who do not meet drug-specific eligibility requirements for the drug selected
             by the investigator, are not eligible to receive that drug.

         13. Patients whose disease is not measurable or assessable by radiographic imaging or
             physical examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only) are not eligible.

         14. Patients with known allergy/hypersensitivity to the study drug (active substance or to
             any of the excipients).
