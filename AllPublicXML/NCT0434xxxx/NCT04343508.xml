      The study is a single center, open label, nutrition intervention study. Healthy adult male
      working at a Singapore construction site are included if they fulfill inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Volunteers receive fortified rice for their daily lunch and dinner each day of the
      week (i e 14 meals/week) over six months. Nutrition status in blood is measured at baseline
      and after six months of fortified rice consumption.

      The study is a single center, open label, nutrition intervention study. Healthy adult male
      working at a Singapore construction site are included if they are between 21 and 50 y old
      Indian or Bangladeshi ethnic origin and have a BMI of 19 0 to 27 5 kg/m2 and sign informed
      consent. Volunteers receive fortified rice for their daily lunch and dinner each day of the
      week (i e 14 meals/week) over six months. Rice is fortified with 500 IU/ 0 15 mg RAE vitamin
      A, 0.05 mg thiamin, 0.06 mg vitamin B6, 1 μg vitamin B12, 130 μg folic acid, 7 mg niacin, 4
      mg iron and 6 mg zinc per 100 g rice. Compliance with whole rice meal consumption is
      monitored. At baseline and 6 months, height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, pulse and body
      temperature are collected. Blood is sampled at baseline and after 6 months for hemoglobin
      (red blood cell folate, and serum zinc, ferritin and vitamin B 12 status following 6 months
      dietary intervention with fortified rice Homocysteine is measured in a random subset of
      volunteers. 10 mL Blood samples are collected via venipuncture prior to dietary intervention.
      Additional 5 mL blood is sampled from 18 volunteers for homocysteine assessment.
