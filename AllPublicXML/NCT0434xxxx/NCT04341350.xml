  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the impact on the frequency of occurrence of
      delirium of an early inhaled sedation strategy (from induction in rapid sequence if
      intubation in intensive care, or from admission if intubated in pre -hospital) by Isoflurane
      using an ANACONDA ™ type system, compared to a conventional intravenous sedation strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation-analgesia is used in most patients treated with mechanical ventilation (MV). The
      usual benzodiazepine and morphine sedation reduces pain and anxiety and allows tolerance of
      invasive procedures in intensive care. These molecules, used as part of the sedation
      titration protocol or the daily sedation stop protocol, have improved patient outcomes.

      Although necessary, these drugs, by mechanisms still uncertain, would promote the occurrence
      of resuscitation delirium. Delirium itself responsible for worsening morbidity and mortality
      (increase in the duration of MV, increase in the length of hospital stay, discussed increase
      in mortality, long-term cognitive sequelae).

      This finding favored the use of new drugs in the sedation strategies of patients on MV.
      Dexmedetomidine has for example reduced the number of days of delirium, the number of days of
      coma and even mortality in septic patients. Its large-scale use has however been questioned
      by a recent study.

      Halogenated gases have been used for a long time in anesthesia. Their pharmacodynamics, their
      positive and adverse effects, their therapeutic margins are well known. Thanks to technical
      innovations they can be used on resuscitation respirators. Several studies on targeted
      populations have shown the feasibility and the benefits of this use, in particular, the
      absence of accumulation, the absence of tachyphylaxis, the broad therapeutic range, the small
      interindividual variation, the rapidity of efficacy and the speed of awakening. Safety in use
      for the staff in charge of the patient is established. In addition, their potential
      neuroprotective effect would make it an anesthetic of choice in the prevention of
      resuscitation delirium.
