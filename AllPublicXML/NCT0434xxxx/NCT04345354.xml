  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of an obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a perfectly
      identified cardiovascular and metabolic risk factor responsible for excess mortality in
      patients with severe OSAHS, while life expectancy, when the SAHOS is treated by continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) is close to that of the general population. It also
      represents a factor of excess mortality, little known and poorly explored, in relation to
      morbidity and mortality occurring during the perioperative period accompanying any general
      anesthesia.
