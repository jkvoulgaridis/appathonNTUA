  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality following
      surgery.A combination of chemical and mechanical prophylaxis using lower extremity
      compression devices (CD) is recommended in patients who are considered at 'moderate risk'
      (Caprini score 2 - 4) or 'high risk' (Caprini score &gt; 4) of developing VTE.

      The aim of this study was to determine whether upper extremity (UE) CD are as effective as
      lower extremity (LE) CD in preventing VTE following surgery. A total of 106 patients were
      recruited.

    <textblock>
      Hospitals throughout the United States currently utilize mechanical compression devices on
      patients' limbs for prevention of blood clots, in addition to blood thinning medication -
      heparin. The compression devices act by affect blood clotting mechanism and there is evidence
      from previous research studies that blood is less likely to develop clots when these
      compression devices are placed on the arms or legs.

      The use of compression devices on arms and legs is within standard of care, but use on legs
      tends to be more common.

      Research studies have shown that use of compression devices in combination with heparin is
      more effective in preventing blood clots than either one alone.

      Not many clinicians remember the option of placing compression devices on arms, and patients
      who do not get compression devices placed on their legs following surgery, often get only
      medication (heparin) with no compression device placed at all.

      This study will compare the effectiveness of compression devices used on patients' arms with
      those used on patients' legs, at preventing blood clots. Non-invasive ultrasound studies will
      be used after surgery to check for blood clots in the legs.
