  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether there are differences in effectiveness and safety outcomes
      among PI3K-treated patients in a real world registry, compared to patients treated in
      clinical trials.

      Phase IV, multicenter, prospective observational study in a real world (RW) setting, designed
      to observe the utilization and effectiveness of PI3K-inhibitor treatment, and HRQoL of
      patients with CLL/SLL/FL outside the context of a clinical trial.

    <measure>Measurement of Quality of Life - EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a widely used health status instrument, which developed by the EuroQol Group in the 1980s. It provides a concise and generic measure to compare and value health status across disease areas. The 5-level EQ-5D-5L was introduced in 2009 to improve the sensitivity of the instrument and reduce the ceiling effect. The EQ-5D-5L consists of the descriptive system measuring 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by choosing one of the 5 levels for each dimension: no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Each dimension has a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digit for the 5 dimensions will be combined into a 5-digit number that describes a patient's health profile. Results of the EQ VAS will be presented to measure overall self-rated health status.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Quality of Life - FACT-lym</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma (FACT-lym) is a PRO measure used to assess HRQoL in patients undergoing cancer therapy. The instrument includes 27 questions on the impacts of cancer therapy over the past 7 days in four domains plus 15 questions related to lymphoma patients: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional over the past 7 days. Each question is answered using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much), where higher numbers indicate better health state. Scores of each domain will be calculated by adding scores for questions included in each domain, and a total score for the FACT-Lym will be obtained by adding each of the subscale scores, with higher score indicating better health state.</description>
