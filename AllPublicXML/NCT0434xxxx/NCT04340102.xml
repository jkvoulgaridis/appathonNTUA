  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with serious mental illness are abstinent while in the hospital for a
      psychiatric admission yet almost all return to smoking after discharge. The investigators
      propose to adapt a digital intervention both to the needs of SMI smokers and to being
      introduced in the inpatient psychiatric setting through a collaboration between experts in
      SMI and the Truth Initiative, a pre-eminent tobacco control organization. The investigators
      believe this will bridge the inpatient to outpatient gap in cessation services and will help
      people remain abstinent following hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with serious mental illness (SMI, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, recurrent
      depression) are a socioeconomically disadvantaged group and die on average 10-15 years
      earlier than those in the general population, many from cancer. The prevalence of smoking in
      persons with SMI is approximately 3 times that in the general population; smoking is the is
      the strongest risk factor for elevated mortality in this population. Psychiatric inpatient
      admissions are common in SMI and the hospital is an optimal place to provide smoking
      cessation services. All patients are abstinent while in the hospital. The key challenge is
      how to continue to engage these patients in cessation services to support continued
      abstinence. While most receive refer to telephone quitline at discharge, quitlines are not as
      effective with SMI smokers and almost all return to smoking. Introducing hospitalized SMI
      patients to cessation services that can be easily accessed when they leave the hospital
      offers the best chance of converting initial abstinence into sustained abstinence
      post-discharge. A digital intervention that incorporates web-delivered evidence-based smoking
      cessation practices, digital coaching, and mobile text messaging is a scalable and
      sustainable way to bridge the inpatient to outpatient gap in cessation services. Currently
      there is no digital cessation program that addresses the needs of SMI smokers. The
      investigators propose to adapt a digital intervention both to the needs of SMI smokers and to
      being introduced in the inpatient psychiatric setting through a collaboration between experts
      in SMI and the Truth Initiative, a pre-eminent tobacco control organization. The
      investigators will build upon a well-established, evidence-based, cessation website,
      BecomeAnEX.org (EX), that offers individualized quit plans, an active social community, text
      and email messaging support, and digital coaching. Integrating input from different
      stakeholders, the investigators will develop adaptations so that EX components and language
      are in line with principles of mental health recovery and will successfully engage SMI
      smokers with digital coaching that will support use of other EX services. The investigators
      will develop automated and integrated procedures for identifying hospitalized SMI smokers and
      registering them with EX. The investigators will then examine the feasibility and
      acceptability of the adapted intervention to engage and retain 60 smokers with SMI after
      hospital discharge.

    <description>Participants will have three individual meetings with a research staff person while they are in the hospital. At these meetings participants will answer questions about their smoking and interest in quitting, learn about BecomeAnEx, and register with the BecomeAnEx program so that they can use it when you leave the hospital. Participants will be given two weeks of nicotine replacement therapy when they leave the hospital. Participants will be asked to use BecomeAnEx as much as they want when they leave the hospital program.</description>

    <description>This research study is focused on a smoking cessation program called BecomeAnEx. We are studying how to adapt BecomeAnEx for people with a mental health disorder who want to reduce or quit their tobacco smoking. BecomeAnEx includes a website that provides education about smoking and quitting. It also has a text messaging program that delivers personalized information. Persons in the program have access to real-time digital coaching with a remote coach who has experience helping people quit smoking. In addition, the program has an on-line community of current and former smokers that can provide support and encouragement.</description>
