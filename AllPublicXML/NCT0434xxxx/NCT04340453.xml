  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip and Knee strengthening exercises are implemented in Patellofemoral Pain (PFP)
      rehabilitation but exercising in high loads to achieve muscle changes in strength may lead to
      increased patellofemoral joint stress. Low load training with Blood Flow Restriction (BFR)
      may allow for exercise strength benefits to proximal and distal muscles with reduced joint
      stress and by promoting hypoalgesia.

      The purpose of this study is to compare hip and knee focused exercises with and without BFR
      training in adults with PFP. The main outcome of this study is function ability which will be
      measured with the Kujala Anterior Knee pain Scale translated in the Greek language at four
      weeks post intervention and at two months follow up. Our null hypothesis is that there will
      be no difference between groups for primary and secondary outcomes measured at four weeks and
      two months post intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This a randomized controlled clinical trial with first primary end point at four weeks and
      second primary end point at two months.

      Sample size was determined through power analysis. The Minimal Clinically Significant
      Difference (MCID) of our main outcome measure, Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale, was used for
      the estimation. The MCID of the Kujala scale has been reported to be 10 points with an
      estimated standard deviation of 13,5 points. For a power of 0.80 and a level of significance
      a=0.05 and considering a two tailed t-test the sample size was calculated to be 60
      participants total (30 in each group). The GPower 3.0.10 software was used to calculate the
      sample size. By estimating a possible 20% drop out we concluded to a sample size of 75.

      The participants of this study will be volunteers and considered a sample of convenience
      since no official records or data base exists in Cyprus with all PFP patients. Participant
      recruitment will begin in November 2019. Potential participants will be informed for the
      study through printed posters around the European University Cyprus (EUC) campus, local
      social media online posters and will volunteer for inclusion. Screening will be carried out
      by an orthopedic surgeon, at the musculoskeletal laboratory of the EUC to determine their
      eligibility based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Volunteers who meet inclusion criteria will receive oral and written information and give
      informed consent to participate in the study by signing a consent form. They will be
      randomized into one of two treatment groups. Group 1 will be the Hip and Knee Exercise group
      and Group 2 the BFR training Hip and Κnee exercise group. Randomization will be carried out
      using a block sequence of 4 by an external statistician to maintain a balance in sample size
      across groups over time and to ensure the assessor was blind to the participants allocation.

      All interventions will take place in the musculoskeletal laboratory and the training center
      lab of the EUC. Time consistency in treatments will be a goal, in order to train participants
      at similar circadian rhythm. Room temperature for both labs will be set at 25 °C. Two
      experienced physiotherapists will each be randomly assigned to supervise one of the two
      intervention groups and provide the treatment. The therapists role is to supervise treatments
      and their progression, keep track of compliance with the study design, adverse effects and
      drop outs. If patients do not comply with the study (seek other treatment for PFP, exercise
      during the study, inability to attend treatments) design they will be excluded. The two
      therapist will be blinded as to the other groups treatment protocol and the studies outcomes.
      They will be given written information for all procedures of their intervention group in
      order to ensure consistency throughout the study. Data collected by the therapists will be
      stored at the E.U.C laboratories and will only be available to them. Additionally, the
      therapists will be assisted by fourth year physiotherapy undergraduate students in
      supervising participants during treatments. Participants who fail to complete at least 10/12
      therapy sessions will be excluded and their data will not be analyzed. All therapy sessions
      will be supervise by a physician who will be in charge of participants safety. Any adverse
      events will be reported with publication of final results. Participants are free to withdraw
      from the study at any given moment. In case of any complaints, participants have the right to
      file official complaints to the university bioethics committee.

      Planed statistical analysis: Statistical analysis will be performed by the studies assessor
      who is blinded to the participants treatment group using the IBM SPSS &quot;Statistical Package
      for the Social Sciences&quot; (SPSS, Version 20.0). Descriptive statistics will be analyzed with
      the calculation of means, standard deviations, minimum and max values for each variable. A
      normality check will follow using the One Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p&lt;0.05). The
      chi-squared test will be used to test for difference between the two groups with respect to
      the categorical variable gender. To check for differences within groups (baseline-4weeks,
      baseline-2months follow up and 4weeks-2months follow up) we will use the paired t-test for
      each comparison. In case of nonparametric data, the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used.
      In order to estimate differences between the two groups (baseline-4weeks, baseline-2months
      follow up and 4weeks-2months follow up) we will use the mixed two way ANOVA with time as a
      within-subjects factor and treatment as the between subjects factor. Homogeneity of variance
      will be checked with the Levene test &lt;0.05. In the case of not normally distributed data we
      will use the generalized mixed effect model with treatment as a fixed factor, time as a
      random factor, and inverse as the link function. Possible correlations will also be checked
      for our outcome measures using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In case of not normally
      distributed data the Spearman correlation coefficient will be used if there seems to be a
      linear correlation from a scatter plot. Missing values in the Patient Reported Outcome
      Measures will be imputed using Multiple Imputation (MI). Only upon agreement by the authors
      that there will be no further changes and/or analysis, results of the study will be
      published.

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed for Function The Greek version of the Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>The AKPS is a 13-item questionnaire that documents response to six different activities such as walking, running, jumping, stair climbing, squatting and prolonged sitting with knee bent, as well as patients symptoms, such as limping, inability to weight bear on the affected limb, swelling, abnormal patella movement, muscle atrophy and limitations of flexion of knee joint. The AKPS asks about the duration of symptoms and limb(s) affected. The maximum score is 100 (no pain/disability/limitation) and the minimum 0 (worst possible function). This questionnaire has been previously used in PFP studies and is found to be a valid and reliable measure for PFP patients with a minimally clinical significant difference (MCID) of 10points. The Greek version has been found to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's a=0.942), test-retest reliability (ICC=0.921) and concurrent validity (r&gt;0.7)</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed. Pain with the Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using the visual analog scale VAS 0-10cm. This scale is a 10cm horizontal line with two small vertical lines at the two ends. The far-left side is 0 &quot;no pain&quot; and the far right is 10 &quot;worst pain&quot;. Participants will be asked to mark with a horizontal line to rate the level of worst pain VAS-W and the level of their usual pain VAS-U that they experienced during the course of the previous week. A standard ruler will be used to measure the distance from 0 to the participants mark. The VAS scale measuring these two types of pain have been shown to be valid and reliable in patients with PFP with an MCID of 2cm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed. Pain with single leg squatting (shallow-deep)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>Two depths of squatting will be assessed and the VAS scale will be used to quantify the level of pain with each squat. For the first Single-leg squat (shallow): the participant will stand in front of the treatment bed and the height of the bed will be adjusted to be the mid-point of his thigh (halfway between the greater trochanter and popliteal fossa midpoint). For the second Single-leg squat (deep): the beds height will be adjusted to the popliteal fossa midpoint. Participants will perform the squat with hands crossed over the chest until they touch but not sit on the beds surface. At the end of each test, the VAS scale will be used to measure pain felt during the squat. This testing method has been previously used to assess pain in anterior knee pain patients.</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed. Kinesiophobia: The Tampa scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess Kinesiophobia using the Greek Version of the TSK that has been found to be valid and reliable. This scale consists of 17 items that assess fear of injury due to movement. Participants will be asked to make ratings of their degree of agreement for each of the 17 items. Ratings range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Responses will be summed after reversing the scores of items 4,8,12 and 16. Higher total scores relate to higher related fear.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed. Catastrophizing: The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) assesses the cognitive process by which pain is seen as an extreme threat and from which the patient suffers exaggerated negative consequences. We will assess catastrophizing using the Greek Version of the PCS that has been found to be valid and reliable. The questionnaire consists of 13 items (statements) describing pain experience and participants are asked to indicate whether they agree with these statements on a five point scale rating from 0 (not at all) to 4 (always). Scores are summed to calculate a final score. A high score indicates a high level of pain catastrophizing. The PSC measures three categories: rumination, magnification and helplessness. Rumination refers to the patients' inability to apart the pain from his mind, magnification expresses the exaggerated cognitions of pain as a threat, and hopelessness is the estimation that the patient cannot do anything to influence his pain.</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed. Maximum pain free flexion angle using the decline step down test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a functional test that measures the Maximum Pain Free Flexion Angle (MPFFA) of the knee joint whilst descending a 20cm high step with a surface inclination of 20o. The participant descends from the step to the maximum point where no pain is present. At this point the assessor will take a photo using the Dr. Goniometer (DrG) app, installed on an iPhone 6S andmeasure the MPFFA. The test has been found to be reliable with intra-observer reliability ICC=0.83 and inter-observer reliability ICC=0.85. It has been shown to be valid as it has been correlated with the AKPS (r= 0.31, p= 0.030</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; is being assessed. Strength: Strength tests will measure isometric Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVIC) with the use of a MicroFET2TM Hand Held Dynamometer (HHD).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks (end of treatment), 2 months (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>Strength tests will measure isometric Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVIC) with the use of a MicroFET2TM Hand Held Dynamometer (HHD) for the quadriceps at ≈60o of knee flexion from the seated position. Hip extensors will be assessed from the prone position and hip abductors in the side-lying position with the hip abducted to ≈10o. Strength will be recorded in Newtons (N). Testing will begin after 2-3 sub-maximal contractions for familiarization and warm up followed by a maximal isometric contraction of a 5sec duration with standard verbal encouragement by the assessor. then followed by a 30sec rest and then repeated. If the two measures differ less than 10% then no other testing will follow. The mean of the two measures will be used for analysis. If measures differ &gt;10%, a third test will be repeated until the above criteria is met. Placement of the dynamometer will be marked with a marker to ensure consistency between trials.</description>
