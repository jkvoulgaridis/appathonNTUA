  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test if patient-reported outcomes with automated reporting to
      clinicians for remote monitoring of postoperative symptoms is feasible and improves quality
      of life, health outcomes, and service utilization in thoracic surgery patients. Patients
      undergoing thoracic surgery will be asked to self-report symptoms for remote monitoring by
      their care team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized feasibility study. A total of 560 patients undergoing
      thoracic surgery will be prospectively enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      arms. All participants will complete patient-reported outcome (PRO) symptom monitoring. The
      two arms are 1) active symptom monitoring and 2) passive symptom monitoring. The participants
      randomized to active symptom monitoring will have alerts sent to their clinicians when their
      PRO symptom scores exceed baseline postoperative scores by 2 points or more, or when 'severe'
      or 'very severe' symptoms are reported. Participants randomized to the passive PRO monitoring
      arm will complete the same PROs as participants in the active monitoring arm, but will not
      have alerts sent to their clinician. All participants will be administered survey instruments
      to assess quality of life, satisfaction, and health history. In addition, a subset of 40
      participants and their caregivers will be chosen at 2 months postoperatively to complete a
      semi-structured interview about their postoperative symptom reporting experience.
