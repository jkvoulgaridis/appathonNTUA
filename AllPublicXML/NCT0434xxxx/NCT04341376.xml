  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of Enhanced First Connections, which is a short-term
      perinatal home visiting program that includes infant and early childhood mental health
      consultation. Mothers with a history of adversity or trauma will be the focus of this
      research. Hypothesized outcomes of Enhanced First Connections include the prevention of child
      maltreatment (child abuse and neglect), prevention of child exposure to adult intimate
      partner violence, increases in family engagement in longer-term evidence based home visiting
      programs, increases in family engagement in specialized support services to address maternal
      adversity and trauma, reductions in maternal risk factors, and the promotion of positive
      parenting and the parent-child relationship.

    <description>Enhanced First Connections is a short-term risk assessment and response home visiting referral program. The goal of Enhanced First Connections is to identify family needs and link families to community resources, including evidence based home visiting models. Enhanced First Connections includes prenatal identification and engagement of women with an adversity or trauma history, and infant and early childhood mental health consultation. Women who enroll in Enhanced First Connections are expected to receive between four and eight home visits before being referred to other community resources.</description>

    <ipd_description>Final datasets generated from questionnaire, interview, and observational assessments will be cleaned and merged using SPSS syntax to generate a final dataset for analysis. A public use de-identified dataset that does not include sensitive or potentially identifiable information will be made available. For datasets that include sensitive or potentially identifiable information, data-use agreements will be put in place with appropriate restrictions prior to the provision of data. To ensure that released data have appropriate documentation, a data dictionary will accompany all de-identified datasets that includes data collection methods, measures and variable construction, and potential limitations of use.</ipd_description>
