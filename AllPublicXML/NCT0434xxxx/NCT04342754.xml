  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized tics that start before
      the age of 18 years. About 5% of cases do not respond to drug treatment and can be classified
      as refractory and in these cases surgical treatment, with deep brain stimulation, appears as
      a therapeutic possibility, but with still conflicting results. Our hypothesis is that DBS in
      Forel's H Field could improve tourette's symptoms, neurological and psychiatric ones.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen patients with TS will be included in our protocol. The tics must have a negative
      influence in the quality of life of these patients. Patients will be submitted to a
      neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the surgical target. After the surgery
      all patients will have the device turned ON for 6 months.

      After the first 6 months participants will be randomly in two groups, one to stay with device
      ON or turned OFF at a period of 3 months. After that the groups will cross over for more 3
      months. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before the surgery, at end of open
      fase, in the moment of cross over and at end of all.

    <description>Assess 5 items: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, interference. Each item is scored for phonic and motor tic symptom by the patient on a 0 to 5 numerical scale. The maximum possible score for these part is 50. Add to that the impairment score, which also has 50 as the maximum score.
Total Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Score (Total Tic Severity Score + Impairment). The maximum possible score for the total scale is 100.
Lower scores of YGTSS represents less tics.</description>
