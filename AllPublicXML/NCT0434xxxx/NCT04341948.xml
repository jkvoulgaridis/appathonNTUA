    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information about how knee pain changes when small
      amounts of electricity are delivered to the nerves in the leg. This study will involve the
      use of a Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) System that is made by SPR Therapeutics (the
      sponsor of the study). The SPRINT PNS System was cleared by the FDA for up to 60 days of use
      in the back and/or extremities for the management of acute and chronic pain.
