  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The studies carried out to evaluate the safety and efficacy of products aimed at the intimate
      area of women aim to confirm the absence of risk associated with its use, identify possible
      feelings of discomfort and / or clinical signs resulting from the use of the product and
      evaluate the benefits provided by the use of the product such as, gynecologically tested,
      clinically tested, hydration for 72 hours, hydration, does not drip or drip little, feeling
      of natural hydration, control of natural vaginal odor, preserves vaginal pH, does not promote
      irritation, use vaginal topic, feeling of comfort, relief from dryness, easy use of the
      applicator, the applicator does not cause discomfort during application, preferably use at
      night, does not change the vaginal flora, reduces pain and discomfort during or shortly after
      sexual intercourse, does not promote discomfort during or shortly after intercourse,
      reduction of vaginal bleeding during or right after sexual intercourse, if there is a small
      amount left in the applicator, the treatment is not compromised.

      The research will be carried out with two new products for use in the internal intimate
      region in up to 74 research participants (up to 37 participants per product - each group of
      37 will use one of the products), which meet the required inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      At the end of the treatment, the analysis must contain a minimum number of 30 participants
      per product. Participants will use the test products for 22 (+ 2) days and will be evaluated
      and monitored throughout the study by a gynecologist to verify the effectiveness of the
      products and possible adverse events. In addition, a profile questionnaire will be applied at
      the beginning of the study (T0 - day 1) and at the end of the study, the perceived efficacy
      questionnaire (T22), to assess signs and symptoms of the efficacy and safety of the product
      used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moisturizers are used in chronic maintenance, replacing normal vaginal sections.

      Vaginal moisturizers rehydrate the mucosal tissue and are absorbed by the skin, adhering to
      the vaginal lining, thus mimicking natural vaginal secretions. The use of vaginal
      moisturizers is intended to allow dryness / atrophy, vaginitis / non-hormonal vaginal atrophy
      and is regularly harmful or once every 2-3 days. The frequency of use is directly
      proportional to the severity of the atrophy (for example, the more severe the atrophy, the
      more frequent the application is), the effects of the moisturizer are more prolonged and the
      effects of the lubricant, lasting 2 to 3 days.

      MOD_PRO_CEP Rev. 03 All-SE-UG-EP-pH-FL-062603-07 / 08-04-18-PRV01 Vaginal moisturizers use
      this longer to change the content of the endothelium fluid, capture the vaginal pH and thus
      maintain vaginal hydration and acidity. Therefore, they are particularly beneficial, not only
      for women with VVA / GSM symptoms that cause pain during intercourse, but also for women who
      are not currently sexually active, but experience discomfort on a daily basis. Since vaginal
      moisturizers are used to moisturize the mucosa, most contain water. For the water to stick to
      the mucosa, it also contains vegetable or synthetic polymers. In addition, they can use a
      wide variety of other excipients to provide adequate viscosity, to buffer or pH and for
      conservation; these additional ingredients (some synthetic polymers) affect the pH and
      osmolality of the moisturizer.

      The products to be tested in this study are two vaginal moisturizers. These are two new
      products from the sponsor.

    <description>Before using the product (T0 - day 1), the vaginal pH will be evaluated, with the aid of a speculum, using colorimetric pH measuring tapes, with a gradual scale of 2 to 9.
The tapes will be applied in contact with the right lateral vaginal wall, without touching the cervix or cervical mucus, due to the pH difference. The cervix, as well as the cervical mucus, have a pH more alkaline than the vagina, and may interfere with the result that will be evaluated by colorimetric approximation using the standard template</description>
