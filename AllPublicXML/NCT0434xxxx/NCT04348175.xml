  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, multi-center, study will enroll patients with renal insufficiency. Single
      ascending doses of setmelanotide will be evaluated, in semi-sequential group design. The
      following four cohorts of patients will be evaluated:

      Cohort A: setmelanotide in subjects with mild renal insufficiency Cohort B: setmelanotide in
      subjects with moderate renal insufficiency Cohort C: setmelanotide in subjects with severe
      renal insufficiency Cohort D: setmelanotide in subjects with normal renal function

      All subcutaneous doses will be administered to the abdominal region. Each dose will be
      studied in a separate cohort of subjects. Cohorts A and B will be performed in a parallel
      manner. After cohorts A and B have been studied and before subsequent cohort C is dosed, the
      available safety data (adverse events [AEs], clinical laboratory test results, vital signs
      and electrocardiograms) from the preceding cohort(s) will be reviewed. In addition, a 48h
      pause to evaluate safety will be implemented following the enrollment of the first 2 (two)
      patients in cohort C before treating the remaining patients in the cohort. Cohort D will be
      performed sequentially following cohort C. Depending on the safety data from the preceding
      cohort(s), a cohort may be repeated, or the dose may be reduced for future cohorts.
