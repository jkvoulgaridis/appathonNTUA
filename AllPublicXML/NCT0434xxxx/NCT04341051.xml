  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted Single-center prospective observational study to evaluate the improvement of
      peripheral vascular perfusion monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy, in patients
      undergoing endovascular surgery after performing sciatic nervous block.

      The aims of that study is to check regional oxigen saturation variability in patients
      suffering from Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (IIa to III Fontaine classification)
      undergoing popliteal sciatic nerve block as analgesic procedure before vascular surgery. We
      want to evaluate the increase in regional microcirculation after the popliteal nerve blocks
      due to vasoplegic response and vasodilatation after performing regional anaesthesia. We will
      place NIRS electrode on the instep of the foot to evaluate regional oxigen saturation in the
      interested leg before the performing of popliteal sciatic nerve block and then during the
      surgery (after 5 minuts, 15 minuts, 30 minuts), and after the end of the procedure.

    <description>we will observe the regional saturation of O2 through NIRS at the following time: T0(before peripheral anesthesia); T1 (5 minutes from the block); T2 (15 minutes from the block); T3 (30 minutes from the block); T4 (after revascularization); At each interval PA, SpO2 and NIRS were also recorded in the contralateral limb as control data.</description>
