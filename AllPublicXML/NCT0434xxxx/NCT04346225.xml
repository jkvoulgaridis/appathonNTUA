  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective imaging study evaluating the utility of baseline metabolic MR imaging
      as a diagnostic and response monitoring tool in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
      Preliminary pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrates the ability of HP C-13
      pyruvate/metabolic MR imaging to detect high-grade prostate cancer, including cancer with
      neuroendocrine differentiation, as well as provide early evidence of metabolic response and
      resistance following application of systemic therapies for the treatment of advanced prostate
      cancer patients. In the proposed study, the investigators aim is to extend the initial
      clinical results and further develop HP C-13 MRI as an imaging modality in advanced prostate
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      Participants with advanced prostate cancer will be enrolled in parallel in one of two cohorts
      prospectively determined by the Principal Investigator. Both cohorts will receive up to two
      13C pyruvate (C-1 and C-2 labeled 13C pyruvate) injections on the day of imaging (2nd
      injection is optional) and may choose to undergo optional MR- or CT- guided tumor biopsies at
      baseline and at the time of disease progression following completion of HP C-13 MRI at the
      corresponding time point. When receiving two HP 13C pyruvate injections, the injections will
      be separated by a period of 15-60 minutes.

      Participants in cohort A will undergo MR imaging with hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate of a
      pre-selected target lesion at a single time point. Participants in cohort B will undergo
      hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRI at baseline and 8 weeks (+/- 4 weeks) following initiation of
      a line of systemic therapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and may undergo an
      additional optional MR scan at the time of disease progression as defined by the Prostate
      Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3). The same sequence of injections will be used
      for all time points in cohort B.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically-confirmed locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. Patients with
             unequivocal clinical evidence supporting diagnosis of prostate cancer who have not had
             prior biopsy may be considered eligible per judgment of Principal Investigator. A
             minimum of 50% of participants in each cohort must have a metastatic target lesion.

          2. Presence of at least one target lesion detected by standard staging scans that, in the
             judgment of Study Investigators, would be amenable to hyperpolarized C-13
             pyruvate/metabolic MR imaging:

               1. Soft tissue/visceral organ target lesions must measure at 1 cm in long axis
                  diameter on CT or MRI.

               2. Target lesions in the bone must be visualized by CT or MRI (lesions present only
                  on bone scan do not qualify).

               3. For patients with target lesion in prostate/prostatic bed:

             i. No contra-indications to endorectal coil insertion (e.g., patients with a prior
             abdominoperineal resection of the rectum or latex allergy).

             ii. No prior local treatment to the selected lesion, or evidence of radiographic
             progression following prior local therapy to selected lesion.

          3. Cohort B participants only: Must not have started on next line of systemic therapy for
             the treatment of prostate cancer prior to baseline MRI.

          4. Able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide signed and dated informed
             consent.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1

          6. For patients undergoing optional tumor biopsy:

               1. No history of bleeding diathesis.

               2. Patients on anti-coagulation they must be able to safely stop treatment for
                  purposes of tumor biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who because of age, general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic
             status cannot give valid informed consent.

          2. Patients unwilling or unable to undergo MR imaging, including patients with contra-
             indications to MRI, such as cardiac pacemakers or non-compatible intracranial vascular
             clips.

          3. Metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device that distorts local
             magnetic field and compromises the quality of MRI.

          4. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would impair the
             patient's ability to comply with study procedures
