  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in the United
      States (U.S.) that will evaluate the effect of mavacamten treatment on reducing the number of
      septal reduction therapy (SRT) procedures performed in subjects with symptomatic obstructive
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM [also known as HOCM]) who are eligible for SRT based on
      ACCF/AHA 2011 and/or ESC 2014 guidelines.
