  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of AI to correctly aid in
      characterization of benign and malignant lesions even when a low dose of gadolinium is
      administered. This study is relevant for several reasons, most notably being the reduction of
      MRI dose and decreased gadolinium deposition in the brain. In addition, use of AI may provide
      increased sensitivity and specificity for the radiologist evaluating a breast MRI exam. Half
      of the population will have benign pathologies and the other half will have malignant
      pathologies.

      The study involves each patient presenting for an initial MRI with a regular dose of
      gadolinium and then presenting at least 48 hours after (no less than 14 days later) for a ¼
      dose (see below regarding dosing) gadolinium MRI exam. Both exams will be performed on a 1.5
      Tesla magnet. Both exams will include a full protocol. The full dose contrast exam will be
      read as standard protocol. All images will be anonymized. Images from the reduced dose study
      will be collected and an AI algorithm applied. All three anonymized data sets (regular dose,
      low dose, and AI algorithm applied to low dose) will be provided to the readers.

      Readers will be three attending radiologists specializing in breast imaging. Exams will be
      scored on quality, background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), and lesion conspicuity.
      Enhancing lesions will be identified and characterized by the radiologists in a document
      provided.
