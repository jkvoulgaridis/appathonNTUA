  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global issue due to its alarming high and increasing prevalence
      worldwide and the roles it plays in occurrence of many chronic diseases. In addition, obesity
      is characterized as a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation and is associated with an
      abnormal inflammatory response, low antioxidant capacity and reduced insulin sensitivity
      which lead to the generation of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance.

      As in Malaysia, study by National Health and Morbidity Survey Malaysia (NHMS) in 2011 and
      2015 showed a continuing increase of the problem. In response to the rise of obesity
      prevalence, various efforts and strategies have been implemented in the past decade to combat
      this problem. The use of natural products as therapeutic agents in preventing metabolic
      disease has becoming popular. Cocoa and its products is a largely consumed food in the world.
      It has a very rich sources of phenolic compound. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have
      shown that polyphenols, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity properties, can
      boost energy expenditure and thermogenesis, lessen oxidative stress and inflammation while
      supporting weight loss management. Furthermore, the contribution of human studies especially
      among obese relatively limited.

      The popularity of chocolate and/or cocoa and its frequent consumption made it the target of
      many research studies, due to its favourable effects, and to the significant role it may
      exert on improving the obesity condition. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the
      effects of flavanol-rich dark chocolate consumption on metabolic profiles of obese adults
      using metabolomic approach.

      Overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle are the leading factors associated with the development
      of obesity. Obese adults usually are advised to make lifestyle modifications which include
      dietary restriction and physical activity recommendation. In addition, dietary supplements
      and medication such as anti-hypertensive, lipid lowering drugs are used to achieved targeted
      body weight of obese adult. Therefore, the confounding factors in this study namely dietary
      intake, physical activity, medication, supplements were controlled throughout the study.
      These factors including smoking were also controlled as it will affect the metabolites.

      Imbalance between energy intake and expenditure results in adipose tissue expansion due to
      excessive lipogenesis in adipose tissues. Generally, it is well accepted that adipose tissue
      expansion in an obese state is accompanied by elevated inflammation. Oxidative stress and
      pro-inflammatory processes are strongly related. Increased abdominal adipose tissue
      accelerates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote increased generation
      of ROS, both inflammation and oxidative stress play a significant role in the development of
      insulin resistant thus further are associated with the degree of metabolic dysfunction.

      It was hypothesized that cocoa flavanol with the properties of anti-inflammation,
      anti-oxidative and antiobesity properties may reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation,
      subsequently reduce the insulin resistance and thus improved the outcome measurements in
      obese adult. In order to measures the altered metabolite in the urine and blood serum
      following cocoa rich flavanol consumption in dark chocolate in obese adult, a metabolomics
      based approach is used in this study.

      This study is a randomized, open-labelled, parallel controlled trial where the intervention
      group will receive 20 grams of dark chocolate, daily for 12 weeks while the control group
      will receive 20 grams of white chocolate daily for 12 weeks. Measurement will be taken
      including sociodemographic, anthropometric measurement, diet and physical activity
      questionnaire, blood and urine samples at baseline and 12 weeks of intervention. Obese male
      adult aged 18-45 years old will be recruited
