  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility is common in GI motility disorders, such as functional
      dyspepsia (FD) gastroparesis and chronic constipation. The symptoms of GI dysmotility include
      abdominal discomfort or pain, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension,
      bloating, anorexia and reduced bowel movement. . Medical treatment for GI motility disorders
      is very limited in the US. Acupuncture has frequently been used for treatment of GI ailments
      in Eastern countries. The most commonly used acupuncture points (acupoints) for focused
      treatment of GI symptoms are the Neiguan (PC6) and the Zusanli (ST36) points.
      Electroacupuncture (EA) at PC6 and ST36 has been reported to accelerate gastrointestinal
      motility in both animals and human.

      Recently, the investigators have studied the feasibility of transcutaneous electroacupuncture
      (TEA): electrical stimulation is applied to acupoints via surface electrodes without needles,
      similar to the commercial available transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) but
      applied to acupoints. The investigators hypothesize that TEA as a new treatment option,
      improves GI symptoms in patients with FD, gastroparesis or constipation, improves GI motility
      and therefore improves quality of life of the patients.

      The success of this project will lead to a noninvasive and convenient therapy for treating GI
      motility disorders. The proposed TEA method is expected to improve gastric and colonic
      functions and thus improve quality of life. In addition, the proposed TEA method and device
      are self-administrative after training during the first office visit. It provides a long-term
      treatment option for both FD, gastroparesis and chronic constipation.

    <measure>Change in the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of TEA on gastrointestinal dysmotility syndrome by changes in the score of the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) including 9 symptoms: nausea (feeling sick to your stomach as if you were going to vomit or throw up), retching (heaving as if to vomit, but nothing comes up), vomiting, stomach fullness, not able to finish a normal sized meal, feeling excessively full after meals, loss of appetite, bloating (feeling like you need to loose your clothes) and stomach or belly visibly larger. Each symptom will be graded from 0 to 5 (none, very mild, mild, moderate, severe and very severe).</description>

    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of TEA on gastrointestinal dysmotility syndrome by changes in the score of Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC-SYN). This questionnaire asks about constipation in the past 2 weeks. Symptoms include: abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, bloating, stomach cramps, painful bowel movements, rectal burning, rectal bleeding, incomplete bowel movement, hardness of stool, size of bowel movements, straining and feeling to pass a bowel without success. Each symptom will be scored between 1 to 4 being 1 for mild symptoms; 2 for moderate; 3 for severe and 4 for very severe.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as assessed by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of TEA on quality of life assessed by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life (PAGI-QoL). The PAGI-QoL instrument consists of 30 items, each with response options based on a 6-point scale and with a recall period of the previous 2 weeks. The items are grouped into 5 dimensions: Daily Activities, Clothing, Diet and Food Habits, Relationship and Psychological Well-being and Distress. A score per dimension as well as a total score can be calculated. The PAGI-QOL scores range from 0 (lowest QoL) to 5 (highest QoL).</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as assessed by the Short Form (SF-36v2) Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 6 and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of TEA on quality of life assessed by the SF-36v2 Health Survey. The SF-36v2 is a 36-item, self-report measure designed to assess quality of life in patients. This measure also provides two summary scores (physical and mental health) and eight scale scores. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain and general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability, i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
