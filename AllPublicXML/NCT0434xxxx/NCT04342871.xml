  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility and acceptability study to inform the development and testing of
      a novel communication intervention to support parents in their communication with children
      about cancer. The research questions to be answered by this study are whether the
      intervention being tested can be feasible and acceptable, and provide preliminary estimates
      of improvement in parental psychological distress.

      This is a single-arm, single center pilot study using a pretest-posttest design to evaluate
      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel psychosocial intervention, Fathers and Mothers
      with cancer Communication Tool (Fam-CT). The purpose of the intervention is to decrease
      parental anxiety by facilitating parental communication about cancer with their children. The
      primary hypothesis being tested is that an intervention that assists parents with their
      communication needs with their children can be feasible, acceptable, and reduce parental
      psychological distress. Findings from this study will inform a future grant application to
      further test this intervention in a randomized controlled trial.

    <description>Assess the change in patient's communication self-efficacy. The adapted Communication Self-Efficacy scale is a 9-item Visual Analogue Scale assessing parent's confidence in their ability to tell their child about parental medical illness. The score range is 0 to 900 with higher scores indicating higher confidence.</description>
