      A randomised controlled trial comparing cervical ripening using foley catheter as in- or
      outpatient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of outpatient versus inpatient Foley catheter
      cervical ripening and patients' satisfaction. Sixty low-risk women were randomized to
      outpatient and inpatient management of intracervical Foley catheter digital insertion. The
      outpatient group was provided with verbal and written 24-hours contact information and
      instructions. Both groups were reassessed the next morning unless labor had begun or the
      catheter had dropped off.
