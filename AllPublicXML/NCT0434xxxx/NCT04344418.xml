  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kenya does not have enough experts to perform heart scans in patients who are very sick and
      in need of urgent intervention. The purpose of this research is to find out whether training
      Kenyan nurses to perform basic heart scans would shorten the time it takes to know whether
      the heart and lungs are working normally in very sick patients, to guide treatment. Patients
      will be placed into one of two groups: One group will have a quick scan of the heart and
      lungs carried out by trained nurses to see how well these organs are working, in addition to
      receiving the normal care offered at the hospital. The other group will receive the normal
      care offered in the hospital only and will not have a scan performed by these nurses. The
      time it takes to make a diagnosis between the two groups will then be compared. Should the
      group that has heart scans by nurses be found to spend less time waiting for a diagnosis to
      be made, more nurses in Kenya will be trained to provide this service, to minimise delays in
      our emergency departments.

      Echocardiography is a useful, non-invasive diagnostic tool in time-critical emergencies. A
      national shortage of cardiologists and of doctors in Kenya however further compounds the
      problem of insufficient staff for emergency care and of any capacity building efforts. To
      achieve the goals of Sustainable Development Goal Number 3 (SDG-3) and realise the
      government's vision of universal healthcare for all, alternatives to the human resource
      challenge are key. Modifying the Scope of Practice of Kenyan nurses is one possible solution.
      Task-shifting traditionally cardiologist roles such as focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS)
      could shorten the time it takes to make a diagnosis in patients with cardiorespiratory
      failure of likely cardiac origin, making prolonged turnaround times in our public facilities
      a thing of the past. Our overarching aim is to harness the power of nurses doing FoCUS. The
      central hypothesis of this work is that in patients with cardiorespiratory failure, a
      nurse-led FoCUS-guided service would shorten time to diagnosis, supporting interventions and
      improving outcomes among the critically ill. Insight into potential barriers and enablers for
      the implementation of a nurse-performed FoCUS service in Kenya is crucial for the success of
      such a service redesign.

    <description>The control arm will consist of usual care ie a combination of physical examination, lab tests and imaging. The need for a formal echocardiographic evaluation by a cardiologist or cardiac sonographer in patients assigned to the control arm will be at the discretion of the clinical teams, as is usual care at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and Aga Khan University Hospital Nairobi (AKUHN). A diagnosis will be selected based on the same pre-defined checklist and the time the diagnosis is made recorded.</description>

    <description>The experimental arm will consist of nurse-performed FoCUS for patients with cardiorespiratory failure. A FoCUS-trained nurse will perform a FoCUS examination within 30 minutes of triage by the triage clinician. The Philips Lumify® handheld ultrasound device (HUD) with a phased array probe will be used and studies limited to a maximum of 10 minutes each. A presumptive diagnosis will then be selected by the nurse from a FoCUS checklist based on pre-defined thresholds for each FoCUS target condition and the time the diagnosis is made recorded. Additional imaging and lab tests may be requested at the discretion of the clinical team but the FoCUS nurses will be blinded to the results of these.</description>
