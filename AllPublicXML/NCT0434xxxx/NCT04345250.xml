      Cycling is commonly questioned whether it provides adequate mechanical strain on bone as many
      elite cyclists have been found to have a low bone mass. However, it remains unclear if this
      is due to cycling or low energy availability. In addition, acute dietary energy restriction
      has been found to be accompanied by an imbalance in bone remodelling with reduced bone
      formation. The objective of this proposal is to examine whether short-term energy restriction
      leads to changes in markers of bone formation and resorption at rest and in response to
      cycling in young adults. Specifically, the study will examine changes in circulating bone
      markers in 15 males and females (ages 18-24) both at rest and following one 45-minute
      spinning class both before and after one week of restricted energy intake. Blood will be
      drawn at rest (pre-trial, fasted), and 3 times post-trial (5 min, 1h and 24h); then analysed
      for biochemical markers of bone formation (BAP and OPG) and resorption (CTX and RANKL) to
      assess the impact of energy restriction on bone at rest and in response to exercise. This
      innovative work has potential to make significant advances in understanding tissue growth and
      development in response to exercise and malnutrition.

      Introduction: The skeletal system serves a variety of purposes such as providing structural
      support, locomotion, protection and more. In order to sustain these functions, bone strength
      must be upheld. The process of replacing older, microdamaged bone with newer, healthier bone
      is known as bone remodelling. Bone remodelling involves the balance/coupling of bone
      resorption and bone formation. Mechanical loading is the magnitude of stress placed on the
      bone that stimulates bone remodelling, which determines bone mineral density (BMD) and
      promotes bone growth (Olmedillas et al. 2011). Thus, human research on the determinants of
      bone growth and strength, is focused on two common factors, exercise and nutrition. Although
      cycling, a predominantly aerobic exercise, is exceptional for cardiovascular fitness, it is
      commonly questioned whether it provide adequate mechanical strain on bone. To date the
      literature surrounding cycling and its impact on bone is contradicting and limited.
      Inadequate energy intake may also influence BMD via reductions in bone mineral content.
      Energy restriction is known to reduce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which plays an
      important role in bone formation 5. Acute dietary energy restriction has been found to be
      accompanied by an imbalance of bone remodelling with reduced bone formation, which is
      especially dangerous in aerobic sports that expend a great amount of energy, such as cycling.
      Many professional and master cyclists are classified as osteopenic (Medelli et al. 2000).
      Specifically, female cyclists have shown significant lower values of whole-body BMD, and a
      lower bone strength, than male cyclists (Olmedillas et al. 2011). In addition, female
      cyclists are known to be energy deficient (low calorie intake) with the average energy intake
      being 85% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Therefore, it is important to
      understand whether cycling is a poor form of exercise for bone health or whether the energy
      restriction, alone or in combination with cycling, is the true underlining issue.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to examine whether short-term energy restriction
      leads to changes in markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, bone turnover at rest and in
      response to cycling in young adults. Specifically, the study will examine changes in
      circulating bone markers at rest and following one bout of low impact 45-minute spinning
      (cycling) both before and after one week of restricted energy intake.

      Methods: Fifteen healthy males and females, aged 20-25 years, will be invited to participate
      in this study, which involves one control trial and two exercise trial visits scheduled one
      week apart. Females will be on monophasic oral contraceptives, During the control trial,
      participants will be briefed on the purpose and procedures, will fill out an exercise
      screening questionnaire, and will provide 4 resting blood samples. One week later,
      participants will perform the first exercise trial of one 45 minute spin session. Following
      the first trial, the participants will go on a predetermined energy deficient diet (25% of
      their habitual diet) for one week, at the end of which they will perform the second trial
      following the same cycling protocol. Between the first and last visit the participants will
      be receiving a Fitbit to monitor their activity (steps, heart rate, physical activity
      participation) and nutritional habits in a food log. To keep the diet consistent and
      standardized, participants will also be asked to record their habitual food intake during the
      control week using the &quot;Eat This Much&quot; app, which will provide an overall portion plan and a
      25% caloric restriction measure for the intervention week. Thus, the intervention diet will
      mirror the control diet in terms of types of food consumed, with the difference being in the
      amount consumed. There will be no restriction regarding water, but drinks will be restricted
      according to the overall calorie intake plan.In both trials, blood will be drawn at rest
      (i.e., pre-trial, fasted), and 3 times post-trial (5 min, 1h and 24h). The blood will be
      centrifuged and the serum separated, aliquoted and then stored at −80 °C until analysis 8.
      The serum will be analysed for biochemical markers of bone turnover (e.g. osteocalcin,
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP]; osteoprotegerin [OPG]) and bone resorption
      (C-telopeptides of type I collagen [CTX]; receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand
      [RANKL], sclerostin) to assess the impact of energy restriction on bone at rest and in
      response to exercise. Metabolic and oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines,
      adipokines, growth factors and hormones will also be assessed to examine potential mediating
      effects.

      Impact: This innovative work has the potential to make significant advances in understanding
      the impact of energy restriction and cycling on bone health. The findings from this work will
      be translatable to understanding tissue growth and development in response exercise and
      malnutrition.

    <description>For a period of 6 days between the exercise trials (i.e., following visit 3), each participant will be put on a restricted energy restricted diet consisting of a 25% reduction in their habitual total daily calorie intake. To keep the diet consistent and standardized, participants will record their typical food intake during a control week using the &quot;Eat This Much&quot; app, which will then provide an overall portion plan and the 25% caloric restriction measure for the intervention week. Thus, the intervention diet will mirror the control diet in terms of types of food consumed, with the difference being in the amount consumed. There will be no restriction regarding water, but drinks will be restricted according to the overall calorie intake plan.</description>

    <description>A 25% reduction in total caloric intake, as calculated through the app. Therefore, during the control period, participants will input what they consume into the Eat This Much app, then the app will calculate the 25% reduction in calories to present participants with how much to consume of the same foods. By doing this their diet will not be altered in terms of macronutrients or micronutrients, but solely on calories.</description>
