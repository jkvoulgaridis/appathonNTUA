    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether or not activity restrictions after a cesarean
      section are warranted and if exercise can improve postpartum wellness. This research study is
      being done because there is no science-based evidence to support postpartum activity
      restrictions after cesarean sections.

      Participants will be randomly placed into one of the following study groups:

        -  Standard postpartum and post-operative instructions group: activity restrictions,
           including no strenuous exercise, sexual intercourse, or lifting objects greater than 25
           pounds for 6 weeks or until evaluation at the 6 week postpartum visit

        -  Study group: Structured 10 week exercise protocol consisting of core strengthening
           exercises (concentrating on the abdominal, gluteal, and pelvic areas), breathing
           exercises, and diaphragm exercises.

    <description>As measured by scores in the completion of the PROMIS29 assessment.
The PROMIS29 assessment uses a method of scoring requiring responses to each item for each participant. Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from one to five. All questions must be answered in order to produce a valid score using the scoring tables. A score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. A higher PROMIS T‐score represents more of the concept being measured. For negatively‐worded concepts like Anxiety, a T‐score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison, an Anxiety T‐score of 40 is one SD better than average. However, for positively‐worded concepts like Physical Function‐Mobility, a T‐score of 60 is one SD better than average while a T‐score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>

Re-hospitalization for wound concerns
Infection
Increased pain, abdominal/core muscle injury
Less breastmilk production (adequate-inadequate, Likert scale 1-5)

    <description>The exercise program will be designed by a physical therapist (Ms. Patricia Ladis) who specializes in postnatal rehabilitation and will be supervised by sports medicine physicians from the Hospital For Special Surgery (HSS). The structured program will include approximately 10 minutes of core muscle group exercises. They will begin this program 2 weeks after their cesarean section. The study group will perform these exercises 5 times per week.</description>
