      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Cequa treatment on the accuracy of
      pre-operative biometry and on corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs) in cataract patients
      who have signs of dry eye disease.

      Hypothesis: In patients with dry eye, defined as corneal staining and a reduced tear breakup
      time, the accuracy of pre-operative biometry and corneal surface HOAs will improve
      significantly after four weeks of Cequa treatment.

      Primary Outcome Measure: Spherical equivalent prediction error of pre-Cequa vs post-Cequa
      ocular biometry performed for cataract surgery.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      The impact of Cequa treatment on corneal higher order aberrations measured in the central 6
      mm of the cornea.

      The difference in SPEED questionnaire scores before and 4 weeks after Cequa treatment.

      The difference in corneal staining and tear breakup time (TBUT) before and after treatment
      with Cequa.

    <description>To compare the difference in Standard Patient of Eye Dryness Questionnaire (SPEED) scores before and after 4 weeks of therapy with Cequa BID among patients with significant dry eye (decreased TBUT or corneal staining) with planned cataract surgery. The SPEED questionnaire gives a score from 0-28 that is the result of 8 items that assess frequency and severity of symptoms. Speed Score Severity rating: 0-4 Mild, 5-7 Moderate, 8+ Severe.</description>

    <description>Duration of Study Treatment - 4 weeks All patients will receive cyclosporine ophthalmic solution (0.09%) BID in both eyes for 28 days, 1 drop per dose. Dosing will be BID, both eyes, assuming both eyes will eventually undergo cataract surgery. Otherwise, single eye treatment in the operative eye will be permitted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with planned cataract surgery,

          -  The presence of central or inferior corneal fluorescein staining defined by the Oxford
             Scale

          -  Reduced tear break up time (TBUT) ≤ 10 seconds.

          -  Able to comprehend and sign a statement of informed consent.

          -  Willing and able to complete all required postoperative visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular surgery (e.g., intraocular, oculoplastic, corneal or refractive surgical
             procedure) performed within the last 3 months or at any time that in the
             investigator's clinical judgment if it would interfere with the outcome measures of
             this study.

          -  Clinically significant ocular trauma.

          -  Active ocular Herpes simplex or Herpes Zoster infection

          -  Ocular inflammation (uveitis, iritis, scleritis, episcleritis, keratitis,
             conjunctivitis) at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Ocular infection (e.g., viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, protozoan or fungal infection
             or the cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, lacrimal sac or eyelids including
             hordeolum/stye).

          -  Active, systemic or local disease condition that causes clinically significant ocular
             surface irritation such that it could interfere with the study findings.

          -  Moderate to severe (Grade 2-4) allergic, vernal or giant papillary conjunctivitis.

          -  Severe (Grade 3 or 4) inflammation of the eyelid (e.g., blepharochalasis,
             staphylococcal blepharitis or seborrheic blepharitis)

          -  Eyelid abnormalities that significantly affect the lid function (e.g., entropion,
             ectropion, tumor, edema, blepharospasm, lagophthalmos, severe trichiasis, severe
             ptosis).

          -  Ocular surface abnormality that may compromise the corneal integrity (e.g., prior
             chemical burn, recurrent corneal erosion, corneal epithelial defect, Grade 3 corneal
             fluorescein staining, map dot fingerprint dystrophy, or the effect of any other
             ophthalmic medication that might in the opinion of the investigator compromise the
             ocular surface integrity).

          -  Participation in this trial in the same patient's fellow eye

          -  Patients who are under age 18, pregnant or breastfeeding, or who may become pregnant
             during participation in the study.
