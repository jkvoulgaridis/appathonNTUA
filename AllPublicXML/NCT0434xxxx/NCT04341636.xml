  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this research are to determine if vertical bitewings will be more effective and
      more comprehensive for the diagnosis of caries and the level of alveolar bone loss than the
      horizontal bitewing technique for the patients at King Abdulaziz University over the age of
      18. This is a cross sectional study. All the images in this study will be conducted at School
      of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University. Each patients will be exposed to 4 horizontal
      bitewing for posterior teeth ( standard of care ) and 4 vertical bitewing for the same area (
      experimental ). The radiographs will be processed digitally. All the x ray will be taken
      using the standard protection protocol.

      of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University. Each patients will be exposed to 4 horizontal
      bitewing for posterior teeth ( standard of care ) and 4 vertical bitewing for the same area (
      experimental ) . X ray will be taken using a film holder and a steel wire (3mm ) on the film
      holders. This steel wire will help to adjust for magnification later on. The x ray tube will
      be in the same distance (4mm from the x ray). The bitewing radiographs will be taken with
      double-packed Ekta speed Plus films on a radiograph machine operating at 70 kilovolt peak and
      8 milliampere, having 2.5 aluminium filtration and a 0.860.8 mm focal spot, according to the
      manufacturer's exposure recommendations, with the parallel technique to obtain an accurate x
      ray as much as possible . The radiographs will be processed digitally. All the x ray will be
      taken using the standard protection protocol.

If caries was detected a second 5-point confidence scale as follows: 1=caries mostly absent (&lt; 25%); 2=caries slightly presence( 25%-50%) ; 3=about half of the border are presence; 4=caries probably clear ( most boarders are presence); 5=caries definitely clear ( all borders are presence ).</description>

    <description>All of the bitewing radiographs will be evaluated by two experienced periodontist for bone loss measurements. The steel wire will be used to determine the magnification factor as explained by G Li et al. 8 The steel wire and cemento enamel junction (CEJ) - if not obscure by caries - will be used as reference points for bone loss measurements. Each tooth will be measured mesially and distally twice and all these measurements will be adjusted using the steel measurement.9 All the measurements will be conducted using IC measure INK software.</description>
