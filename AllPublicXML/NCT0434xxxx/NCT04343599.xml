    <description>The first two sessions will have as objective the correct and effective learning of the hypopressive technique. The rest of the sessions will be dedicated to the realization of an exercise protocol based on a progression of postures from standing to supine. Diaphragmatic apneas of approximately 7 seconds will be performed, alternating each apnea with three breaths.</description>
