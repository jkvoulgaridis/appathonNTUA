  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Disease (CV) including stroke is the leading cause of death in Malaysia
      Hypertension is a major contributor to this. Prevalence of hypertension in Malaysia is high
      (42%) in adults age 30 years or older. Besides the actual blood pressure (BP) level recently,
      blood pressure variability (BPV) has been recognized as an independent and strong predictor
      of CV events especially strokes. However, data on the BP variability and its relationship to
      CV events is very limited in Asia, particularly in Malaysia. Hence the investigators aim to
      study BPV and its relationship to CV events in treated hypertensive patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a cross-sectional study on patients with hypertension. The 10-year retrospective
      data on BP, treatment, biochemical changes, kidney function and CV events will be extracted
      from patient records.

      Eligible patients who have given written informed consent will be given a questionnaire
      capturing data of their socio-demographic status, weight, height and BP measured.

      Those agreeable to measure their own BP at home 3 times a day for a week will be loaned a BP
      device to measure their own BP at home. The home BP readings will be recorded onto a provided
      form and returned to the investigators.

      Data will be analysed to

        1. determine BPV of the clinic visit-to-visit BPV (long tem BPV)

        2. determine the day to day BPV (short term BPV)

        3. examine the BPV to CV events, kidney function, cognition

        4. determine the prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension

        5. determine the level of control of BP

        6. examine the relationship of ownership of home BP devices to control and satisfaction of
           treatment

    <description>BPV will be categorized as above or below the mean BPV of the entire group. The number of CV events in percentage in each group will be compared It is expected that those with higher BPV will have more CV events</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Treated hypertensives with White Coat or Masked hypertension</measure>
    <time_frame>31 Dec 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The Home and Clinic BP measurements will be used to determine the percentage of Masked and White Coat Hypertension. These two conditions are expected to be associated with more CV events than those with control of both clinic and home BP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in cognition in those with higher BP variability compared to those with lower BPV</measure>
    <time_frame>31 Dec 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score will be compared between those with higher with those with lower BPV. The minimum MoCA score is 0 and the maximum is 30. A higher MoCA score indicates better cognition. A MoCA score of 26 is considered as normal. The MoCA score is expected to be lower in those with higher BPV.</description>
