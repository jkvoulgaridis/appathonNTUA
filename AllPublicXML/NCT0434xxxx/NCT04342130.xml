      Chronic low back pain patients and healthy controls will be recruited for this study.
      Participants' brain will be scanned at baseline and then again on a different day after the
      administration of an oral dose of 30 mg morphine in an open label design. Participants will
      receive morphine 60 minutes prior to the start of the second scanning session. The brain
      scans will include structural scans, functional scans at rest and functional scans during the
      ingestion of a highly caloric drink.

    <description>Participants received a highly caloric drink and a tasteless solution during a functional MRI scanning session. General linear model was used to generate the magnitude of the fit for each type of stimuli and differences between the fits were calculated. Next within subject analysis approach was used to calculate the effect of an acute dose of morphine on brain response to the highly caloric drink between baseline and 1 hour. The measures of the fit and their differences are expressed in z-scores.</description>
