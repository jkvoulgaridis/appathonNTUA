    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      single-centre study involving 45 healthy participants. The aim is to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of Entervax, a combination vaccine against enteric fever comprising Typhi ZH9
      (hereafter ZH9) plus an engineered derivative that will provide an immune response to the key
      antigens (LPS 0:2 and H:a flagella) from S. Paratyphi A (hereafter ZH9PA). ZH9PA has not
      previously been tested in humans therefore the first two cohorts comprise a dose escalation
      of ZH9PA and the final cohort comprises a single dose level of the combination of ZH9PA and
      ZH9.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be confirmed at Screening

          1. Healthy male and female participants 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Female participant of childbearing potential willing to use 2 effective methods of
             contraception, i.e., established method of contraception + condom, if applicable
             (unless of non-childbearing potential or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant) from the first dose
             until 2 months after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP).

          3. Female participant of non-childbearing potential. For the purposes of this study, this
             is defined as the participant being amenorrhoeic for at least 12 consecutive months or
             at least 4 months post-surgical sterilisation (including bilateral fallopian tube
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy).

          4. Female participant of childbearing potential or non-childbearing potential with a
             negative pregnancy test at Screening.

          5. Female participant of post-menopausal status confirmed by demonstrating at Screening
             that the serum level of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) falls within the
             respective pathology reference range. In the event a participant's menopausal status
             has been clearly established (for example, the participant indicates she has been
             amenorrhoeic for 10 years, confirmed by medical history, etc), but serum FSH levels
             are not consistent with a postmenopausal status, determination of the participant's
             eligibility to be included in the study will be at the Investigator's discretion
             following consultation with the Sponsor.

          6. Male participant willing to use an effective method of contraception or 2 effective

             applicable (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant) from first dose
             until a stool sample tested for presence of the vaccine strains is negative.

          7. Participant with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 19 or ≤34 kg/m^2 (BMI = body weight (kg)
             / [height (m)]^2).

         12. No clinically significant history of hypersensitivity (e.g., hives/rash/swollen
             lips/difficulty with breathing) to azithromycin, ampicillin,
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin.

         13. No clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results (in the opinion of the
             investigator) for serum biochemistry, haematology and/or urine analyses within 28 days
             before receiving the first dose administration of the IMP.

         14. Participant with a negative urinary drugs of abuse (DOA) screen (including alcohol and
             cotinine) test results, determined within 28 days before the first dose administration
             of the IMP unless there is a documented medical explanation for the positive result
             other than drugs of abuse (e.g., the participant has been prescribed opioids for
             pain). (N.B.: A positive test result may be repeated at the Investigator's
             discretion).

         15. Participant with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg)) and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) test results at Screening.

         16. No clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or vital
             signs determined within 28 days before first dose of IMP.

          1. Participant continues to meet all screening inclusion criteria.

          2. Participant with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (including alcohol and
             cotinine) prior to dosing unless there is a documented medical explanation for the
             positive result other than drugs of abuse (e.g., the participant has been prescribed
             opioids for pain). (N.B.: A positive test result may be repeated at the Investigator's
             discretion).

          3. Female participant of childbearing potential or non-childbearing potential with a
             negative pregnancy test on admission.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant with any clinically significant medical (cardiovascular disease,
             pulmonary, hepatic, gallbladder or biliary tract, renal, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatological, neurological, autoimmune
             disease or current infection) or psychiatric condition (see also exclusion criterion
             number 21) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes participation in the
             study. This will include any clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry
             results and/or haematological results and/or urine analytical results.

             in the 6 months prior to study entry) cytotoxic drugs or immunosuppressive therapy
             (including systemic corticosteroids).

         19. Participant who is a current smoker (cigarettes, tobacco and/or e-cigarettes) or has
             stopped smoking in the last 3 months prior to Screening.

         20. A clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse [defined as the consumption

             months or a marketed drug clinical study within the 30 days before the first dose of
             IMP. (Washout period between studies is defined as the period of time elapsed between
             receiving the last dose of the previous study and receiving the first dose of the next
             study).

         23. Donation of 450 millilitres (mL) or more blood within the 3 months before the first
             dose of IMP.

         24. Participant who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unsuitable for participation
             in the study.

        To be re-confirmed at Day 0 / prior to each dosing visit:

          1. Development of any exclusion criteria since the Screening visit.

          2. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs since Screening, unless in the opinion
             of the Investigator and Sponsor's Responsible Physician, the medication will not
