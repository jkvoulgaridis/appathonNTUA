  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative approach adopted in a cohort of adult oncological patients undergoing major
      abdominal surgery will be described. In particular, the physician's attitude toward use of
      sCr for identification of patients at risk for PO-AKI will be described, as well as the
      patients who should be reassessed in the long term for progression toward CKD. The incidence
      and risk factors associated with PO-AKI and renal function deterioration within a year
      postoperatively will be also evaluated.
