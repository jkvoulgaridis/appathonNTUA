  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressant-like effects of sildenafil to its ability to modulate transduction pathways
      responsible for neuroplasticity. Treatment with sildenafil was shown to be PKG-dependent and
      lead to increased expression of cGMP, pCREB, BDNF and VGF in the hippocampus and prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), brain areas relevant to mood disorders pathophysiology. Sildenafil produces
      antidepressant-like effects by inhibiting oxidative stress in the hippocampus and by
      decreasing the levels of IL-1β in the hippocampus and striatum.

    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The principal measure of the outcome was the 17-items HAM-D. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-13 suggest mild depression, 14-17 moderate depression and scores over 17 are indicative of severe depression. Remission is defined as HAM-D total score ≤ 7 (primary outcome). Treatment response is defined as ≥ 50% drop in the HAM-D total score.</description>

    <description>Serum level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured at the baseline and after the treatment to evaluate the biological effects of the used medications.</description>
