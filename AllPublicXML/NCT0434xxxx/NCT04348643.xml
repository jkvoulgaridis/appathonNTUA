      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CEA-targeted CAR-T cells
      therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CEA+ Cancer,and obtain the recommended dose and
      infusion plan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CEA is a classic tumor marker, especially in more than 80% of colorectal cancer patients. In
      normal tissue cells, only a small amount of CEA is expressed in the cell membrane of the
      digestive tract cells, and the CEA is expressed toward the cell cavity under physiological
      conditions to avoid recognition by CAR-T cells targeting CEA. This is a study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of CEA-targeted CAR-T cells therapy,and obtain the recommended dose and
      infusion plan.
