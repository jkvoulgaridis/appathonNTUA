  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion
      study of TPST-1495 administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab to
      determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary anti-tumor activity in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
      Subjects with all histologic types of solid tumors are eligible for the study. However, the
      preferred tumor types for enrollment are microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC),
      adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), bladder
      cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and gastric cancer.

      study of TPST-1495 administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab to
      determine its MTD, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PD), pharmacodynamics (PK) and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Subjects with all
      histologic types of solid tumors are eligible for the study. However, the preferred tumor
      types for enrollment are microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC), adenocarcinoma of
      the lung, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), bladder cancer, triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) and gastric cancer. To be eligible, subjects must have no
      remaining standard known to confer clinical benefit. This trial is composed of dose
      escalation and dose expansion cohorts.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible:

          1. Subjects must have a histologically-confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable for which there is no remaining standard therapy known to confer clinical
             benefit. While all solid tumor types are eligible for the study, there is a preference
             to enroll patients with MSS colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
             neck, bladder cancer and triple negative breast cancer and gastric cancer. Prior anti
             PD-1 or PDL-1 is permitted provided that the subject did not discontinue prior
             therapies due to immune-related adverse events.

          2. Subjects must have a tumor that is at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is
             radiographically apparent on CT or MRI.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 at enrollment

          4. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          5. Subjects must have received their last chemotherapy, biologic therapy or
             investigational therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          6. Adequate organ and marrow function (subjects must not have received transfusions or
             growth factor support within 14 days prior to first dose of investigational product)
             as defined below:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000 mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); for subjects with
                  documented/suspected Gilbert's disease, bilirubin should be ≤ 2 × ULN.

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN; for
                  subjects with liver metastases, AST or ALT ≤ 5 × ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5×ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min for
                  subjects with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5× institutional ULN.

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to receive
        investigational product:

          1. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non
             interventional) clinical study, a specimen-collection study or the follow-up period of
             an interventional study. The use of an investigational device or agent must be stopped
             at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          2. Chronic use (i.e., daily for 7 days or more) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             or COX-2 inhibitors within 2 weeks of enrollment.

          3. Gastrointestinal ulcer or active colitis within 28 days of enrollment.

          4. New York Heart Association Classification II, III or IV.

          5. Baseline QTcF &gt; 470 milliseconds

          6. Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of
             investigational product

          7. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including inflammatory
             bowel disease (e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease), systemic lupus erythematosus,
             Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves'
             disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.)

          8. Active infection requiring therapy (including tuberculosis) or positive tests for
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody test and hepatitis C (HCV)
             ribonucleic acid (RNA) test1. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who
             have positive HCV antibody test. Patients with a negative HBsAg test and a positive
             total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening are eligible for the study.

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions
             associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations including a history
             of substance abuse that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially
             increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give
             written informed consent.

         10. Administration of the following drugs is prohibited while taking TPST 1495: glyburide,
             cefaclor, cefonicid, cefoxitin, cephradine, cidofovir, zidovudine, digoxin, docetaxel,
             paclitaxel, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin or saquinavir
