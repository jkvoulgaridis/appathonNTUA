  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. The
      investigational drug is HBM9161 injection, and the indication is MG.

      The subjects will be randomized to three dose groups (340mg, 680mg and placebo) for a 6
      weeks' double-blind treatment period followed by an open-label extension treatment period.
      The study will investigate the safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic of
      HBM9161 in patients with attack of MG in China.

               2. Childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test results at screening
                  visits, and agree to consistently use acceptable and effective contraceptive

             their heterosexual partner must take effective contraception.

          5. Positive serologic test for AChR-Ab or MUSK-Ab at the screening visit and at least 1
             of the following:

               1. History of abnormal neuromuscular transmission test demonstrated by
                  sign-fiber-electromyography or repetitive nerve stimulation OR

               2. History of positive edrophonium chloride test OR

               3. Participant has demonstrated improvement in MG signs on oral cholinesterase
                  inhibitors as assessed by the treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of rituximab, belimumab, eculizumab or any monoclonal antibody/Fc-fusion biologic
             for immunomodulation within 6 months prior to screening.

          2. Immunoglobulins given by SC, IV(IVIG), or intramuscular route, or
             plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PE) within 4 weeks before screening.

          4. Total IgG level &lt;6g/L (at screening).

          5. Participant has any laboratory abnormality (at screening) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, is clinically significant, has not resolved at baseline, and could
             jeopardize or would compromise the participant's ability to participate in this study.

          6. Have known autoimmune disease other than MG that would interfere with the course and
             conduct of the study (such as uncontrolled thyroid disease).

          7. Have an active infection, a recent serious infection (i.e., requiring injectable
             antimicrobial therapy or hospitalization) within the 8 weeks prior to screening.

             virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Participants must
             have negative test results for HBV surface antigen, HBV core antibody, HCV antibody,
             HIV 1 and 2 antibodies and a negative TB test at screening.
