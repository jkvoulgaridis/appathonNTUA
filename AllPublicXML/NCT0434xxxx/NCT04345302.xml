  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Harmful alcohol use is a leading cause of global disability and death. However increased
      detection and brief intervention capacity of more severe alcohol use disorders (AUD) has not
      been accompanied by increased availability of treatment services. Incorporating treatment for
      such disorders into primary care (PC) is of paramount importance for improving access and
      health outcomes. This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of a Brief Motivational
      Treatment (BMT) applied in primary care for treatment of these disorders.

      This trial aims to test the superiority of BMT over enhanced usual care with a reasonable
      margin, over which the BMT could be further considered for incorporation into PC in Chile.
      Its pragmatic approach ultimately aims to inform policymakers about the benefit of including
      a brief psychosocial treatment into PC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory trial aims to estimate the effectiveness of a BMT for AUD provided in PC.
      The underlying question is whether Chilean PC should incorporate this treatment among its
      regular programs based on its effectiveness.

      To answer this question, a randomised comparison between the manualized BMT and EUC will be
      undertaken. The main hypothesis is a superiority one:

      • Participants under BMT will perform better than EUC in the reduction of alcohol
      consumption.

      Also, there are ancillary questions that deserve special attention. The following hypotheses
      will help with the explanation of the results:

        -  Active BMT components (i.e., the working alliance and fidelity to the MI strategies)
           mediate the effect.

        -  Participant´s AUD severity mediates the effect.

        -  Participants under BMT will receive a higher amount of additional care (physician
           consultations, social worker consultations, participation in alcoholic anonymous, and
           others).

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a parallel-group, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial to test the superiority of a Brief Motivational Treatment over enhanced usual care. The allocation ratio is 1:1 as per a computer-generated randomisation schedule stratified by site and the baseline SDSS-DAYS score using permuted blocks of random sizes.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A research assistant blinded to the allocation of the participant will perform the follow-up assessments. Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and the therapists will know in which group they are participating; however, they will be strongly instructed to not disclose their allocation at the follow-up assessments. At trial closure, a statistician blinded to allocation will conduct the data analysis.</masking_description>

    <description>The change from baseline in the negative secondary consequences of alcohol consumption will be measured using the Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC-2R) questionnaire, and will be aggregated using means. The DrInC-2R has a score range from 0 to 150, with higher scores indicating higher consequences.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and six-months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the severity of the alcohol use disorder using the Substance Dependence Severity Scale. Means will be used to aggregate participants` DAYS, SEV, and WORST SEV scores for alcohol.
The DAYS score varies on an 8-point scale ranging from 0 (symptom did not occur) to 7 (symptom occurred every day of past 30). The SEV and WORST SEV severity variables are scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 5 (extreme), with a score of '2' indicating that the diagnostic criterion has been met. Lower scales scores represent less severe dependence, and higher scale scores reflect more severe dependence.</description>

The proportion of participants that improve their motivational stage will be used to aggregate the measurement in each group. The SOCRATES scores range within three dimensions: Recognition (7 - 35), Ambivalence (4 - 20), and Taking Steps (8 - 40), with higher scores indicating higher involvement in the dimension.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive the Brief Motivational Treatment, which is a primary care-adaptation of the Motivational Enhancement Therapy as manualized in the Project MATCH [19]. This treatment consists of four 45-minute sessions, provided by a psychologist at weeks one, two, six, and twelve. The first three sessions, occurring during the first six weeks, are more active regarding the behavioural change, while the last session functions as closure and review of the process. If a participant asks for more support, they will be able to attend up to two extra sessions before the last one.
The main adaptations are:
The translation into Chilean Spanish.
Update of Motivational Interview concepts.
Companion training material that includes a demonstrative video and practical exercises.
An adapted personalized feedback procedure.
Information on additional resources available in the primary care centre and the community.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive an educational brochure on alcohol use disorder, with self-help materials and guides on how to get additional support.
The physicians within the PC centre will also receive information on how to diagnose alcohol use disorders, prescription guides for the medications that are available for treating these disorders in the PC centre (mainly Disulfiram and any other if available), and directions on when and where to refer clients for treatment.</description>

    <description>The treatment will be delivered by general psychologists with at least three years of experience in primary care. They will receive training and then will demonstrate proficiency in a simulated client session.
During recruitment, therapy sessions will be recorded, and ten percent of them will be reviewed using a proficiency scale. Then, a feedback report will be issued and discussed with each therapist.</description>

    <description>During the trial, participants will continue to receive regular medical and social care at their health centre. These services may include prescriptions for mental health issues and alcohol (Disulfiram, anti-craving, anti-depressants, and other medications), social assistance, and the full spectrum of primary health care. Nevertheless, they will not receive other psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder in the health centre.</description>
