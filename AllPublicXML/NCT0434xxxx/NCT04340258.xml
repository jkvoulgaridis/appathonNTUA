      This study is a non-randomized, single-arm, multi-institutional phase 1b/II study including
      patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancer eligible for resection. Patients who are
      identified to be eligible for surgical resection will be screened and consented to receive
      one 200mg IV dose of pembrolizumab followed by salvage surgery. At the time of surgery, they
      will have Cesium131 seeds implanted. Two to six weeks after surgery, subjects will be started
      on 200 mg IV of pembrolizumab to be continued every 3 weeks for 6 months. The phase 1b part
      will enroll 3 patients for a safety run-in, followed by the phase 2 part if no DLTs are seen
      in these 3 patients. Phase 2 will be used to estimate the 2-year DFS in comparison to a
      benchmark selected based on a historical control. For correlative studies, archived tissue
      and surgical specimen will be evaluated by H&amp;E and IHC for immune phenotype. Blood samples
      will also be collected as shown in schema above for correlative studies (blood will be
      collected for correlatives and biomarkers before and after the first of pembrolizumab, before
      starting adjuvant pembrolizumab and at completion of 6 month course of adjuvant
      pembrolizumab). Patients will be followed approximately every 3 weeks during treatment for
      the first 6 months, then monthly for 3 months following treatment and then every 3 months
      thereafter for 24 months for disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

    <description>Cs-131 brachytherapy seed is a low-energy-gamma isotope that is contained in a titanium capsule. Dosing will be determined by a radiation oncologist study team member based on CT scan and intraoperative findings. The number of seeds and spacing will be outlined preoperatively based on the proposed square area of exposure in the resection bed. The plan is to deliver a total of 60-70Gy of radiation to the site.</description>

    <description>Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. The drug will be infused through a peripheral line or an indwelling catheter. The first dose will be given 2 weeks prior to surgery. Post-surgery, pembrolizumab will be started between 2 and 6 weeks and will continue every 3 weeks for a duration of 6 months. Study Drug may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons. The Investigator's Brochure contains specific instructions for the preparation of the standard of care pembrolizumab infusion fluid.</description>
