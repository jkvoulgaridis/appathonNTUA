    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double blinded study included 30 patients scheduled for lumbar
      herniectomy under general anesthesia. The patients were randomized to receive either
      retrolaminar block or intravenous analgesia treatment.Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was
      used to measure the pain intensity of patients in postoperative period. Postoperative
      analgesic requirements were recorded to asses effectiveness of regional anesthesia.Opiod and
      NSAİD as rescue medication were recorded postoperatively.

      This prospective, randomized, double blinded study included 30 patients scheduled for lumbar
      herniectomy under general anesthesia. The patients were randomized to receive either RLB or
      intravenous analgesia treatment. All patients were routinely monitored and their heart rate,
      blood pressure and pulse oxymetry recorded during the anesthesia. Numeric Pain Rating Scale
      (NPRS) scores evaluated at 2, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after the surgery. Opiod and NSAİD as rescue
      medication were recorded postoperatively
