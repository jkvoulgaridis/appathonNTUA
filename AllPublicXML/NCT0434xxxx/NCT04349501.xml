  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult male patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer and planning to undergo
      radiation therapy (RT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will undergo an advanced
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination called Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI-MRI) to
      evaluate whether RSI-MRI can predict treatment response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo RSI at three time points: before therapy (MRI #1), after
      neoadjuvant ADT (MRI #2), and after radiotherapy (MRI #3). Treatment response will be
      assessed primarily by absence of biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥2 ng/mL greater than nadir)
      within 3 years of completing radiotherapy. Change in RSI cellularity index from MRI #1 to MRI
      #2 will be evaluated for prediction of participants who will experience biochemical
      recurrence within 3 years, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We
      hypothesize that RSI cellularity index will be an early biomarker for treatment effectiveness
      in prostate cancer treated with ADT and radiotherapy.

    <intervention_model_description>A logistic regression model of biochemical recurrence within 3 years will be fit, using maximum likelihood, on the change in RSI cellularity index from MRI #1 to MRI #2 and relevant covariates such as demographics. Continuous variables will be splined; only main effects will be considered. The cross-validated AUC for this model will be reported with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval using Efron's bias-corrected and accelerated (bca) method. If the lower bound on the 95% confidence interval of the AUC excludes 0.55, RSI cellularity index will be declared &quot;viable&quot; for identifying participants who will recur within the three-year post treatment. If declared &quot;viable&quot;, a Cox model for predicting recurrence time will be fit, and the hazard ratios for RSI will be used to describe the adjusted associations supported by the data between RSI cellularity index and recurrence time.</intervention_model_description>
