  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the role of noradrenergic system in the non-motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In particular, researchers hope to better understand what
      role the noradrenergic system may play in the regulation of blood pressure, cognition and
      mood symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. With this information, future research
      may explore treatments that target the noradrenergic system in order to better treat the
      non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

      The experimental drug used in some of the study assessments, yohimbine hydrochloride, is not
      being tested as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease. Yohimbine hydrochloride will
      be used to manipulate the noradrenergic system during some of the assessments. By measuring
      the amounts of hormones the body produces before and after yohimbine hydrochloride
      administration, researchers can assess how well the noradrenergic system is functioning.

    <description>The first visit in the study has no interventional drug. Yohimbine (5mg) is administered orally during visit two, during a head up tilt test, to manipulate the noradrenergic system to determine the association between OH and NP symptoms in those with PD.

          9. Known ophthalmologic disease such as untreated cataract, glaucoma, optic neuritis,
             orbital trauma, or other neuroretinal disease that might impact pupillary function
