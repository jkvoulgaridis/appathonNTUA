  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitiglinide calcium hydrate (Glufast Tablets) is an insulinotropic agent of the glinide class
      with rapid onset and is chemically designated as (+)-monocalcium
      bis[(2S,3a,7a-cis)-α-benzylhexahydro-γ-oxo-2-isoindolinebutyrate] dihydrate.By transiently
      increasing insulin secretion, mitiglinide exerts a hypoglycemic effect with rapid onset and
      short duration of action.This effect results from the inhibitory effect of mitiglinide on the
      ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel current through binding to sulfonylurea receptor in
      pancreatic cells.

      In an in vitro study, it was confirmed that mitiglinide is metabolized in liver and kidney,
      and the glucuronide and hydroxyl metabolites are mainly produced by drug metabolizing
      enzyme,UGT1A9 and 1A3, and by CYP2C9, respectively.Considering that the patient population
      with T2DM to be targeted appears to have hepatic impairment and the effects of liver
      dysfunction on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mitiglinide are still unknown, this
      study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety
      of mitiglinide when administered to T2DM patients with impaired hepatic function.
