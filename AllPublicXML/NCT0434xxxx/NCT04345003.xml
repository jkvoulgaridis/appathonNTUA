  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for fibroids
      is an outpatient approach for controlling symptom with an excellent safety record. It is
      important to exclude in advance patients who would not benefit from this treatment. For that
      purpose this study assesses the influence of fibroid elasticity and diffusion on ablation
      efficiency during treatment by MR-HIFU

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-procedural predictors of treatment efficacy will be useful for excluding in advance
      patients who would not get benefit of this treatment. It seems that elastography, cellular
      density and perfusion could be considered as predictors. Fibroid elastography will be
      quantified by MRE Resoundant® system and pelvic ultrasound. Perfusion and cellular density
      will be quantified by MR diffusion.

    <description>It will be evaluated in two ways:
The first consists of a qualitative analysis taking as a reference the signal of the paravertebral muscles. Myomas will then be classified into a hypersignal, iso-signal or hyposignal group as compared to muscles (qualitative method according to the classification of Funaki).
The second will be a quantitative method. One ROI will be positioned in the myoma and a second in the paravertebral muscle and the ratio of these values will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The standard pre-therapeutic assessment includes a pelvic US to eliminate the presence of calcification of fibroids. If this absence is confirmed, the elasticity of uterine myoma (by ARFI method) will be measured.
The standard pre-therapeutic MRI performed allows to classify and measure the myoma in order to determine if it is accessible for HIFU treatment. MRI elastography sequence with the Resoundant® system will be performed during this exam.</description>
