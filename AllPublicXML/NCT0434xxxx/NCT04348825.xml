  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will apply state of the art radiology through advanced magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) techniques to investigate structural and functional brain effects of ECT.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a multi-disciplinary collaboration, imaging findings will be correlated to psychiatric
      response parameters, neuropsychological functioning as well as neurochemical and genetic
      biomarkers that can elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The aim is to document both
      treatment effects and potential harmful effects of ECT.

      Sample: n = 40 patients in a major depressive episode (bipolar and major depressive
      disorder). Two control groups with n = 15 in each group: age and gender matched healthy
      volunteers not receiving ECT and patients undergoing electrical cardioversion (ECV) for
      atrial fibrillation (AF). Observation time: six months.

        Forty patients accepted for ECT at Haukeland University Hospital will be included.

        Control groups: A group of patients undergoing Electrocardioversion (ECV) for atrial
        fibrilation (AF) (controls 1) and healthy controls undergoing the same investigations as
        the ECT patient group, but not receiving ECT or anesthesia (controls 2).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (age &gt; 18) referred to the ECT-unit and accepted for treatment because of
             moderate and severe depression,

          -  fulfilling the criteria for the following ICD-10 diagnoses: F31.3 and F31.4; F32.1 and
             F32.2 and F32.3; F33.1 and F33.2 and F33.3.

          -  symptom intensity must be verified by a score ≥ 25 on the Montgomery and Åsberg
             Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ECT treatment within the last 12 months.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Patients unable to give written informed consent (according to the responsible
             clinician or ECT responsible).

          -  Patients who cannot participate in the MRI scanning because of contraindications to
             MRI.
