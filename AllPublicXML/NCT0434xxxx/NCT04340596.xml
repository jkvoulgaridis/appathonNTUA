    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of N-803, an
      IL-15 superagonist, with or without combination broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), to
      induce HIV-1 control during analytic treatment interruption (ATI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of N-803, an IL-15
      superagonist, with or without combination broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), to induce
      HIV-1 control during analytic treatment interruption (ATI).

      Participants will be screened for eligibility and undergo leukapheresis, and a subset will
      also undergo optional rectal biopsy and/or lymph node fine needle aspirations (FNAs) (Step
      1).

      After pre-entry and determination of eligibility in Step 1, participants will be randomized
      before Step 2 entry to either the N-803 only arm (Arm A) or the N-803 with combination bNAbs
      arm (Arm B):

        -  Arm A will receive a dose of N-803, 6 mcg/kg, subcutaneously 1 week after Step 2 entry
           and then every 3 weeks for a total of eight doses (during the first 22 weeks).

        -  Arm B will receive the following (during the first 22 weeks):

             -  Combination bNAb at Step 2 entry with VRC07-523LS dosed at 20 mg/kg and 10-1074
                dosed at 30 mg/kg, intravenously;

             -  A dose of N-803, 6 mcg/kg, subcutaneously 1 week after Step 2 entry and then every
                3 weeks for a total of eight doses;

             -  A second dose of 10-1074 at week 9 of Step 2 dosed at 30 mg/kg, intravenously

      After completing randomized treatment (Step 2), participants will interrupt antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) (Step 3) and will be followed closely to monitor for indications for
      reinitiation of ART (Step 4).

      After Step 2 entry, most participants will be followed for approximately 100 weeks across the
      remaining three study steps (i.e., Steps 2, 3, and 4).

      Step 1 will last up to 90 days, Step 2 will last approximately 52 weeks (study intervention),
      Step 3 will last up to 24 weeks (ATI), and Step 4 will last 24 weeks (ART restart).
