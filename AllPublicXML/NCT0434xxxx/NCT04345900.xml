          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior
             hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,
             women who have been amenorrhoeic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,
             anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression.

        Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative urine
        pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test) documented within
        the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug.

        Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree to use two
        forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and for 3 months
        after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine
        device (IUD) plus one barrier method; (b) on stable doses of hormonal contraception for at
        least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c)
        2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and
        spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized
        partner.

        For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women:
        agreement to use two forms of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3
        months after the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or concomitant sickle cell
             disease.

          2. Received chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

             of study drug.

          4. Phase 3 only: Received 5 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic
             breast cancer (adjuvant chemotherapy will count as one line of chemotherapy, and any
             hormonal or biological, non-conjugate therapy [e.g., trastuzumab] will not count as a
             line of therapy).

          5. Current use of strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, within 3 days of the first
             administration of study drug, and 7 days after treatment with taxanes OR requires use

          6. Received an investigational agent or tumor vaccine within 2 weeks before the first
             dose of study drug; patients must have recovered from toxicity of prior treatment and
             have no &gt; Grade 1 treatment emergent AEs.

             patient has detectable Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg). Hepatitis B surface
             antibody (anti HBs) without detectable HBsAg does NOT exclude patients from the study.
             Hepatitis C infection (Hepatitis C antibody reactive) which requires treatment also
             excludes patients from the study.
