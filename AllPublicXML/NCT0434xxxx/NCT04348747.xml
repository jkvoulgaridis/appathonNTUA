  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well dendritic cell vaccines against Her2/Her3, cytokine
      modulation (CKM) regimen, and pembrolizumab work for the treatment of triple negative breast
      cancer or HER2+ breast cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastasis). Dendritic cell
      vaccines work by boosting the immune system (a system in the body that protect against
      infection) to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. CKM regimen, consisting of
      rintatolimod, interferon alpha-2b and celecoxib, attempt to direct the immune cells to the
      cancer cells and maximize the effectiveness of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is an &quot;immune
      checkpoint inhibitor&quot; which is designed to either &quot;unleash&quot; or &quot;enhance&quot; the cancer immune
      responses that already exist by either blocking inhibitory molecules&quot; or by activating
      stimulatory molecules. Giving dendritic cell vaccines, CKM regimen, and pembrolizumab may
      shrink the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. The best overall central nervous system (CNS) response as per Response Assessment in
      Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Volumetric quantification of brain metastases. II. The non-CNS (i.e. of systemic disease)
      response rate as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      III. The median CNS, non-CNS and overall progression free survival (PFS). IV. The median
      overall survival (OS). V. The safety of this regimen. VI. The proportion of patients not
      requiring retreatment for their brain metastasis at 6 months since the first dose of
      anti-HER2/3 vaccine.

      VII. Rate of failure of irradiated lesions.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate baseline and post-treatment molecular biomarkers (including PD-L1) in
      peripheral tumor tissue and peripheral blood, and correlate with treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

      TREATMENT PHASE: Patients receive anti-HER2/HER3 dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on
      days 1, 15, and 29. Patients also receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID),
      recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV on days 15-17 and
      29-31.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may also receive a booster dose of anti-HER2/HER3 dendritic cell vaccine ID,
      celecoxib PO BID, recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV
      every 3 months in the opinion of principal investigator.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant,not
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

               -  Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)

          -  WOCBP must agree to use acceptable birth control methods for the duration of the study
             and until persistence of the study drug is no longer detected in the peripheral
             blood:this may be a period of several years. Methods for acceptable birth control
             include: condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, and
             hormonal contraception; it is recommended that a combination of two methods be used.
             NOTE: If the risk of conception exists, patients must agree to use highly effective
             contraception throughout the study and for at least two years following the last study
             treatment administration

          -  Negative serum and highly sensitive urine pregnancy test(s):

             i) within 72 hours prior to study allocation; ii) following initiation of treatment,
             pregnancy testing will be performed for WOCBP and interpreted prior to every cycle of
             pembrolizumab (Initial Treatment Phase); iii) at the End of Treatment (EOT)
             Assessment; and iv) whenever pregnancy is otherwise suspected. Note: In the event that
             72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study
             treatment, another pregnancy test must be performed and must be negative in order for
             subject to start receiving study medication.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer
             (TNBC) (estrogen receptor [ER] =&lt; 1%, progesterone receptor [PR] =&lt; 1% HER2 negative)

               -  HER2 testing should be performed on the invasive component using a validated
                  immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) assay

               -  IHC staining is defined as:

                    -  IHC 3+ if there is complete and intense circumferential membrane staining
                       within &gt; 10 percent of tumor cells. All IHC 3+ tumors are considered HER2
                       positive

                    -  IHC 2+ if there is incomplete and/or weak/moderate, circumferential membrane
                       staining within &gt; 10 percent of tumor cells. All IHC 2+ tumors are reported
                       as HER2 equivocal

                    -  IHC 1+ if there is faint or barely perceptible, incomplete membrane staining
                       within &gt; 10 percent of tumor cells. All IHC 1+ tumors are reported as HER2
                       negative

                    -  IHC 0 if (1) no staining is observed, or (2) there is faint or barely
                       perceptible, incomplete membrane staining within &lt; 10 percent of tumor
                       cells. All IHC 0 tumors are reported as HER2 negative

                    -  Equivocal HER2 testing should trigger reflex HER2 testing using ISH on the
                       same specimen or a new test (using a different specimen with either IHC or
                       ISH)

               -  Results from ISH are defined as the ratio of gene amplification of HER2 and the
                  chromosome 17 enumeration probe (CEP17). Results are reported as:

                    -  ISH positive if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &gt;= 2.0, and the HER2 copy number
                       signals/cell is &gt;= 4

                    -  Definitive diagnosis will be rendered pending further workup in the
                       following instances:

                         -  If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &gt;= 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number is &lt;
                            4.0 signals/cell - negative if confirmed on retesting

                         -  If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and the average HER2 copy number is &gt;=
                            6.0 signals/cell positive - if confirmed on retesting

                         -  If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number is
                            between &gt;= 4.0 and &lt; 6.0 signals/cell negative - if confirmed on
                            retesting

                    -  ISH negative if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and average HER2 copy number
                       is &lt; 4.0 signals/cell

          -  Measurable brain disease as per RANO-BM criteria. Have at least one untreated brain
             metastasis approved by a research team that meets the following size requirements:

               -  &gt;= 0.5 cm AND twice the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice thickness; and

               -  &lt; 3.0 cm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at the time of
                  enrollment (i.e. target lesion[s])

               -  Of note, lesions &gt;= 0.5 cm and &lt; 3 cm may be determined ineligible by the
                  research team because of location or symptoms. An untreated brain metastasis is
                  defined as a lesion not present at the time of whole brain radiation therapy or
                  not included in a stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 0.5 cm of a treated
                  lesion), or any lesion that is new or unequivocally progressing since prior
                  radiation therapy or prior surgery. If &gt;= 0.5 cm is used, then the MRI imaging
                  should have a 1.5 mm slice thickness or less must be used.

          -  Any brain metastasis &gt;= 3.0 cm or causing symptoms must have previously been treated
             with local therapy (i.e. radiation or surgical resection, as clinically appropriate)
             prior to study enrollment. Any lesion present at the time of whole brain radiation
             therapy (WBRT) or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 5 mm of
             the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new or documented to
             have progressed since treatment

          -  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and/or prior radiotherapy is permitted &gt;=2 weeks prior
             to initial Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccine dose (leaving one or more lesions which are not
             radiated and will be used as target lesions) but a follow up brain MRI should be
             obtained prior to dendritic cell (DC) vaccine to determine stability of the lesions.
             An interval of at least 4 weeks after the end of whole brain radiation or for any
             surgical resection of brain lesions is permitted after the last cytotoxic, targeted,
             immunotherapeutic or investigational agent is permitted (prior to the start of DC
             vaccine)

               -  Previous whole brain radiation is allowed if patient has been diagnosed with
                  recurrent, progressive brain metastasis. Previously irradiated lesions would be
                  considered non-target lesions

               -  Previously resected lesions or those treated with SRS would be considered
                  nontarget lesions. There is no limitation on prior local therapies to other
                  lesions.

          -  If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL or &gt;= 5.6 mmol/L

          -  Leukocytes: &gt;= 3 x 10^9/L

          -  Absolute neutrophil count: &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelets: &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Total bilirubin: =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for
             participants with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]):
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (=&lt; 5 x ULN for participants with liver
             metastases)

          -  Creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (Glomerular Filtration Rate
