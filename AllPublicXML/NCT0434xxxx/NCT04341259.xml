    <textblock>
      A Phase I, Open-Label study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability
      of ipatasertib in Chinese participants. Approximately 20 Chinese participants with locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has
      proven ineffective will be enrolled to provide sufficient data. Participants will receive a
      400-mg ipatasertib dose (two 200-mg tablets) daily orally (PO). Participants deriving
      clinical benefit may be offered continued treatment with ipatasertib until disease
      progression, at the discretion of the investigator (as assessed by the investigator) or until
      the study is terminated by the Sponsor.
