  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the investigator's observational, nonrandomized, open label study is to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal cells (ADSC)
      transplantation into the individuals with faiure in reconstruction of peripheral nerves. ADSC
      will be used during a last-chance surgery (neurolysis, nerve release) on a previously
      reconstructed nerve. All enrolled patients will have a documented at least 2-years clinical
      and electrophisiological observation. Each patient will recive once 10 microinjections of
      ADSC along the injured nerve, directly after nerve neurolysis. Safety, adverse events and
      efficacy will be confirmed by clinical, elecrophisiological (EMG, Sensory Thyreshold) and
      DASH survey.

      The aim of the study will be an evaluation of undifferentiated Adipose-Derived Stromal/Stem
      Cells (ADSC) usage during a last-chance surgery (neurolysis, nerve release) on a previously
      reconstructed nerve. Patients who experienced failure of nerve reconstruction will be
      included in the study. During the revisional surgery, nerve fascicles will be released, and
      ADSCs will be isolated from harvested fat with enzymatic method in a standarized conditions.
      Cells will be administered through microinjections along the fascicles and around the
      adjacent tissues after external neurolysis. The follow-up will be continued at least 36
      months.

    <description>The treated nerve will be identified and released. Scar tissue will be removed, and nerve fibers will be exposed. Prepared solutions of ADSC will be administered via microinjection with a 30-G needle along the released nerve fascicles, above and below the reconstructed area and around the adjacent tissue, which stayed in contact with the nerves.</description>
