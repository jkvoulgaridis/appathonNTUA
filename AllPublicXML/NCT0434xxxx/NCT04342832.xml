    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) can cause each other and sustain each other.
      Combined, the two diseases negatively influence each other's prognosis and lead to higher
      mortality. Studies in HF patients in which the AF burden is reduced by AF ablation show
      promising results toward improved prognosis, but so far only one randomized trial is
      conducted that focused on major clinical endpoints. As the selected patients in this trial
      were not representative for the entire population and its ablation method varied from patient
      to patient, it is the aim of the present study to confirm that early invasive therapy
      consisting of a strict pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) protocol using cryoballoon therapy has
      positive effects on hard clinical endpoints in a wider variety of patients in the HF
      population.

      Furthermore, there are no studies which compare cost-effectiveness of an early invasive
      strategy in this patient category. The investigators expect that avoided hospitalizations and
      healthcare resource utilizations lead to lower costs in the AF ablation group, despite
      initial higher costs of the procedure.

      Objective:

      To compare outcome and cost-effectiveness of early AF ablation by PVI using cryoballoon
      therapy with standard (medical) therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection
      fraction.

      Study design:

      Multicenter, randomized, open label clinical trial.

      Study population:

      Symptomatic adult patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (&lt;40%) and
      paroxysmal or persistent AF.

      Intervention:

      AF ablation (PVI) using cryoballoon therapy.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary endpoint is a combined endpoint of all‐cause mortality, unplanned cardiovascular
      hospitalization, and stroke (time‐to‐event analysis).

      Secondary endpoints of the trial are:

        -  A combined endpoint of mortality, number of unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations,
           and stroke (recurrent-event analysis);

        -  A hierarchical endpoint of mortality, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations, stroke,
           and HF complaints;

        -  Cost-effectiveness. Key exploratory endpoints include individual components of the
           combined endpoints, days alive out of the hospital, hospitalizations for heart failure,
           recurrence of atrial arrhythmia, and quality of life.

    <description>If a patient is randomized to early invasive treatment, the ablation is performed within 3 months by an experienced cardiac electrophysiologist using CE-certified equipment. Via the femoral vein a guiding catheter is advanced through the inferior vena cava to the right atrium and into the left atrium via transseptal puncture. Then, the cryoballoon is advanced, inflated, and placed against one of the four PVs. PV occlusion is assessed by selective contrast injection. When adequate PV antral seal is confirmed, ablation of the tissue in contact with the balloon is performed using pressurized liquid nitrous oxide. The cold inflated balloon thus creates circular lesions around the PV. The balloon and tissue interface are then allowed to reach normal temperatures. Depending on local practice, the freeze-thaw cycle may be repeated twice. Electrical isolation is assessed and when it is confirmed, the next PV is treated in the same way. The procedure ends when all PV's are isolated.</description>
