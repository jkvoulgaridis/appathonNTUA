    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Jinshuibao for patients with CKD due to glomerulonephritis, with a planned
      follow-up of 48 weeks.

      Previous studies have shown that cordyceps sinensis can act on several immune response
      pathways. Jinshuibao capsule, which is composed of fermented cordyceps sinensis powder (Cs-4)
      , has shown therapeutic effects in chronic kidney disease (CKD) according to small sample
      exploratory studies. Here, we conduct a prospective, double-blind randomized controlled study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of Jinshuibao for patients with CKD due to
      glomerulonephritis.
