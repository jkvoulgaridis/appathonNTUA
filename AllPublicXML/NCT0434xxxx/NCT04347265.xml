  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our daily clinical practice, one of the most frequent reasons for consultation
      physiotherapists is low back pain (LBP). Regardless of the origin of the problem, the
      approach from physiotherapy contemplates the reduction of pain through different procedures,
      including neuromodulation.

      In the field of Physiotherapy, ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (PNM) is
      defined as the application through a needle with ultrasound guidance of an electrical current
      at low or medium frequency, seeking a sensitive and / or motor response of a peripheral nerve
      in some point of its trajectory, or of a muscle in a motor point, with a therapeutic
      objective. The objective of this study is to analyze that the effect of PNM on the sciatic
      nerve produces statistically significant changes in pain, joint range and functionality in
      patients with chronic LBP. Thirty subjects will be recruited, which will be divided into 3
      groups: group 1 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve in the gluteus region;
      group 2 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve in the middle of the thigh; and
      group 3 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve before popliteus region. The PNM
      intervention with NMP will consist in the single application of an asymmetric rectangular
      biphasic current (250 microseconds, 3 Hz) during 90 seconds

    <description>Participants received the percutaneous electrical stimulation intervention. Specifically, this consisted of the application of a square wave biphasic electrical current, with 3 Hz frequency and a 250Âµs pulse width, at the maximal tolerable intensity, to cause an tolerable muscle contraction. The application was 10 stimulations of 10 seconds, with 10 seconds at rest between stimulations. A trained physiotherapist performed the PNM intervention.</description>
