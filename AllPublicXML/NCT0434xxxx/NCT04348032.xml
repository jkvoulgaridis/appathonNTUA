  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological malignancy. Despite initial
      therapeutic response, the majority of advanced-stage patients relapse and eventually succumb
      to chemoresistant disease. The prognosis of patients with platinum-resistant or refractory
      ovarian cancer was very poor, with the response rate of 20%~25% after chemotherapy. The
      purpose of treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer is mainly to improve the quality of life of
      patients and prolong survival. Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis.And
      VEGF/VEGF receptor(VEGFR) signaling pathway is the most promising angiogenic target due to
      its key roles in angiogenesis and tumor growth.This study sought to assess the efficacy and
      safety of the combination therapy of apatinib and PLD, clarifying whether combination therapy
      could improve the outcomes of patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.

      This study is a randomized, parallel-controlled, multicenter clinical study. We recruit
      patients over the age of 18 years with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. patients
      who meet the criteria for enrollment are randomly divided into two groups, including
      experiment group and control group. This study will be divided into three stages: 1. Baseline
      period (within 21 days before the start of treatment): Patients will complete screening tests
      during the baseline period to assess whether they meet the selection criteria. 2. Treatment
      period (from the first administration to the completion of the last treatment cycle). The
      tumor will be evaluated every 8 weeks during this period. If the treatment is effective, the
      chemotherapy does not exceed 6 cycles，then experiment group receives oral apatinib
      maintenance therapy until the disease progresses or toxicity could not be tolerated. Control
      group is followed up. 3. Follow-up period. After the end of chemotherapy, the survival status
      and follow-up anti-tumor therapy are collected by telephone or research centers visit every 3
      months until death or loss of follow-up.The primary endpoint is the progression-free survival
      time(PFS) of patients and is judged according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors, version 1.1. Adverse events are classified and recorded according to the National
      Cancer Institute's Standard of Common terms for adverse reactions (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0.

    <description>Patients receive PLD and apatinib at the same time. The dose of intravenous chemotherapy drug is calculated according to the body surface area, and the dose of oral drug apatinib is 250mg qd. Dose suspension and dose reduction are allowed only when patients have serious adverse reactions. The intravenous chemotherapy drug PLD dose is only allowed to be down-regulated twice (one time is to reduce the standard dose by 25%), and the oral drug apatinib dose is only allowed to be reduced once (250mg gravity QD changed to 250mg gravity Qod). Otherwise the patients will drop out of the study.</description>
