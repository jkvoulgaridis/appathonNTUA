  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, First-in-Human, single ascending-dose study. Approximately
      40 healthy adult male subjects will be given a single capsule of MYMD1 to determine its
      safety, how well it is tolerated, how the body acts on the experimental drug, and how the
      experimental drug acts on the body. This will be based on blood and urine sample analysis and
      other physical measurements.

    <textblock>
      A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, single ascending-dose
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single oral dose capsules
      of MYMD1 in healthy male adult subjects. Each subject will participate in the study for
      approximately 7 weeks, including a Screening period of up to 30 days, a confinement period of
      4 days, and a follow-up period of approximately 2 weeks. In each cohort, 8 subjects will be
      administered a single dose of either MYMD1 (N=6 in each cohort) or Placebo (N=2 in each
      cohort), under fasted conditions, and each subject will participate in only 1 of the 5
      cohorts during the study. Anticipated dosing levels will be 5mg (Cohort 1), 10mg (Cohort 2),
      15mg (Cohort 3), 20mg (Cohort 4), and 25mg (Cohort 5). Sentinel dosing will be used to
      initiate each cohort, and the first 2 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either MYMD1
      or Placebo. The remaining subjects will be dosed 5:1 to receive either MYMD1 or Placebo,
      respectively.
