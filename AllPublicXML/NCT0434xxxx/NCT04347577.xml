  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As an important micro-ecological factor in human body, intestinal flora is closely related to
      the occurrence and development of major depressive disorder. The purpose of our study is to
      investigate a microbiome probe of depression. This study is a 6-months open trial that will
      enroll approximately 30 patients in major depressive disorders and 10 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls. We will comparing gut bacteria community structures of pre- treatment,
      those of 1 month and 6 months after treatment to remission. With the microbiome change in a
      preliminary analysis of pre-and post-treatment, we will reveal the diversity before and after
      the depression treatment.

      Participants (30 patients and 10 controls) will be recruited in the clinical psychological
      department of Beijing Chaoyang hospital. Patients with first-episode major depressive
      disorder confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (Chinese mini version) and assessment
      of symptom severity (Hamilton Depression Scale-17, HAMD-17) will be enrolled in a six-month
      open study. Healthy controls matched for age, sex and body-mass index (BMI) will have only
      baseline stool and electroencephalography (EEG) collections. We then will make an assessment
      of HAMD-17, patient-reported outcomes, and EEGs identified at the pre-treatment and those
      same parameters at the 1- to 6-month point. Treatment response (50% reduction in HAMD-17),
      treatment remission (HAMD-17&lt;7, at least 3 weeks) will be analyzed with change in microbiome,
      inflammation markers and EEG.

      We will analyze the differences in the intestinal flora community structure and diversity of
      patients and controls in order to obtain information on key different bacteria. We will
      conduct the correlation between each genus of bacteria in the intestinal flora and the total
      score of HAMD-17 in order to reveal the dynamic succession change of the intestinal flora
      with the disease state of major depressive disorder. The analysis with multiple testing
      corrections will be analyzed between depressive severity, EEG and gut microbiome composition.

      The results of this study will provide the objective and direct biomarkers for major
      depressive disorder to achieve remission. This study will bring an important scientific basis
      to further optimizing treatment methods and improvie clinical effect.
