      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of a 2-session intervention to reduce
      nightmares among Veterans admitted VA mental health residential rehabilitation treatment
      programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances and suicide are highly prevalent among Veterans and recent research also
      suggests high comorbid rates of sleep and suicide in Veterans discharged from VA mental
      health residential rehabilitation treatment programs (MHRRTP; domiciliaries). Nightmares are
      a frequent concern identified by MHRRTP patients and are a modifiable risk factor for suicide
      risk. Little is known, however, about the treatment of nightmares and subsequent impact in
      this setting. The primary aims of the present project are to investigate the efficacy and
      acceptability of delivering a 2-session intervention to reduce nightmares among Veterans
      admitted to a MHRRTP. This study will examine this intervention's impact on reducing
      nightmare distress and nightmare frequency, as well as assess treatment acceptability.
      Changes in suicide risk following intervention will also be explored. This research will be
      conducted within the Canandaigua and Bath VA domiciliary programs which currently accommodate
      ~150-175 Veterans. The study will be a randomized control trial with a hybrid design that
      uses stratification based on prescription use and randomly assigns individuals (N = 48) to
      either the treatment group or treatment as usual group (TAU). Veterans referred for the
      protocol will be screened for eligibility and then if appropriate, scheduled for a baseline
      evaluation, randomized to either the treatment group or TAU group, seen for two intervention
      sessions one week apart, and then be followed up with 4- and 8-weeks post initial treatment
      via telephone. This research has potential to highlight valuable targets for cross-cutting
      treatment in a rehabilitation setting that can be delivered in civilian and Veteran samples.

    <description>The brief two-session, behaviorally-based imagery rehearsal intervention is based on components from previous group and individual formats that have been published, but will be presented in an abbreviated manner. In the first session, Veterans will be presented with psychoeducation about dreaming, basics of sleep hygiene and stimulus control techniques, how to change negative dreams from a &quot;learned habit&quot; perspective, re-scripting, and how to rehearse new dream imagery. They will then be asked to complete in-session practice of imagery rehearsal with the new imagery developed. Veteran will be instructed in practice post-session.</description>
