  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radio-guided technique offers both help with in-vivo identification and ex-vivo
      confirmation of parathyroid adenoma. In-vivo accuracy is most important but its results are
      not satisfactory. The aim of this study was to evaluate if there is a beneficial effect of
      individualized timing of surgery using preoperative multi-phase 99mTc-MIBI single-photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT on in-vivo characteristics of minimally invasive
      radio-guided parathyroidectomy.

      Despite the relatively accurate preoperative topographic information, minimally invasive
      parathyroid surgery can still be very challenging, especially in the case of small adenoma in
      ectopic localization. Radioguided technique offers both help with in-vivo identification and
      ex-vivo confirmation of adenoma. Excellent ex-vivo radio guidance results are referred. But,
      in-vivo accuracy is most important but its results are not satisfactory. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate if there is a beneficial effect of individualized timing of surgery
      using preoperative multi-phase 99mTc-MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT)/CT on in-vivo characteristics of minimally invasive radio-guided parathyroidectomy.
