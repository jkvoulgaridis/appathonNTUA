    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site open-label randomized comparative effectiveness trial of a 28-day
      formulation of extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) versus treatment as usual (TAU) for
      hospitalized patients with a moderate or severe opioid use disorder (OUD) seen by an
      addiction consultation service (ACS) and agreeing to initiate a medication for OUD (MOUD).
      Participants will be randomly assigned to XR-BUP or TAU to be received within 72 hours of
      anticipated hospital discharge. Follow up will occur at approximately 34, 90, and 180 days
      following hospital discharge.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomize approximately 314 hospitalized men and women ages 18 years and older
      with opioid use disorder (OUD) moderate or severe and who have not been taking prescribed
      medication for OUD (MOUD) for 14 days or more prior to hospitalization. Eligibility will be
      determined over one or more assessments during the index hospitalization. Once eligibility
      has been determined, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a single injection of
      extended-release buprenorphine or TAU, which will include methadone, sublingual
      buprenorphine, or naltrexone. Connection to OUD care and ongoing MOUD following
      hospitalization will be per community standard. Participants will be assessed for engagement
      in OUD treatment by the presence of a legitimately prescribed MOUD on day 34 following
      hospital discharge. Further outcomes will be assessed at 90 and 180 days following hospital
      discharge.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-site open-label randomized comparative effectiveness trial of a 28-day formulation of XR-BUP versus TAU for hospitalized patients with OUD agreeing to MOUD. Approximately 4-5 sites (hospitals) with existing ACSs experienced in hospital-initiated MOUD will be selected. Identification of patients with OUD will occur as per each site's local practice. Approximately 314 hospitalized patients with OUD who were not receiving prescribed MOUD for at least 14 days prior to hospitalization and are willing to start MOUD including buprenorphine will be randomized 1:1 to two different strategies. After baseline assessments are performed, eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to XR-BUP or TAU</intervention_model_description>

                  complex medical detoxification which cannot be completed prior to randomization.

          3. Taking a long-acting opioid other than buprenorphine (e.g., methadone,
             extended-release oxycodone, extended-release morphine) in the three consecutive days

             however, patients may have received MOUD for withdrawal management during or prior to
             hospitalization at the time of enrollment.

          8. Are currently in jail, prison or other overnight facility as required by court of law
             and/or is considered a prisoner under local law or is under current terms of civil
