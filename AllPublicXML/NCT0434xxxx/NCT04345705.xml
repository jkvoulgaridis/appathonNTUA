      The purpose of this study is to offer a novel cancer vaccine called poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®) for
      subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma by directly injecting the vaccine into the
      tumor.

      This trial will enroll a maximum of 18 patients with biopsy proven malignant pleural
      mesothelioma who are surgically resectable. Subjects will undergo core biopsies of their
      mesothelioma followed by direct injection of Poly ICLC, a TLR3 agonist which has been shown
      to have biological and immunological effects. Within two to three weeks following the
      injection, the patients will undergo a pleurectomy/decortication or EPP, as is standard of
      care. Tissue resected at that time will be compared to tissue obtained at biopsy prior to the
      injection of the immunological agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of intratumoral Poly-ICLC, a TLR3 agonist modulating the tumor
      microenvironment (TME), in subjects with potentially resectable, malignant pleural
      mesothelioma (MPM). Patients will be eligible for the study if they have had a CT and/or PET
      CT imaging suggestive of MPM, pathologically confirmed MPM and are surgically operable. If
      the patient is deemed to be a good candidate, he or she will be consented by the surgeon or
      the collaborating medical oncologist. Subjects who consent will go on to receive a core
      needle biopsy and fine needle aspiration (FNA) by an interventional radiologist under CT
      guidance. FNA and up to four core biopsy samples will be obtained from the tumor lesion.
      Poly-ICLC will be delivered to the interventional suite prior to the biopsy performed.
      Pathology will be confirmed either by surgical biopsy or interventional radiology guided
      biopsy prior to core biopsy retrieval. Patients will receive up to 4 intra-tumoral (IT)
      injections of Poly-ICLC of 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0mg (0.5ml) in a dose escalation design. The
      injection sites will be labeled on a diagram by the interventional radiologist to communicate
      the location to the thoracic surgeon.

      Post injection of the Poly-ICLC, the patient will be monitored in the IR suite for any
      adverse events for at least two hours which is current standard of care to assess for
      pneumothorax. A study nurse will measure the subject's vital signs including pulse oximetry
      and will assess the injection site for two thirty minute intervals and again at two hours.
      Additional laboratory tests may be performed at the discretion of the study physician if
      signs and symptoms of an adverse event become apparent. A chest radiograph will also be
      obtained at two hours post procedure as is current standard of care post pleural biopsy. In
      the absence of adverse events subjects will be allowed to go home two hours after injection
      Post biopsy, the patient will be seen again by the thoracic surgeon who will consent the
      patient for surgery and institute the appropriate workup as per the standard of care.
      Patients will have preoperative tests that may include pulmonary function test,
      echocardiogram, and PET-CT but these will be left to the discretion of the treating thoracic
      surgeon. Up to 21 days post biopsy/Poly-ICLC injection (per the standard of care); the
      patient will undergo surgical resection of the lesion. Both biopsy specimen and surgically
      resected tissue will be stored in the department of pathology per current guidelines. In
      addition, tissue and blood will be procured for research purposes and processed in the Sinai
      Immunotherapy Core lab. The pre-IT biopsy and the surgically resected tissue, along with
      peripheral blood and plasma specimens, will then be compared to evaluate immunological target
      alterations after drug exposure with Poly-ICLC. Postoperative care and follow up will be
      performed per the standard of care from the treating surgeon. Radiation and chemotherapy will
      be given postoperatively at the discretion of the treating radiation and medical oncologists
      if deemed necessary.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1: Dose Escalation Study
This protocol consists of a phase I study to determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral (IT) Polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (Poly-ICLC, Hiltonol®) prior to surgical resection for malignant pleural mesothelioma. It will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this schedule and describe the toxicities by frequency and by grade.
The proposed doses of intratumoral (IT) Polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid are 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg.
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any of the following AEs:
grade &gt; 2 pneumonitis
grade &gt; 3 fever
grade &gt; 3 fatigue
grade &gt; 3 lung infection
grade ≥ 3 hypersensitivity reaction
Any AE preventing a patient from proceeding with surgery
grade ≥ 3 weakness
grade ≥ 3 abdominal pain
grade ≥ 3 hepatobiliary disorder</intervention_model_description>
