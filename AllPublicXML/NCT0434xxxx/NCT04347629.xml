  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to reduce the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      and its consequences for an aging U.S. population. To accomplish this, the investigators
      propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of an advance care planning (ACP) video
      intervention (vs. usual care) among older patients with CKD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The video intervention consists of a video decision aid along with a video declaration
      (ViDec), which is recorded by the patient. The video decision aid explores ACP options for
      medical care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and reviews hemodialysis, peritoneal
      dialysis, as well as medical management without dialysis; it also reviews cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR). Patients will also audio- or video-record their preferences using a
      tablet. The video will be shared with their nephrologist. The patient will have a copy of the
      video to take with them and share with their loved ones.

      Patients will answer survey questions about their preferences, knowledge, decisional
      conflict, and ACP engagement. They will be surveyed every two months for one year or death
      (if they die before one year).

      Potential participants will be recruited from 10 nephrology clinics: Massachusetts General
      Hospital (n=75), Brigham and Women's Hospital (n=75), University of Pittsburgh (n=75),
      University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research,
      University of Washington, Renal &amp; Transplant Associates of New England, University of New
      Mexico and Boston Medical Center.

    <measure>Change in Kidney Disease (KD) Specific Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>KD-QOL is a validated instrument to assess QOL that includes 36 questions with response options in likert scale format. The outcome measure is the difference in averaged scores between baseline and 12 months; It is calculated as (Score at visit 2 - Score at visit 1).
QOL is assessed by three components; physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score. Physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score are averaged scores of sub-scales. The range of each score and each sub-scale are 0 - 100, and higher values indicate better QOL status.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed using a validated instrument EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) which has two components. There is a descriptive system with 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. the other component is a visual analogue scale (VAS) that records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>
