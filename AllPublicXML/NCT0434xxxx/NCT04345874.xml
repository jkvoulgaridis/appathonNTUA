  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a nutrition technical assistance training program for
      family child care home providers on the food they serve young children in their care and the
      food environment in their home. Half the providers will be assigned to the nutrition program
      and the other half will receive a comparison on environmental health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early care and education (ECE) providers play a vital role in ensuring that young children
      have access to nutritious foods. Over 25% of children in ECE (1.2 million children) attend
      Family Child Care Homes (FCCH). Improvements in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)
      may introduce new barriers for FCCH, which have limited meal preparation capacity. Limited
      research has examined foods served by FCCH providers, and no group randomized trials have
      been conducted using a Community-Based Participatory approach in FCCH and including an
      evaluation of intervention costs.

      Goals: 1. Determine the effectiveness of a statewide community-based Nutrition Technical
      Assistance Intervention to enhance meeting CACFP best-practices.

      Methods: Conduct a cross-sectional assessment of a random sample of FCCH providers' (n=60)
      menus and meals served. Foods will be evaluated against the CACFP requirements and
      best-practices. Trained Extension Educators will implement both interventions (n=30
      intervention, n=30 comparison) in six selected counties and selected surrounding rural
      counties, reaching underserved rural and low-income populations. The intervention is based on
      theoretical foundations and formative interviews, and will consist of two 60-90-minute visits
      to the FCCH and one group class lasting approximately 3 hours.

    <description>Participating family child care home providers in six selected counties and selected surrounding rural counties will be randomized to either the Nutrition Intervention (n=30), or an environmental health comparison group (n=30) that will receive an Integrated Pest Management and Green Cleaning intervention with the same format and visit frequency. Briefly, the Nutrition Technical Assistance Intervention and comparison group will consist of three encounters with our intervention team: two home-based, 90-minute visits scheduled at the convenience of the family child care home provider and a 3-hour group class session that will be conducted on a weekend. Total contact time with intervention staff will be 6 hours. All participants will receive a toolkit. Providers will complete either intervention over a period of three months.</description>
