      Liver cirrhosis is a global health problem which could be associated with several
      neurological manifestations. The associated peripheral neuropathy could be assessed by
      conventional nerve conduction studies.

      Objective: The study aims at early detection of peripheral neuropathy among patients of liver
      cirrhosis by conventional nerve conduction studies and quantitative EMG methods. In addition,
      the study aims at finding out correlation between peripheral neuropathy and severity of the
      liver cirrhosis.

      Methods: This a cross-sectional study conducted on fifty-six liver cirrhotic patients, that
      had been recruited from the Endemic medicine department/outpatient clinics and their
      age-gender matched sixty-one healthy controls. The recruited patients were clinically
      assessed .Both conventional nerve conduction studies and quantitative EMG techniques in the
      form of MUNE calculation, using modified spike -triggered technique and IPA ratio evaluation
      were performed for the allocated cirrhotic patients.

    <description>Using nerve conduction studies of the: left ulnar,left posterior tibial and right deep peroneal motor nerves;assess their distal latency (measured in milliseconds) ,amplitude (measured in millivolts) and conduction velocities (measured in m/s).In addition , to sensory studies of the left ulnar and right sural sensory nerves; assessment of peak latency (measured in milliseconds) , amplitude (measured in microvolts) and their conduction velocities(measured in m/s) .
Compare the values with our normative values.
Detect evidence of peripheral neuropathy ( increased in distal latency above the upper limit of its normal value, decreased conduction velocity below the lower limit of its normal value and decreased amplitude below lower limit of its normal value).
A minimum of three variables in two or more nerves are required to diagnose polyneuropathy as referenced by (Meulstee &amp; Van Der Meche , 1995).</description>

Comparing between patients with evidence of peripheral neuropathy (as detected by nerve conduction studies) and those without evidence of peripheral neuropathy versus the severity of their liver disease ( as assessed by Child-Pugh class) using Mann Whitney U test; to find out if their is statistical difference between them or not; denoting the presence/absence of correlation between peripheral neuropathy and the severity of the liver disease.</description>

    <description>Comparing between liver cirrhotic patients who reported fatigue(as part of their neurological symptoms) versus those who didn't report fatigue, regarding their MUNE values; using Mann Whitney U test.
If there is statistical difference between them; there would be correlation between loss of motor units and fatigue reported by the patients(this assumption was based on (Heckman &amp; Enoka, 2012) &amp;(Mota et al., 2020) conclusions that there is positive correlation between fatigability and loss of motor units.</description>
