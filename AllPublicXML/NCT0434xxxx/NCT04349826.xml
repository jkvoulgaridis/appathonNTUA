  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever affects more than 11 million children and adults
      globally each year including 7 million in South Asia. Up to 1% of patients who get typhoid
      may die of the disease and, in those that survive, a prolonged period of ill health and
      catastrophic financial cost to the family may follow. In the last 20 years, treatment of
      typhoid fever with a 7-day course of a single oral antimicrobial, such as ciprofloxacin,
      cefixime or azithromycin, given in an out-patient setting has led to patient recovery in 4 to
      6 days without the need for expensive hospitalization. Increasing antimicrobial resistance in
      Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, threatens the effectiveness of these treatments and increases
      the risk of prolonged illness and severe disease. The recent emergence of a particularly
      resistant typhoid strain in Pakistan, and subsequent international spread, adds urgency to
      this problem and Salmonella is now listed as a high (Priority 2) pathogen by world health
      organisation.

      Treatment with combinations of antimicrobials may be more effective for treating typhoid
      fever and mitigate the problems of resistance. This suggestion is based on expert opinion but
      not backed up by good quality evidence. The ACT-South Asia study aims to compare a
      combination of azithromycin and cefixime with azithromycin alone in the outpatient treatment
      of clinically suspected and confirmed uncomplicated typhoid fever. The total recruitment will
      be 1500 patients across sites in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. A placebo (sugar
      pill) will be used instead of cefixime in the single drug arm so that neither the patient nor
      the study team know which patient is receiving which treatment.Investigators will assess
      whether treatment outcomes are better with the combination after one week of treatment and at
      one and three month follow-up. Both antimicrobials are widely used and have excellent safety
      profiles. If the combination treatment is better than the single antibiotic treatment, this
      will be an important result for patients across South Asia and other typhoid endemic areas.
      This study will additionally investigate the financial implications for families and health
      system.

Typhi or S. Paratyphi on day 7 of treatment regardless of the presence of fever (microbiological failure) OR blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever relapse within 28 days of initiation of treatment.</description>
