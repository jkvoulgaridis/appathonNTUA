  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 2x2 randomised controlled trial with information-based intervention (no
      labelling / labelling) and structural intervention (default proportion / increased proportion
      of lower energy density food items) as between-subject factors and energy density (kcal/g) of
      food purchases during an online supermarket-shopping task as dependent variable. This study
      will use an online supermarket platform developed to mimic an online supermarket website and
      participants will be asked to complete a shopping task using a pre-determined shopping list
      of 10 items.
