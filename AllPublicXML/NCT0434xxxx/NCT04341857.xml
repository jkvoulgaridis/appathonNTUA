      This is a prospective single arm phase II clinical study to compare the safety and efficacy
      of PD-1monoclonal antibody +FLOT in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma/esophagus-gastric
      junction adenocarcinoma.

      Into a set of 25 cases of the gastric carcinoma confirmed by pathology or gastroesophageal
      junction adenocarcinoma (cT4 and/or N + M0, Multi-Disciplinary Team thought line to
      perioperative treatment) patients, preoperative accept four cycle by bead a resistance +
      sintilimab + capecitabine plus oxaliplatin into new adjuvant chemotherapy, because PD1
      antibodies distance between surgery time interval is the lack of clinical data, judging by
      the researchers is 4 cycles of chemotherapy combination of sintilimab .The patient was able
      to undergo D2 radical surgery.Pathological examination was carried out to observe the pCR and
      the infiltration rate of immune cells.After the operation, patients continued to receive 4
      cycles of capecitabine + oxaliplatin adjuvant therapy, and the total number of chemotherapy
      cycles was 8 cycles.Disease-free survival time and safety of treatment were observed, and OS,
      ORR and quality of life of all patients were followed up.

Patients with new non-breast cancer malignancy must continue to be followed for progression of the original breast cancer. For patients without progression, follow-up is censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurs within 12 weeks following the date last known progression-free, in which case the death will be counted as a DFS event.</description>
