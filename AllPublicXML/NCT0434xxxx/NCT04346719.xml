  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-frequency alternating currents of greater than 1 kHz applied on peripheral nerves has
      been used in animal studies to produce a motor nerve block. It has been evidenced that
      frequencies higher than 5 kHz are necessary to produce a complete peripheral nerve block in
      primates, whose nerve thickness is more similar to humans.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous studies with transcutaneous HFAC, suggest high-frequency stimulation (10 and 20
      kHz) have an inhibitory effect over muscle strength and somatosensory threshold.

      However, in these studies the intensity needed to reach block threshold is very high. The
      purpose of the present work is to reduce the amount of current intensity needed using a
      percutaneous approach by apply two acupuncture needles near the nerve as electrodes.
