      To provide expanded access to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging for eligible participants to detect
      and localize prostate cancer for initial and subsequent treatment strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging
      has been embraced enthusiastically worldwide. Given the unmet clinical need for accurately
      diagnosing and staging prostate cancer and the encouraging results of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET
      worldwide, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and University of California San
      Francisco (UCSF) conducted pivotal registration trials to assess 68Ga-PSMA-11's safety and
      efficacy profile in detecting prostate cancer in adult patients. To gap the unmet clinical
      need of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET during the period prior to FDA approval, UCLA Nuclear Medicine
      offers expanded access of this investigational PET drug to eligible participants.

    <description>A single dose activity of 5 mCi (accepted range of 3-7 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 will be intravenously administered to patient as a bolus injection. After 50-100 minutes of uptake time, the patient will undergo a whole body (skull to mid-thighs) PET/CT imaging.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Biochemical recurrent (i. Inclusion/Exclusion) and preprostatectomy (ii.
        Inclusion/Exclusion) staging patients will be eligible for the expanded access protocol. In
        order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet the following
        criteria:

        Biochemical Recurrence Population:

        i. Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathological proven prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  Rising prostatic specific antigen(PSA) after definitive therapy with prostatectomy or
             radiation therapy.

               -  Post radical prostatectomy (RP)

               -  PSA equals to or greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more than 6weeks after RP

               -  Post-radiation therapy -ASTRO-Phoenix consensus definition

               -  Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 50 (or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/
             World Health Organization (WHO) equivalent).

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign
             it.

             i. Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant investigational therapy.

          -  Known inability to lie flat, remain still or tolerate a PET scan.

          -  Patient undergoing active treatment for non-prostate malignancy, other than skin basal
             cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma that has not metastasized and
             superficial bladder cancer.

        Preprostatectomy Staging Population:

        ii. Inclusion criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  Considered for prostatectomy with lymph node dissection.

          -  Intermediate to high-risk disease (as determined by elevated PSA [PSA&gt;10], T-stage
             [T2b or greater], Gleason score [Gleason score &gt; 6] or other risk factors).

          -  Able to provide written consent.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent).

        ii. Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients not capable of getting PET study due to weight, claustrophobia, or inability
             to lay still for the duration of the exam.

          -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy or any definitive local therapy prior to
             prostatectomy including focal ablation techniques (HiFu).
