  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe physician-reported clinical effectiveness outcomes,
      as determined by Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) assessment, in biologic-naive participants with
      CD over 12 months following treatment initiation with vedolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, single-cohort, prospective study of participants with moderate
      to severe CD. The study will review medical charts with prospective patient-reported outcome
      measures to provide real-world data to describe clinical outcomes and participant-reported
      symptom experience over 12 months following vedolizumab treatment initiation.

      The study will enroll approximately 140 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational group:

      â€¢ Vedolizumab

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in Canada. The overall duration of study will be
      approximately 24 months, including participant's enrolment period of 12 months and follow-up
      data collection period of 12 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants in Clinical Remission at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as HBI less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5. HBI score is used to measure disease activity of CD. It consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0= very well to 4= terrible), abdominal pain (0=none to 3= severe), number of liquid or soft stools/ previous day, abdominal mass (0= none to 3= definite and tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score/item). The total score is sum of sub scores, where score &lt;5 = remission, 5 to 7 = mild disease activity, 8 to 16 = moderate disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 16 = severe disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) Using the Two-item (PRO-2) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PRO2 is comprised of the stool frequency and abdominal pain components of the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). The PRO-2 score is the sum of the abdominal pain and stool frequency subscores of the CDAI score. The average daily number of stools and abdominal pain score (with 0 indicating no pain and 4 indicating severe pain) over the past seven days are weighted according to the CDAI multiplication factors (2 for stool frequency and 5 for abdominal pain).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Endoscopic Improvement at Month 12 as Determined by Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) Values or Qualitative Physician Assessment of Disease Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, percentage of the surface area that is ulcerated, percentage of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 colonic segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable is sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease. The Physician's Assessment of Disease Severity was ranked on a 9-point scale (9 = much worse, 7 = worse, 5 = no change, 3 = better, 1 = much better).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI-SHP assess the impact of CD on work productivity and daily activities, and classroom impairment during the previous 7 days. The questionnaire consists of questions about the number of hours missed from work, hours worked, and the extent to which work productivity and regular daily activities were affected. Scores will be calculated as percentages of hours worked and percentages of productivity at work on work days. An overall work productivity score will be computed by multiplying the percentage of work time by the percentage productivity at work; the higher the scores, the better work productivity and activity performance.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) Score at Month 12</measure>

    <description>The SIBDQ is a self-reported quantitative assessment of participant's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in terms of physical, emotional, and social symptoms associated with IBD. The questionnaire relates to the past two weeks and consists of 10 questions about fatigue, social and leisure activities, pain, feelings of depression, and physical health issues. It consists of 7 point scale, with 1 indicating severity and 7 indicating the lack of a problem. The overall score can range from 10-70, with higher scores signifying better HRQoL.</description>
