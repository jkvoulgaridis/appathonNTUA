      The purpose of this study is to assess the vision improvement achieved by patients with late
      stage dry age-related macular degeneration who received corneal treatments by a low vision
      aid device. Patient records for patients with at least 12 months follow-up will be analyzed
      to determine measures of vision improvement including best spectacle-corrected distance and
      near visual acuity. Analyses will include descriptive statistics and correlation between
      outcomes and baseline characteristics.

    <description>Near infrared light is used to irradiate the cornea to change the modulus of small volumes of anterior stroma. The change of modulus produces a change of corneal stiffness and shape that modifies the distribution of light onto the retina. Light rays are redirected from dysfunctional areas of the retina that have been damaged by age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to functional areas of the retina, thereby improving patient vision.</description>

             eyes.

          5. - Treated eyes were pseudophakic at the time of treatment.

          6. - Patient had moderate to severe baseline vision impairment with best
             spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/63 or worse (decimal = 0.317
             or less; logMAR greater than or equal to 0.50) in the treated eye(s).

          7. - Patient CDVA records are available at baseline and at 12 month post-treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. - Corneal disease or disorder in either eye.

          2. - Increased intraocular pressure (above 20 mm Hg), glaucoma or history of glaucoma.

          3. - Presence or history of any other condition or finding that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for retrospective observational study.
