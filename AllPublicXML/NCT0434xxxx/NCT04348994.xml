  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is designed to assess the long-term clinical effects and safety profile of non-ablative
      Er:YAG (IncontiLase速) laser treatment, the durability of the results and the optimal
      treatment regimen for mild-to-severe stages of genuine female stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with urodynamically proven SUI, who have failed/declined conservative therapies
      will be informed about the study.

      They will be invited to attend a screening/baseline visit. At this visit, they will be asked
      to perform a standardised 1 hour pad test. Their medical history will be checked and they
      will undergo a clinical and vaginal examination, pregnancy test and dip stick urinalysis. If
      their 1 hour pad weight is &gt;2g and they meet all other inclusion / exclusion criteria, they
      will be eligible for inclusion. They will receive detailed instructions for performing a 24
      hour pad test, and will be asked to keep a 3 day voiding diary. They will be given the
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF).

      Patients will then undergo 3 outpatient treatment visits. The timing of visits will be
      approximately 1 month apart. At each of their 3 outpatient appointments, they will be asked
      about any deleterious effects since their last appointment. Patients will receive 3
      treatments in total.

      Patients will be invited to attend a follow-up visits 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after the 3rd
      treatment and asked to complete the 1 hour pad test, 24 hour pad test, 3 day voiding diary
      and ICIQ-SF questionnaire.

      At the 18-, 24- and 30-month follow up, they will be given an option to receive additional
      single session of non-ablative Er:YAG laser treatment. At each visit, and during additional
      visit after 36 months, they will be asked to complete all of the tests (1 hour pad test, 24 h
      hour pad test, 3 day voiding diary and ICIQ-UI SF).
