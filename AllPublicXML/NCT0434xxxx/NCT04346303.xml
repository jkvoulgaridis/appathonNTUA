    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design prospective experiments before and after the test. The
      purpose is to explore whether short-term interactive video games can improve the motivation,
      interpersonal interaction, and physical and mental health of patients with mental illness in
      community rehabilitation homes. Samples of mentally ill patients from community
      rehabilitation homes (full-day rehabilitation institutions) in the northern region were
      collected using a structured questionnaire for the recipients, as follows:

        1. Collect basic information through a structured questionnaire, which includes basic
           information, disease status, life style and other related information.

        2. Three data collections were performed, namely the baseline period (T0) and the
           pre-program (T1) two weeks later. Three weeks of intervention activities were provided
           twice a week, followed by a post-test ( post-program, T2).

        3. After a total of six times mentioned above, each 60 minutes of interactive video game
           intervention, the patient completed the activity feedback form, reflecting the feelings
           and feedback of participating in the activity.
