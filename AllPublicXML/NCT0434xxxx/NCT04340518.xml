  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleral lenses, customized rigid contact lenses that land on the soft and spongy conjunctival
      tissue overlying the sclera, will be fitted on 15 subjects with normal ocular surfaces. The
      purpose of the study is to determine the amount of conjunctival compression caused by the
      devices and the length of time required for the shape to recover from compression.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the interval required for the conjunctival tissue
      to return to its natural shape after scleral lens wear. All study visits will take place at
      the University of Houston College of Optometry (UHCO). Subjects will be recruited and fitted
      with scleral lenses to wear during the experimental days. Once the proper fit has been
      achieved, subjects will wear the scleral lens for 4 days total, returning after the 1st and
      4th day of lens wear for approximately 2 hours of testing. The subjects will then return
      every 24-hours for measurements until their conjunctival shape has returned to the original
      shape. The testing will be done using the sMap scleral topographer, which measures the
      elevation of the conjunctiva. Testing is non-invasive although it requires instillation of
      Fluress eye drops, a sodium fluorescein dye with anesthetic that allows for imaging. The
      total number of visits is 9-14 and the length of visit ranges from 10 minutes to 2.5 hours.
