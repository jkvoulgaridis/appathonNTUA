  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major global health problem and main cause of disability worldwide. Blood
      pressure control is important for good health in stroke patients. Measuring central blood
      pressure (the blood pressure which is found in the heart) and measuring the stiffness of your
      arteries will give practitioners, clinicians and researcher's important information over and
      above what is usually obtained from peripheral blood pressure in the arm. The most validated
      and most recognisable equipment for central blood pressure and arterial stiffness is the
      SphygmoCor XCEL. However, the Doppler Ultrasound is used more often in population-based
      studies and has been shown to be a precise and accurate measurement. Although these devices
      are validated, they both require a highly skilled operator and are quite time-consuming. As
      such, it is important to explore less operator dependent and time consuming devices, such as
      the Vicorder, as this could be essential for researchers and clinicians.Therefore, this study
      will investigate whether the Vicorder device is valid and reliable when measuring these
      outcomes and if so could be implemented in large research studies and potenially be used by
      clinicians.

      Twenty stroke patients will be recruited for this study. Participants will take part in four
      seperate assessments (2 hours each) with a minimum of 24 hour recovery between each session.
      Before each assessment participants will undertake an overnight fast (only water is allowed
      to be consumed prior to the assessment). If required, participants will take their medication
      the morning of each assessment and this will be noted.During the first session participants
      will be randomised into either a supine or seated condition. Participants will rest in this
      posture for 15 minutes. Triplicate measures of peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave
      analysis will be measured using the SphygmoCor XCEL and Vicorder device. A 3-lead ECG will be
      placed on the participant and ultrasound measures will be taken at the carotid, brachial,
      femoral and posterior tibial artery. This will examine the caroid-femoral pulse wave velocity
      (cfPWV), brachial-femoral pulse wave velocity (bfPWV), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity
      (baPWV) and femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (faPWV). Following this, the Vicorder device
      will be used to measure these segments. All measures will be on both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic sides. This procedure will be repeated in a seperate session whereby individuals
      will be in the other posture.

      Session 3 and 4 will include participants resting for 15 minutes in a supine position.
      Triplicate measures of peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave analysis will be taken with
      the Vicorder. Followed by triplicate measures of cfPWV, bfPWV, baPWV and faPWV. This will be
      repeated in a seated position within the same session.

    <description>No intervention. Participants will undertake an overnight fast prior to each assessment (only water is allowed to be consumed prior to the assessment).Participants will be asked to visit the lab on four separate occasions; the first two sessions will involve triplicated measures of carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV), brachial-femoral PWV (bfPWV), brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV), femoral-ankle PWV (faPWV) and TT by the Vicorder in both seated and supine position. During the third and fourth sessions individuals will be randomised into either a supine or seated position. A 3 lead ECG will be attached and ultrasound video clips will be taken at the carotid, brachial, femoral and posterior tibial artery on both the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides to look at stiffness and blood velocity. Following this, the Vicorder will be used to look at cfPWV, bfPWV, baPWV, faPWV and TT on both sides.</description>
