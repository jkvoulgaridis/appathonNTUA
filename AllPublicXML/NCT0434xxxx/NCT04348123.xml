  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify interventions that are designed to better serve
      women who are homeless, with a speciÔ¨Åc focus on increasing screening rates and decreasing
      late stage breast cancer diagnosis among this high-risk understudied community of women. As a
      result, the study team hopes to influence the broader homeless healthcare initiative

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this program will be to bring 6-8 mobile on site mammography clinics to homeless
      shelters that house women across the greater Cleveland and surrounding communities over a
      two-year period. Prior to arrival, clinic staff will recruit women to participate in a survey
      to elucidate beliefs and barriers around breast health and mammography. After the survey,
      clinic staff will conduct the outreach program, consisting of a brief educational session
      about breast health and mammography for any participating women. Education will be tailored
      to be culturally appropriate, and delivered by a female public health educator with
      experience in the underserved community. The educational session will explain screening
      options and address common barriers. After education, eligible women who wish to receive a
      mammogram may receive one from the on-site mobile mammography clinic free of charge.
      Throughout the day, the community educator will also lead activities and meals will be
      provided in order to create a festive atmosphere and inspire a sense of community among the
      women. Spanish speaking staff will be available for the educational sessions.
