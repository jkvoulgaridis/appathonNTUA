      Use radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) treatment.

    <textblock>
      Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a pre-malignant lesion. Currently, there is no
      standard treatment for this condition, thus the patients with GIM need surveillance endoscopy
      every 1-3 years, regarding to the severity and extension of lesion. However, the protocol for
      GIM surveillance is uncertain and need high cost.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is used for Barrett's esophagus (BE; pre-malignant lesion of
      esophageal adenoCA) treatment as a standard treatment. The investigators hypothesized that
      RFA may effective in GIM treatment.

      The investigators will random GIM participants to have the RFA treatment only one site of the
      stomach (left or right). At the first session, the investigators will biopsy at suspected GIM
      lesions to confirm the diagnosis and severity of GIM. Two months later, The investigators
      will apply RFA to all GIM lesions at the assigned location and then every 2 months for 3
      sessions or until no GIM lesion seen by endoscopy. The final endoscopy will be done at 1 year
      follow-up and biopsy will be performed to assess the efficacy of RFA compare to no treatment.
