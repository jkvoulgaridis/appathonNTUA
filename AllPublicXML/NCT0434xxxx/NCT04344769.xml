      The purpose of this study is to characterize oxidative stress and the Nrf2 antioxidant
      response in early stages of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), while
      identifying candidate biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) concentration is a major determinant of cellular
      fate and is finely regulated by the cell's antioxidant systems. While low levels of ROS are
      required for pro-survival signaling, cell proliferation, growth, and energy metabolism, the
      excess of ROS or oxidative stress leads to inflammation, cell death, and disease/injury
      progression. Indeed, oxidative stress is commonly observed in several renal diseases
      including ADPKD. On the other hand, a surplus of antioxidants will not only neutralize ROS,
      but may result in the antithesis of oxidative stress, which is known as reductive stress. The
      Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that integrates
      cellular stress signals and responds by regulating the expression of several antioxidant
      proteins. Activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense pathway enhances ROS
      detoxification, conferring a more reduced intracellular environment that can promote cell
      survival and proliferation, a distinctive feature in ADPKD that underlies cyst formation and
      enlargement. Therefore, a better characterization of ROS levels and antioxidant response in
      ADPKD patients would allow development of more specific and effective therapies, while
      providing additional related biomarkers.

      The investigators broad objective is to characterize oxidative stress and the Nrf2
      antioxidant response in early stages of ADPKD, while identifying candidate biomarkers.

      Participants in this study will have a blood and a urine sample collected to determine
      biomarkers of oxidative status and antioxidant response to study redox balance at early
      stages of the disease. In addition, an abdominal MRI will be performed to determine patient's
      total kidney volume (TKV).
