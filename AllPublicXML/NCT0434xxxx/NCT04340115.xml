  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease causing pain, stiffness, swelling
      and loss of joint function. RA can reduce the ability to perform everyday tasks. The purpose
      of this study is to observe the incidence of serious infections, regardless of their
      relationship to RINVOQ, in Japanese daily practice.

      RINVOQ is an approved drug for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA.
      This study evaluates medical records from institutions participating in the study to identify
      any adverse events (untoward medical occurrence), and reasons for discontinuation of RINVOQ
      in participants taking the study drug. A target of 1000 Japanese participants' data will be
      observed for 3 years.

      Participants will receive RINVOQ per their physicians' usual prescription. Individual data
      will be collected for three years.

      No additional study-related tests will be conducted during routine clinic visits. Only data
      which are routinely collected during clinic visits will be utilized for this study.
