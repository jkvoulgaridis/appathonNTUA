  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONCR-177-101 is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion study of
      ONCR-177, an oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus for intratumoral injection, alone and in
      combination with PD-1 blockade in adult subjects with advanced and/or refractory cutaneous,
      subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate
      preliminary efficacy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ONCR-177 is an intratumorally administered oncolytic immunotherapy comprised of a genetically
      engineered HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) that selectively replicates in tumor tissue.
      Oncorus Inc. is developing ONCR-177 both as monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 blockade
      for the treatment of advanced solid tumor malignancies. This first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1
      dose escalation and expansion study will determine the intratumoral dose of ONCR-177 as a
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, in subjects with advanced and/or
      refractory cutaneous, subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors. This protocol will
      enroll subjects who have at least one lesion that is visible, palpable or detectable and can
      be injected. Subjects with any cancer types who are eligible for the trial and have such
      lesions can be considered for enrollment. Additionally, preliminary evidence for clinical and
      immunologic activity will be sought to guide ongoing studies and development of ONCR-177 in
      subjects with cancers that are unmet medical needs. Confirmation of safety of ONCR-177
      administration in combination with pembrolizumab will also be evaluated in this study, to
      enable development as part of combination immunotherapy.
