  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Movement during everyday activities most often requires stable posture. Postural control
      corresponds to a complex motor ability to maintain / re-establish balance and orient one's
      body in the environment. Postural stability and equilibrium deteriorate with age. More than
      30% of people over 65 years old fall per year. Falls represent 90% of hip fractures and
      sometimes result in lasting psychological effects. Shoes are our direct link between the
      ground and our feet. Wearing shoes plays a major role in postural control. The
      characteristics of shoes usually worn by elderly people are identified with those of shoes
      known to be 'dangerous'. In order to improve stability and reduce the risk of falling for the
      elderly, Axis-Comfort Development® has developed &quot;experimental balance shoes&quot;. Their shoes
      have technical characteristics presented in the scientific literature as beneficial for
      postural stability.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of wearing experimental
      balance shoes on postural balance compared with the people's own shoes. We assumed that
      postural balance would be improved by experimental balance shoes in an acute way and improved
      by a familiarization phase.

      This was a controlled, randomized, blind and cross-over study. three sessions were held in
      our center, each time interspersed with a phase of familiarization at home (7 to 10 days)
      during which the people had to wear either the experimental balance shoes or their own
      personal shoes. 21 volunteers in total participated in this study, all between 65 and 75
      years old. Five tests were presented randomly for each session and all tests were carried out
      on a Huber 360 ® (LPG System, France) stabilometric platform. The mains criteria were static
      equilibrium on one foot and two feet (with eyes open and closed) and secondary criteria were
      stride frequency during the walk on the spot and stability limits.

      An improvement of these multiple criteria during the different sessions would be proof of the
      positive effect of experimental balance shoes on postural balance in the elderly.
