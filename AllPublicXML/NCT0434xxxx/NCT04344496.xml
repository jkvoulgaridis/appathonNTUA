  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to establish the cancer genome atlas and the platform of recurrence risk
      prediction specific for East Asian breast cancer patients. The study was planned to collect
      blood sample, fresh tumor tissue, and paraffin embedded tumor tissue from 2000 patients. Aims
      to identify unique genetic alterations in Asian tumors, to identify the susceptible genes for
      breast carcinogenesis in East Asia, and to establish the new platform for accurate prediction
      of recurrence. The investigator will explore the association of patient outcomes with the
      genetic alterations from the cancer atlas of East Asian breast tumors.
