  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a term used to describe a collection of symptoms including memory loss, problems
      with reasoning and communication, and a reduction in a person's ability to carry out daily
      activities. The most common types of dementia are: Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia,
      mixed dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. Clinicians and families are looking for ways to
      deal with this challenging group of diseases to improve quality of life, reduce depression
      and agitation for individuals in long term care (LTC).

      There are a variety of non-pharmacologic interventions for dementia often used in addressing
      physiological and behavioral challenges, new to this category of treatment is virtual reality
      (VR).

      Virtual reality has been studied in mild cognitive impairment. Colleagues completed a
      systematic review of non-pharmacological intervention to treat older people with dementia and
      found music to be the only intervention effective, VR was not included as no studies were
      found.

      The Registered Nurses Association of Ontario report non-pharmacological approaches are an
      important alternative to the use of antipsychotic medications. They recommend health-care
      providers should consider non-pharmacological interventions wherever possible as a first-line
      approach to the management of BPSD.

      Virtual reality as proposed in this research will include music, library items will be
      selected that are person specific, and will provide sensory stimulation. To date there is no
      published research on the use the VR in moderate to severe dementia in LTC, looking at
      depression.

      Dementia is a term used to describe a collection of symptoms including memory loss, problems
      with reasoning and communication, and a reduction in a person's ability to carry out daily
      activities such as washing, dressing and cooking. The most common types of dementia are:
      Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.
      Dementia is a progressive condition, which means that the symptoms will gradually get worse.
      Clinicians and families are looking for ways to deal with this challenging group of diseases
      to improve quality of life, reduce depression and agitation that often accompany dementia as
      it progresses and individuals are placed in long term care (LTC).

      There are a variety of non-pharmacologic interventions for dementia ranging from traditional
      interventions such as behavioral therapy to newer interventions such as multisensory therapy.
      Often used in addressing physiological and behavioral challenges, some interventions have
      been shown to aid cognitive ability as well. &quot;Cognitive stimulation,&quot; is a catchall term
      referring to non-pharmacologic interventions with a cognitive focus, new to this category of
      treatment is virtual reality (VR).

      Virtual reality has been studied in mild cognitive impairment. A systematic review of studies
      evaluating computerized cognitive training and virtual reality cognitive training
      interventions for individuals at high risk of cognitive decline called mild cognitive decline
      documented consistent improvement in the domains of attention, executive function, visual and
      verbal memory, and also on the psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and apathy in
      participants. Colleagues completed a systematic review of non-pharmacological intervention to
      treat older people with dementia and found music to be the only intervention effective, VR
      was not included as no studies were found.

      The Registered Nurses Association of Ontario completed a best practice guideline on Dementia
      based on current evidence in 2016. They report non-pharmacological approaches are an
      important alternative to the use of antipsychotic medications, which historically have been
      overused as a first-line strategy for managing behavioural and psychological systems of
      dementia (BPSD). They recommend health-care providers should consider non-pharmacological
      interventions wherever possible as a first-line approach to the management of BPSD.

      The most well-studied and effective non-pharmacological approaches include listening to
      music/music therapy, effective communication and person-centred approaches and other sensory
      stimulation. Virtual reality as proposed in this research will include music, specific
      library items will be selected that are person specific, and will provide sensory stimulation
      in keep with the RNAO guidelines. To date there is no published research on the use the VR in
      moderate to severe dementia in LTC looking at depression as the primary outcome measure.

    <description>All residents are seen by a RN, with care by Registered Practical Nurse (RPN) and Personal Support Worker (PSW) staff 24/7. Residents supported by behavior support Ontario staff; include Behavior responsive team. Residents prior to admission have been assessed by the Geriatric program. Residents may receive psychotropic or cognitive enhancement medications. The residents are seen routinely seen once a week by the physician. Their Dementia is monitored weekly but the physician as well as daily by the registered staff. Quarterly or more frequently cognitive assessments are completed and referrals made to appropriate specialists. A day would include meals, engagement in scheduled and non-scheduled programs such as exercise, and activities, groups. Residents are supported in their activities of daily living, and social engagement. Specific interventions based on resident needs are supported in a Dementia capable environment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Virtual Reality (VR) is a scenario that simulates experiences. The immersive environment is similar to the real world, creating an experience. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to &quot;look around&quot; the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. VR requires the user to use a multi-projected in their own room using BroomX to generate realistic images, sounds that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A library has been developed, set to music, as well, we will use library items already part of the BroomX. We will attempt to use BroomX in their own room or in a suitable room within the LTC home. The participants still get the immersive experience, and the projection device has automatic controls that conform the visuals to a 360 experience no matter what size the room is, or what chairs, window blinds, are in the room.</description>
