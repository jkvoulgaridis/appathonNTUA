  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AHF-CODE reduced study is a prospective, non-randomized, monocenter study performed in
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction admitted for worsening heart
      failure.

      The main objective of the AHF-CODE study is to identify congestion markers (clinical,
      biological and ultrasound) at the end of hospitalization for acute heart failure that are
      associated with the risk of all cause death or rehospitalization for acute heart failure
      within 3 months of hospital discharge.
