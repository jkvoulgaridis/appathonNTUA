  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of orthodontic treatment is one of the exacerbation causes of orthodontic pain.
      Several methods have been suggested to reduce the duration of orthodontic treatment
      classified to surgical and non-surgical methods.

      Researches used minimally invasive surgical methods like corticision, piezocesion,
      micro-osteoperforation, and piezo-puncture indicated that most of these methods can
      accelerate dental movement by 20 - 40% without causing additional pain as a result of using
      those methods. Applying corticision on the lower anterior teeth using a surgical blade and a
      hammer may accelerate tooth alignment during orthodontic treatment. This study consists of
      two groups, patients will be randomly assigned to one of these two groups.

      Pain is defined as an unpleasant emotional sensory experience associated with actual or
      potential harm. It was mentioned as one of the most common complaints related to orthodontic
      treatment, and around 65-95% of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment suffer from various
      degrees of pain.

      Corticision is one of the minimally invasive surgical procedures that is not associated with
      flap lifting. It was used to accelerate tooth movement in animals and case report studies.
      Its application on humans may aggravate their fear and anxiety towards the pain that may
      accompany this technique.

      No study in the literature has been searched in patient perception of pain, discomfort,
      levels of acceptance and satisfaction accompanied corticision application, but in this study,
      these previous variables accompanied corticision technique have been studied on crowded lower
      anterior teeth cases which are one of the most common types of malocclusion.

    <measure>Change in the Perception of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 hours following the onset of treatment (bonding of the appliance), then at 7 days, 14 days following the onset of orthodontic treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is assessed by asking the study participant to place a mark on a horizontal 100 mm line to indicate the level of pain being experienced. The left end of the line refers to no pain (VAS=0) where the right end refers to maximum (unimaginable) pain (VAS=100). The level of pain is represented in the number of millimeters measured from the left end of the line to the mark pointed out by the patient. This is called the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) where the higher the number is the more intense the pain.</description>

    <description>Discomfort is assessed by asking the study participant to place a mark on a horizontal 100 mm line to indicate the level of discomfort being experienced. The left end of the line refers to no discomfort (VAS=0) where the right end refers to maximum discomfort (VAS=100). The level of discomfort is represented in the number of millimeters measured from the left end of the line to the mark pointed out by the patient.

    <description>Difficulties of mastication are assessed by asking the study participant to place a mark on a horizontal 100 mm line to indicate the level of difficulties in mastication being experienced. The left end of the line refers to no difficulties (VAS=0) where the right end refers to maximum difficulties (VAS=100).

    <description>Satisfaction is assessed for both groups by asking the study participant to place a mark on a horizontal 100 mm line to indicate the level of satisfaction. The left end of the line refers to no satisfaction (VAS=0) where the right end refers to maximum satisfaction (VAS=100). The level of satisfaction is represented in the number of millimeters measured from the left end of the line to the mark pointed out by the patient.

The grade of ease is represented in the number of millimeters measured from the left end of the line to the mark pointed out by the patient.
