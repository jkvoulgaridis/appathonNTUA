  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open label, single arm, integrated 3-part
      dose escalation and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of AK117 administered
      intravenously to adult subjects with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors
      or lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises 3 parts: a dose escalation phase for estimating the optimal priming dose
      (Part A), a dose escalation phase for estimating the optimal maintenance dose (Part B), and a
      dose expansion phase (Part C). The 3 parts will be conducted sequentially. Approximately 159
      subjects (up to 27 subjects in Part A, up to 72 subjects in Part B, and up to approximately
      60 subjects in Part C) will be enrolled in this study.
