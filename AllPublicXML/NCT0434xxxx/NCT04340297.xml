  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonerosive Reflux Disease (NERD) is a common refractory gastrointestinal disease. Proton Pump
      Inhibitors (PPIs), the preferred drug, have poor response, single target and poor acid
      inhibition effect in some patients in clinical application. Long-term use of PPI can lead to
      many side effects, even dependency. The main Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)syndrome types
      of NERD are liver-stomach depression-heat syndrome, spleen deficiency damp-heat syndrome and
      cold-heat complicated syndrome. TCM syndrome differentiation treatment has the advantages of
      overall regulation and individualized treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy advantages of syndrome differentiation series prescription combined with
      PPIs descending ladder withdrawal in the treatment of patients who use PPIs for a long time
      that can not stop, and to solve the problems of multiple side effects and dependency caused
      by long-term use of PPIs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonerosive Reflux Disease (NERD) accounts for about 70% of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
      (GERD), which is a common refractory gastrointestinal disease. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs),
      the preferred treatment, have the following problems in clinical use: about 50% of patients
      respond to PPIs only partially or not at all; PPIs has a single target, and the effect of
      acid suppression alone is poor; long term use of PPIs can lead to dyspepsia, fundic gland
      polyp, atrophic gastritis, intestinal flora disorders, and even dependency. Liver-stomach
      depression-heat syndrome, spleen deficiency damp-heat syndrome and cold-heat complicated
      syndrome account for 80%-91% of NERD's Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome. TCM
      syndrome differentiation treatment has the advantages of overall regulation and
      individualized treatment, but it lacks high-level evidence-based medicine evidence. On the
      basis of previous work, the project plans to establish sub centers in 6 Chinese hospitals,
      including 180 patients with NERD who meet the requirements to carry out a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, in which 90 subjects in the
      experimental group received the treatment of syndrome differentiation series of prescriptions
      combined with PPIs descending ladder withdrawal, and 90 subjects in the control group
      received the treatment of placebo combined with PPIs descending ladder withdrawal. The
      therapeutic effects were evaluated from the following aspects: the VAS score of reflow and
      heartburn, the rate of discontinuation of antacids, the rate of recurrence of NERD symptoms,
      the score of TCM syndromes and the improvement of gastrointestinal function. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy advantage and safety of Tongjiang series prescription
      combined with PPIs descending ladder withdrawal compared with PPIs descending ladder
      withdrawal alone for patients who use PPIs for a long time that can not stop, so as to obtain
      evidence-based medical evidence of high-quality TCM syndrome differentiation treatment of
      NERD, and form an effective and popularized treatment plan to solve the problems of various
      side effects and dependency caused by long-term use of PPIs.

    <description>During the period of taking medicine, the patients recorded the reflow and heartburn attacks (attack times and duration) within 24 hours every day on the symptom diary card, and VAS scores were performed on the reflow and heartburn symptoms. The average score of each symptom in the past week was calculated. The decrease rate of symptom score â‰¥ 50% after weekly treatment was recorded as response, and the number of response weeks was more than 50% of the whole treatment period, which was considered effective.</description>
