  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is the most common cause of chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain
      and is characterized by pain associated with generalizad sensitivity, fatigue, sleep
      disturbances and psychological problems. Due to the chronic nature of the pathology and the
      great dependence on analgesic drugs that it often entails, in these patients it is considered
      necessary to provide an individualized approach and provide strategies that allow symptoms to
      be controlled conservatively and non-pharmacologically.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate and to compare the effects on pain, functional
      capacity, body strength, physical activity level, disability, fatigue, quality of sleep,
      anxiety, depression, kinesiophobia and catastrophizing when a home-based aerobic exercise
      program or a supervised aerobic exercise program are applied.

      For this purpose the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial single-blind
      (examiner). The investigators included patients diagnosed of fibromyalgia according to the
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR).

      Patients included are randomized into 2 groups, one receive supervised aerobic exercise
      therapy and the other home-based exercise therapy. Groups receive 2 treatment sessions a week
      over 15 weeks.

      The variables are measured at the beginning, at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the
      end of intervention.
