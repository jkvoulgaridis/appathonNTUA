  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial examines the effectiveness of a multi-level smoking cessation program for
      high-risk women in rural communities. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cervical
      cancer in women. Rural primary care practices and providers often lack the electronic health
      record support to pre-identify smokers for services, as well as lack the necessary counseling
      training and access to comprehensive cessation programs. Implementing evidence-based smoking
      cessation programs in rural Appalachia may decrease the rates of cigarette smoking and as a
      result decrease the rates of cervical cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of a core component of an integrated cervical cancer
      prevention program designed to help female smokers quit by standardizing clinical practice
      supports and protocols. (Service outcomes) II. Determine satisfaction with the multilevel
      intervention. (Client outcomes) III. Test the sustainability of the multilevel intervention
      via training of providers and staff on counseling and billing for evidence-based smoking
      cessation services. (Implementation outcomes)

      OUTLINE:

      IMPLEMENTATION OF TOBACCO-USER IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM: Clinics and systems develop and
      implement minimally required electronic tracking and reporting systems for identification of
      smokers during months 1-12.

      GROUP RANDOMIZED TRIAL: Providers and participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EARLY ARM): Providers undergo training over 60 minutes to explain the Break Free
      program and basics of quitting smoking during months 13-24. Female smokers interested in
      quitting in the next 6 months will be referred to an in-person counseling session at the
      clinic. Participants then receive 4 phone counseling over 15-20 minutes with a trained
      tobacco treatment specialist.

      ARM II (DELAYED ARM): Female smokers receive usual care during months 13-24. Providers
      undergo training over 60 minutes to explain the Break Free program and basics of quitting
      smoking during months 25-36. Female smokers interested in quitting in the next 6 months will
      be referred to an in-person counseling session at the clinic. Participants then receive 4
      phone counseling over 15-20 minutes with a trained tobacco treatment specialist.
