  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a novel clinical decision support
      application on the rate of perioperative medication errors and preventable adverse medication
      events. The investigators hypothesize that the perioperative clinical decision support
      application will reduce the incidence of perioperative medication errors and adverse
      medication events compared to the standard of care.

Life-threatening: The event has the potential to cause symptoms that if not treated would put the patient at risk of death.

Significant: The event has the potential to cause symptoms that while harmful to the patient pose little or no threat to the patient's function.</description>
