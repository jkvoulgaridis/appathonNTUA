  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 randomised clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of Lu-PSMA therapy
      followed by docetaxel chemotherapy versus docetaxel chemotherapy on its own in patients with
      newly-diagnosed high-volume metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, stratified, 2-Arm, multi-centre, phase 2 clinical trial
      recruiting 140 newly-diagnosed high-volume mHNPC patients at 11 Australian centres over a
      period of 18 months. Patients will be randomised to the experimental Arm (177Lu-PSMA followed
      by docetaxel) or standard-of-care Arm (docetaxel) in a 1:1 ratio. All patients will receive
      ADT continuously throughout the trial. Patients will be stratified according to disease
      volume by conventional imaging (low-volume vs. high-volume) and duration of ADT at time of
      registration (≤ 28 days vs. &gt; 28 days).

    <time_frame>Upto 32 months assuming 18 months to complete recruitment, a maximum of 1.6 months from consent to commencement of treatment for last patient and then 12 months from commencement of treatment for last patient.</time_frame>
    <description>Undetectable PSA is defined as PSA ≤ 0.2ng/ml at 12 months after protocol treatment commencement. Patients who experience unequivocal radiographic (by conventional imaging modality) and/or clinical disease progression within 12 months of initiating protocol treatment will be considered as not having undetectable PSA at 12 months.</description>
