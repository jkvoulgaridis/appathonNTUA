  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents are a valuable but underused resource in neonatal pain management. In the Nordic
      countries, family-centred neonatal care has come a long way in welcoming and including
      parents in the everyday care of their infant. Nonseparation of parents and infants is a
      protective measure in decreasing stress in both parents and infants and should also be
      applicable during painful procedures. Sick newborn infants and infants that are born
      premature are cared for in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Because of the intense
      nature of the care the infants are subjected to an extensive amount of painful procedures and
      treatments needed for survival. Research shows that infants cared for in the NICU, experience
      on average between 7 and 17 painful procedures per day, and far from all infants receive
      adequate pharmacological or non-pharmacological analgesia during the procedures. The parents'
      role in the pain experience of older children has received considerable attention in
      research, but parents' participation in infant pain management has quite recently become a
      focus for research in nursing pain science with currently a handful studies. Research shows
      for example that when parents are present, the documentation of nursing pain assessment
      increases as well as the use of non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods, and parental
      presence can reduce the child's pain intensity and behavioural distress. There is no previous
      research within Swedish health care context that has investigated the parents' attitudes
      towards being involved in their infant's pain management, nor any research that previously
      has assessed the efficacy of combined parent-driven pain management such as skin-to-skin
      contact or breastfeeding including parental live lullaby singing. The objectives for the
      study are to investigate parents' and health professional's attitudes, experiences and
      perspectives on non-pharmacological parent-driven pain management and also to test the
      efficacy of combined parent-driven pain management such as skin-to-skin contact,
      breastfeeding and parental live lullaby singing.

      Study design and eligibility criteria:

      The study design for the qualitative part of this study, tier one, is inspired by
      Participatory Action Research (PAR), involving both parents and health professionals in
      neonatal intensive care in a collaborative research project. Our ambition with the PAR design
      is to democratize the research process and include also the parents in the knowledge making.
      One focus group per region is recruited by the researchers and the participants are recruited
      based on their interest for parent-driven pain management. The focus groups contain two
      parents of infants who currently are admitted to the NICU, one parent who previously
      experienced NICU care, two health professionals and two researchers. In the focus groups, the
      NICU parents, the health professionals and the researchers will sit together discussing and
      sharing knowledge about parent-driven pain management interventions. The groups will then
      test the parent-driven interventions during a routine blood sample, before the groups meet
      again to evaluate their experiences and suggest solutions for plausible problems to improve
      clinical practice. The feedback from the focus groups will purportedly bring about guidelines
      for parent-driven pain management which are context sensitive and tailored to the Swedish
      family-centered NICU situation and public health care system as well as bring forth
      information how to implement parent-driven methods.

      The second tier of the study is a randomized controlled trial. A written informed consent is
      acquired from each and one of the infant's parents. Healthy, full term infants who will be
      screened with the routine phenylketonuria (PKU) test and their parent, are enrolled and
      randomized into one of three groups; one control group with glucose (n= 75), one group with
      skin-to-skin contact (n= 75), and one group where the skin-to-skin contact is combined with
      breastfeeding, live parental lullaby singing and touch (n= 75). All infants will receive
      effective pain management of some kind. If applicable, health care interpreting service will
      be offered for parents not speaking Swedish. Infants treated with sedatives or analgesics
      within the last 24 hours are excluded.

    <description>The primary outcome in the randomized controlled trial is pain in infants measured with the Premature Infant Pain Profile Revised (PIPP-R). The PIPP-R evaluates three behavioral facial actions (brow bulge, eye squeeze and nasolabial furrow), two physiological items (heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation), and two contextual items (gestational age and behavioral state). The PIPP is weighted for younger gestational age and sleep state. Scores can range from 0 to 21, and a difference of two points between conditions can be considered clinically important.</description>

    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse populations.Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

    <description>Parent-driven interventions are skin-to-skin care, breastfeeding and multi-sensory stimulation like vocalisation. They are all a combination of multiple sensory inputs comprising auditory, tactile and olfactory recognition. Research has started to investigate breastfeeding in combination with Kangaroo-mother- care for example, which has shown to be an effective mix. A multimodal approach that includes a combination of non-pharmacological approaches is considered more effective during venipuncture than single strategies and provides greater pain relief.</description>

    <description>Live parental infant-directed lullaby singing is an individually tailored, non-verbal, multisensory, multimodal and affective tool to regulate the infant before, during and after venipuncture. Direct breast-feeding has demonstrated efficacy that is equal to, or greater than, sweet taste interventions in reducing behavioral and physiological responses to pain in full-term infants undergoing venipuncture with no demonstrated adverse outcomes. Direct breast-feeding should be considered the preferred first-line analgesic intervention for painful procedures performed on full-term infants.</description>
