      Background:

      'Free will' can be defined as the belief that people have control over their thoughts and
      movements. The topic of free will is controversial and is still being debated. Science has
      only partial answers to questions about free will, so researchers want to learn more about
      it. They want to assess the role of consciousness when intentions are present with behavior.
      This could help to explain the causal role of consciousness in movement or decisions.

      Objective:

      To learn more about free will.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 25-45

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and neurological exam.

      Participants will have 1 study visit. It will last up to 4 hours.

      Participants will sit in a comfortable chair in front of a screen. They will perform some or
      all of the following tasks.

      Visual Task. Participants will watch different stimuli on the screen and answer simple
      questions.

      Electroencephalography (EEG). An EEG records the electrical activity of the brain ('brain
      waves'). For the EEG, small electrodes are put on the scalp with an electrode cap. A gel is
      placed in the space between the electrodes and the scalp. Participants' brain waves will be
      recorded, including while they decide whether to move their thumb.

      Choice/Reaction Time Task. Participants will watch different stimuli on the screen and react
      to them by moving their wrist. During this task, they will wear an EEG cap on their head and
      electrodes on their arms and wrists.

      Electromyography. Small electrodes will be attached to participants' skin. Their muscle
      activity will be recorded while they decide whether to move their wrist and during the
      movement itself.

      Study Description:

      The main focus of this protocol will be to try to identify the quale of free will, its
      electrophysiological correlates, and to determine whether this quale plays a causative role
      in movement.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

      We will be doing a series of experiments. In the first experiments, we want to explore the
      behavioral response of normal subjects when they move after a visual stimulus that can be
      seen or unseen. We want to study behavior in different conditions with movement triggered by
      movements seen and not seen. Furthermore, we want to analyze the EEG related to those stimuli
      to explore sensory and motor processing.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoints:

      Reaction time and accuracies of the responses to different stimuli in different conditions
      will be identified as well as the subjects subjective experiences. EEG ERP shapes and
      microstates patterns will also be investigated.

      Study Population:

      Up to 50 healthy volunteers of both genders between the ages of 25-45, fluent in English and
      right-handed.

      Participant Duration:

      The total study is expected to last 48 months, with each individual expected to participate
      in a single 4-hour outpatient visit at the NIH Clinical Center, but there can be multiple
      visits.
