  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is responsible for a huge and growing burden of patient suffering and social costs,
      and the impact of this disease is shared disproportionately by minorities and in rural
      resource-challenged communities, particularly in the Deep South. To address this problem, the
      UAB Diabetes Research Center will establish a primary care clinical network in rural counties
      of Alabama and in the Mississippi delta that will provide the DRC and its members with
      opportunities for partnership and the infrastructure to conduct translational and clinical
      research in those patients with the greatest need. A pilot trial will be conducted within the
      coalition to assess feasibility for a larger trial to evaluate a novel and sustainable
      approach for diabetes prevention that involves an innovative lifestyle intervention combined
      with metformin.

      Our pilot trial in aim 3 will include enrolling 4 primary care practices. Each of the
      participating practices will be randomized to one of two arms and accordingly enrolled
      participants from each clinic will be assigned to one of two conditions:

      Condition 1. Receive lifestyle modification alone (DPP) Condition 2. Receive lifestyle
      modification with metformin therapy recommendations (DPP-recommendations Twenty five patients
      will be enrolled from each participating practice. Patients will be followed by protocol for
      one year after recruitment.
