  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are studies investigating the dimensional changes following free gingival graft (FGG)
      around teeth with inadequate attached gingiva, however no study investigating the effect of
      smoking on dimensional changes following FGG around dental implants exists. In the present
      study, we hypothesized that smoking might increase the dimensional change of FGG around
      dental implants and affect the healing of donor site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Implants with inadequate attached gingiva on the buccal site, which placed in posterior
        region at least 1 year ago, and loaded with a fixed prosthetic restoration at least 6
        months ago.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Implants with peri-implantitis, patients who had previously the soft or hard tissue graft
        surgery at the site in question, patients who had previously operated from the donor site,
        patients with systemic disease that may interfere with periodontal surgery, patients taking
        any medication that can prolong bleeding, patients with immune system disease, infectious
        diseases such as hepatitis or HIV, individuals under the age of 18, and women with pregnant
        or breastfeeding.
