    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy patients will be fitted with a virtual reality head-mounted display, and virtual
      experiences will be initiated prior to colonoscope insertion. Colonoscopy will be initiated
      without standard sedatives and narcotics. The colonoscopy will proceed with the subject using
      virtual reality distraction instead of pharmacological sedation for as long as s/he would
      like. Standard sedatives and narcotics will be administered upon participant request at any
      time during the procedure. Questionnaires will be administered to the subject and the
      endoscopist after each procedure to assess the acceptability of use of virtual reality in the
      colonoscopy setting.

      This study aims to assess whether virtual reality is an acceptable alternative to
      pharmacological sedation during colonoscopy. Past research has shown that in order to fully
      experience pain, one must pay attention to it. Virtual reality has been shown to help
      mitigate pain by providing distraction from the painful stimulus.

      In this study, participants undergo screening or surveillance colonoscopy under virtual
      reality distraction.

      Individuals who are scheduled for a routine screening or surveillance colonoscopy and have
      had at least one prior colonoscopy under conscious sedation are eligible to participate.
      Those who give written, informed consent are fitted with and oriented to a virtual reality
      head-mounted display. The subject is then prepped for the colonoscopy by a registered nurse
      per institution protocol. This includes placement of an intravenous line.

      Written consent is obtained for colonoscopy with medication by the performing endoscopist.
      The patient is again fitted with the virtual reality head-mounted display and virtual
      experiences are initiated. The endoscopist performs the colonoscopy with the subject using
      virtual reality distraction instead of pharmacological sedation for as long as the subject
      likes. Standard sedatives and narcotics will be administered by a registered nurse upon
      participant request at any time during the procedure.

      Following the procedure, participants and endoscopists complete a questionnaire about their
      subjective experience with virtual reality during colonoscopy. The research coordinator fills
      out a case report form for each subject with information about the procedure including
      length, colonoscopy findings, and complications as noted by the endoscopist.
