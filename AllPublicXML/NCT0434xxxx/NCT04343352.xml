      Introduction: support to family and child related to epilepsy, controls or when they come for
      urgent reasons. Solutions must be found to ensure its continuity.

      this support. The widespread use of the Internet today, e-health and health education is
      increasing day by day. Objective: The investigators research is planned to develop a mobile
      Epilepsy Training Program.

      Parents with children diagnosed with epilepsy and assessing its effectiveness. Material and
      Method: The research is a randomized controlled experimental study.

      An application was made to the Eskişehir Osmangazi University Clinical Research Ethics
      Committee and the ethics committee permission was obtained with the decision of 13.02.2020
      dated 80558721-050.99-E.20230 and 2019-66 decision. Only volunteer participants will be
      included in the research. Its population study 3-6 years old children diagnosed with epilepsy
      Eskişehir City Hospital Child Neurology Outpatient Clinic between 01 September 2020 and 31
      September 2021.

      The sample of the research will consist of parents who meet the inclusion criteria.

      research between these dates. Parents meeting research sample selection criteria The
      application was randomized as a control group according to the Parent Epilepsy Information
      Scale.

      Application group; will use the mobile application the investigators prepared for the parent.
      Control group will consist of parents who follow the hospital's treatment protocol. The
      investigators study Completed with a total of 60 parents, 30 of whom are determined by power
      analysis group. Statistical analysis will be done with SPSS package program. Keywords: Child,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic disease is defined as a condition that deviates from the normal, results from
      pathological changes and leaves permanent insufficiency, continues for a long time, and
      requires special training, long-term care and treatment for the patient's rehabilitation.
      Epilepsy, one of the chronic diseases, is one of the most common neurological disorders in
      childhood.

      The main goal in the treatment of epilepsy; It is based on the principle of ensuring seizure
      without harming the child's growth and development potential. In other words, controlling the
      seizures is to correctly identify the cause of the seizure and to help the child live a
      normal life.

      According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the role of the
      epilepsy specialist nurse in epilepsy management is not limited to seizure control, but
      requires multi-dimensional care planning. It is an important nursing role to regulate the
      lifestyle and increase the compliance with the treatment to increase the patients'
      non-seizure. At the same time, the key roles of the epilepsy nurse include continuing
      cooperation with other healthcare team members, collaborating with the public and
      epilepsy-related organizations, and providing necessary information and educational support
      to families and children.

      However, the support given to the family and the child is limited to the times that may come
      only with controls or for urgent reasons. Detailed solutions will be found to ensure the
      continuity of this support. Today, with the widespread use of the internet, healthcare
      education is increasing day by day. Web-based training applications prepared by professional
      experts are for information such as guidance, information and encouragement for patients with
      limited time and their parents. Participants phone contains at least one smartphone in almost
      every home in the internet age. there may be mobile applications to install.

      With the use of mobile applications in health care services, it is seen that the quality of
      life of the patients and their relatives and the quality of health care services increase,
      but also contributes economically to health institutions.

      The aim of the research is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of the mobile epilepsy
      education program for parents with children diagnosed with epilepsy.

Parents in the application group will be monitored for 3 months using the mobile epilepsy training program. The researcher will follow the participants' use of the mobile application with the interface of the mobile epilepsy training program.
During the monitoring phase, the Epilepsy Information Questions screen will be given once every 15 days, and the training module will be reopened automatically on missing or incorrect answers and the parent's information on this subject will be renewed.
- At the end of the 3rd month, posttests (Parent Epilepsy Knowledge Scale for Parents and Parental Anxiety Scale for Seizures Scale) will be applied face-to-face.</description>

    <ipd_description>With the mobile application, patients diagnosed with epilepsy and their parents / caregivers will be able to easily learn the correct information about epilepsy disease at any time (7/24) in any environment with a structured training program. Thanks to the mobile application, it will be possible to facilitate the compliance of diagnosis, follow-up and treatment in epilepsy disease. It is thought that mobile application will take place in child intensive care, child neurology and child clinics especially in the smartphones of children / parents / caregivers with epilepsy.</ipd_description>
