  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removal of impacted lower third molar teeth is one of the most common oral surgical
      procedures, and these operations often lead to various complications in patients.
      Antibiotics, analgesics and mouthwashes are prescribed for the treatment of complications
      encountered. When using postoperative antibiotics in surgery of impacted third molar teeth,
      lower surgical area infection, pain, swelling and trismus are seen. Based on this
      information, in this study, it is aimed to evaluate the effects of rifamycine
      intraoperatively on the postoperative pain, swelling and trismus.

    <description>Rifamycine is a broad spectrum semi-synthetic antibiotic that acts on gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. As a local application, it has areas of use in dentistry such as washing fistula mouths, maxillary sinus and abscess wounds and treating osteomyelitis.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds. It is also used to dilute other drugs to be injected and to wash the operation site in dental surgery operations. It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as normal saline.</description>

    <description>Local anesthesia was obtained using 2 ml articaine hydrochloride 40 mg/ml with epinephrine 0.01 mg/ml . The horizontal incision was made with no. 15 scalpel blade and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised. In all surgical procedures, bone removal and/or tooth sectioning were performed under sterile saline irrigation. Following the extraction, granulation tissues were removed, and bleeding was controlled. Finally, extraction socket was irrigated with the solution which contains 250 mg rifamycine and the mucoperiosteal flap was repositioned by 3.0 silk sutures.</description>
