    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, phase III parallel-group non-inferiority study aimed to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of prefilled liquid etanercept (Yisaipu) versus
      lyophilized etanercept powder (Yisaipu) in active ankylosing spondylitis patients.

    <textblock>
      The study carried out between March 6, 2014 and July 13, 2015 across multiple medical centers
      in China enrolled adult active ankylosing spondylitis patients aged between 18 and 65 years.
      Patients were randomized in a 3:1:1 ratio to receive twice weekly 25 mg prefilled liquid
      etanercept for totally 24 injections (group I) or once weekly 50 mg prefilled liquid
      etanercept for totally 48 injections (group II), or 25 mg twice weekly lyophilized etanercept
      powder for totally 48 injections (group III). The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion
      of patients who achieved ASAS20 at week 24.
