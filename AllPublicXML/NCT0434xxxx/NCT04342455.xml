  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess diagnostic accuracy,image quality and renal safety of a double low-dose coronary
      CTA protocol at coronary artery evaluation in patients with diabetes by using invasive
      coronary angiography(ICA) as the reference method and to compare the results with those
      obtained traditional dose protocol. The study will randomly include about 400 consecutive
      participants aged 18 to 80 years old who had been diagnosed with diabetes and suspected
      coronary artery disease.All participants undergo ICA and coronary CT angiography performed
      with a whole-heart CT scan.Coronary segment interpretability,image quality based on a
      four-point Likert scale,blood indicators of renal function will be accessed between double
      low-dose CTA protocol and traditional CTA protocol. Investigators hypothesize that an
      individualized coronary CTA protocol that appropriately reduces radiation dose and contrast
      dose does not affect image quality and diagnostic accuracy, and can reduce the risk of kidney
      damage in high-risk patients.

      The study has been approved by the local ethics committee and allparticipants will be
      provided written informed consent. Iodixanol 320 mg/ml is injected followed by 30 ml of
      saline solution.In the test group,the tube voltage,contrast agent volume and flow rate are
      adapted to cardiac ejection fraction(EF) and body mass index(BMI)according to the pretest.
      participants in the contract group are injected 50 ml contrast agent with the flow rate of 5
      ml/s in tube voltage of 120 kVp. All participants are scanned in automatic tube current.
