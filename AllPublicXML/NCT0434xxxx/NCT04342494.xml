  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9(PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression: The PHQ-9 incorporates self-report questions on 9 specific depression symptoms that align with the DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria. PHQ-9 scores range from 0-27 and 27 indicates severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood as measured by the Mental Health App Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily up to about 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Single Question, &quot;On a scale of 1 to 10, what was your average mood today?&quot; Scores will be averaged over follow-up periods with lower scores indicating worse moods and higher scores indicating better moods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicide risk as measured by the Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Inventory (PANSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 14-item subjectively completed inventory that consisted of 2 subscales: the PANSI-NSI subscale composed of 8 items and the Positive Ideation (PANSI-PI) subscale consisting of 6 items. The possible total scores on the PANSI-NSI and PANSI-PI subscales range from 8 to 40 and 6 to 30, respectively. Higher scores on the PANSI-NSI and lower scores on the PANSI-PI reflect greater risk for suicidal behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety as measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7 consists total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance use as measured by the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ASSIST Global Continuum of Illicit Drug Risk Score ranges from 0 to 308, with higher scores indicating greater risk.</description>
