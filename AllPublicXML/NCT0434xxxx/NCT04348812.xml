  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) across the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), versus sham stimulation, effectively augments the beneficial effects
      of a gamified attention bias modification training (ABMT) mobile app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety-related attentional bias (AB) is the preferential processing of threat observed in
      clinical and sub-clinical anxiety. Attention bias modification training (ABMT) is a
      computerized cognitive training technique designed to systematically direct attention away
      from threat and ameliorate AB, but mixed and null findings have highlighted gaps in our
      understanding of mechanisms underlying ABMT and how to design the most effective delivery
      systems. One neuromodulation technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) across
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may augment the effects of ABMT by strengthening top-down
      cognitive control processes, but the evidence base is limited and has not been generalized to
      current approaches in digital therapeutics, such as mobile applications. The present study
      tested whether tDCS across the PFC, versus sham stimulation, effectively augments the
      beneficial effects of a gamified ABMT mobile app. Thirty-eight adults (Mage = 23.92, SD =
      4.75; 18 females) evidencing low-to-moderate anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to
      active or sham tDCS for 30-minutes while receiving ABMT via a mobile app. Participants
      reported on potential moderators of ABMT, including life stress and trait anxiety. ECG was
      recorded during a subsequent stressor to generate respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)
      suppression as a metric of stress resilience.
