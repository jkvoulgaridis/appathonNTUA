      This phase 2 trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining immunotherapy with a
      PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (Pembrolizumab), an anti-VEGF receptor (Ramucirumab), and a taxane
      chemotherapy (Docetaxel) in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did
      not respond to FDA-approved treatments with platinum-based chemotherapy given concurrently or
      sequentially with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.

      Pembrolizumab helps the body's immune system to attack cancer cells and hasten their ability
      to grow and spread. Ramucirumab blocks new blood vessel growth to reduce tumor growth.
      Docetaxel works mainly by stopping cancer cells from dividing. Ramucirumab combined with
      docetaxel is an FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC patients after progression on platinum-based
      chemotherapy. It has shown to improve efficacy compared to docetaxel alone in this setting.
      Pembrolizumab is an FDA-approved treatment for NSCLC and can be given alone or in combination
      with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Investigators hypothesize that the combination of docetaxel, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab
      will be safe and more effective than the current standard of care treatments (docetaxel alone
      or in combination with ramucirumab) in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC after
      progression on treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy, given
      concurrently or sequentially.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination treatment using the 6-month
      progression free survival rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of docetaxel and ramucirumab in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients who progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy and
      PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor given sequentially or in combination.

      II. To determine immune related adverse events of the combination docetaxel, ramucirumab, and
      pembrolizumab.

      III. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination docetaxel, ramucirumab, and
      pembrolizumab.

      IV. To assess the overall survival (OS) of the combination docetaxel, ramucirumab, and
      pembrolizumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate treatment response with PD-L1 22C3 expression, STK11 and KRAS mutation
      status.

      II. To correlate treatment response with the doublet tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1
      22C3 expression.

      III. To perform an immunophenotypic analysis of circulating immune cells by mass cytometry
      before and after treatment and end of treatment (EOT).

      IV. To analyze the tumor infiltrating immune cells by single cell ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      sequencing coupled to mass cytometry, in paired biopsies before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      After premedication, patients will receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes,
      ramucirumab IV over 60 minutes, then pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each 21-day
      cycle. The combination will be administered until confirmed disease progression defined as
      progression on 2 consecutive scans at least 4 weeks apart, occurrence of severe side effects,
      withdrawal of consent by the patient or if in the opinion of the treating physician
      continuing on the study treatment is not in the best interest of the patient.

      The first six patients will be evaluated for safety data. If less than 2 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity, enrollment on study will continue with the efficacy assessment of the
      combination.

      Participants who experience confirmed disease progression or start a new anticancer therapy,
      will move into the Survival Follow-Up Phase and should be contacted by telephone every 12
      weeks (+/- 3 weeks) for 2 years, then every 6 months for next 3 years, then annually until
      the subject's death or until the subject is lost to follow-up up to 10 years to assess for
      survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs
      first.

    <description>Will be determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Will be reported and its 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method. PFS rates of two patient groups stratified by binary biomarker (PD-L1 and KRAS status), respectively will be estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models will be further used in the multivariable analyses to assess adjusted effect of PD-L1 and KRAS status on the patients' PFS after adjusting for other factors. Interaction terms between these factors will also be tested for statistical significance. The proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated graphically and analytically with regression diagnostics.
