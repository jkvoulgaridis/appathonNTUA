  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, the number of older adults is expected to more than double by 2050 and more than
      triple by 2100, with most of the increase in developing countries. This situation has become
      a challenge to health professions such as physical therapy, since aging involves a gradual
      reduction in the capacity to adapt and an increase in vulnerability to health issues such as
      chronic non-communicable diseases and musculoskeletal disorders. The respiratory system, as
      the rest of the body, is exposed to both physiological aging and disease. According to the
      World Health Organization , respiratory diseases such as trachea, bronchi, or lung cancer,
      lower respiratory tract infections, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are found in the
      third, fifth, and sixth cause of death, respectively, among the top ten.

      Therefore, bronchopulmonary and thoracic pathology constitutes an important problem for
      Public Health, both due to the high number of affected subjects and to their potential
      severity For this reason, the recommendations of the European, North American and national
      societies, highlight, among other aspects, the importance of the prevention of these
      diseases. They also insist on the need to maintain the integrity of the thoraco-abdominal
      anatomical elements and preventive treatment in those at risk, before symptoms appear. These
      recommendations together with the change of perspective that is being taken into account when
      treating aging have led to the fact that in the last decade more research has been started on
      the respiratory system in older people without respiratory problems.

      The aim of this trial is to investigate whether manual therapy, elastic band exercise or
      walking can mitigate the effects of age-related changes in lung function in adults over 60
      years old. Also whether there is a difference in effect between the different forms of
      therapy.

      Study design A 4-week program will be implemented with sessions 2 days a week, 45-60 minutes
      per session. It would be convenient for each group to have 30 participants each. Group1:
      walking group. 40 minutes walking with supervision of the physiotherapist. 2 times per week.;
      Group 2: walking (40 minutes) plus self-administered thorax manual therapy (20 minutes). It
      will be applied in group and supervised by a physiotherapist. 2 times per week.; Group 3:
      walking (40 minutes) plus thorax exercises with elastic-band (20 minutes). It will be applied
      in group and supervised by a physiotherapist. 2 times per week.;Group 4: control group will
      do usual life and assessments as the rest of the groups.

      Oucome measures Pulmonary function: pulmonary function evaluation via forced spirometry
      dynamic lung volumes (forced vital capacity, FVC; forced expired volume at 1 second, FEV1).
      Chest wall expansion: A measuring tape is used to measure chest expansion in centimetres (cm)
      at two levels of the rib cage: upper chest expansion and lower chest. Exercise tolerance: 6
      Six Minute Walk Test. Smoking Index. The smoking index is a unit for measuring cigarettes
      consumption over a long period. Musculoskeletal Pain: visual analog scale. The pain VAS is a
      unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult
      populations. Perception of change after treatment: Patient Global Impression of Improvement.
      Quality of life. Trigger points pain: by algometer. Change in thorax position: Distance
      between acromion-bed. Functional capacity: Sit-to-stand. Frailty: FRAIL Questionnaire.
      Motivation and self-efficacy: Participation motives are measured with the Exercise Motivation
      Index.

    <description>The smoking index is a unit for measuring cigarettes consumption over a long period and was calculated using the following formula:
Smoking index = Cigarettes Smoked per Day (CPD)× years of tobacco use.
Smoking index categories were non-smoker, &lt;400, 400-799, and ≥800. The CPD was estimated for current and former smokers. We defined heavy smoking as ≥20 CPD and mild smoking as &lt;20 CPD.

    <description>Participation motives are measured with the Exercise Motivation Index. The questionnaire consists of 15 statements followed by a five-point rating scale for each statement, ranging from 0 (not important) to 4 (extremely important). Although the authors found that the index was valid and reliable, they advise that further validation be made. Three subscores (0-4) were calculated by summing the scores for physical, psychological, and social motivation and dividing them by the number of statements for each area (Stenström, 1997; Klompstra, 2015) Cronbach's alpha was 0.889.</description>

    <description>All walks will be done immediately after the MT and TB intervention, as this has been shown to improve the synergistic effect of combining the two interventions. The walking sessions will be organized twice a week. The walking sessions will begin with a 10-minute warm-up. After warming up, you will take a continuous walk for 10-20 min, at a target intensity of 13 (&quot;somewhat difficult&quot;) on the Borg scale. Using the Borg scale, which ranges from 6 to 20, participants will be asked to walk at an intensity of 13 (perception of &quot;somewhat difficult&quot; activity). Each session will be completed with a 10 minute cool down period. The objectives of Walinking will be individualized according to the level of physical condition of each participant. The walking group will include a weekly walking goal of 75 minutes.</description>
