  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether emotional working memory training and attention
      bias modification training are an effective neurobehavioral therapy to prevent the occurrence
      of depression .That is whether emotional working memory training and attention bias
      modification training are superior to placebo in preventing the occurrence of depression over
      1 year after training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attentional bias has been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of
      depression. Attentional bias modification training (ABMT), an experimental paradigm that uses
      training to induce adaptive attentional bias, was developed to test the causal model and this
      has therapeutic implications in depression.To test the effect of ABMT on treatment of
      depressive symptoms, a randomized, double-blind, placebo and blank controlled trial is
      conducted in college students who are experiencing mild-to-severe symptoms of depression.

    <description>Maintaining positive working memory training is based on visual positive works n-back task.In this training, positive words are presented on the pictures of happy face.According to the rules, subjects are required to identify whether the word present currently is as the same type as the word presented n before then click the keys correspondingly.Each training session contains 15 blocks which are consisted with 20+n trails.</description>

    <description>Repressing negative working memory training is a dual n-back task containing visual and auditory stimulus.Both two types of stimulus are negative.In this training, subjects are required to identify whether the location of picture presented on the screen or the word appeared in the headphone is the same as the picture or the word presented n before, then react with typing correspondingly.Each training session contains 16 blocks which are consisted with 20+n trails.</description>

The word pairs in each group are repeated 8 times, with a total of 216 trial.Participants received 10 sessions over 2 weeks. 90% of the targets in the training group appear in the positive word position and 10% of the targets appear in the neutral word position.</description>
