  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
      States and other industrialized societies, and advanced age is the major risk factor for
      development of CVD. Advancing age appears to exert its pathological influence primarily via
      adverse functional and structural effects on arteries. Aging is associated with increased
      stiffness (reduced compliance) of large elastic arteries and impaired arterial endothelial
      function that is characterized by reductions in nitric oxide (NO)- mediated
      endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). While several changes to arteries may contribute to
      age-associated increases in CVD risk; the development of endothelial dysfunction and
      stiffening of the large elastic arteries are among the most important contributors. Both are
      predictors of CV events and clinical CVD with increasing age. Although the importance of
      endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening with age are well established, the initiating
      events of these deleterious changes are elusive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced age is the primary and most predictive risk factor for CVD. The investigators have
      demonstrated that there is a pronounced age-associated increase in T cell infiltration into
      the perivascular space around large elastic arteries and small resistance arteries. The
      objective of this study is to determine if and how T cells contribute to age-related arterial
      inflammation and dysfunction.

      Although there is evidence from rodent studies that T cells play a critical role in arterial
      dysfunction, it is unknown whether this occurs in humans. Abatacept, a T cell co-stimulation
      inhibitor, is FDA approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Importantly, Abatacept
      decreases the inflammatory phenotype of circulating T cells. Abatacept will be used in older
      adults to be the first to determine if T cell inflammation contributes to arterial
      dysfunction in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that older adults treated with
      Abatacept will exhibit greater flow-mediated dilation, decreased pulse wave velocity,
      decreased or unchanged blood pressure, decreased inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in
      endothelial cells, decreased plasma free radicals, decreased proportion of memory T cells,
      and experience a shift away from a pro-inflammatory T cell phenotype compared to placebo.
      These results will be interpreted to mean that T cells play a role in mediating age-related
      arterial dysfunction in humans.
