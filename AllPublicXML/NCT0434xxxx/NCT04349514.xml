  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a natural history study prospectively investigating neuroimaging markers of disease
      progression in children and adults with Friedreich ataxia (FA). There will be three
      assessment periods (baseline, 12 and 24 months). The study will include approximately 200
      individuals with FA and 100 matched controls recruited across the six international academic
      sites. Other assessments will include secondary clinical and cognitive markers, as well as
      exploratory blood markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a multi-system progressive disorder with the most prevalent and
      prominent symptoms relating to dysfunction in the central and peripheral nervous system,
      including, loss of balance and coordination, frequent falls, loss of ambulation, dysarthria,
      dysphagia and loss of vision and hearing. Other symptoms include cardiomyopathy, diabetes,
      scoliosis and fatigue. Age of onset can vary but most often presents during childhood, ages
      5-15 years.

      There is currently no cure and no disease-modifying treatment. Drug candidates to potentially
      treat FA are under development; however, there is a lack of well- characterized neuroimaging
      biomarkers for testing their efficacy in clinical trials, hampering this process.
      Establishing disease-specific neuroimaging biomarkers to track disease progression requires
      high-quality longitudinal data from large cohorts of patients, compared to controls. In rare
      diseases, such as FA, this can only be achieved through multi-site collaboration.

      The aim of TRACK-FA is to develop an FA neuroimaging dataset from brain and spinal cord that
      is suitable for assessing the potential value of neuroimaging biomarkers and providing a
      basis for instituting them in clinical trials. The dataset will comprise a range of
      neuroimaging measures to assess changes in spinal cord and brain regions that have previously
      shown to be compromised in individuals with FA. In addition to neuroimaging measures,
      TRACK-FA will also include clinical, cognitive data and biospecimen data. The TRACK-FA
      dataset will provide a unique opportunity for academic researchers in collaboration with
      industry partners to access the images, subsidiary data, and associated clinical data for
      community research.

      This multi-centre study is a collaborative effort across six academic institutions, together
      with industry partners and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance USA (FARA).

Binocular vision will be assessed using participants' normal corrective lenses where relevant. Participants are required to read each letter on the chart. Three charts will be presented, with three different visual contrast levels: 100% (equivalent to high-contrast visual acuity), 2.5%, and 1.25%. The maximum total score across the three charts (number of letters read correctly) is 240. Scores for each individual chart will also be recorded.

In the second section, participants are asked to supply an unrelated word to complete each sentence. Scaled scores for total response latency in each section, a scaled score for errors in the second section, and an overall scale score are calculated. This test is to be administered to participants who are aged 18 years and over. This assessment will be administered to participants with FA and controls.</description>

        The study population will consist of individuals aged 5 and above who either have a
        diagnosis of Friedreich ataxia (FA) or who do not (Controls). Controls will be healthy
        volunteers who are age- and gender-matched to the FA cohort.

    <ipd_description>It is recognised that this project will generate data that is of interest to the FA academic and bio-pharmaceutical, drug development community. All such data (de-identified) will be made available to third parties at the completion of the study after request, with approval from the TRACK-FA Steering Committee. Each site will be required to ensure that participants are consented in such a way that allows the sharing of de-identified data with the community in this manner.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will become available after the conclusion of the TRACK-FA study. The study will be 5 years in duration and each academic site may have a slightly different start and end date.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Data access will be granted on a case-by-case basis after the study has been completed. The requesting party will be required to submit a formal request to the TRACK-FA Steering Committee outlining how the data is to be used and for what purpose.</ipd_access_criteria>
