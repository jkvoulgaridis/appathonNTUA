      This study is a pilot, open-label, randomized controlled trial of postpartum women with
      hypertensive disorders pregnancy and persistent non-severe blood pressure. The purpose of the
      study to provide data that may provide guidance regarding blood pressure management of
      patients with non-severe postpartum hypertension. There are limited guidelines for best
      practice with persistent, non-severe hypertension, and treatment in this situation is usually
      at the provider's discretion.

      Study groups will include a treatment with nifedipine extended release or no treatment.
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will be provided
      the study drug (nifedipine extended release) at an initial dose of 30mg daily in 1-month
      supply. The control group will not receive any drug for blood pressure control. the primary
      outcome is systolic blood pressure at 1 week postpartum.

      Subjects in both groups will be scheduled for a 1-week postpartum blood pressure check and
      routine 4 week postpartum visit. Medication compliance in the treatment group will be
      assessed via validated questionnaire. The primary outcome of this study is average systolic
      blood pressure at 1 week postpartum. Patients will be given instructions on blood pressure
      ranges and specific symptoms when they should contact study staff.

    <description>The treatment group will provided with month supply of 30mg tablets of nifedipine extended release prior to discharge from the delivery admission. Dose increases in clinic will be at the discretion of providers, however a treatment algorithm will be provided for guidance.Treatment group will be given a home blood pressure cuff prior to discharge with instructions for use. They will also be scheduled for a 1 week blood pressure check and 4 week postpartum clinic appointment which standard for these patients outside of this proposal.</description>

    <description>The control group will not receive any medications at discharge. Providers will be instructed to only prescribe new blood pressure medication at subsequent postpartum visits if the blood pressure is in the sever range (&gt;/=160/110). The control group will be given a home blood pressure cuff prior to discharge with instructions for use. They will also be scheduled for a 1 week blood pressure check and 4 week postpartum clinic appointment which standard for these patients outside of this proposal.</description>
