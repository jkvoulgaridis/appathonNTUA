  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about how short-term exercise intervention affects adolescents from
      different ethnic/racial backgrounds with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators will assess the tolerability of short-term high-intensity interval
      training (HIIT) in adolescents with NAFLD, and examine and compare the relationship between
      some circulating proteins to hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, and markers of insulin
      resistance from three major U.S. ethnic groups. Up to 350 participants will be enrolled in
      this study, ages 13-18 years.

    <measure>Degree of steatosis</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Controlled attenuated parameter (CAP) score will be measured via Fibroscan before and after the High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) sessions, and comparison will be made between Hispanic and non-Hispanic adolescents with baseline Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The &quot;Controlled Attenuated Parameter Score&quot; is measured in decibels per meter (dB/m). It ranges from 100 to 400 dB/m. Higher values are associated with increased hepatic fat content.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular fitness will be assessed via &quot;peak oxygen uptake&quot; (VO2 max) before and after the High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) sessions, and comparison will be made between Hispanic and non-Hispanic adolescents with baseline Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). VO2 max is expressed as milliliters per body weight in kilograms per minutes. There is no established normative data for VO2 max in pediatric population; however, higher values indicate better cardiovascular fitness.</description>

    <description>Transient Elastogram (TE) score will be measured via Fibroscan before and after the High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) sessions, and comparison will be made between Hispanic and non-Hispanic adolescents with baseline Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The &quot;Transient Elastogram Score&quot; is measured in kilopascals (kPa). It's normally between 2 and 6 kPa. The highest possible result is 75 kPa.

    <description>Each exercise session will begin with a 5-10 minute low-intensity warm-up, followed by ten 1-minute intervals on exercise equipment (such as elliptical machine and/or bike and/or treadmill), at a high intensity. Participants will have two minutes to recover from each effort. Participants will be encouraged to keep moving between high-intensity efforts. The session will end with a 5-10 minute low-intensity cool-down. Study personnel may adjust the duration and/or intensity of sessions if needed. All exercise sessions will be directed and monitored by an experienced exercise trainer or exercise physiologist.</description>
