      Investigation of post-cesarean recovery among Taiwanese pregnant women.

      Improving postpartum quality of recovery is important particularly for women undergoing
      cesarean delivery. This is because cesarean delivery is associated with significant
      postoperative pain and risks of anesthesia-related adverse effects. To improve the quality of
      recovery after a cesarean delivery, the first step is to find out the most relevant
      perioperative factors.

      In response to this problem, experts including anesthesiologists, obstetricians and midwives
      from University College London Hospital, Royal Free Hospital, London as well as Stanford
      University established a set of 11-item questionaire related to postpartum recovery, namely
      the Obstetric Quality of Recovery-11 score (ObsQoR-11), with a total score of 110. The latest
      systemic review in 2020 also confirmed that this questionnaire is the best option for
      recovery assessment after cesarean delivery. However, for women undergoing cesarean delivery
      in Taiwan, it is still unknown whether this questionnaire is representative or not.
      Therefore, this study aims to include women undergoing elective cesarean delivery from three
      hospitals in Taiwan.
