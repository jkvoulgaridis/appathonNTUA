      The purpose of the open-label, non-controlled, 3-epoch, multi-dose, multi-center study is to
      evaluate serum trough levels of Immunoglobulin globulin (IgG), pharmacokinetics (PK),
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of Immunoglobulin globulin subcutaneous (IGSC), 20% (Epoch
      2 and Epoch 3) and Immunoglobulin globulin intravenous (IGIV) (Epoch 1) in Japanese
      participants with PID.

    <textblock>
      This study will consists of 3 treatment parts (Epoch 1, 2, 3). The total duration of the
      study will be 55 weeks in which screening period is for 2-6 weeks and Epoch 1 is from Week 6
      to Week 19, Epoch 2 is from Week 19 to Week 43, Epoch 3 is from Week 43 to Week 55.

      Each participant will receive IGIV treatment in Epoch 1 for a total of 13 weeks, then switch
      to weekly subcutaneous (SC) treatment with IGSC, 20% in Epoch 2 for a total of 24 weeks and
      will continue into Epoch 3 for a total of 12 weeks of biweekly SC treatment with IGSC, 20%.
      Drug dose in Epoch 2 and Epoch 3 will be adjusted so that it will be an equivalent weekly
      dose of the dose administered in Epoch 1 and twice the dose administrated in Epoch 2
      respectively. Epoch 2 will contain two periods, period 1: dose adjustment period (first 12
      weeks) and period 2: evaluation period (second 12 weeks).

    <description>The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. In this study, 2-7 years (parent as observer), 8-13 years (participant as observer) for Peds-QL health questionnaire will be analyzed. Higher scores indicate better quality of life (QOL) for all domains of the Peds-QL. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Four dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 is a generic quality-of-life instrument that has been widely used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) of participants. In this study, 14 years and older (participant as observer) for SF-36 health questionnaire will be analyzed. Generic instruments are used in general populations to assess a wide range of domains applicable to a variety of health states, conditions, and diseases. The SF-36 consists of 36 items that are aggregated into 8 multi-item scales (physical functioning, role - physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role - emotional, and mental health), with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better HRQL.</description>

In this study, 2-12 years (parent as observer), 13 years and older (participant as observer) for TSQM health questionnaire will be analyzed. TSQM-9 is a 9-item, validated, self-administered instrument used to assess participant's satisfaction with medication. The three domains assessed are effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The score of each of the 3 domains is based on an algorithm to create a score of 0 to 100.

    <description>The LQI is a self-administered questionnaire developed specifically for participants/legal guardians involved in IGIV treatments. In this study, 2-13 years (parent as observer), 14 years and older (participant as observer) for LQI health questionnaire will be analyzed. LQI consists of 15-items, divided into four domains: treatment interferences (6 items), therapy-related problems (4 items), therapy setting (3 items), and treatment costs (2 items). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1: &quot;Extremely bad&quot; to 7: &quot;Extremely good&quot;. Total scores range from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating the highest possible satisfaction with factors such as independence, therapy convenience, social/school/work activities, and health and travel costs.</description>
