  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelopathy from cervical cord compression may induce hypertension and sympathetic
      hyperactivity. Anesthesia may suppress sympathetic activity and lead to hypotension that
      require vasopressor treatment. We aim to elucidate the causative factors for severe
      hypotension during anesthesia by prospective observational study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It had been reported the cervical spondylotic myelopathy may lead to the development of
      hypertension. Decompression surgeries ameliorated neurological symptoms as well as the blood
      pressure. The cause may be the abnormality of autonomic dysfunction developed after
      myelopathy. However, the evidence was weak. We have noticed a tendency of hypotension during
      anesthesia in patients undergroing cervical spine surgeries, especially in surgeries of long
      levels and hypertensive patients. Thus we postulate the autonomic activity is abnormal in
      patients with cervical myelopathy. Sympathetic hyperactivity developed in order to maintain
      adequate perfusion to the cervical cord. When patients are under anesthesia, the sympathetic
      tone is suppressed, thus leading to severe hypotension that require the treatment of
      inotropic treatment. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a good index of autonomic activity. Thus
      we plan to Therefore we will measure the HRV (analysis of ECG) and baroreflex activity
      (analysis of arterial line during the anesthesia) in patients undergoing cervical spine
      surgeries for decompression of cord compression perioperatively. The primary end-point is the
      comparison of severity of cord compression between normotensive and hypertensive patients
      with cervical myelopathy. The secondary end-point is to compare blood pressure and HRV pre-
      and postoperatively. The third end-point is to elucidate the causative factors for severe
      hypotension during anesthesia.
