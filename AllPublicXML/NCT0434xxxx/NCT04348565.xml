  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled metabolic parameters and co-morbidity risk factors cause Diabetes Mellitus as
      the leading cause of a multitude of micro-/macro-vascular complications. According to the
      International Guidelines and Recommendations, people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      should attend diabetes educational programmes periodically and optimize the metabolic index
      of control. In Hong Kong, General Practitioners with solo-practice (GP-SP) have the least
      availability of resources and support in DM management. A discrepancy of diabetes care
      between public and private settings and a gap of clinical practice between public-private
      healthcare settings is identified. In relation to the big population of T2DM is caring by
      GP-SP but no structured Diabetes Care Programme (DCP) is in place. A structured DCP for T2DM
      is in need to fill up the clinical gap and make beneficial to the target subjects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a DCP for people with T2DM in
      primary care settings. It is a multi-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial with
      parallel groups pre-test and post-test design. The evidence-based intervention (DCP) will be
      carried out in a private primary care setting. People with T2DM attending the GP-SP who meet
      the study criteria will be randomly assigned into one of the two study groups, either &quot;DCP in
      addition to usual medical care&quot; or &quot;Usual medical care only&quot; as a control group. The
      intervention group can beneficial in clinical and psychosocial outcomes after the completion
      of the 20-week structured DCP with a greater improvement of HbA1c level, Self-Efficacy in
      diabetes management, Diabetes Empowerment level, Diabetes Knowledge, and Quality of Life than
      those who only received usual medical care at the GP-SP.

      This study is to implement an evidence-based develop Diabetes Care Programme (DCP) for 152
      adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in a few clinics of a general practitioner with
      solo-practice (GP-SP) in community, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing the outcomes
      between study group (DCP with the usual medical care) and control group (Usual medical care
      only). It is believed that a structured DCP can promote greater clinical outcomes improvement
      and behavioral changes in the study group as evidence showed in literature. The primary
      outcomes are glycemic control (HbA1c level) and Self-Efficacy in diabetes management; whereas
      Diabetes Empowerment level, Diabetes Knowledge and Quality of Life are the secondary
      outcomes.

      The DCP consists of two parts, conduct 3 interactive group education with an innovative
      educational tool &quot;Diabetes Conversation Mapâ„¢&quot; sessions by dietitian and diabetes
      educator/nurse. Then it followed by another 8 weeks for delivering two 15-30 minutes
      teleconsultations for patient empowerment and follow-up of &quot;Action Plan&quot; by a diabetes
      educator/nurse. Evaluation of outcomes will be done before the DCP (baseline), at week-8
      (right after the group sessions), and at week-20 (4 weeks after the last teleconsultation).

      In addition, a focus group interview will be carried out after the completion of the whole
      intervention. It purposes to explore and get valuable descriptive information and feelings
      from participants about the intervention and diabetes self-management.
