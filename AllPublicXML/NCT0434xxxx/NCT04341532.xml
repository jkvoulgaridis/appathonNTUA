  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are key events that lead to a decline in health status among CF
      patients, with many never recovering to baseline health. With the advancement of new CFTR
      modulators and other therapies increasing the lifespan of those living with CF, it will
      become increasingly important to have better strategies to manage PEx in order to have better
      outcomes following treatment. PEx treatment decisions will need to take into consideration
      the increasing frequency of antimicrobial resistance bacteria and the need to treat multiple
      types of bacteria at once. The purpose of this study is to analyze sputum samples from CF
      subjects at the time of PEx in order to identify markers of antimicrobial resistant bacteria
      and see how those relate to treatment responses. CF patients will be recruited from patients
      followed by the Adult CF Program at National Jewish Health. Within 48 hours of admission to
      the hospital for treatment of a PEx, subjects will be enrolled and sputum will be collected.
      The sputum will be processed and analyzed for the presence of antimicrobial resistant
      bacteria. These results will be compared to clinical data, such as spirometry and frequency
      of hospitalizations.

        An eligible subject will be a current patient of the Colorado Adult CF Clinic who is being
        hospitalized at the onset of IV treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation, as diagnosed by a
        clinic physician, and who is chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or
        Staphylococcus aureus.
