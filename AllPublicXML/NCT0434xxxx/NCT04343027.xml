  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the orthopedic surgery clinic routinely fill out a patient- reported outcome
      measurement survey prior to their visit. These scores are stored in Epic, but are not
      routinely reviewed with patients during their office visit. Study subjects will be randomly
      assigned into one of two groups: those who have their patient- reported outcome measurements
      reviewed with them by their physician, and those who will not have their patient-reported
      outcome measurements reviewed during the visit. Following the visit, patients will complete a
      patient satisfaction survey.

      This patient satisfaction survey is a modified version of the Press-Ganey Outpatient Medical
      Practice 10-question survey. The patient satisfaction survey scores will then be compared
      between the two groups to quantify the effect of reviewing of patient-reported outcome
      measurements with patients on their satisfaction with the office visit
