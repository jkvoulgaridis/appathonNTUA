  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy microneedling via a professional tattoo machine in revitalizing hair
      follicles in patients with fibrosing alopecia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an open label trial of tattoo machine microneedling in ten patients
      with fibrosing alopecia (five patients with CCCA and five with FFA). Ten healthy female
      patients older than 18 years will undergo 6 microneedling sessions. Over the course of six
      months, subjects will undergo up to six treatment sessions (one session every 30 day).
      Photographs will be taken at each session. Patients will be evaluated at 8 visits over 8
      months with the first visit for screening purposes. Each visit will last about an hour.
      Approximately 30 minutes will be spent on consenting and time for patient to ask questions
      during the first visit. The remaining 30 minutes will be allotted for the investigator to
      determine if the patient meets criteria for trial enrollment. During the remaining visits, 20
      minutes will be allotted for photography, 15-20 minutes for the procedure and 10-15 minutes
      for post-procedure patient assessment. Remaining 10 minutes on visits 2 and 8 will be used
      for biopsy.
