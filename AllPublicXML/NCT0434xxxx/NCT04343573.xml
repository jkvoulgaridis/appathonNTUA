  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to find out whether proton craniospinal radiation
      therapy (proton CSI) or partial photon radiation therapy is more effective at preventing
      leptomeningeal metastasis from worsening. The proton CSI targets the entire space containing
      the CSF, brain, and spinal fluid. The partial photon radiation therapy treats only areas
      where the patient is having symptoms, such as the entire brain or part of the spine. The
      investigators also want to find out if proton CSI improves the symptoms patients may be
      experiencing because of the leptomeningeal metastasis. In addition, the investigators will
      compare the side effects of proton CSI and partial photon therapy.
