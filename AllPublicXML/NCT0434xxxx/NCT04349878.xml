    <textblock>
      In light of the controversy that are already approved but that however still exists regarding
      the efficacy and influence of the decontaminant tools for the management of Periodontitis (,
      the aim of this study was to evaluate, at 6 months follow-up, the post-treatment clinical
      parameters and immunological and gingival microbial profiles in patients with periodontitis,
      treated by either SRP in addition to phytotherapeutic drug or SRP alone.

      This trial was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of
      Helsinki of 1975, and reviewed in 2008. The local ethical committee of the University of
      Messina approved the study protocol and each patient was carefully informed about the
      possible inherent risks of the study and provided their informed written consent 34 patients,
      18 men and 16 women, aged 27 to 65 (mean age 44.2) were assessed for eligibility . In all
      subjects, subgingival plaque was acquired from 4 separate proximal sites at 365 days after
      therapy.

      The Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) was gathered, at the same time from other four different
      non-contiguous interproximal sites using filter paper strips‡ as previously described. The
      levels of IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-α were recognized by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay using an equation with software using a five polynomial parameter. Each selected
      subject underwent randomly, without anaesthesia, at the same time and after recording
      periodontal parameters, the two following treatments: in one, were treated as conventional
      Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) + phytotherapeutic drug (Neuridase), while the other group
      were treated as conventional SRP alone
