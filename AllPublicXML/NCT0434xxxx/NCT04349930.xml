    <textblock>
      This study seeks to exploit bladder cannabidiol receptors as a therapeutic drug target by
      conducting a double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trial evaluating the effects of
      vaginal hemp cannabidiol (CBD) suppositories on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), pain
      severity, and sexual function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with
      an insidious course and is detrimental weight to women's quality of life, sexual function,
      and general health. IC/BPS affects nearly 1.2 million women in the United States and although
      there are currently six lines of treatment, they lack high level evidence and sufficient
      efficacy. New therapies are in high demand. As the cannabis industry gains popularity in
      medicine, research has revealed prevalent expression of cannabinoid receptors in bladder
      detrusor muscle and urothelium suggesting a novel drug target for IC/BPS. This study seeks to
      exploit this target by conducting a double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trial
      evaluating the effects of vaginal hemp cannabidiol (CBD) suppositories on lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS), pain severity, and sexual function. Women with diagnosed IC/BPS will be
      randomized to treatment with a placebo vaginal suppository or a hemp CBD vaginal suppository.
      We will monitor changes in their LUTS, pain, and sexual function using validated
      questionnaires. Our goal is to evaluate whether CBD is an effective, low-risk and less
      invasive treatment option for IC/BPS. Attainment of this goal would demonstrate a potential
      novel use for CBD in our Urogynecology patient population.
