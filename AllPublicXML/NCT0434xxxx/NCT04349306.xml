        Inclusion criteria :

          1. Patient or parent/legal guardian is willing and able to provide signed informed

             informed consent.

          3. At screening, the patient is expected to have a minimum life expectancy of 45 days and
             has a performance status (PS) no greater than 3 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) scale, or a PS no less than 30 on the Lansky score as per the
             Investigator's preference.

          4. Newly diagnosed NHL or AL who is at the initiation of or during the first cycle of
             chemotherapy,baseline blood uric acid greater than 8 mg/dL (473 mol/L) at screening.

          5. If newly diagnosed NHL patient with blood uric acid no greater than 8 mg/dL at
             screening, the patient must be diagnosed with Stage III or IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
             with high tumor burden which will be high risk of TLS.

          6. If newly diagnosed AL patient is with blood uric acid no greater than 8 mg/dL at the
             screening but with a high risk of TLS.

          7. The patient will receive the chemotherapy, and will be confined in hospital for at
             least 14 days after first dose of rasburicase.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia

          2. Patient who has been treated or planned to receive allopurinol within 72 hours of
             rasburicase administration.

          3. Patients with abnormal liver or renal function.

          4. Documented history of hereditary allergy or asthma.

          5. Patients with known deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), or a
             history of hemolytic disease or methemoglobinemia.

          6. Patients with severe infection or active bleeding.

          7. Previous therapy with urate oxidase.

          8. Hypersensitive reaction against rasburicase or any of the other ingredients of the
             study drug.

          9. Patient is not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the
             Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions, or patients potentially at
             risk of noncompliance to study procedures.

         10. Pregnant or breastfeeding woman.

         11. Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not protected by highly-effective method(s) of
             birth control and/or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy.

         12. Male participant with a female partner of childbearing potential not protected by
