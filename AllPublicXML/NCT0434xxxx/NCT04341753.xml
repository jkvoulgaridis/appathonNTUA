  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the recommendations of French and international learned societies, respiratory
      rehabilitation is part of the care of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD). Indeed, scientific work carried out for more than 10 years on the respiratory
      rehabilitation of patients suffering from COPD shows that respiratory rehabilitation allows a
      reduction of the handicap caused by the disease and an improvement in the quality of life of
      the patients.

      A respiratory rehabilitation program (PRR) includes: individual exercise re-training,
      therapeutic education, respiratory physiotherapy, help with smoking cessation and nutritional
      and psychosocial care. Exercise retraining includes training the muscles of the lower limbs
      in endurance and strength combined with training the muscles of the upper limbs.
      Strengthening the upper limbs helps reduce dyspnea in patients with COPD. In order to
      determine a precise muscle building protocol, it is necessary to assess at the start of the
      program the maximum voluntary strength (FMV) of the different muscle groups of the upper
      limbs. Measuring FMV quantifies a possible frequent strength deficit in patients with COPD
      and the effects of the strengthening program. Currently, tests to assess FMV using isokinetic
      dynamometers are used as a benchmark. However, this material is little used in current
      practice. Portable dynamometers are used to perform simple tests and to obtain muscle
      strength measurements. However, the reliability of the maximum voluntary force measurements
      of the different muscle groups of the upper limb has not been evaluated. Studies seem
      necessary to determine the reproducibility of the measurement in intra and inter-examiner
      (Schrama 2014) and to assess its sensitivity to change during a respiratory rehabilitation
      program. The objectives of this study are to study the reproducibility, validity and
      sensitivity to change of the measurement of FMV using a portable dynamometer.
