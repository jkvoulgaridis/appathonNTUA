      Evaluating Serum Level Of IL 31 , IL33 and IL36 and Their Correlation with Disease Activity
      In Patients With Psoriasis In Assuit University Hospital .

        -  To correlate their levels with disease activity using PASI score .

        -  To allow better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease .

      Serum samples will be collected from 45 psoriasis patients and 45 matched healthy
      individuals. After full history taking and dermatological examination, the disease severity
      will be assessed using the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score. All patients
      enrolled in our study had no other autoimmune or systemic diseases and underwent no systemic
      treatment including glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive drugs, or phototherapy at least 1
      month before the PASI score evaluation and sample collection period. Wriiten informed consent
      will be obtained from all the patients and healthy controls.

      Assessment of serum interleukin-31 ,33 and 36 concentrations in psoriatic patients Patients
      and controls Blood samples will collected from psoriatic patients and controls, and will
      centrifuged for 15 min at 1000 rpm. Next, the serum samples will be subdivided into small
      aliquots to be stored at −80°C until analysis for cytokine levels. ELISA kits will be used to
      determine serum IL-31 , 33 and 36
