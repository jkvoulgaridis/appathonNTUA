      Study evaluates these take of diclofenac sodium when used in conjunction with miconazole and
      urea as a topical antifungal nail gel treatment for onychomycosis. All of the patient's will
      be treated with the active formula and blood levels of diclofenac sodium tested for as well
      as monitoring of hepatic and renal functions

    <textblock>
      Tinea Unguium/onychomycosis is a ubiquitous health problem affecting ~3% of the adult
      population. It is associated with higher risk for other disease processes. Effective
      treatment for this disease has been lacking. Oral antifungal agents are associated with high
      incidence of recurrence of disease, hepatotoxicity, cytochrome P450 Pathway interference,
      non-compliance, side effects and cost. No effective long-term topical applications have been
      verified. Debridement of the damaged nail in combination with a broad-spectrum topical
      antifungal agent and an anti-inflammatory agent is a safe, inexpensive and easily formulated
      alternative to previous ineffective treatments. The rationale for debridement is simple in
      that the effectiveness of the topical antifungal is present only when it is in contact with
      the fungal agent, nail bed and involved diseased tissue. The associated inflammatory response
      associated with fungal infections is well-established. The only topical NSAID available in
      the United States is diclofenac sodium. The combination of miconazole, diclofenac sodium and
      urea has proven effective in this researcher's self-treatment of tinea unguium. Miconazole
      and diclofenac sodium are well studied and well-established pharmaceutical
