  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigator will test the usefulness of gabapentin in treating some
      of the symptoms associated with POTS. Gabapentin is FDA-approved to treat epilepsy and nerve
      pain and works by reducing excessive activity in the nervous system. This medication has also
      been shown to be effective in reducing bowel discomfort in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome, sleeplessness, and possibly migraine headache. The investigator has observed
      positive results when prescribing gabapentin off-label to alleviate photosensitivity and
      headaches in POTS patients. The aim of this pilot study is to better quantify what the
      investigator has seen and evaluate whether it merits further study in a larger group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous
      system. The autonomic nervous system regulates major bodily functions, such as blood
      pressure, heart rate, body temperature and sweating. Patients with POTS experience heart
      palpitations, lightheadedness, and increased heart rate upon standing as well as other
      symptoms, such as nausea, foggy headedness or inability to concentrate, sensitivity to light,
      migraine headaches, and trouble sleeping that may occur even when these patients are not
      standing. Because many POTS symptoms are attributed to excessive activity in parts of the
      brain, the investigator would like to study whether some of these symptoms can be reduced
      with a proven seizure medication, gabapentin.

      The investigator will perform several simple tests on a group of POTS patients both before
      and after they have been treated with this drug. The tests will include non-invasive heart
      rate and blood pressure monitoring during a maneuver that requires the participant to exhale
      in a continuous manner as if blowing up a balloon, an assessment of sensitivity to light, and
      completion of several questionnaires that assess sleep behavior and sensitivity to heart,
      bowels, and bladder. Participants will take gabapentin for one week and placebo for another
      week. Neither the investigator nor the participant will know beforehand whether the
      participant is taking gabapentin or placebo. The investigator will then compare the results
      of pre-trial tests to post-trial tests to determine how effective gabapentin was at
      alleviating symptoms. If the trial is effective, the investigator expects gabapentin to
      reduce palpitations, decrease sensitivity to light, and improve sleep behavior.

      Risks of this study may include participants developing side-effects due to the drug.
      Side-effects of gabapentin may include dizziness, drowsiness, diarrhea, dry mouth,
      constipation, vomiting, loss of balance, allergic reaction, fatigue, and indigestion. If any
      side-effects occur, the investigator anticipates that they will be mild because the drug will
      be administered at a very low dose. Any side-effects that occur are expected to resolve
      quickly after stopping the medication. Furthermore, by gradually increasing the dose and
      restricting the trial to a relatively short period of time, the investigator will limit the
      risk of side-effects.

      Doctors and patients alike could benefit from this study by learning about a new use for an
      established drug to treat several of the symptoms of POTS, thereby improving patients'
      quality of life.

    <intervention_model_description>Consented patients are randomized into one of two groups using balanced permutations generated randomization.com. Subject numbers will be ordered and placed in individually numbered, nontransparent envelopes by an independent observer. Trial medication is administered based on the randomization scheme.
Baseline data will be collected followed by a 7-day trial phase of either gabapentin or placebo on a gradually increasing dosing schedule. Post-trial data will be collected on day 7 followed by 1-week washout period and Week 3 crossover medication.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>As each patient is consented, the PI will go to the randomization log which is numbered 1 through 12 and record the subject's study identification number and initials and date in the next available space on the form. He will then remove the large manila envelope in sequence corresponding to the subject's randomization number on the form, open the envelope, and remove the sub-envelope labeled Week 1 Medication. He will remove the packet for Week 1 day 7 and return it to the large envelope. He will then dispense the envelope &quot;Week 1 Medication&quot; containing packets for days 1-6 to the subject. The large manila envelope will then be placed in the subject's study chart until the next visit on Day 7.
The PI will provide a photocopy of the randomization log to the independent observer after each patient is randomized. Only the independent observer will have the unblinding code in the event that an emergency situation arises and the code must be broken.</masking_description>

    <description>The Photosensitivity Index is a 10-point visual analog of scale yielding a score of 0-10 to rate glare and pain after 30-second exposure of ophthalmoscopic light in each eye in a dimly lit room. Higher score indicates greater sensitivity to light.</description>

    <description>The Somatosensory Amplification Scale is a validated 5-point severity scale used to investigate the possibility of perceptual amplification of symptoms. The scale covers 10 somatic and visceral sensations to quantify symptom amplification yielding a score of 0-50, with higher score indicating greater somatosensory amplification.
