  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a standard procedure for severe aortic
      stenosis patients with moderate or higher risk of surgery. Several studies have reported the
      adverse effects of blood disorders, such as anemia and iron deficiency, on the prognosis of
      patients undergoing TAVI, and many other studies have been conducted to find ways to prevent
      them.

      Iron isomaltoside, the latest intravenous iron supplement, can effectively replenish iron
      store with a single high-dose injection. Research has shown that a preoperative single
      high-dose iron isomaltoside (1000mg) safely increased hemoglobin levels after surgery in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, there have been no studies on the effect of
      ultra-short-term use of intravenous iron supplements prior to TAVI procedure.

      Therefore, we investigate the effect of a single high-dose of iron isomaltoside (20mg/kg,
      maximum dose: 1g) on the hemoglobin concentration after the TAVI.
