  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A follow-up study to assess the long-term safety of intra-articular (IA) administration of
      UBX0101 in patients with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded, multi-center study to provide approximately 1 additional year of follow-up
      for patients with knee OA who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled study of IA
      UBX0101. No intervention is planned and patients will have 4 scheduled visits to collect
      follow-up assessments. The primary objective is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability
      of IA administration of UBX0101 in patients with painful knee OA.

        Patients with moderate to severe painful knee OA who participated in a randomized,
        placebo-controlled study of UBX0101 and who consent to having blinded follow-up at the
        study site for 1 additional year of follow-up. Patients are permitted to take

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with knee OA who have completed a randomized placebo-controlled study of
             UBX0101.

          -  Patients who are willing and able to consent to having blinded, long-term follow-up;
             consent via legally authorized representative is not accepted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would likely
             interfere with adhering to the study schedule of visits for 12 months.

          -  Patients who are scheduled to undergo knee arthroplasty on either knee during the
             study.

          -  Patients who anticipate arthroscopic surgery on either knee at any time during the
             study.

          -  Patients who plan to receive treatment with an anti-nerve growth factor agent during
             the study.

          -  Patients who plan to participate in another investigational study (including
             interventional studies of investigational drugs and investigational treatments [e.g.,
             braces, stem cells, and procedures]) during the study.
