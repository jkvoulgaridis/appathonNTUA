      This study aims to determine whether the effectiveness of cinnamon spice capsules vs. placebo
      capsules on glucose tolerance in prediabetic subjects who are overweight or obese.

      Participants will be asked to take cinnamon spice or placebo capsules daily with breakfast
      and dinner (2 weeks of cinnamon, 2 weeks of placebo). The placebo capsule is a study product
      that looks like the cinnamon capsules, but contains no active ingredients. The amount of
      cinnamon will be 4 grams per day. 2 grams will be taken at breakfast and dinner. Timed blood
      collections over a three-hour period will be used to measure how cinnamon spice affects
      glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity in human subjects. Everyone who participates in the
      study will receive each treatment in random order. In this way, everyone will receive
      cinnamon spice capsules and placebo.

      In a crossover study design subjects will consume either cinnamon or placebo with foods and
      before bed for 28 days. The placebo capsule is a study product that looks like the cinnamon
      capsules, but contains no active ingredients. The participants will also be asked to undergo
      an oral glucose tolerance test 4 times (on separate days) before and after the first and
      second cinnamon/placebo consumption. Subjects will take 3 capsules of cinnamon or placebo
      (total 2 g) with the glucose drink (75 g). Timed blood collections over a three-hour period
      will be used to measure how cinnamon spice affects glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity in
      human subject. Continuous glucose monitoring will performed through the entire study for each
      subject. The microbiome will also be examined at the beginning and end of each 28 day phase
      (0-4 weeks and 6-10weeks). Subjects will consume a brown-beige diet during the study to
      exclude the effects of other polyphenol-rich foods. We will enroll twenty subjects &gt;= 20
      years of age, overweight/obese (BMI 25 to 35 kg/ m2) with fasting blood sugar between 100 and
      126 mg/dl or HbA1c &gt;=5.7% and &lt;= 6.5%.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy human adults age &gt;=20 years' old

          -  Typically consume low fiber/polyphenol diet (beige diet see below)

          -  Overweight/obese individuals with a BMI of 25 to 40 kg/m2 and HbA1c &gt;=5.6% and &lt;=
             6.5%.

          -  Subjects must read and sign the Institutional Review Board-approved written informed
             consent prior to the initiation of any study specific procedures or enrollment. A
             subject will be excluded for any condition that might compromise the ability to give
             truly informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subjects with cinnamon intolerance

          -  Any subject with a screening laboratory value outside of the laboratory normal range
             that is considered clinically significant for study participation by the investigator.

          -  Any subject currently taking blood thinning medications such as Warfarin or Coumadin

          -  Any history of gastrointestinal disease or surgery except for appendectomy or
             cholecystectomy.

          -  Eating a high fiber/polyphenol diet or taking any medication or dietary supplement,
             which interfere with the absorption of polyphenols.

          -  History of gastrointestinal surgery, diabetes mellitus on medications, or other
             serious medical condition, such as chronic hepatic or renal disease, bleeding
             disorder, congestive heart disease, chronic diarrhea disorders, myocardial infarction,
             coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty within 6 months prior to screening, current
             diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic BP &gt;160mmHg, diastolic BP
             &gt;95mmHg), active or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, bulimia, anorexia, laxative
             abuse, or endocrine diseases (except thyroid disease requiring medication) as
             indicated by medical history.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Currently uses tobacco products.

          -  Currently has an alcohol intake &gt;= 20 g ⁄ day;

          -  Currently has a coffee intake &gt;= 3 cups ⁄ day;

          -  Allergy or sensitivity to cinnamon. Subjects will be excluded if there is a prior
             history of such sensitivity. Since these foods are commonly eaten and allergies are
             rare, subjects should be aware of this sensitivity prior to entering the study. To
             determine this, a positive history of cinnamon ingestion without incident will be
             requested. In addition, any subject with a history of allergy or anaphylaxis of any
             kind will be excluded

          -  Is unable or unwilling to comply with the study protocol.
