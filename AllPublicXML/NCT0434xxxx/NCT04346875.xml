  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to compare two methods for a relationship with total knee
      infection: regular changing of dressings and not changing dressings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the most dreaded complications that occur
      after total joint arthroplasty. Periprosthetic joint infection remains an uncommon yet
      devastating complication that continues to influence the outcome of total joint arthroplasty.
      (1-4) Although different dressing methods have been described, the effect of changing the
      frequency of conventional dressings on PJI is curious.

      After obtaining informed consent from all participants, parallel-group randomization will be
      performed with the help of a computer. The first dressing of all participants will be done in
      the operating room using the same materials. No drains will be used in any patient.

      Then, according to the randomization, the procedures will be adjusted by the wound care nurse
      with the patient. All on-study and outcome data will be collected by the study staff blinded
      to study group assignment. The dressing group participants will be dressed by the same wound
      care nurse during the discharge. The dressing group participants will be dressed by the same
      wound care nurse in an outpatient service every three days using the same material. The total
      dressing number will be in the dressing group participant 5 times. Both group participants
      will be evaluated in the outpatient service after 2 weeks. Subsequently, all participants
      will be invited to check-in at the end of each month. All participants will be evaluated
      according to MSIS criteria in terms of superficial and deep periprosthetic infection.

      The primary endpoint is to detect the difference between the incidence of periprosthetic
      infection after the regular dressing change and the incidence of the dressing unchanged
      group. In the secondary endpoint, it is to determine whether dressing change is an
      independent factor with multiple logistic regression test.
