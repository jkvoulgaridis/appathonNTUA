  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the functional outcomes of both techniques are comparable.
      However, ThuFLEP might increase speed recovery of postoperative irritation and early stress
      urinary incontinence according to the Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID)
      because of minimal tissue penetration depth of TFL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thulium fiber laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuFLEP) has already shown the outcomes
      comparable to OSP with better safety profile (lower blood loss compared to OSP) and shorter
      hospital stay. TFL has the efficacy and safety proven in comparative trials, being a
      promising rival for HoLEP. The main features of TFL distinguishing it from Ho:YAG is its
      wavelength of 1.94 Âµm (leading to about three-fold increase in water absorption and lesser
      penetration depth of &lt;0.1 mm vs &gt;0.2 mm in Ho:YAG). With identical average and peak powers of
      100 W, the laser does not burst tissues, allowing for clean and precise cutting instead.
      Conversely, Ho:YAG's average power is about 100 W and its presumable peak power is around
      10-15 kW. With such an outburst of energy, each pulse of Ho:YAG creates a large vapor bubble
      which ruptures the tissue. This may be a possible reason for increased irritative symptoms in
      early postoperative period after HoLEP comparing to ThuFLEP. But all in all, the probable
      causes for such postoperative symptoms remain unclear so far, despite the fact that absence
      of irritation and incontinence is ought to be one quality marker of &quot;Pentafecta&quot;. According
      to the idea of high-power impact, probably, decreasing of HoLEP power will mitigate these
      problems. On the one hand, low-power HoLEP is feasible, safe and effective modality for
      symptomatic BPO. However, the results remain controversial and there is lack of LP-HoLEP
      application data nowadays. May be, with another option, for instance OSP or monopolar
      enucleation, it is possible to solve the issues. But the discussion of the past years
      demonstrates that the presence of early SUI is not only a problem of EEP, but also
      underreported in other approaches in relieving BPO secondary to BPH.
