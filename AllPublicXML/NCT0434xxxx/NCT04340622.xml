  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test, for safety and efficacy, a novel treatment for opiate addiction that
      applies a 4-minute treatment of intense near infra-red light to stimulate a side of the brain
      that the investigators determine to be healthier, more mature, and less traumatized.
      Investigators will compare an active and a sham treatment given twice weekly for 4-weeks.
      Investigators hope this will lead to a significant weapon in the battle against the opioid
      epidemic as well as lead to psychological and physiological insights into possible relations
      among trauma, cerebral laterality, and addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is to demonstrate that a novel treatment for opiate addiction is safe and far
      superior to a sham comparison treatment. The treatment is hoped to significantly aid in the
      battle against the opioid epidemic that is ravaging much of the country and the world. The
      treatment consists of using a 4-minute application of transcranial photobiomodulation, near
      infra-red mode, through a supra-luminous LED, to one side of the forehead over the brain
      hemisphere that we determine (through a proprietary test) to have a more positive emotional
      valence. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate that the treatment will be very effective
      in reducing drug cravings, anxiety, and depression as well as in reducing relapses. Aim I
      will offer twice-weekly treatments to two groups, active and sham, for 4-weeks and will look
      specifically for differences in opioid cravings, anxiety, depression, and opioid use. The
      investigators will evaluate participants weekly for safety and efficacy for 3-weeks
      post-treatment. In Aim II a highly-regarded product engineer will work with the company to
      design a marketable product that may have patentable elements.
