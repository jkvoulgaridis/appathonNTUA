    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label proof-of-concept study of vamorolone. Twenty
      participants with a flare of mild or moderately active Ulcerative Colitis (defined as a
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] 10-60) will be enrolled and receive
      vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day orally once daily for 8 weeks.
