  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, an independent set of 8 oncologists and 50 patients will be studied, half
      (n=25) who are under the care of an oncologist who will be randomized to training in the TA
      intervention, and half (n=25) who are under the care an oncologist who will be randomized in
      to usual care. The investigators will examine the feasibility (rate of completion of
      intervention), acceptability (oncologists' and patients' satisfaction), and efficacy of the
      TA intervention for improving the TA between oncologists and Latino advanced cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos in the United States (US), who now
      represent the largest minority group. Latino cancer patients engage in advance care planning
      less often and receive less value-consistent care at the end-of-life (EoL) more often than
      non-Latino cancer patients. The proposed research addresses the pressing need to reduce
      Latino EoL care disparities by developing an intervention for improving the therapeutic
      alliance between oncologists and their Latino cancer patients.

      The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test the feasibility and acceptability
      of an intervention designed to improve the therapeutic alliance (TA) between oncologists and
      their Latino advanced cancer patients. Mixed methods will be used to create a conceptual
      model of the TA between oncologists and their Latino advanced cancer patients. The TA
      intervention will be pilot tested in a randomized control trial. The underlying hypothesis is
      that an intervention based on an empirically-sound conceptual model of the TA between
      oncologists and Latino advanced cancer patients, that supports oncologists' and patients'
      autonomy, competence, and relatedness, will lead to improved TA between oncologists and
      Latino advanced cancer patients, which in turn will lead to reduced disparities in advanced
      care planning engagement and end-of-life care quality.

    <description>Therapeutic alliance will be measured by using the THC, a unidimensional, reliable and valid and measure of therapeutic alliance between advanced cancer patients and their physicians. The THC score ranges 16 (lowest) to 64 (highest) with a higher THC score indicated greater TA (better outcome).</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of a primary component - an educational intervention for oncologists, and a secondary component - an informational handout for patients. The intervention's conceptual framework is the self-determination theory (SDT) of health behavior change. Oncologists will meet with a standardized patient instructor (SPI) for 2 in-office educational sessions: a 60-minute training session and a 45-minute booster session. At session 1, the SPIs show them a 15-30-minute DVD created by the research team. The key module themes and content for the DVD will be determined by our conceptual model of the TA in Latino advanced cancer patients. In the remaining time, the SPIs will engage the oncologist in role-play exercises. Oncologists will complete a 45-minute reinforcement session 1 month later, which uses a similar format.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients include those with locally advanced or metastatic pancreaticobiliary cancer
             (including, but not limited to, pancreatic, biliary, or gallbladder), esophagogastric
             cancer (including, but not limited to, stomach, esophagus, or gastroesophageal
             junction), hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer (including, but not limited to,
             pulmonary, mediastinal, and pleural/chest wall), or gynecological cancer (including,
             but not limited to, cervical, ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, fallopian tube) and
             have experienced disease progression on at least first-line chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer will be eligible only if they have
             experienced disease progression on at least 2 lines of chemotherapy. Patients with
             metastatic colorectal cancer who have experienced disease progression on at least 2
             lines of chemotherapy are also eligible. However, if patients have colorectal cancer
             with a RAS mutation then they are eligible to participate with disease progression
             after at least the first-line chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to identify an informal caregiver, or for whom an informal
             caregiver is unwilling to participate, will be excluded.

          -  Patients or caregivers who are not fluent in English or Spanish, or who are severely
             cognitively impaired (i.e., Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire scores &lt; 6),
             will be excluded.

          -  Patients or caregivers who appear to be too weak or ill to complete an interview as
             judged by the interviewer will be excluded.

          -  Patients receiving palliative care/hospice at enrollment will be excluded to permit a
             prospective examination of predictors of future use of palliative care.

          -  Patients for whom an oncology provider is unwilling to participate will be excluded
             from the study.
