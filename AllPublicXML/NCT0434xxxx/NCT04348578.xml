      Aim: To compare the 12-month radiographic outcome of root canal treatment with and without
      the additional use of QMix 2-in-1 (Dentsply Tulsa, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland)
      irrigation solution.

      Methodology: The study included 60 single-rooted teeth with periapical radiolucency of 60
      patients, randomized into two groups using randomized block design with block sizes of 10
      patients in each. Root canals were prepared with WaveOne Gold files (Dentsply Sirona,
      Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and irrigation was performed with 5 mL 2.5% sodium
      hypochlorite (NaOCl) using side-vented needles during instrumentation. The final irrigation
      protocol was performed using 5 mL 2.5% NaOCl (n= 30) or 5 ml QMix 2-in-1 (n=30). Then the
      root canals were irrigated with 5 mL of distilled water and filled with gutta-percha and AH
      Plus sealer (Dentsply Sirona), using the cold lateral compaction technique. The patients were
      recalled after 12 months and evaluated radiographically according to perapical index (PAI)
      scores. Pre and post-treatment PAI scores were compared and teeth were considered 'healthy'
      (PAI ≤ 2) or 'diseased' (PAI ≥ 3). The Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the
      differences between the post-operative and follow-up images of the treatment groups. The
      Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to examine the changes in PAI score from baseline to
      the follow-up evaluation in each group.

      This randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate radiographic periapical repair
      after endodontic treatment using QMix 2-in-1 (Dentsply Tulsa, Maillefer, Ballaigues,
      Switzerland) and NaOCl irrigation in single-rooted teeth with apical periodontitis.

    <description>The root canal was prepared using the WaveOne Gold file reciprocation system with VDW Silver motor. WaveOne Gold #25 (0.07) file was used for instrumentation. For larger canals, #35 (0.06) and #45 (0.05) files were used after the #25 file. During instrumentation procedure, irrigation was applied with 5mL 2.5% NaOCl using a side-vented needles. The final irrigation was applied with 5mL NaOCl and 5mL sterile saline in the control group.The root canals were dried with sterile paper points and were filled with gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer with the cold lateral condensation method and the entry cavity was restored with composite. All treatments were performed following a standardized procedure by one operator. After completion of the root canal treatment, periapical radiographs were taken using the paralleling technique. All the patients were called for follow-up examination at 12 months, and were examined radiographically.</description>
