  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multi-center study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib 200 mg (2 x 100 mg tablets) administered orally
      QD compared with dupilumab 300 mg administered by subcutaneous injection every other week (as
      per label guidelines) in adult participants on background topical therapy, with moderate to
      severe AD. The treatment duration is 26 weeks. A total of approximately 600 participants will
      be enrolled from approximately 220 sites globally. Approximately 600 participants will be
      randomly assigned to study intervention such that approximately 500 evaluable participants
      complete the study. There are primary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 4, and a key
      secondary efficacy assessment at Week 16. Efficacy and safety endpoints will be assessed
      throughout the entire study. Exploratory endpoints related to hand eczema efficacy will be
      assessed throughout the study.
