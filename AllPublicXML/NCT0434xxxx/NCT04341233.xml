  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 19.5 months project will pilot the introduction of a hospital-based, nurse-led ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) service for patients being initiated on
      biologic therapy in NHS Lothian Edinburgh Western General Hospital.

      It is anticipated that this new model of care will improve:

        1. The time from referral for biologic therapy to initiation of treatment with a biological
           therapy due to the dedicated nurse to see patients

        2. The management and monitoring of AS and PsA patients post commencement of treatment , in
           line with The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines
