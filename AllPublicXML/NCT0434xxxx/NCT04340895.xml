  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence that a therapy of Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
      disease adjusted on tight monitoring of non-invasive parameters, such as clinical symptoms
      and faecal calprotectin (FC) (substance that is released when intestines are inflamed and
      that can be measured in faeces), can provide significantly higher benefit for the
      participants in terms of disease control and quality of life (QoL) improvement, compared to a
      symptom-based approach only.

    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the percentage of participants achieved endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopic sub-score &lt;=1 [normal or mild friability]). The Mayo endoscopic scoring ranges from 0-3 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline over 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as a change in the QoL using SIBDQ over 12 months. The SIBDQ consists of 10 questions, measuring systemic, social, Bowel, and emotional status; each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (optimum QoL). A higher score indicates a better QoL. Total scores range from 10 (poor QoL) to 70 (good QoL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Form Questionnaire-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline over 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health-related survey that assesses participant's QoL and consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems and emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality, and 2 component scores (mental component score and physical component score). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 (poorest health) to 100 (best health) scale with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Escalated to Rescue Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue therapy included systemic corticosteroids/ immunosuppressants /biologics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI: UC) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline over 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI-UC is a questionnaire with 6 questions used to evaluate lost productivity (work time missed and work and activity impairment) during the past 7 days due to UC. The scores are presented as percentages.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hospitalization Days</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Outpatients Visits and Calls (Outside of Study Schedule)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 12 months</time_frame>
