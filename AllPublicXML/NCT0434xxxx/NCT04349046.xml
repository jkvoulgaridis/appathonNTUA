      This study is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized
      post market clinical follow-up study. The objectives of this study are to confirm the
      long-term safety, performance and clinical benefits the Exception Cementless femoral stem
      (standard and varized) when used in primary total hip arthroplasty.

      Six surgeons have prospectively collected clinical data for patients operated consecutively
      between January 2008 and September 2012. The patients have been operated based on the
      indications and contraindications listed in the Instructions For Use (IFUs) of the implant.

      This study is an extension of the surgeons' data collection as an attempt from Zimmer-Biomet
      to fulfill its post-market surveillance obligations by recovering clinical data
      retrospectively and prospectively.

      Study Procedure Flowchart - retrospective data collection: most patients had clinical
      follow-ups at pre-op, operative, immediate post-op, 3 Months, 1 year, 2, 3, 5, 7 years
      post-surgery during which their surgeons collected clinical data. This data will therefore
      only be collected by Zimmer-Biomet after the patients specifically consent to it.

      Study Procedure Flowchart - prospective data collection: The informed consent signed by the
      patient for this study also allow Zimmer Biomet to collect the data of the standard clinical
      follow-up that will be conducted by the investigators at least 10 years post-surgery.

    <description>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common operative treatment where an arthritic, degenerative or fractured hip joint is replaced with a prosthetic device if conservative options are unable to relieve pain and debilitating symptoms. THA was traditionally performed on patients over 60 years old, but now includes young and active patients, as well as very old ones thanks to the continuous improvement in implant design. Major indications of THA include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis and hip fractures. The THA surgical procedure involves replacing the head of the femur and acetabulum or socket with an artificial prosthesis. This system is composed of a femoral stem that is inserted into the femoral canal, a ball that attaches to the femoral stem, and an acetabular component or shell that replaces the acetabulum.</description>

        Six surgeons have prospectively collected clinical data for patients operated consecutively
        between January 2008 and September 2012. The patients have been operated based on the
        indications and contraindications listed in the Instructions For Use (IFUs) of the implant.

        For this retrospective and prospective study, only the patients who had consented to the
        original data collection after their surgery will be contacted.

        These the patients should be capable of understanding the surgeon's explanations and
        following his instructions, should be able and willing to participate in the last follow-up
        visit, and should give consent to take part in the study. The patients should meet all the
        inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

      <textblock>
        At the time of surgery, the inclusion criteria were based on the indications presented in
        the IFUs:

          -  Primary or secondary osteoarthritis

          -  Inflammatory impairment of the hip, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.

          -  Fracture of the neck of the femur

          -  Avascular necrosis of the femoral head

          -  Sequelae from previous operations on the hip, osteotomies, etc.

          -  Congenital hip dysplasia.

          -  Patient is older than 18 years old

          -  Patient had consented to the original data collection after his/her surgery

        At the time of surgery, the exclusion criteria were based on the contraindications
        presented in the IFUs:

          -  Local or systemic infections.

          -  Serious muscular, neurological or vascular deficiencies in the limb concerned.

          -  Bone destruction or poor quality bone likely to affect the stability of the implant
             (Paget's disease, osteoporosis, etc.)

          -  Any concomitant disorder likely to affect the function of the implant.

          -  Allergy to one of the implant components.

          -  Patients weighing more than 110 kg.

          -  Patient incapable of following the recommendations of the surgeon
