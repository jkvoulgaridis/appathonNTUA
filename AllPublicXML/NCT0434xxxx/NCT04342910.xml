  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line platinum-contained therapy.
      The primary study hypotheses are that camrelizumab (SHR-1210) combined with apatinib prolongs
      overall survival (OS) for participants with tumors that show positive programmed cell death
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
