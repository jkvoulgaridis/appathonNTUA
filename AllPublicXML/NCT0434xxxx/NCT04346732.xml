      Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of vapocoolant spray in reducing
      pain related to venipuncture in young, healthy male blood donors.

      Hypotheses:

      H1: Vapocoolant spray reduces venipuncture pain during blood donation. H0: Vapocoolant spray
      does not reduce venipuncture pain during blood donation.

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written
      informed consent. Before the procedure was begun, the donors who agreed to participate in the
      study were met face-to-face and asked to fill in the &quot;Informative Characteristics Form&quot;, the
      &quot;VAS&quot;, the &quot;Blood/Injection Fear Scale&quot; and the &quot;STAI-I&quot; forms.Then the donors were assigned
      to their groups by the researcher.The donors in the control group were not given any
      intervention during the blood collection process. Vapocoolant spray was applied to the donors
      in the vapocoolant spray group. During the blood collection procedure, after the donors' skin
      was cleaned with antiseptic solution, spray was applied to the application site for a maximum
      of 10-15 seconds from a distance of 25 cm. In both groups, immediately following
      venipuncture, pain assessment was made with the VAS by the researcher, who did not know which
      group each participant belonged to.
