                     investigational drug;

                  3. There is a good understanding of the patient's clinical situation and
                     investigational drug proposed use for surgery including the proposed
                     fluorescence detection device;

                  4. All available therapeutic approaches for the patient's disease have been
                     exhausted by the patient and their physicians;

                  5. The investigational drug is considered an &quot;eligible investigational drug&quot;
                     under Section 561(B)(2) of the FDCA at the time of the Expanded Access
                     Request;

                     requested expanded access has been obtained;

                  8. Treating physician understands and is willing to be responsible for ensuring
                     that the patient informed consent requirements are met; and

             3. Clinical trials: Blaze Bioscience lists its active clinical trials on
                clinicaltrials.gov. Before granting an Expanded Access Request for tozuleristide,
                written confirmation by the treating physician that the patient is not eligible for
                an active Company clinical trial is needed prior to consideration of the Expanded
