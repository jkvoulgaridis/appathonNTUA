  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of ultrasound guided steroid
      injection versus ultrasound guided steroid hydrodissection to treat patients with CTS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial. Patients with CTS were randomly
      treated with sonographically guided corticosteroid injection (group A); sonographically
      guided hydrodissection and corticosteroid injection (group B).

      Boston Carpal tunnel questionnaire, nerve conduction studies and VAS pain score were
      performed on initial visit and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks .

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline in self reported pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>patient were asked to indicate the intensity of their average level of pain for the wrist-hand region, using an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 to 10 (worst pain imaginable)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline in median nerve distal motor latency</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the CMAPs were obtained via surface electrodes placed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The active recording electrode was placed on the muscle belly, and the reference electrode was placed on the tendon insertion. The median nerve was stimulated 8 cm proximal to the active recording electrode. Distal motor latencies were measured from the onset of stimulus artifact to the onset of the CMAP</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in sensory nerve conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SNAPs were obtained using an antidromic method and recorded by surface electrodes placed at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index finger for the median nerve and the same joints of the little finger for the ulnar nerve. The median nerves were stimulated at the wrist at a distance of 14 cm from the wrist to the active electrode. Distal sensory latencies were measured from the onset of the stimulus artifact to the onset of the SNAP. SNCV was calculated dividing the distance of 14 cm by the distal sensory latency.</description>
