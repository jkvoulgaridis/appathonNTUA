  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant can help patients with end-stage kidney disease to get rid of dialysis and
      have a good quality life. However, during the renal donation operation, the stress response
      and subsequent inflammatory responses may result in damage to the residual kidney and
      transplanted kidney. Dexmedetomidine can increase urine output and decrease the neutrophil
      gelatinase associated lipocalin level in patients receiving coronary artery bypass surgery.
      The primary goal of this trial is to investigate the effects of perioperative infusion of
      dexmedetomidine on the microcirculation and residual kidney function in kidney donors and on
      the transplanted kidney function in kidney recipients.

      Kidney transplant can help patients with end-stage kidney disease to get rid of dialysis and
      have a good quality life. However, during the renal donation operation, the stress response
      and subsequent inflammatory responses may result in damage to the residual kidney and
      transplanted kidney. In addition, the transplanted kidney will encounter ischemic and
      reperfusion injuries during kidney transplant, and it may affect its function. It has been
      reported in several animal studies that dexmedetomidine can reduce microcirculatory
      dysfunction, kidney injury, and intestinal injury. Moreover, dexmedetomidine can increase
      urine output and decrease the neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin level in patients
      receiving coronary artery bypass surgery. The primary goal of this trial is to investigate
      the effects of perioperative infusion of dexmedetomidine on the microcirculation and residual
      kidney function in kidney donors and on the transplanted kidney function in kidney
      recipients. This is a single blind and randomized controlled trial. The participants will be
      randomly assigned to the Control group or Dexmedetomidine group. The participants in the
      Control group will receive standard anesthesia care for kidney donation operation. Beside the
      standard anesthesia care, the participants in the Dexmedetomidine group will receive
      continuously intravascular infusion of dexmedetomidine since 10 minutes after anesthesia till
      one hour after operation. At several specific time points, participants will receive
      sublingual microcirculation examination by using an incident dark field video microscope and
      blood tests. The chart information will be recorded. The blood creatinine level of the kidney
      donors and recipients at 1 and 6 months will be recorded.
