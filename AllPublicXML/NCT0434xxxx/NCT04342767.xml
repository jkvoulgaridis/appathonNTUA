      This prospective clinical trial will compare the bacterial burden in the wound bed and on the
      periwound skin before and after mechanical debridement with EZ Debride using fluorescence
      imaging.

      After consenting, the ulcers of eligible subjects are measured, photographed and undergo the
      MolecuLight imaging procedure (MLiX). The ulcer is mechanically debridement with the EZ
      Debride device after which a second MLiX procedure is performed. The investigator will then
      compare the two images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic wounds burden healthcare systems across the globe. In the United States the
      cost of nonhealing wounds approximates 100 billion dollars.1-3 The presence of bacteria in
      and around the wound impedes wound healing. Clinicians treat elevated wound bacterial levels
      with mechanical and sharp debridement, topical antiseptics and systemic antibiotics. However,
      evidence on the best methods to reduce bacterial load is lacking. The EZ-1 clinical trial
      will utilize the latest fluorescence imaging technology to investigate whether mechanical
      debridement using the EZ Debride® tool reduces bacterial burden.

    <description>Pain scores (PEG) before, during and after mechanical debridement. Pain intensity of the reference ulcer is assessed before and after any wound cleansing using the PEG score
PEG Scale Assessing Pain Intensity and Interference (Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity). The PEG scale is a validated pain scoring system. It consists of three 1-10 rating scales: numerical, enjoyment of life and general activity. The subject indicates a numerical value that best represents the pain intensity at ulcer site on a scale of 0 to 10 anchored by word descriptors at each end, as &quot;no pain&quot; on the left side and &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; on the right side of the number line. The number 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot;, the number 5 represents &quot;moderate pain&quot; and the number 10 represents the &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.</description>
