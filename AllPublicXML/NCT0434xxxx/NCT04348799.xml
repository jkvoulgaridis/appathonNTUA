    <textblock>
      A prosepective case-control study ,the case were matched with 1:1according to gestational
      age,birth weight and admission diagnosis and divided into two groups according to the
      consensus definition of National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
      Platelet count, circulating megakaryocyte count, platelet activating markers (CD62P and
      CD63), thrombopoietin were recorded and compared in two groups, then, serial thrombopoietin
      levels and concomitant platelet counts were measured in infants with BPD.

        Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the common complications in neonatal intensive
        care units (NICU), mainly occurs in premature infants and is considered to be the main
        cause of premature death
