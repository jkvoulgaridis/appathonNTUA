  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) have become a focus of HIV and other sexually transmitted
      diseases (STD) control in China. Most of MSM who seek causal partners through online dating
      platforms do not know their sexual partners' real HIV and STDs infection status, which leads
      to more high risk status, especially for sexual behaviors. Effective Internet-based partner
      notification is urgently warranted to increase their risk awareness and prevent HIV and STDs
      transmission. This study developed an app which can help MSM to query recent HIV and other
      STDs statuses each other from the testing platform in order that they can find a relatively
      safety sexual partners and reduce risk of HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because most of the recent &quot;Partner Notification&quot; methods are a kind of afterwards remedial
      measures and will fail to find some of the infected MSM, researchers propose a preventive
      measures before they meet together. For MSM who are seeking potential sexual partners through
      Internet, researchers will encourage them to query health status before they decide to meet
      each other in order to promote their healthy self-responsibility consciousnes including
      avoiding HIV and other STDs infection, which will form a real ,digital MSM cohort.
      Researchers designed a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the effect of an intervention paradigm that provides HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and
      hepatitis C status partner notification based on the existing HIV and STDs control methods
      through an mHealth application (app), to reduce HIV and STDs incidences among MSM in China.
      More than 6000 MSM of 16 districts in Beijing, China will be grouped into four arms, each arm
      will cover four indepednent districts of Beijing randomly. The four arms will be randomized
      to sequentially initiate partner notification intervention through the app at 6-month
      intervals. All participants will be provided informed consent in the app after a full
      explanation of the protocol design. Researchers expect that the HIV incidence will be
      significantly lower and the secondary outcomes will also be better after partner notification
      intervention. The feasible and affordable public health management paradigm will have
      implications for HIV and STDs prevention and control among MSM and other key populations.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is not a conventional crossover design,we use a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster-randomised design.The study lasts for 2.5 years, which is divided to five continuous observation periods (every six months).The sixteen districts are assigned to four arms randomly.Four arms began recruiting participants at the same time,and at the first observation period,all groups were given health education and regular HIV and STDs testing prompting service,the two services above are given continuously for five observation periods.At the second observation period,the first group is given permission to query health status (partner notification) through app,but the other three groups do not.At every observation period after that (the third to fifth observation period),the three groups will be given permission to query health status one by one.Once a group is given the permission,it is retained until the end of study.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Because partner notification is a kind of behavioral intervention, participants know what intervention they receive. However, we take efforts to reduce the bias caused by the non-blind design. At the beginning of the research, participants, care providers, and researchers who participate in participants management will not know the randomized scheme. The partner notification will be opened to participants sequentially by the predetermined computer program, and does not need care providers and researchers to implement the intervention manually. The care providers and researchers do not know the implementation of partner notification unless the participants tell them whether they can use the function on their own initiative. Even the care providers know that, the operation and results of the HIV and STDs testing will not be affected. At last, the outcomes assessors do not know the randomized scheme in data analysis.</masking_description>
