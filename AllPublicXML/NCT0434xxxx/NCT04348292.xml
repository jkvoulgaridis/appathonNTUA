  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of sirolimus and durvalumab and to see how well they work
      in treating patients with stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Sirolimus is an oral
      medication that blocks the mTOR cellular pathway which may help the immune system work
      better. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Giving sirolimus before durvalumab may help the immune system get rid of cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sirolimus followed by durvalumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment II. To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus followed by durvalumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment for stage I, II, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus in combination with durvalumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment for stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC II. To evaluate response to sirolimus in
      combination with durvalumab in patients with PD-L1-positive versus (vs.) PD-L1-negative
      tumors III. To evaluate the association between blood mutation burden and response to
      sirolimus and durvalumab

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune-mediated effects of combination sirolimus and durvalumab II. To
      investigate tumor and immune microenvironment changes in tissue samples

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Starting on day 22, patients receive durvalumab
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour. Treatment with durvalumab repeats every 21 days for up to 2
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within a 2-3 week
      period after the second dose of durvalumab, but not earlier than two weeks after the
      administration of durvalumab, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <description>Other adverse events will be listed and summarized by severity, seriousness, and by system organ class. The number and percentage of subjects who experience AEs will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. The frequency of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity grades 1 through 5, will be described.</description>

    <measure>The effectiveness of sirolimus followed by durvalumab will be assessed by complete pathologic response rate in the efficacy population</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>If the null hypothesis is rejected then this is evidence that the response rate exceeds 10% when sirolimus followed by durvalumab is given before resection. The one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for complete pathologic response will be reported. Exact binomial test will be used to compare the estimated complete pathologic response rate to the historical reference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete pathologic response rates for PDL-1 negative and PDL-1 positive patients</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of both the complete pathologic response and investigator assessed response rates per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 rates between the PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative groups will be performed by calculating the lower bound of a one-sided 80% CI for the difference, complete pathologic response for PDL-1 positive patients âˆ’ complete pathologic response for PDL-1 negative patients. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the efficacy in term of response rate between the different groups stratified by other factors, respectively. Logistics regression model will be further employed to test the adjusted effect of each other factor on the response rate after adjusting for other clinical factors and demographic factors, respectively. Correlation of response will be performed for tumor mutation burden using spearman correlation coefficient and tested with Wald's test.</description>

    <measure>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs will be summarized and tabulated by type and grade. DLT rate by dose level will be calculated as proportion (Patients with DLT/Total patients) along with 95% confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the probability of DLT between the different other factors, such as PD-L1 status.</description>
