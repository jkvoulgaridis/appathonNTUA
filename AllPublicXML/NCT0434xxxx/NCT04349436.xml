  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1B study is a multicenter, open-label, study of RP1 to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of RP1 for the treatment of advanced CSCC in up to 30 evaluable organ transplant
      recipients. This will include patients with either previous renal or hepatic allograft
      transplantation and experiencing subsequent documented locally advanced or metastatic CSCC.
      The study will enroll a total of 30 evaluable patients. Patients will participate up to
      approximately 3 years including a 28-day screening period, up to approximately 1 year
      treatment period, and a 2-year follow-up period.

      RP1 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus that is designed to directly
      destroy tumors and to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase 1B, open label,
      multicenter, trial evaluating the safety and tolerability, biodistribution, shedding, and
      preliminary efficacy of RP1 in adult hepatic and renal transplant recipients who subsequently
      experienced advanced or metastatic CSCC. Patients will be dosed with RP1 by direct or
      ultrasound guided intra-tumoral injection into superficial, subcutaneous or nodal tumors. No
      transplanted organs will be injected.
