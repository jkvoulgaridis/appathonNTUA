    <textblock>
      This research examine the effectiveness of a Pilates intervention for reducing the risk of
      falls among adults aged over 65 years. The effects were measured the Pilates classes with a
      supplementary home-based exercises in two phases: Phase I investigated (Mat Pilates
      supervised with a supplementary home-based Pilates exercise for the pre and post-test of 6
      weeks intervention. Eligible 32 participants). The main study randomised controlled trial
      (phase II) investigate whether a Pilates intervention of 12 weeks with a supplementary at
      home program is effective in reducing falls risk factors. Pilates group which practiced
      Pilates and the control group which did not practice Pilates The aim of the study is to
      identify whether spatiotemporal gait parameters, mobility, postural stability parameters of
      anteroposterior and mediolateral (AP-ML), functional mobility, fear of falling and physical
      activity changes.

      There are a lack of studies evaluating the spatiotemporal parameters of gait, fear of
      falling, and physicial activity after a Pilates intervention. The inclusion criteria were
      healthy older adults (≥ 65 years). Demographic details: age, gender, height, weight, Body
      Mass Index, health status, 2 question of fear and previous falls (one year). Screening test:
      The Montreal cognitive MOCA test. Participants were assessed using the following
      fall-predictor measures. Primary outcomes: the 16-item Falls Efficacy Scale-International
      (FES-16), and the Footwork Pro pressure plate system. Secondary outcomes: the Timed Up and Go
      (TUG), the GAITRite system, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the
      Functional Reach Test (FRT). The randomised controlled trial, eligible n=60 participants and
      randomise allocated into control group (no exercise) and Pilates group. The Pilates
      intervention took place at the Aras Moyola building, NUI Galway.The instructor is fully
      qualified to carry out the Pilates programme. The instructor is a qualified physiotherapist
      and has undertaken courses clinical Pilates in Valeria Figueireido International and Body
      Control Pilates for older adults. The video and booklet were built by the PI. The booklet
      contains pictures demonstrated by the instructor. Participants also had access to the
      home-based Pilates exercise video via a Dropbox link sent to their email by PI. The
      instructor demonstrated, explained and showed the exercises through the video to the
      participants during the first supervised Pilates class which participants also performed the
      home-based exercises. Feedback notes and comments were also taken from the participants. The
      participants were asked to give feedback on the same day as the assessments (Post-test).
      Questionnaire of Pilates exercises applied for the participants after Pilates 24 sessions
      supervised completed and a diary calendar of falls during the period of the intervention of
      12 weeks, phone calls and e-mails were provided by the PI.

    <description>Pilates classes were held twice weekly for one hour. The classes were divided into a warm-up, mat Pilates with accessories and a cool-down. Participants used small items of equipment such as bands, circles or rings, blocks, spyke balls and foam rollers. The intervention lasted 12 weeks; the classes were supervised twice a week. The supervised exercises were evaluated every four weeks (frequency and intensity) focused on the lower limb (muscles related to gait), core and trunk (muscles related to posture). The participants were asked to perform supplementary at-home workouts three times a week using a booklet and video that was provided to the participants. The video and booklet to introduce the six principles of Pilates, warm-up exercises, exercises on the chair, mat Pilates exercises and cool-down exercises. Participants were advised to perform these exercises three times a week for 30 minutes at home.</description>
