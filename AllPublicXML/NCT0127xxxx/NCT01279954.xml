    <description>Subjects will receive approximately 10 mg/kg rounded to the nearest 25 mg for the first 6 months of the trial. At 6 months subjects will then be randomized to receive either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg.
Abatacept will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Following the initial administration, abatacept will be given at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion and every 4 weeks thereafter for up to 2 years.</description>
