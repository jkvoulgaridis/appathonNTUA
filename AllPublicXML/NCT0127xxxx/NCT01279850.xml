  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long term use
      with Lyrica in medical practice. Also, occurrence of unknown and known adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) in subjects treated with Lyrica will be monitored during the survey period, and
      whether an additional treatment outcome investigation and/or a post-marketing clinical study
      is required in the future will be determined.

          <description>The sleep interference (inability to sleep because of pain) experienced at Week 104 during the past 24 hours was rated by participants at the time of getting up in the morning on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 10 (totally unable to sleep because of pain). Mean change from baseline in participant-rated sleep interference score at Week 104 was presented along with standard deviation.</description>
          <population>The analysis population for this outcome measure comprised of participants for whom the evaluation outcome of participant-rated sleep interference score was available and who satisfied the inclusion criteria among the baseline analysis population.</population>
