  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is considered a &quot;surgical disease&quot; with no medical therapy
      available to improve any clinical outcomes, including symptoms, time to surgery, or long-term
      survival. Thus far, randomized studies involving statins have not been promising with respect
      to slowing progressive valve stenosis. Beyond the valve, two common consequences of aortic
      stenosis are hypertrophic remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary venous
      hypertension; each of these has been associated with worse heart failure symptoms, increased
      operative mortality, and worse long-term outcomes. Whether altering LV structural
      abnormalities, improving LV function, and/or reducing pulmonary artery pressures with medical
      therapy would improve clinical outcomes in patients with AS has not been tested. Animal
      models of pressure overload have demonstrated that PDE5 inhibition influences NO-cGMP
      signaling in the LV and favorably impacts LV structure and function, but this has not been
      tested in humans with AS. Studies in humans with left-sided heart failure and pulmonary
      venous hypertension have shown that PDE5 inhibition improves functional capacity and quality
      of life, but patients with AS were not included in those studies. The investigators
      hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition with tadalafil will upregulate NO-cGMP signaling, reduce
      oxidative stress, and have a favorable impact on LV structure and function as well as
      pulmonary artery pressures and quality of life. In this pilot study, the investigators
      anticipate that short-term administration of tadalafil to patients with AS will be safe and
      well-tolerated.

      Patients with severe symptomatic AS who will undergo elective aortic valve replacement will
      be eligible for this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study. Prior to
      randomization, subjects will have testing including: 6 minute walk, quality of life
      questionnaire, blood draw, and an echocardiogram. If an initial monitored dose of tadalafil
      is tolerated, participants will be randomized 2:1 to tadalafil vs. placebo. After 4 weeks on
      drug or placebo, subjects will have the same baseline testing repeated. At the time of aortic
      valve replacement surgery, the aortic valve and a small piece of LV myocardium will be taken
      for several analyses.
