      The investigator would like to see if aspirin could block niacin-induced flushing by
      analyzing blood and urine after taking aspirin.

      Phase I: Subjects were assigned to either placebo or aspirin groups. They were given 5 days
      of 81 mg aspirin or placebo. On day 5, they were given a single dose of niacin (600 mg)
      administered 30 minutes after the last dose of aspirin or placebo. The same subjects came
      back for cross-over study and were assigned to a different group. There was a 2-week washout
      period between each treatment. Urine was collected sequentially for analysis

      Phase II: The same study subjects come back for an open label one week study. They were given
      5 days of taking 81 mg Aspirin, taken once daily, followed by a single dose of 600 mg Niacin
      on day 6. Urine was collected sequentially for analysis

      The purpose of this study is to look at the roles of various blood cells and their
      contributions of different prostaglandins. The intention is that by better understanding
      these prostaglandins and various metabolites, it will provide insights into their roles in
      the cardiovascular system.

      Prostaglandins and metabolites are naturally occurring substances found in the blood and
      urine which can act as markers which can be quantified and studied as we will be doing in
      this study. Flushing response to niacin will also be assessed by laser doppler measuring
      blood flow of the facial skin.

      Untransformed and transformed data will be subjected to exploratory analysis of variance
      appropriated for a three factor design with one two period crossover factor and two
      non-repeated factors. Additionally, volunteer's test(s) for paired observations will
      characterize the magnitude of the niacin effect on the response variables within selected
      time points.

        <description>Percentage change of area under the urinary prostaglandins concentration versus time curve (AUC) in response to niacin with or without pretreatment of aspirin was studied.
