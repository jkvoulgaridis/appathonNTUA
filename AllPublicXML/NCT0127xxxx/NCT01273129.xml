      Background:

      - Medically intractable epilepsy is the term used to describe epilepsy that cannot be
      controlled by medication. Many people whose seizures do not respond to medication will
      respond to surgical treatment, relieving seizures completely or almost completely in one-half
      to two-thirds of patients who qualify for surgery. The tests and surgery performed as part of
      this treatment are not experimental, but researchers are interested in training more
      neurologists and neurosurgeons in epilepsy surgery and care in order to better understand
      epilepsy and its treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To use surgery as a treatment for medically intractable epilepsy in children and adults.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adults at least 8 years of age who have simple or complex partial seizures
      (seizures that come from one area of the brain) that have not responded to medication, and
      who are willing to have brain surgery to treat their medically intractable epilepsy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and
           neurological examination. Imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and
           computer-assisted tomography (CT), may also be conducted as part of the screening.
           Participants who do not need surgery or whose epilepsy cannot be treated surgically will
           follow up with a primary care physician or neurologist and will not need to return to
           the National Institutes of Health for this study.

        -  Prior to the surgery, participants will have the following procedures to provide
           information on the correct surgical approach.

        -  Video electroencephalography monitoring to measure brain activity during normal
           activities within a 24-hour period. Three to four 15-minute breaks are allowed within
           this period.

        -  Wada test to evaluate speech, comprehension, and memory centers of the brain, using a
           contrast dye to study the blood vessels of the brain and a short-term anesthetic
           administration procedure to test the effects on areas of speech and memory.

        -  Depth electrodes and/or brain surface electrodes to measure brain activities and
           determine the part of the brain that is responsible for the seizures (seizure focus).

        -  Participants will have a surgical procedure at the site of their seizure focus. Brain
           lesions, abnormal blood vessels, tumors, infections, or other areas of brain abnormality
           will be either removed or treated in a way that will stop or help prevent the spread of
           seizures without affecting irreplaceable brain functions, such as the ability to speak,
           understand, move, feel, or see.

        -  Participants will return for outpatient visits and brain imaging studies 2 months, 1
           year, and 2 years after surgery.

      Objective

      This protocol is being performed provide standard care therapy for patients with drug
      resistant epilepsy and to follow the therapeutic course of patients from pre-operative
      evaluation, through surgery, and post-operatively, and to collect prospective data on seizure
      outcomes following surgery to add to the body of knowledge in this field. Primary outcome
      measures will be used to assess efficacy of

      surgery for clinical care purposes. Any treatment under this protocol will be based on the
      current standard of care for epilepsy surgery. The secondary goals of this protocol will be
      to investigate neurophysiological correlates of human cognitive function and to provide
      invasive monitoring for patients with tumor related epilepsy.

      Study Population

      Patients 8 years and older whose seizures are uncontrollable with medication may participate
      in this study as well as patients with tumor related epilepsy in whom invasive monitoring is
      indicated.

      Study Design

      Patients will be screened by study neurologists to confirm their diagnosis of drug resistant
      epilepsy. Patients that do not have a confirmed diagnosis of drug resistant epilepsy will be
      offered further evaluation in protocol 18-N-0066, Investigating Epilepsy:
      Screening,Evaluation and Treatment. Patients confirmed to have drug resistant epilepsy will
      be offered standard invasive and non-invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures. Diagnostic
      invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes for further localization of their seizure
      focus may be required. The ultimate goal is to surgically remove or modify the epileptic
      focus. Standard procedures to be performed are 1) anterior temporal lobectomy or 2)
      amygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy, 3) focal cortical resection for epilepsy
      that arises outside the temporal lobe, 4) removal of brain lesions causing epilepsy, and 5)
      multiple subpial transection.

      In patients in whom invasive monitoring is medically necessary, neurophysiologic activity
      during cognitive tasks will be captured from intracranial surface and depth electrodes.
      Analysis will focus on the role of neuronal firing and aggregate neural activity 1) during
      cognitive function, 2) in other states such as wakefulness and sleep, and 3) during periods
      of time surrounding seizure activity.

      Drug Resistant Epilepsy

      Patients with drug resistant epilepsy will be followed for two years after the surgical
      procedure and will receive standard neurological examinations and MRI evaluation of the
      brain. Patients who do not have surgical resection of epileptogenic tissue will complete
      participation after the three-month post-op visit. Participants in this protocol will be
      evaluated for potential eligibility for other NINDS clinical trials.

      Tumor Related epilepsy

      Patients with tumor related epilepsy will be enrolled in this protocol because of clinical
      indications arising from participation in a seperate protocol, 16-N-0041 Tumor Related
      Epilepsy. Patients will complete participation after the three-month post-op visit.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary goal of this protocol is to provide standard care therapy for patients with drug
      resistant epilepsy, and to determine the efficacy of surgery for treatment while collecting
      physiology, tissue, and behavioral data for research.The primary outcome measure for patients
      with drug resistant epilepsy is the change in seizure frequency, as measured by the Engel
      scale before and 1 year after treatment. Secondary outcome measures include 1) percentage of
      patients who are able to be completely withdrawn from anti-epileptic medication; 2)
      percentage of patients who are seizure-free (Engel Class I); 3) mean Engel Class one year
      after surgery stratified by the type of surgical procedure; 4) percentage of patients with
      permanent neurological side-effects from surgical treatment; and 5) neurophysiological
      correlates of cognitive function. Outcomes for patients with tumor related epilepsy will be
      assessed under a seperate protocol, 16-N-0041, Tumor Related Epilepsy.
