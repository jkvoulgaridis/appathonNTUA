      The study tests Tomtherapy based Image Guided Radiation against conventional radiation
      techniques for it's ability to reduce long term small bowel toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pelvic radiotherapy (+/- chemotherapy) leads to reduction in the risk of local
      recurrence and improves progression free survival (PFS) in patients with post-operative
      intermediate and high risk factors following Wertheim's hysterectomy. However, adjuvant
      external beam radiotherapy and vaginal cuff brachytherapy increase the risk of small bowel
      toxicity such that patients undergoing external beam pelvic radiotherapy and vaginal cuff
      brachytherapy may have 15-18% incidence of late RTOG ≥ grade II small bowel toxicity. Phase
      II studies using new techniques like Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) have reported up
      to 50% reduction in small bowel doses with up to 30% reduction in ≥ grade II acute toxicity.
      However, there is no randomized data demonstrating the benefit of highly specific and
      conformal techniques like image guided (IG)-IMRT in reducing radiation induced small bowel
      toxicity in patients with cervical cancers. The present study is being proposed to test if
      use of IG-IMRT with Tomotherapy is associated with reduced small bowel late toxicity

    <time_frame>Within 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Acute toxicity will be reported using CTCAE V.3.0. CTCAE forms will be filled before starting radiation, weekly during radiation treatment and on each scheduled follow-up. If any toxicity occurs at another time point additional forms will be filled to capture the same. Acute toxicity difference will be calculated between the two study arms.</description>

    <description>Assessment is done for all enrolled patients to compare the quality of life after treatment with tomotherapy and conventional radiation . EORTC QLQC30 module will be used for evaluating QOL of patients. QOL scoring will be done as per standard recommendations outlined in EORTC QLQ C30 scoring manual. All patients will undergo QOL evaluation at baseline, after treatment and at subsequent follow-up. Scale- Not at all-1 , A little Bit-2, Quite a bit-3, very much-4.
1 will be considered as better outcome &amp; 4 will be considered as worst outcome.</description>
