  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a local multicentric, open-label, non-randomized phase II study of nilotinib as
      a first line treatment in adult patients with newly-diagnosed Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive (Ph+) and chronic phase myeloid leukemia (CML-CP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study of nilotinib as a frontline
      treatment for patients with Ph+ CMLCP. All patients received oral nilotinib 300 mg twice
      daily for a planned treatment duration of 24 months or until early discontinuation.

      The primary efficacy end point was the cumulative rate of Major Molecular Response (MMR) in
      all participants by 12 months. Secondary efficacy end points included the rate of Complete
      Cytogenic Response (CCyR) at 6 and 12 months; cumulative rates of MMR up to 24 months; time
      to and durability of MMR; and cumulative rate of Complete Haematologic Response (CHR) by 12
      months.

      Patient evaluations, including hematologic assessments, were conducted every 15 days during
      the first 3 months, monthly until month 12, and then every 3 months until the end of the
      study (24 months). All efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to treat population.

    <description>Major Molecular Response (MMR) was defined as BCR-ABL1^IS ≤0.1%, on the International Scale [BCR-ABL1IS]) by 12 months. BCR is the Breakpoint Cluster Region gene / BCR gene product and ABL is the Abelson proto-oncogene. BCR-ABL is the Fusion gene from BCR and ABL/Protein product from BCR-ABL. Participants who withdrew prematurely or those who failed to provide data for the study for other reasons were designated as premature withdrawal or inevaluable, respectively, and were included in the ITT analysis as non-responders.</description>
