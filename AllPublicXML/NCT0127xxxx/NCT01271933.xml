    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a controlled release
      formulation of pregabalin administered once daily as compared to placebo in the treatment of
      fibromyalgia. All patients will receive pregabalin; half of the patients will receive placebo
      at some point in the study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation Throughout the Study Assessed by Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 to Week 7 and Week 11 to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>C-CASA was used to categorize and summarize results from the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS) and the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). S-STS was an 8-item prospective rating scale that tracked treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviors. Items 1a, 2 to 6, 7a, 8 were scored on a 5-point Likert scale (ranges 0 [not at all] to 4 [extremely]). Items 1, 1b, and 7 required yes or no responses. S-STS total score range 0-30. Lower score=reduced suicidal tendency. C-SSRS was a participant rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, actual attempts (yes or no responses), and intensity of ideation (rated 1=low severity to 5=high severity). Responses on S-STS or C-SSRS were mapped to C-CASA categories as: Completed suicide; suicide attempt; preparatory acts; suicide ideation; self-injurious behavior, intent unknown; not enough information; self-injurious behavior, no suicide intent; other, no deliberate self harm.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was performed in 4 countries at 50 centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Baseline phase was from Visit 1 to Visit 2. Eligible participants entered single blind (SB) phase (Visit 2 to Visit 6) [6 weeks]. Responders with at least 50% improvement in pain from baseline at the end of SB phase were considered for double blind (DB) phase (Visit 6 to Visit 9) [13 weeks]. All subjects entered 1 week taper phase after completion.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
          <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

          <title>Pregabalin (Double Blind Phase)</title>
          <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase, or placebo. Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

          <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase,or placebo.For participants randomized to placebo, the first week of the DB phase included a blinded taper to placebo. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

        <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Tiredness Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</title>
        <description>The tiredness assessment in the daily interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary consists of an 11-point NRS ranging from zero (not tired) to 10 (extremely tired). Participants rate their tiredness due to fibromyalgia during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 (not tired) and 10 (extremely tired).</description>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Tiredness Score at Double Blind Endpoint Visit</title>
        <description>The tiredness assessment in the daily IVRS diary consists of an 11-point NRS ranging from zero (not tired) to 10 (extremely tired). Participants rate their tiredness due to fibromyalgia during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 (not tired) and 10 (extremely tired).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Double blind endpoint visit (Week 19)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS consisted of all participants randomized to the DB phase who received at least 1 dose of study medication in the DB phase. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

            <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase, or placebo. Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

          <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Tiredness Score at Double Blind Endpoint Visit</title>
          <description>The tiredness assessment in the daily IVRS diary consists of an 11-point NRS ranging from zero (not tired) to 10 (extremely tired). Participants rate their tiredness due to fibromyalgia during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 (not tired) and 10 (extremely tired).</description>

        <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night.</description>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

          <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night.</description>

Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night. Participants rated quality of sleep during the past night by selecting a number between 0 (very poor) and 10 (excellent). Mean sleep quality was calculated as the mean of the last seven days, the potential range of responses at each week was therefore 0 (very poor) -10 (excellent), where higher scores indicated better quality of sleep.</description>

          <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Daily Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ) - Sleep Quality at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</title>
          <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night. Participants rated quality of sleep during the past night by selecting a number between 0 (very poor) and 10 (excellent). Mean sleep quality was calculated as the mean of the last seven days, the potential range of responses at each week was therefore 0 (very poor) -10 (excellent), where higher scores indicated better quality of sleep.</description>
          <population>SBAS consisted of all participants who were enrolled into the SB phase of the study and received at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Daily Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ) - Subjective Number of Awakenings After Sleep Onset at Weeks 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</title>
        <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night.</description>

            <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase, or placebo. Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Daily Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ) - Subjective Total Sleep Time at Weeks 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</title>
        <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night. Subjective total sleep time was the subjective estimate of the total amount of time the participant was asleep after lights out until final awakening.</description>

            <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase, or placebo. Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Daily Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ) - Sleep Quality at Weeks 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</title>
        <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night. Participants rated quality of sleep during the past night by selecting a number between 0 (very poor) and 10 (excellent). Mean sleep quality was calculated as the mean of the last seven days, the potential range of responses at each week was therefore 0 (very poor) -10 (excellent), where higher scores indicated better quality of sleep.</description>

Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Daily Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ) - Subjective Wake After Sleep Onset and Subjective Latency to Sleep Onset at Double Blind Endpoint Visit</title>
        <description>The SSQ is designed to capture subjective behavior in participants with disrupted sleep. Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Double blind endpoint visit (Week 19)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS consisted of all participants randomized to the DB phase who received at least 1 dose of study medication in the DB phase. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

Participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night.</description>

The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at Week 6 - Sleep Disturbance, Snoring, Awakening Short of Breath or With a Headache, Sleep Adequacy, Somnolence, Sleep Problems Index I and Sleep Problems Index II</title>
        <description>The MOS-SS is a validated self-administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) and two overall sleep problems indices assessing sleep over the past week. Score range for Sleep Disturbance (SD), sleep adequacy (SA), snoring, somnolence, awakening short of breath/headache was 0-100, where higher score=greater SD; greater SA; greater snoring; greater somnolence; greater shortness of breath/headache respectively. Quantity of Sleep (range-0 to 24 hours; higher scores/hours=greater quantity of sleep). Sleep Problem Index I and II: Score Range=0 to 100; higher scores =greater sleep problems. Optimal Sleep (assessed as yes or no), 'Yes' =optimal sleep (average 7-8 hours/night); 'No' =not optimal sleep.</description>

            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at Week 19- Quantity of Sleep</title>
        <description>The MOS-SS is a validated self-administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) and two overall sleep problems indices assessing sleep over the past week. Score range for Sleep Disturbance (SD), sleep adequacy (SA), snoring, somnolence, awakening short of breath/headache was 0-100, where higher score=greater SD; greater SA; greater snoring; greater somnolence; greater shortness of breath/headache respectively. Quantity of Sleep (range-0 to 24 hours; higher scores/hours=greater quantity of sleep). Sleep Problem Index I and II: Score Range=0 to 100; higher scores =greater sleep problems. Optimal Sleep (assessed as yes or no), 'Yes' =optimal sleep (average 7-8 hours/night); 'No' =not optimal sleep.</description>

Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

          <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at Week 19- Quantity of Sleep</title>
          <description>The MOS-SS is a validated self-administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) and two overall sleep problems indices assessing sleep over the past week. Score range for Sleep Disturbance (SD), sleep adequacy (SA), snoring, somnolence, awakening short of breath/headache was 0-100, where higher score=greater SD; greater SA; greater snoring; greater somnolence; greater shortness of breath/headache respectively. Quantity of Sleep (range-0 to 24 hours; higher scores/hours=greater quantity of sleep). Sleep Problem Index I and II: Score Range=0 to 100; higher scores =greater sleep problems. Optimal Sleep (assessed as yes or no), 'Yes' =optimal sleep (average 7-8 hours/night); 'No' =not optimal sleep.</description>

        <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at Week 6</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in FIQ Score at Week 19</title>
        <description>The FIQ is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire. FIQ contains 10 subscales, which are combined to yield a total score. There are 11 questions that are related specifically to physical functioning (item 1). The remaining questions assess pain, fatigue, stiffness, difficulty working, and symptoms of anxiousness and depression. The FIQ is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>

Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

        <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) at Week 6</title>
        <description>The MFI is a 20-item, self-administered questionnaire designed to measure the following dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. Items are summed to form subscale scores; there is no overall score. The score range is from 4 to 20, where higher scores indicate greater dysfunction.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
        <population>SBAS consisted of all participants who were enrolled into the SB phase of the study and received at least 1 dose of study medication.</population>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire at Week 6</title>
        <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which disease state affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Subscale scores include percent work time missed due to the health problem; percent impairment while working due to problem; percent overall work impairment due to problem; and percent activity impairment due to problem. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
        <population>SBAS consisted of all participants who were enrolled into the SB phase of the study and received at least 1 dose of study medication.</population>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline WPAI Questionnaire at Week 19</title>
        <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which disease state affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Subscale scores include percent work time missed due to the health problem; percent impairment while working due to problem; percent overall work impairment due to problem; and percent activity impairment due to problem. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

            <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase, or placebo. Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

        <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Actigraphy Functional/Sleep Assessment - Total Sleep Time at Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7</title>
        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Total sleep time = number of minutes asleep between time of sleep onset to morning awakening.</description>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Minutes of interrupted sleep = minutes awake after sleep onset (analogous to wake-time after sleep onset from polysomnography measurements).</description>

        <title>Single-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline at in Actigraphy Functional/Sleep Assessment - Sleep Fragmentation Index Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7</title>
        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Sleep fragmentation index = a measure of sleep relatedness. Sleep fragmentation index calculated from analysis of the periods that participant was not moving (immobile bouts). It is number of immobile bouts that were exactly 1 minute long divided by total number of immobile bouts. Value ranges from 0-100 percent, with low number representing more restful sleep.</description>

        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Percent sedentary = percent of daytime spent in sedentary activities as determined by the activity counts measured each minute.</description>

            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Actigraphy Functional/Sleep Assessment - Minutes of Interrupted Sleep at Weeks 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</title>
        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Minutes of interrupted sleep = minutes awake after sleep onset (analogous to wake-time after sleep onset from polysomnography measurements).</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Actigraphy Functional/Sleep Assessment - Sleep Fragmentation Index at Weeks 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</title>
        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Sleep fragmentation index = a measure of sleep relatedness. Sleep fragmentation index calculated from analysis of the periods that participant was not moving (immobile bouts). It is number of immobile bouts that were exactly 1 minute long divided by total number of immobile bouts. Value ranges from 0-100 percent, with low number representing more restful sleep.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Actigraphy Functional/Sleep Assessment - Total Daytime Activity at Weeks 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</title>
        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Total daytime activity = total activity &quot;counts&quot; during the day.</description>

        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Sleep fragmentation index = a measure of sleep relatedness. Sleep fragmentation index calculated from analysis of the periods that participant was not moving (immobile bouts). It is number of immobile bouts that were exactly 1 minute long divided by total number of immobile bouts. Value ranges from 0-100 percent, with low number representing more restful sleep.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind Phase: Change From Baseline in Actigraphy Functional/Sleep Assessment - Percent Sedentary at Double Blind End Point Visit (Week 19)</title>
        <description>Actigraphy was assessed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist. The accelerometer was programmed to record movements. This information was used to calculate several endpoints reflecting daytime activity, and sleep quality and duration. Percent sedentary = percent of daytime spent in sedentary activities as determined by the activity counts measured each minute.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation Throughout the Study Assessed by Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA)</title>
        <description>C-CASA was used to categorize and summarize results from the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS) and the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). S-STS was an 8-item prospective rating scale that tracked treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviors. Items 1a, 2 to 6, 7a, 8 were scored on a 5-point Likert scale (ranges 0 [not at all] to 4 [extremely]). Items 1, 1b, and 7 required yes or no responses. S-STS total score range 0-30. Lower score=reduced suicidal tendency. C-SSRS was a participant rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, actual attempts (yes or no responses), and intensity of ideation (rated 1=low severity to 5=high severity). Responses on S-STS or C-SSRS were mapped to C-CASA categories as: Completed suicide; suicide attempt; preparatory acts; suicide ideation; self-injurious behavior, intent unknown; not enough information; self-injurious behavior, no suicide intent; other, no deliberate self harm.</description>

            <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
            <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

      <desc>The same event may appear as both an AE and a serious AE. However, what is presented are distinct events. An event may be categorized as serious in one participant and as nonserious in another participant, or one participant may have experienced both a serious and nonserious event during the study.</desc>

          <title>Pregabalin (Single Blind Phase)</title>
          <description>Participants were treated with pregabalin 165 mg/day during the initial week of the SB phase.Subsequently, the pregabalin dose could have been increased based on efficacy and tolerability at each weekly visit (Visit 3 [Week 1], Visit 4 [Week 2], and Visit 5 [Week 3]).The dose could have been decreased at or between the weekly visits,up to and including Visit 5 (Week 3). The dose could only be changed by 1 step (up or down) at a time (eg, 165 mg/day to 330 mg/day, or 495 mg/day to 330 mg/day).After the end of the third week of the SB phase (Visit 5), no further dose optimization was permitted. Participants unable to tolerate a dose of at least 330 mg/day by Visit 5 (Week 3) were discontinued from the study.During the next 3 weeks of the SB phase, the optimized dose was provided. Participants unable to tolerate the optimized dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.</description>

          <title>Pregabalin (Double Blind Phase)</title>
          <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase, or placebo. Participants randomized to pregabalin, received pregabalin at the optimized dose (330 to 495 mg/day) during the first week and thereafter. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>

          <description>At Visit 6 (Week 6), participants were randomized to receive either pregabalin at the optimized dose determined during the SB phase,or placebo.For participants randomized to placebo, the first week of the DB phase included a blinded taper to placebo. After DB baseline, all observed and volunteered AEs regardless of treatment or casually related to investigational product(s) were reported.</description>
