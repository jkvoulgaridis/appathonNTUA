      This study will look to see how well patients with relapsed or recurrent intracranial germ
      cell tumors respond to the new combination of chemotherapy (in induction)of Gemcitabine,
      Paclitaxel and Oxaliplatin (GemPOx) followed by consolidation chemotherapy and autologous
      stem cell rescue.

          -  Patients with histologically proven germinoma and MMGCT, including endodermal sinus
             tumor (yolk sac tumor), embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma and mixed germ cell tumor
             will be eligible for the study.

          -  Patients with mature/immature teratoma who have tumor marker elevations are eligible
             on this study.

          -  Patient with ONLY mature and/or immature teratoma are ineligible in the absence of the
             tumor marker elevations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             marker elevations are excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who have received previously a high dose chemotherapy regimen and autologous
             transplant are excluded from this study.

          -  Patients who have received gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and/or paclitaxel are excluded
             from this study.
