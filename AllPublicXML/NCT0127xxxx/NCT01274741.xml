    <textblock>
      This study compares Creating Change, a new past-focused behavioral therapy for posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD)/substance use disorder (SUD), to Seeking Safety, an evidence-based
      present-focused behavioral therapy for PTSD/SUD.

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a new behavioral therapy model, Creating Change (CC) for PTSD/SUD. CC
      helps clients explore the past as a step in their recovery process. It has major public
      health relevance in that it is a low-cost, flexible model designed for all trauma and
      substance abuse types, both genders, and all clinical settings. It has particular relevance
      for VA in that many veterans suffer from PTSD and SUD. The new model demonstrated positive
      results in two pilot studies.

    <description>Creating Change is a past-focused, integrated, cognitive-behavioral therapy for PTSD/SUD. It has 17 topics, which in this study were delivered in weekly one-hour sessions, in individual format. The treatment explores how PTSD and SUD arose and interacted across the patient's life, including constructing a narrative of its meaning, processing associated emotions and memories, and exploring themes related to these.</description>
