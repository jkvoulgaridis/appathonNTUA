    <textblock>
      This study will test the idea that using an experimental mouth rinse after each time you
      brush your teeth will result in a healthier mouth than using the regular mouth rinse.
      Participants will be expected to avoid oral hygiene (like brushing teeth or using mouthwash)
      for at least 12 hours before each visit and will not be allowed to eat, drink or smoke for at
      least 4 hours before each visit.

      At the first visit, the study will be explained to you in detail and you will be allowed to
      ask any questions you may have before signing a consent form. You will complete a
      medical/dental history and the dentist will examine your mouth, during which he will poke
      your gums and scrape some plaque off your teeth for testing. If you do not meet the
      requirements to continue in the trial, you will be told that you do not need to return for
      more testing.

      If you meet requirements to continue, you will have an equal chance of being assigned to use
      either of the two mouth rinses being studied. You will be given a diary, toothbrush,
      toothpaste, and your assigned mouth rinse, with instructions on how they must be used.

      You will be instructed not to use any unassigned oral care products and to follow your usual
      eating habits. You will be given appointments to return two times within the next four weeks.
      At those visits, the staff will check to make sure you're following the instructions and ask
      how you're feeling, and the dentist will do the same thing he did during the first visit.

      The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled,
      parallel-designed clinical study is to determine the efficacy of an experimental mouth rinse
      on whole-mouth mean plaque and gingivitis scores as an adjunct to brushing after four weeks
      of use.

      The secondary objectives will be to determine the efficacy of the an experimental mouth rinse
      as an adjunct to brushing on whole-mouth mean plaque and gingivitis measured at 2 weeks as
      well as a bleeding assessment according to the Bleeding Index at 2 and 4 weeks. A
      microbiological assessment will be performed to identify and quantify specific oral microbes
      to assess any change in population.

    <measure>Microbiological Assessments - Absolute Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An assay (a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization) was conducted to estimate the number of bacterial cells in collected plaque samples. First, the bacterial cells were lysed (split open) in solution. DNA from the bacteria was then detected using fluorescent probes for different bacterial species. The sensitivity of the assay was 10^4 cells and failure to detect a signal was recorded as zero. Signals were converted to absolute counts by comparison with the fluorescent signal of standards of known concentrations.
The following hybridized categories of bacteria were analyzed:
Actinomyces species
Purple complex
Yellow complex
Green complex
Orange complex
Red complex
Other species</description>

          <title>Microbiological Assessments - Absolute Counts</title>
          <description>A checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was conducted to estimate the # of bacterial cells in plaque samples. DNA from lysed bacteria cells was detected using fluorescent probes for different bacterial species. The sensitivity of the assay was 10^4 cells; failure to detect a signal was recorded as 0. Signals were converted to absolute counts by comparison with fluorescent signals of standards of known concentrations.

        <title>Microbiological Assessments - Absolute Counts</title>
        <description>An assay (a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization) was conducted to estimate the number of bacterial cells in collected plaque samples. First, the bacterial cells were lysed (split open) in solution. DNA from the bacteria was then detected using fluorescent probes for different bacterial species. The sensitivity of the assay was 10^4 cells and failure to detect a signal was recorded as zero. Signals were converted to absolute counts by comparison with the fluorescent signal of standards of known concentrations.
