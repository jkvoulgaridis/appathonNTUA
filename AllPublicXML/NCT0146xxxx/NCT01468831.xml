    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away
      from the retina in the back of the eye. It often leads to macular edema, a swelling of the
      retina that is a common source of vision loss. Studies suggest that inflammation might be a
      cause. Minocycline is a drug that might help prevent cells involved in inflammation from
      becoming activated. It is approved for use as an antibiotic, but it has not yet been tested
      to see if it can treat BRVO.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for branch retinal vein
      occlusion.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have branch retinal vein occlusion in at least one
      eye, with vision between 20/32 and 20/200.

      Design:

        -  This study lasts 2 years, with at least 25 visits. Participants must agree to protect
           themselves from sunlight or artificial ultraviolet rays while in this study.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood tests and an eye exam. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive
           the medicine.

        -  Those in the study will take minocycline or a placebo pill twice a day, about 12 hours
           apart, for 2 years.

        -  Participants will have monthly visits for blood tests and full eye exams to study the
           effect of the treatment. Other exams may include thyroid tests and eye imaging studies.
           Those in the study may also receive injections of a drug to prevent the growth of new
           blood vessels in the eye.

      Objective:

      Retinal vein occlusions (RVO) are significant sources of vision loss, affecting mostly
      healthy people over 55 years of age. The common source of vision loss is the macular edema
      accompanying the retinal injury. Very recently, studies employing monthly anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments have demonstrated a benefit to this line of
      treatment; however, the duration of effectiveness appears to be short lived and the length of
      time needed for these monthly injections remains unknown. A histologic study of human retinas
      with RVOs found the presence of activated microglia. Microglia are capable of migrating
      through the retina to sites of inflammation to associate closely with neurons and the
      vasculature, and are key cellular players in the mediation of processes of chronic
      inflammation. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising cellular target for forms of
      therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes found in vein occlusions.
      Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory
      properties, including microglia inhibition. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of minocycline as a microglia inhibitor in participants with branch
      retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).

      Study Population:

      A minimum of ten and a maximum of 20 participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be
      enrolled. Eligibility criteria include: foveal center-involved macular edema secondary to a
      BRVO, retinal thickness in the central subfield greater than 350 microns as measured by
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity (VA) between 20/32 and 20/200 in the
      study eye.

      Design:

      In this pilot, double-masked, randomized, multi- center study, participants will receive
      monthly bevacizumab injections for the first three months, followed by PRN dosing. In
      addition, participants will take an oral dose of 100 mg of minocycline or placebo twice daily
      for 24 months. During each monthly visit, participants will have their visual acuity measured
      and will undergo OCT testing to measure retinal thickness. At the Month 3 visit and
      thereafter, participants will be evaluated for &quot;improvement&quot; and &quot;worsening&quot; and will be
      eligible for additional bevacizumab treatment and/or investigational product (IP) depending
      on which criteria they fulfill. Additionally, at Month 12, participants will also be
      evaluated for no improvement.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome is the difference in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      as measured in ETDRS letters, between the minocycline and placebo groups in the study eye at
      12 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the difference between the
      minocycline and placebo groups in the number of intravitreal bevacizumab injections between
      12 and 24 months and baseline, changes in mean macular sensitivity as measured by
      microperimetry at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline,

      the mean change in BCVA at 24 months compared to baseline, the changes in retinal thickness
      as measured by OCT at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, number of participants
      improving greater than or equal to 1 logOCT scale step at 12 and 24 months compared to
      baseline, as well as changes in fluid leakage in the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein
      angiography at 12 and 24 months compared to baseline. Safety outcomes include the number of
      participant withdrawals, the number and severity of systemic and ocular toxicities and the
      number of adverse events.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met, where applicable:

          -  Participant is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Participant must understand and sign the protocol s informed consent document.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding
             and must be willing to undergo serum (BRC sites only) and urine pregnancy tests
             throughout the study.

          -  For the NEI Site: Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants
             able to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or
             vasectomy, be completely abstinent from intercourse or must agree to practice two
             acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study and for one
             week after study medication discontinuation (based on the half life of minocycline
             which is 11-22 hours). Acceptable methods of contraception include:

               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal
                  patch or vaginal ring),

               -  intrauterine device,

               -  barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or

               -  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

        Oral birth control pills must be used with caution as minocycline decreases the
        effectiveness of some oral contraceptives. Participants already taking oral contraceptives
        may continue to use them, but must agree to use at least one other method of birth control
        while on study.

        For the BRC Sites: Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants able
        to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or vasectomy,
        or be completely abstinent from intercourse.

        Male participants or male partners (of female participants) who have not had a vasectomy or
        are not abstinent are required to use a condom with spermicide throughout the course of the
        study and for one week after study medication discontinuation (based on the half life of
        minocycline which is 11-22 hours). Female participants of childbearing potential or female
        partners (of male participants) of childbearing potential must practice one of the below
        acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study and for one week
        after study medication discontinuation:

          1. hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills*, injected hormones, dermal patch or
             vaginal ring),

          2. intrauterine device,

          3. barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm) with spermicide, or

          4. surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

             Abstinence is only acceptable when it is the participant s preferred and usual
             lifestyle choice. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

             Oral birth control pills must be used with caution as minocycline decreases the
             effectiveness of some oral contraceptives. Participants already taking oral
             contraceptives may continue to use them, but must agree to use at least one other
             method of birth control while on study.

             It should be noted that two forms of contraception (as specified above) will be used
             by sexually active participants for the duration of the study and for one week after
             study medication discontinuation.

               -  Participants must agree to notify the study investigator or coordinator if any of
                  their doctors initiate a new medication during the course of the study.

               -  Participant must have normal renal function and liver function or have mild
                  abnormalities not above grade 1 as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for
                  Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE).

               -  Participant must agree to minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays and
                  to wear protective clothing, sunglasses and sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) if s/he
                  must be out in the sun.

               -  Participant has at least one eye that meets the study eye criteria listed in
                  Section 3.2.

               -  Participant has a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
                  preclude participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including
                  blood pressure and glycemic control).

               -  Participant has a history of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney
                  transplant.

               -  Participant has a history of chronic hepatitis or liver failure.

               -  Participant has an allergy or hypersensitivity to minocycline or any drug in the
                  tetracycline family.

               -  Participant is currently taking a tetracycline medication.

                  within three months prior to study entry.

               -  Participant has a history of thyroid cancer.

             Study Eye Eligibility Criteria:

             -The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of
             the exclusion criteria listed below:

               -  Study Eye Inclusion Criteria:

                    -  The study eye has a best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score between 78 and
                       34 letters (i.e., between 20/32 and 20/200).

                    -  The study eye shows evidence of definite retinal thickening due to a BRVO
                       based on clinical examination involving the center of the macula that is not
                       refractory to further therapy as based on the investigator s clinical
                       judgment. BRVO is defined as an eye that had retinal hemorrhage or other
                       biomicroscopic evidence of RVO (e.g., telangiectatic capillary bed) and a
                       dilated (or previously dilated) venous system in one or two quadrants or
                       less of the retina drained by the affected vein. Hemiretinal vein occlusion
                       (HRVO) is an RVO that involves two altitudinal quadrants. In this study,
                       eyes with a HRVO will be considered a BRVO and are given the same treatment
                       as BRVO eyes.

                    -  The study eye has retinal thickness in the central subfield on baseline OCT
                       measurement &gt;350 microns, as measured by Zeiss Cirrus spectral domain OCT,
                       or an equivalent retinal thickness on a similar OCT machine.

                    -  The study eye has media clarity and pupillary dilation sufficient for
                       adequate fundus photographs. Furthermore, the participant must be able to
                       cooperate during the procedure for accurate fundus photographs.

               -  Study Eye Exclusion Criteria:

                    -  The study eye has macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than
                       BRVO.

                    -  An eye should not be considered eligible if:

                         -  The macular edema is considered to be related to cataract extraction,
                            or

                         -  Clinical examination and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface
                            disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the
                            primary cause of the macular edema, or

                         -  Clinical examination, medical history and/or fluorescein angiography
                            suggest that diabetic retinopathy is the primary cause of the edema.

                         -  The study eye has a history of a recurrent RVO.

                         -  The study eye has a history of RVO present for &gt; 18 months.

                         -  A brisk afferent pupillary defect (APD) is present in the study eye.

                         -  An ocular condition is present in the study eye such that, in the
                            opinion of the investigator, visual acuity would not improve from
                            resolution of macular edema

                            (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard
                            exudates, laser scar at fovea, non-retinal condition).

                         -  An ocular condition (other than RVO) is present that, in the opinion of
                            the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity
                            during the course of the study

                            (e.g., uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular
                            glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

                         -  A substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is
                            likely to be decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e.,
                            cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was
                            otherwise normal) is present in the study eye.

                         -  The study eye has had panretinal or sectoral scatter photocoagulation
                            (PRP) within four months prior to study entry.

                         -  The study eye has had pars plana vitrectomy within six months prior to
                            study entry.

                         -  The study eye has undergone major ocular surgery (including cataract
                            extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within three
                            months prior to study entry.

                         -  A yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) capsulotomy has been performed on the
                            study eye within two months prior to study entry.

                         -  The study eye has had treatment &lt; 3 months prior to study entry of
                            intravitreal or periocular steroid injections.

                         -  The study eye has had treatment &lt; 28 days prior to study entry of
                            intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.
