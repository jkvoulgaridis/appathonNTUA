    <measure>Part B: Change From Day 1 (Pre-dose) in Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Score at Day 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Pre-dose), Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>DSST is a cognitive test designed to assess psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the participant to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-second period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (less than cognitive functioning) to 133 (greater than cognitive functioning) as a description of DSST. An increase in score represents an improvement in an integrated measure of cognitive function.</description>

Any suicidality: emergence of any suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. Any suicidal behavior: when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any these questions- actual attempt to suicide, engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts. Any suicidal ideation: when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any of these questions- wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent to suicide. Number of Participants with any suicidality has been reported for this outcome measure.</description>

          <description>Sleep stages included NREM sleep and REM (dreaming) sleep. Non-REM sleep is comprised of the sum of Stage N1 (light sleep), N2 (also fairly light, with sudden increases in brain wave frequency known as sleep spindles) and N3 or slow wave sleep (deep sleep). Sleep was staged in sequential 30-second epochs.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Day 1 in Waketime Questionnaire Parameters: Time Spent Awake After Falling Asleep at Day 6</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to answer the following question using Waketime Questionnaire: How long did you sleep last night, number of awakening after falling asleep, time to fall asleep last night, time spent awake after falling asleep, rate quality of your sleep (using Likert scale, ranged from 0 = very sound or restful, to 4 = very restless where lower score indicates better outcome). The primary purpose of the Waketime Questionnaire was to confirm anticipated reports of poor sleep. In this outcome measure, data for question &quot;Time spent awake after falling asleep&quot; has been reported.</description>

        <description>DSST is a cognitive test designed to assess psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the participant to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-second period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (less than cognitive functioning) to 133 (greater than cognitive functioning) as a description of DSST. An increase in score represents an improvement in an integrated measure of cognitive function.</description>

        <description>PVT, a computer-based test, is a chronometric measure of an individual's reaction to specified small changes in a labile environment. Participants were instructed to respond to a digital signal on a computer terminal by pressing a key. Errors of omission and commission are recorded. When a participant did not respond to the PVT signal within 500 msec, it was termed a lapse. The higher the number of lapses the greater the impairment.</description>

        <title>Part A: Maximum Change From Day 1 (Pre-dose) in Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Score at Day 6</title>
        <description>DSST is a cognitive test designed to assess psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the participant to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-second period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (less than cognitive functioning) to 133 (greater than cognitive functioning) as a description of DSST. An increase in score represents an improvement in an integrated measure of cognitive function. In this outcome measure, data for participants who received placebo matched to &quot;1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg E2006&quot; and matched to &quot;10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg E2006&quot;, has been presented separately.</description>

        <title>Part A: Maximum Change From Day 1 (Pre-dose) in Number of Lapses of &gt; 500 Msec Assessed by Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) at Day 6</title>
        <description>PVT, a computer-based test, is a chronometric measure of an individual's reaction to specified small changes in a labile environment. Participants were instructed to respond to a digital signal on a computer terminal by pressing a key. Errors of omission and commission are recorded. When a participant did not respond to the PVT signal within 500 msec, it was termed a lapse. The higher the number of lapses the greater the impairment. In this outcome measure, data for participants who received placebo matched to &quot;1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg E2006&quot; and matched to &quot;10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg E2006&quot;, has been presented separately.</description>

        <title>Part A: Change From Day 1 in Waketime Questionnaire Parameters: How Long Did You Sleep Last Night at Day 6</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to answer the following question using Waketime Questionnaire: How long did you sleep last night, number of awakening after falling asleep, time to fall asleep last night, time spent awake after falling asleep, rate quality of your sleep (using Likert scale, ranged from 0 = very sound or restful, to 4 = very restless where lower score indicates better outcome). The primary purpose of the Waketime Questionnaire was to confirm a lack of sleep disturbance. In this outcome measure, data for question &quot;How long did you sleep last night&quot; has been reported.</description>

          <title>Part A: Change From Day 1 in Waketime Questionnaire Parameters: Time Spent Awake After Falling Asleep at Day 6</title>
          <description>Participants were asked to answer the following question using Waketime Questionnaire: How long did you sleep last night, number of awakening after falling asleep, time to fall asleep last night, time spent awake after falling asleep, rate quality of your sleep (using Likert scale, ranged from 0 = very sound or restful, to 4 = very restless where lower score indicates better outcome). The primary purpose of the Waketime Questionnaire was to confirm a lack of sleep disturbance. In this outcome measure, data for question &quot;Time spent awake after falling asleep&quot; has been reported.</description>
          <population>PD analysis set included all participants who had sufficient PD data to derive at least one PD parameter. Here &quot;number analyzed&quot; signifies participants who were evaluable for the outcome measure at given time points.</population>

        <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment [C-CASA]) is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess any suicidality, any suicidal Behavior, any suicidal ideation. Any suicidality: emergence of any suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. Any suicidal behavior: when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any these questions- actual attempt to suicide, engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious, behavior, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts. Any suicidal ideation: when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any of these questions-wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent to suicide. Number of participants with any suicidality has been reported for this outcome measure.</description>
