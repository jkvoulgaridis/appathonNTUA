    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate how genetic profiles respond to LY2216684 and the effect of Quinidine
      on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY2216684 in a specific genetic profile. Side effects will be
      documented.

      The human cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme is a polymorphic enzyme yielding ultrarapid
      metabolizer, extensive metabolizer (EM), intermediate metabolizer, and poor metabolizer (PM)
      phenotypes. Enrollment in the study was limited to participants predicted to be CYP2C19
      extensive metabolizers or CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, as determined by genotyping analysis.

          <population>Participants who received at least 1 dose of LY2216684 and had evaluable LY2216684 plasma concentration data were included in the analysis. Participants who vomited within twice the median time to maximum observed drug concentration (tmax) following dosing of LY2216684 were excluded from the analysis.</population>
