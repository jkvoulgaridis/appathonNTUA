      Study A0081106 is a 12-month open-label study to evaluate the long term safety and
      tolerability of pregabalin as add-on therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years of age
      with partial onset seizures and pediatric and adult subjects 5 to 65 years of age with
      primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Pregabalin will be administered in equally divided
      daily doses for 1 year, in either capsule or liquid oral formulation.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to 13 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to 13 months) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator.</description>

Primary generalized tonic clonic seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain, then spreads to both sides of the brain as a tonic-clonic seizure and usually last 1 to 3 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants as Per Reliable Change Index (RCI) Category for Cogstate Detection Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>CogState brief battery consisted of 2 tasks- detection and pediatric identification task using a laptop computer with external response buttons. Prior tasks, participants were briefed rules, given an interactive demonstration and a sufficient number of practice trials. For each task, participant responded &quot;yes&quot; using a response button with dominant hand. Participants had to &quot;respond as fast and as accurately as possible.&quot; Detection task: measured simple reaction time to assess psychomotor function. Participant pressed a &quot;YES&quot; response key as soon as they detected an event (ie, a card turning face up presented in the center of the computer screen). A participant's RCI was calculated by dividing the change from individual baseline score by ([square root 2] times WSD), where WSD is within-subject standard deviation from Cogstate detection task normative data. Improvement in cognition when RCI &lt;=-1.65, decline in cognition when RCI =&gt;1.65.</description>

For each task, participant responded &quot;yes&quot; using a response button with dominant hand. Participants had to &quot;respond as fast and as accurately as possible.&quot; Pediatric identification task: measured choice reaction time to assess visual attention. An event (a card turning face up) occurred in center of computer screen and participant decided if event met a predefined and unchanging criterion (is the color of the card black?); answered &quot;YES&quot; if criterion was met. A participant's RCI was calculated by dividing the change from individual baseline score by ([square root 2] times WSD),WSD=within-subject standard deviation from Cogstate task normative data.

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment Related AEs and Treatment Related SAEs</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to 13 months) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator.</description>

        <description>Tanner stage defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. Participants were evaluated for pubic hair distribution, breast development (only females) and genital development (only males), with values ranging from stage 1 (pre-pubertal characteristics) to stage 5 (adult or mature characteristics).</description>

        <description>28-days seizure rate was defined as number of seizures per 28-day period. 28-days seizure rate have been reported separately for partial onset seizure and primary generalized tonic clonic seizure. Partial onset seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain. This kind of seizure is brief, lasting seconds to less than 2 minutes. Primary generalized tonic clonic seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain, then spreads to both sides of the brain as a tonic-clonic seizure and usually last 1 to 3 minutes.</description>

          <description>28-days seizure rate was defined as number of seizures per 28-day period. 28-days seizure rate have been reported separately for partial onset seizure and primary generalized tonic clonic seizure. Partial onset seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain. This kind of seizure is brief, lasting seconds to less than 2 minutes. Primary generalized tonic clonic seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain, then spreads to both sides of the brain as a tonic-clonic seizure and usually last 1 to 3 minutes.</description>

          <description>28-days seizure rate was defined as number of seizures per 28-day period. 28-days seizure rate have been reported separately for partial onset seizure and primary generalized tonic clonic seizure. Partial onset seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain. This kind of seizure is brief, lasting seconds to less than 2 minutes. Primary generalized tonic clonic seizure: a seizure that starts in one area of the brain, then spreads to both sides of the brain as a tonic-clonic seizure and usually last 1 to 3 minutes.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants as Per Reliable Change Index (RCI) Category for Cogstate Detection Task</title>
        <description>CogState brief battery consisted of 2 tasks- detection and pediatric identification task using a laptop computer with external response buttons. Prior tasks, participants were briefed rules, given an interactive demonstration and a sufficient number of practice trials. For each task, participant responded &quot;yes&quot; using a response button with dominant hand. Participants had to &quot;respond as fast and as accurately as possible.&quot; Detection task: measured simple reaction time to assess psychomotor function. Participant pressed a &quot;YES&quot; response key as soon as they detected an event (ie, a card turning face up presented in the center of the computer screen). A participant's RCI was calculated by dividing the change from individual baseline score by ([square root 2] times WSD), where WSD is within-subject standard deviation from Cogstate detection task normative data. Improvement in cognition when RCI &lt;=-1.65, decline in cognition when RCI =&gt;1.65.</description>
