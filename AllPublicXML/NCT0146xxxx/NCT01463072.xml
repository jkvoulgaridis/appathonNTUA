    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of nab-paclitaxel in treating older patients
      with breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes
      (locally advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability (grade 2-5 toxicity, neuropathy grade 2 or higher, need for
      dose reductions, or delays) of weekly nab-paclitaxel in older adults with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (response and time to progression) of weekly nab-paclitaxel in
      older adults with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer using a stratification factor
      based on patient age (at least 5 patients age 75 years or older and no more than 15 patients
      age 65-70 years).

      II. To explore predictors of the need for dose reduction, dose delays, or grade 2-5 toxicity
      and neuropathy grade 2 or higher based on a cancer-specific geriatric assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Rates and associated 95% exact Clopper and Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>General linear models and graphical methods will be used to explore factors as identified by a cancer-specific geriatric assessment that may be predictive of toxicity/dose reduction or dose delays. Assessment consists of an evaluation of the individual's functional status, comorbid medical conditions, cognition, nutritional status, psychological state, and social support.</description>
