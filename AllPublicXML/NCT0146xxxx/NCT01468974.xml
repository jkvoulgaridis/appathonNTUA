      The purpose of the ESPRIT I Clinical Investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance
      of the ESPRIT BVS in subjects with symptomatic claudication from occlusive vascular disease
      of the superficial femoral (SFA) or common or external iliac arteries.

    <description>The Rutherford Becker clinical category is a scale to measure chronic limb ischemia.
Category and Clinical Description:
0 = Asymptomatic, no hemodynamically significant occlusive disease, 1 = Mild claudication, 2 = Moderate claudication, 3 = Severe claudication, 4 = Ischemic rest pain, 5 = Minor tissue loss, non-healing ulcer, or focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemia, 6 = Major tissue loss, extending above transmetatarsal level, functional foot no longer salvageable</description>

    <measure>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) for the Treated Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and it is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure in the ankle of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms.
An ABI of 0.9 - 1.3 is a normal range. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 indicates severe disease. A value greater than 1.3 is considered abnormal suggesting calcification of the walls of the arteries and noncompressible vessels, reflecting severe peripheral vascular disease. Subjects with ABI values greater than 1.3 will be excluded from the analysis.
Calculation of the Ankle Brachial Index:
(Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure = ABI)</description>

    <description>Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire is defined as a disease specific quality of life (QOL) measure for subjects with chronic lower limb ischemia. Each item is rated as a seven point response scale, with a score of one being the worst and a score of seven the best possible. The total average score is the sum of all 25 items scores divided by 25. For each separate domain an average score can be calculated (sum of all items of one domain divided by the number of items of that domain). The highest score for each domain is 7, which indicates best health outcome.

          <description>Amputation:
The removal of a body extremity by surgery. For this study, the definition of amputation will only apply to amputations of the limb that was treated.
A minor amputation will be defined as below-the-ankle; and a major amputation will be defined as limb loss at or proximal to the transtibial level. Major amputations will be specified as below-the-knee and above-the-knee amputations.</description>

        <title>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) for the Treated Limb</title>
        <description>The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and it is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure in the ankle of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms.
An ABI of 0.9 - 1.3 is a normal range. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 indicates severe disease. A value greater than 1.3 is considered abnormal suggesting calcification of the walls of the arteries and noncompressible vessels, reflecting severe peripheral vascular disease. Subjects with ABI values greater than 1.3 will be excluded from the analysis.

          <title>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) for the Treated Limb</title>
          <description>The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and it is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure in the ankle of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms.
An ABI of 0.9 - 1.3 is a normal range. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 indicates severe disease. A value greater than 1.3 is considered abnormal suggesting calcification of the walls of the arteries and noncompressible vessels, reflecting severe peripheral vascular disease. Subjects with ABI values greater than 1.3 will be excluded from the analysis.

          <description>Measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), a disease-specific instrument utilized to characterize walking ability through a questionnaire as an alternative to treadmill testing. It is a measure of subject-perceived walking performance for subjects with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and/or intermittent claudication. The WIQ quantifies patient-reported walking speed, walking distance, and stair-climbing ability, respectively, on a scale of 0 (= worst) to 100 (= best).</description>

          <title>Treated Site Late Loss</title>
          <description>Mean in-lesion Late Loss is calculated as: (MLD post-procedure - MLD follow-up).
The average of two orthogonal views (when possible) of the narrowest point within the area of assessment - in lesion, treated site or treated segment. Minimum Lumen Vessel Diameter (MLD) is visually estimated during angiography by the Investigator; it is measured during qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) by the Angiographic Core Lab.</description>

        <title>Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol) Scores Summary</title>
        <description>Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire is defined as a disease specific quality of life (QOL) measure for subjects with chronic lower limb ischemia. Each item is rated as a seven point response scale, with a score of one being the worst and a score of seven the best possible. The total average score is the sum of all 25 items scores divided by 25. For each separate domain an average score can be calculated (sum of all items of one domain divided by the number of items of that domain). The highest score for each domain is 7, which indicates best health outcome.
The domains include Activity Domain, Symptom Domain, Pain Domain, Emotional Domain, Social Domain.</description>

        <title>Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol) Scores Summary</title>
        <description>Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire is defined as a disease specific quality of life (QOL) measure for subjects with chronic lower limb ischemia. Each item is rated as a seven point response scale, with a score of one being the worst and a score of seven the best possible. The total average score is the sum of all 25 items scores divided by 25. For each separate domain an average score can be calculated (sum of all items of one domain divided by the number of items of that domain). The highest score for each domain is 7, which indicates best health outcome.
The domains include Activity Domain, Symptom Domain, Pain Domain, Emotional Domain, Social Domain.</description>
