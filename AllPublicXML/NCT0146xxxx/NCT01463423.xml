      A research study using a method of treating lung cancer with focused radiation called
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of individualizing the dose of radiation used to treat lung tumors with SABR
      based on tumor-specific factors.

      Primary Objective: Evaluate local tumor control with individually optimized lung tumor SABR.
      Tumor control will be assessed by CT, PET-CT, and if appropriate, biopsy. The trial will
      focus on three cohorts: 1) patients with limited primary NSCLCs (T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T2aN0M0,
      T2bN0M0, or T3N0M0) non-small cell lung cancer; 2) patients with a history of NSCLC who have
      new limited primary NSCLC lesion(s); and 3) patients with more advanced lung cancer or lung
      metastases from a variety of different cancers.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of individually optimized lung tumor SABR. Pulmonary, esophageal,
           chest wall, skin, vascular, cardiac/pericardial, and neurologic (brachial
           plexus/recurrent laryngeal/myelitis) toxicity will be scored by the CTCAE 4.0 criteria.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of anatomically optimized audio-visual biofeedback
           (AVB)-coached breath-hold technique assisted by fast delivery using gated RapidArc with
           flattening free filter mode (FFF) in a subset of patients. Feasibility will be assessed
           based on: i) The proportion of patients able to reproduce an anatomically-optimized
           breath-hold with AVB-coaching during treatment. ii) The reduction in treatment delivery
           time compared to gated free-breathing treatment.

        -  Determine progression free, metastasis free, and overall survival in patients treated
           with individually optimized lung tumor SABR.

        -  Examine new biomarkers in lung tumor SABR patients.
