      cell lymphoma who have relapsed, progressed or are refractory to bortezomib.

      Follow up phase will continue until either 100% of the patients have died, are lost to follow
      up or have withdrawn consent or a maximum of 4 years from the last patient enrolled,
      whichever comes first. All other efficacy and safety endpoints will be updated at this time.
      In the unlikely event that the study will be closed and patients are still responding to
      treatment at this time, Celgene will discuss with the treating physicians options to provide
      further treatment to the patient after study closure in line with local regulation.

      Follow up for second primary malignancies and OS will continue until 100% of the patients
      have died, are lost to follow up, have withdrawn consent, or a maximum of 5 years from the
      last patient enrolled, whichever comes first.

      10 October 2017: In regard to the last subject last visit date/study completion date, the
      prolongation of timelines is due to the bridging of a treatment gap for a patient responding
      to study medication until non-study medication is available.

    <time_frame>From Day 1 of study treatment to progession or early treatment discontinuation; up to data cut-off date of 06 April 2016; median duration of treatment was 94.5 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants whose best response was Complete Response, Complete Response unconfirmed or Partial Response. Participants who had discontinued before any response has been observed, or changed to other anti-lymphoma treatments before response had been observed, were considered as non-responders. Tumor Response was assessed by a modification of the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria, IWRC, Cheson, 1999); CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease; CRu is defined as a CR, with a 1) residual lymph node mass &gt;1.5 cm that has decreased by 75% in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD). Individual nodes previously confluent decreased by more than 75% in the SPD compared with original mass; 2) indeterminate bone marrow; PR = is defined ≥50% decrease in 6 largest nodes or nodal masses.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants whose best response was CR or CRu. Participants who had discontinued before CR/CRu was observed, or changed to other anti-lymphoma treatments before a CR/CRu response had been observed, were considered as non-responders.

    <description>Kaplan Meier estimates for the duration of CR/CRu was calculated from the date of the first occurrence of CR/CRu to the date of documented disease progression or death (without documented progression) for participants who obtained a CR/CRu; participants who had not progressed (or died) were censored at the last valid assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>From Day 1 of study drug to first documented date of disease progression; up to data cut-off date of 06 April 2016; median time in follow-up was 16.34 months</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan Meier estimates of PFS was defined as the start of study drug therapy to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. If a participant had not progressed or died, PFS was censored at the time of last adequate assessment when the participant was known not to have progressed. For participants who received other anti-lymphoma therapy with no evidence of progression, PFS was censored at time of last adequate tumor assessment with no evidence of progression prior to the start of new anti-lymphoma treatment.</description>

    <description>Kaplan Meier estimate of time to progression was calculated as time from the start of the study drug therapy to the first observation of disease progression. Participants who died without progression were censored at the date of death; otherwise, the censoring rules presented above for PFS applied to the analysis of TTP.

          <description>Participants received lenalidomide 10 mg or 25 mg oral capsules on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle and was dependent on renal function; Participants with normal renal function (defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl)) of ≥ 60 mL/min) received 25 mg of lenalidomide by mouth (PO) daily, and those with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min but &lt; 60 mL/min) were started at a 10 mg daily dose.

Tumor Response was assessed by a modification of the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria, IWRC, Cheson, 1999); CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease; CRu is defined as a CR, with a 1) residual lymph node mass &gt;1.5 cm that has decreased by 75% in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD).
