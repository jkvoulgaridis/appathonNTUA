  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that the Duofix Tibial
      component results in a reduction of immediate postoperative pain compared to the LCS Porocoat
      version.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate the clinical and patient
      outcomes, biological fixation and survivorship associated with the LCS Duofix and Porocoat
      knee system over 10 years.

    <measure>Difference in the Mean VAS Pain Score Between Subjects Receiving LCS Complete Duofix™ and Porocoat® Knee Systems at 12 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months Post Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score asks the subject to place a vertical mark anywhere on a horizontal line (that is approximately 10 cm long) with 'No pain' listed on the left (scored as 0) and 'Very severe pain' labeled on the right (scored as 10). The subject is instructed to indicate the amount of pain they feel in their knee joint</description>

        <title>Difference in the Mean VAS Pain Score Between Subjects Receiving LCS Complete Duofix™ and Porocoat® Knee Systems at 12 Months.</title>
        <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score asks the subject to place a vertical mark anywhere on a horizontal line (that is approximately 10 cm long) with 'No pain' listed on the left (scored as 0) and 'Very severe pain' labeled on the right (scored as 10). The subject is instructed to indicate the amount of pain they feel in their knee joint</description>

        <description>The SF-12 consists of 12 questions that explores issues that apply to people have many different types of treatment, and in all different states of health, from good to bad. The physical composite score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the lowest level of health and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
