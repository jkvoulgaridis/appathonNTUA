      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of allopurinol as an augmentation
      agent for the prevention of mania in bipolar disorder patients with currently stable mood.
      Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder with severe mood swings (mania and depression). Despite
      the development of medications for mania, they may have significant side effects, high costs
      and the need for serum level monitoring. These factors adversely affect medication compliance
      in bipolar patients. One recent study indicated the efficacy of allopurinol in the treatment
      of bipolar mania. Our hypothesis is that the addition of allopurinol to standard medications
      for bipolar disorder will decrease the recurrences of manic episodes compared to standard
      medications.

      This study will recruit bipolar disorder patients currently mood stable on a therapeutic dose
      of an anti-manic medication. Stable mood will be defined as a Young Mania Rating Scale score
      ≤10 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≤10. Subjects must have a diagnosis of bipolar
      disorder confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Young Mania Rating
      Scale and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview are common research questionnaires
      used in bipolar disorder studies. Potential subjects will be identified and approached during
      an outpatient clinical visit by a member of the research team and identified by their
      treating physicians and referred to the researchers.

      This study involves adding allopurinol to subjects' current bipolar medications. This study
      will be a open label, naturalistic study. The subject will be examined monthly for manic
      symptoms for 2 years. Semi-structured interviews and study questionnaires will be
      administered to subjects at each visit. Monthly Follow-up Study Visits (once per month for 2
      years - Months 1-5, 7-11, 13-17, 19-23) may be conducted either in-person or over the phone.
      All of the questionnaires will be administered by a clinician if the visit is completed over
      the phone. However, the 6-month interval visits (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24) must be done at
      the research center.

      The primary outcome measure will be the number of manic episodes in the 2 year study period.
      A manic episode will be defined by a Young Mania Rating Scale score ≥20.

    <measure>Number of Manic Episodes According to the Young Mania Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Young Mania Rating Scale is an 11-item, clinician-administered scale to assess severity of manic symptoms before, during and after treatment. Four items are graded on a min. 0 to max. 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content and disruptive/aggressive behavior) while the remaining 7 items are graded on a min. 0 to max. 4 scale. A score of 0 indicates behavior is absent and score of 4 or 8 indicates the behavior is present and severe.
The change in score between Baseline and the Completion Visit will be reported. Ideally, the two time points will be Baseline and 6 Weeks after Baseline, but if a subject terminates early, the last Young Mania Rating Scale score will be used. The scores from each question are added for a total score ranging from min. 0 to max 60; higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. A score of 0-12 indicates the absence of mania or a very mild manic state, a score of 13-20 or higher indicates a mild manic episode, and over 20 indicates a manic state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Depressive Episodes Per Patient Visit According to the Hamilton Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a tool used to determine a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. The Hamilton Depression Scale form lists 21 items, but the scoring is based on the first 17 questions. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (min) = not present to 4 (max) = severe. Nine are scored from 0 (min) to 2 (max). The sum of the scores from the first 17 questions is: 0 (min) to 7 (max) = normal, 8 (min) to 13 (max) = mild depression, 14 (min) to 18 (max) = moderate depression, 19 (min) to 22 (max) = severe depression and ≥ 23=very severe depression. A score of 11 or more indicates a depressive episode in terms of this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Using an open label, naturalistic design, subjects will continue with their current psychiatric medications during the study. Allopurinol will be given at a fixed dose of 300 mg/day for the first week and then 600mg/d for the remainder of the study. Subjects who cannot tolerate the 600mg dose will be given a dose of 300mg/d. Subjects will participate in monthly follow up visits for 24 months. Subjects who develop a substance abuse or substance dependence disorder during the study will be terminated from the study. Also, subjects who develop a medical condition which can affect their mood stability will be terminated from the study.</description>

        <title>Number of Manic Episodes According to the Young Mania Rating Scale</title>
        <description>Young Mania Rating Scale is an 11-item, clinician-administered scale to assess severity of manic symptoms before, during and after treatment. Four items are graded on a min. 0 to max. 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content and disruptive/aggressive behavior) while the remaining 7 items are graded on a min. 0 to max. 4 scale. A score of 0 indicates behavior is absent and score of 4 or 8 indicates the behavior is present and severe.
The change in score between Baseline and the Completion Visit will be reported. Ideally, the two time points will be Baseline and 6 Weeks after Baseline, but if a subject terminates early, the last Young Mania Rating Scale score will be used. The scores from each question are added for a total score ranging from min. 0 to max 60; higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. A score of 0-12 indicates the absence of mania or a very mild manic state, a score of 13-20 or higher indicates a mild manic episode, and over 20 indicates a manic state.</description>
        <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
        <population>The outcome measure will be the total number of patient visits at which the Young Mania Rating Scale was administered per the number of patient visits at which a manic episode (according to the Young Mania Rating Scale) was recorded. The number of manic episodes prior to study start were not collected.</population>

        <title>Number of Depressive Episodes Per Patient Visit According to the Hamilton Depression Scale</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a tool used to determine a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. The Hamilton Depression Scale form lists 21 items, but the scoring is based on the first 17 questions. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (min) = not present to 4 (max) = severe. Nine are scored from 0 (min) to 2 (max). The sum of the scores from the first 17 questions is: 0 (min) to 7 (max) = normal, 8 (min) to 13 (max) = mild depression, 14 (min) to 18 (max) = moderate depression, 19 (min) to 22 (max) = severe depression and ≥ 23=very severe depression. A score of 11 or more indicates a depressive episode in terms of this outcome measure.</description>
