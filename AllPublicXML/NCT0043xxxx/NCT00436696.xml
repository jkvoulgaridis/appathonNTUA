    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking at genes in participants with neuroblastoma or noncancerous
      conditions. Identifying genes related to cancer may help in the study of cancer. It may also
      help doctors predict who is at risk of developing neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform a whole genome scan for association of neuroblastoma with single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNP) and SNP haplotypes.

      II. Identify true disease-associated SNP alleles using a customized genotyping platform
      enriched for haplotype analyses in an independent sample set.

      III. Validate disease-associated SNP alleles and haplotypes in a final independent sample
      set.

      IV. Identify neuroblastoma predisposition genes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to presence of
      high-risk disease (yes vs no) and MYCN amplification (yes vs no).

      DNA samples are derived from participants' banked blood or uninvolved bone marrow. A whole
      genome scan of DNA samples is employed to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs). The candidate SNPs are investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to
      identify 10-20 true disease-associated alleles. The disease-associated alleles are again
      investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to validate 5-10 disease-associated
      SNPs. SNPs are then analyzed for heritable predisposition.

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing. A certificate of confidentiality
      protecting the identity of research participants in this project has been issued by the
      Children's Oncology Group.
