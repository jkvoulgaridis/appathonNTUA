      This randomized phase III trial studies doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and
      paclitaxel to see how well they work with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with
      cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (lymph node-positive) or cancer that has not spread
      to the lymph nodes but is at high risk for returning (high-risk, lymph node-negative breast
      cancer). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of breast cancer by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery
      and help prevent the tumor from returning. It is not yet known whether doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel are more effective with or without
      bevacizumab.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the disease-free survival of patients (defined as invasive disease-free
      survival [IFDS]) with lymph node positive and high risk lymph node negative breast cancer
      randomized to treatment with either doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride)/cyclophosphamide
      plus placebo followed by paclitaxel (AC + placebo &gt; T + placebo) or the same chemotherapy
      regimen plus bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare short-term (20-24 weeks) versus long-term (50-54 weeks) bevacizumab therapy.

      II. To compare the overall survival. III. To evaluate toxicity. IV. To evaluate the
      association between outcomes in E5103 (disease-free survival, overall survival and
      toxicities) and genotype (derived from candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms and genome
      wide evaluations).

      V. To compare the quality of life of breast cancer patients treated with AC/paclitaxel and
      bevacizumab or placebo, in terms of physical symptoms, physical functioning, psychological
      state and social functioning over an 18 month period.

      VI. To determine the impact of theoretical biomarker information on patients' willingness to
      accept the toxicities of bevacizumab for the estimated potential benefit.

      VII. To create a biospecimen repository including plasma, serum and CellSearch cassettes
      containing circulating tumor cells (CTC) for evaluating determinants of late relapse,
      including candidate biomarkers reflecting occult tumor burden (e.g., CTCs and plasma tumor
      deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) and host factors (e.g., estrogen, insulin-insulin-like growth
      factor [IGF] axis, inflammation, etc).

      VIII. To create a biorepository of metastatic tumor samples in patients who have had a late
      relapse.

      IX. To determine body mass index (BMI) and comorbidity burden in patients with operable
      breast cancer five or more years after diagnosis.

      X. To determine whether there is a relationship between late relapse and BMI at diagnosis and
      at 5 years after diagnosis, and whether BMI-associated inflammatory and/or metabolic
      biomarkers are associated with early and late recurrence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV
      over 20-30 minutes, and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 or
      3 weeks for 4 courses. Beginning 3 weeks later, patients then receive paclitaxel IV over 1
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with
      paclitaxel and placebo repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

      ARM II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide as in arm I and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 or 3 weeks for 4
      courses. Beginning 3 weeks later, patients then receive paclitaxel as in arm I and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with paclitaxel and bevacizumab repeats
      every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

      ARM III: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide as in arm I and
      bevacizumab as in arm II. Treatment repeats every 2 or 3 weeks for 4 courses. Beginning 3
      weeks later, patients then receive paclitaxel as in arm I and bevacizumab as in arm II.
      Treatment with paclitaxel and bevacizumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Beginning 2
      months later, patients then receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      with bevacizumab alone repeats every 3 weeks for 10 courses.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 15 years.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Accrual to Step 1 of E5103 was activated November 2, 2007 and closed February 28, 2011; 4994 patients were entered. Upon unblinding of Step 1 treatment assignment, only patients treated on Arm C during Step 1 who had not ended protocol treatment early were eligible to register to Step 2 (Arm D) and 1316 patients were enrolled to Step 2.</recruitment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Arm A (Chemo + Placebo)</title>
          <description>Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide IV over 20-30 minutes, and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 or 3 weeks for 4 courses. Beginning 3 weeks later, patients then receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with paclitaxel and placebo repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.</description>

          <description>Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide as in arm A and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 or 3 weeks for 4 courses. Beginning 3 weeks later, patients then receive paclitaxel as in arm A and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

          <description>Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide as in arm A and bevacizumab as in arm B. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Beginning 3 weeks later, patients then receive paclitaxel as in arm A and bevacizumab as in arm B. Treatment with paclitaxel and bevacizumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Within the following 2 months, patients then receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with bevacizumab alone repeats every 3 weeks for 10 courses. The monotherapy of bevacizumab is considered as arm D in this study.</description>

        <description>Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) was defined as time from from date of randomization to first treatment failure (invasive ipsilateral, local/regional, or distant recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, invasive non-breast second primary malignancy or death from any cause, whichever occurred first). Cases with incomplete follow-up, without documented IDFS event including those who developed squamous or basal cell skin cancers or insitu carcinomas of any site as their only event were censored at the date of last disease evaluation.</description>

          <description>Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) was defined as time from from date of randomization to first treatment failure (invasive ipsilateral, local/regional, or distant recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, invasive non-breast second primary malignancy or death from any cause, whichever occurred first).

            <groups_desc>The primary objective of this trial was to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab improved IDFS. A two-step hierarchical approach was used. In the 1st step, Arm C was to be compared to Arm A. If Arm C significantly improved IDFS relative to Arm A, then in the 2nd step, a comparison of Arm B to Arm A was to be performed. If the treatment in both Arm C and Arm B significantly improved IDFS relative to Arm A, then a comparison of Arm C to Arm B was to be performed with respect to IDFS.</groups_desc>
