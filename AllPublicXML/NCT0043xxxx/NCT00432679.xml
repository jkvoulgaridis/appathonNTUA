    <description>Baseline value was value on Day 0. Change from Baseline was defined as value at Week 16 minus Baseline value. The full analysis set used which was defined as remaining after participant who infringed on the following events were excluded from the randomized participants, who did not take the investigational drug during or after the treatment period (amount of investigational drug taken was zero tablets) and who were not measured for HbA1c even once as the observation period Baseline value or in the treatment period (after the investigational drug was prescribed), or for whom the above were unavailable (including cases that the above were considered missing measurements due to a defective sample).</description>
