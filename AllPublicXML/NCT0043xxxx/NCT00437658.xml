    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density of the Spine at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The percent change from baseline in spine and femur BMD at week 24 was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The absence of significant bone loss was supported if the lower bounds of the confidence intervals for the mean percent change in BMD were ≥ -2.2% for both the spine and femur at week 24.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response in the Dysmenorrhea Component of the Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation), dyspareunia (painful intercourse), non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration (hardening). Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The dysmenorrhea score was based on the participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had painful menstruation during the last 28 days?&quot;.
Participants were classified as responders for dysmenorrhea if they reported a 1 point or greater reduction (improvement) from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density of the Spine at Week 24</title>
        <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The percent change from baseline in spine and femur BMD at week 24 was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The absence of significant bone loss was supported if the lower bounds of the confidence intervals for the mean percent change in BMD were ≥ -2.2% for both the spine and femur at week 24.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Response in the Dysmenorrhea Component of the Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation), dyspareunia (painful intercourse), non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration (hardening). Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The dysmenorrhea score was based on the participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had painful menstruation during the last 28 days?&quot;.
Participants were classified as responders for dysmenorrhea if they reported a 1 point or greater reduction (improvement) from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Response in the Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Component of the CPSSS at Week 24</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The non-menstrual pelvic pain score was based on participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had pelvic pain during the last 28 days?&quot; Participants were classified as responders for non-menstrual pelvic pain if they reported a 1 point or greater reduction (improvement) from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Response in the Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Component of the CPSSS Over Time</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The non-menstrual pelvic pain score was based on participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had pelvic pain during the last 28 days?&quot; Participants were classified as responders for non-menstrual pelvic pain if they reported a 1 point or greater reduction (improvement) from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total CPSSS During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain scores are based on the participant's assessment, pelvic tenderness and induration were assessed by the investigator based on findings associated with a pelvic examination.
The total CPSSS has a maximum possible value of 15 (total score range: 0 to 15, where a lower score indicates less signs and symptoms of endometriosis or better functioning).
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) analysis of covariance model which included fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, a random effect for patient, and terms for baseline value and the baseline-by-time interaction.</description>

        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain scores are based on the participant's assessment, pelvic tenderness and induration were assessed by the investigator based on findings associated with a pelvic examination.
The total CPSSS excluding dyspareunia has a maximum possible value of 12 (total score range: 0 to 12, where a lower score indicates less signs and symptoms of endometriosis or better functioning).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dysmenorrhea Component of the CPSSS During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
The dysmenorrhea score was based on the participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had painful menstruation during the last 28 days?&quot;.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) analysis of covariance model which included fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, a random effect for patient, and terms for baseline value and the baseline-by-time interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dyspareunia Component of the CPSSS During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
The dyspareunia score was based on the participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had painful intercourse during the last 28 days?&quot; Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) analysis of covariance model which included fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, a random effect for patient, and terms for baseline value and the baseline-by-time interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Component of the CPSSS During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
The non-menstrual pelvic pain score was based on participant's response to the question &quot;Have you had pelvic pain during the last 28 days?&quot;.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) analysis of covariance model which included fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, a random effect for patient, and terms for baseline value and the baseline-by-time interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in in Monthly Peak Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pelvic Pain</title>
        <description>The VAS for pelvic pain was used as an assessment of pain intensity. The VAS was a horizontal line on which the left extreme was labeled &quot;no pain&quot; and the right extreme was labeled &quot;worst pain ever felt&quot; scored on a scale from of 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain ever felt). Participants indicated the worst level of pain felt over a 24-hour period by ''ticking'' the horizontal line on their e-Diary at approximately the same time each day. Monthly peak VAS for pelvic pain was defined as the maximum VAS pain score reported for an individual participant from the previous visit to the day of the current scheduled visit.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) analysis of covariance model which included fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, a random effect for patient, and terms for baseline value and the baseline-by-time interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in in Monthly Mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pelvic Pain</title>
        <description>The VAS for pelvic pain was used as an assessment of pain intensity. The VAS was a horizontal line on which the left extreme was labeled &quot;no pain&quot; and the right extreme was labeled &quot;worst pain ever felt&quot; scored on a scale from of 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain ever felt). Participants indicated the worst level of pain felt over a 24-hour period by ''ticking'' the horizontal line on their e-Diary at approximately the same time each day. Monthly mean VAS for pelvic pain defined as the average of all VAS pain scores reported for an individual participant from the previous visit to the day of the current scheduled visit.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) analysis of covariance model which included fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, a random effect for patient, and terms for baseline value and the baseline-by-time interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) Pain Dimension</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in EHP-5 Control and Powerlessness Dimension</title>
          <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one oral dose of study drug, an initial subcutaneous injection, and either reported at least 7 e-diary VAS values or provided an assessment of either dysmenorrhea or non-menstrual pelvic pain at week 4 or later during the treatment phase (intent-to-treat) with available data at each time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EHP-5 Emotional Well-being Dimension</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EHP-5 Social Support Dimension</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EHP-5 Work Dimension</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), or Not Relevant (no score), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EHP-5 Relationship With Children Dimension</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), or Not Relevant (no score), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EHP-5 Medical Profession Dimension</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), or Not Relevant (no score), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

          <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions, five of which were recorded in this study: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession and treatment.
Each question was scored on a five point scale (Never = 0, Rarely = 25, Sometimes = 50, Often = 75, Always = 100), or Not Relevant (no score), where 0 indicates the best health status and 100 worst health status. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one oral dose of study drug, an initial subcutaneous injection, and either reported at least 7 e-diary VAS values or provided an assessment of either dysmenorrhea or non-menstrual pelvic pain at week 4 or later during the treatment phase (intent-to-treat) with available data at each time point.</population>
