  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months (PFS Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months from randomization</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the first date of progressive disease or death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who did not have progressive disease, PFS was censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to disease progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy. The PFS probability values were multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Tumor Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 13.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response rate was defined as number of participants with overall best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) over number of protocol qualified participants using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) Guidelines. CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs or complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not worsening) of 1 or more non-target lesions, with no new lesions appearing. Percentage of participants = (Number of participants with overall best response of CR or PR/Number of protocol qualified participants) x 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of response to progressive disease up to 13.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of disease progression or death from any cause. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria, CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs or complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not worsening) of 1 or more non-target lesions, with no new lesions appearing. For participants who died, the duration of response was censored at death. For participants still alive, duration of response was censored at the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to date of death from any cause up to 21.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time in months from the date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the cut-off date, OS was censored at the last contact date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression (up to 13.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall disease control rate for each treatment arm was calculated as percent of participants with overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) over number of protocol qualified population. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria, CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions, and SD was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.
Percentage of participants = (Number of participants with overall best response of CR, PR, or SD/Number of protocol qualified participants) x 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Who Died</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to study completion (Cycle 31.5 [21 days/cycle] and 30-day safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant events were defined as serious and other non-serious AEs. Participants who died due to progressive disease (PD) or and adverse events (AEs) while on treatment and or died during the 30 day post-treatment are included. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Histologic diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

          2. Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             performance status schedule.

          3. Have had documented disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0; Therasse et al. 2000) within 3 months after receiving
             5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) plus bevacizumab as first-line
             therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease, or within 6 months after receiving
             FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting.

          4. Standard radiation therapy for rectal cancer is allowed. Participants must have
             recovered from the toxic effects (except for alopecia) of the treatment prior to study
             enrollment. Prior radiotherapy must be completed 4 weeks before study entry. Lesions
             that have been radiated in the advanced setting cannot be included as sites of
             measurable disease unless clear tumor progression has been documented in these lesions
             since the end of radiation therapy.

          5. At least one uni-dimensionally measurable lesion meeting RECIST v1.0 guidelines (at
             least 10 millimeters [mm] in longest diameter by spiral computerized tomography (CT)
             scan, or at least 20 mm by standard techniques). Positron emission tomography (PET)
             scans and ultrasounds may not be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Have received treatment within the last 4 weeks with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          2. Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating enzastaurin, irinotecan, or cetuximab.

          3. Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder [such as active infection including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or cardiac disease] that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the participant's ability to adhere to the protocol.

          4. Have a serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months,
             angina, or heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or
             IV.

          5. Have a prior malignancy (other than colorectal cancer, or adequately treated carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer), unless that prior malignancy was
             diagnosed and definitively treated at least 5 years previously with no subsequent
             evidence of recurrence. Participants with a history of low grade (Gleason score less
             than or equal to 6) localized prostate cancer will be eligible even if diagnosed less
             than 5 years previously.

          <title>Stage of Disease at Initial Diagnosis</title>
          <description>Cancer staging is a process describing the severity of the cancer, size of the tumor, and how far it has spread from the original location.
Stage IIb - invaded adjacent organs or penetrates peritoneum (outer lining of the colon); Stage IIIb - has spread to 1-3 nearby nodes; Stage IIIc - has spread to ≥ 4 nearby nodes; Stage IV - the cancer has spread to other organs of the body such as the lung, brain, or liver.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the first date of progressive disease or death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who did not have progressive disease, PFS was censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to disease progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy. The PFS probability values were multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage values.</description>

          <title>Duration of Response</title>
          <description>The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of disease progression or death from any cause. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria, CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs or complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not worsening) of 1 or more non-target lesions, with no new lesions appearing. For participants who died, the duration of response was censored at death. For participants still alive, duration of response was censored at the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>
