    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 study of DCC-3014 in patients with malignant
      solid tumors and tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). There will be 2 distinct parts in this
      study: Dose Escalation (Phase 1) and Expansion (Phase 2). Phase 1 will enroll both malignant
      solid tumor and TGCT patients. Phase 2 will comprise two cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B) and
      will only enroll TGCT patients.
