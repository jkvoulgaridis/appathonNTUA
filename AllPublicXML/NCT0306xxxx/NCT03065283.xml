      The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effects of diaphragmatic release
      techniques on posterior chain flexibility and lumbar spine amplitude; Respiratory muscle
      strength and chest cavity mobility in healthy women. This is an intervention study with a
      randomized controlled trial design. The randomized study in two groups, the Intervention
      Group in which two diaphragmatic release techniques were performed and the Control Group
      where two placebo techniques were applied in 75 participants between 18 and 35 years of age.
      For intragroup analysis the paired Student t test was used, comparing the outcomes before and
      after the intervention and for intergroup analysis the independent Student t test.
