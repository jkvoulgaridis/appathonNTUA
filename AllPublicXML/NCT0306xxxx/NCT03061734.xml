  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-Dose Naltrexone and Acetaminophen (LDNA) combines two well-established none-addictive
      medications, at lower doses than the doses used for the approved indications.

      The combination is a First-in-Class drug for the treatment of migraine due to its unique
      mechanism of action.

      Naltrexone 50 mg, is approved for the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction, based on its
      opioid antagonist properties. Yet, the underlying mechanism of naltrexone 's analgesic
      properties is attributable to its antagonism of Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR4). Naltrexone
      reversed acute and chronic neuropathic pain and migraine in animal studies (led by Dr. Linda
      Watkins). Toll-like Receptor-4 activation leads to an intracellular signaling pathway and
      inflammatory cytokine production which is responsible for activating the innate immune
      system. TLR4 signaling has emerged as a major pathway that mediates neuropathic pain.

      Naltrexone inhibits TLR4-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, [i.e., nitric oxide
      (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species (ROS)].

      Blocking TLR4 also leads to blocking of TLR4-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression.

      The biological rationale for LDNA is through naltrexone's inhibition of the TLR4-induced
      pro-inflammatory cytokine production and the inhibition of the TLR4-induced cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2) activation. Acetaminophen provides additional COX-2 blockage, delivering a one-two
      punch to COX-2 expression.

      Activators of TLR4 include endogenous Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP), which may
      consist of extracellular degradation products or dead cell components such as DNA, RNA, or
      plasma proteins.

      The resulting neuroinflammation in the spinal nerve roots and the trigeminal pathway leads to
      pain.

      Clinically, acetaminophen has been commonly used to yield synergy in analgesic combinations
      (e.g., Vicodin) and is meant to create synergy with naltrexone. Combining an optimal dose of
      acetaminophen with an opioid produces an analgesic effect greater than that obtained by
      doubling the dose of either constituent administered alone.

      The study consists of a screening visit, out-patient treatment of a migraine attack with a
      single dose of the study drug within 8 weeks, and End-of-Study Visit 2-7 days after treatment
      of a moderate or severe migraine attack.
