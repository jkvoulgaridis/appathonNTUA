  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health issues in post-treatment adult cancer survivors are associated with multiple
      adverse outcomes and may represent a cancer health disparity for rural survivors. The purpose
      of this study is to test a stepped-care approach tailored to symptom severity based on recent
      American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for reducing emotional distress (anxiety
      and/or depressive symptoms) and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue,
      fear of recurrence, quality of life) in rural, post-treatment cancer survivors in community
      oncology settings and to examine intervention costs. The resultant intervention will have
      great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by
      telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with
      different cancer types.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be stratified by baseline score ≥15 on the GAD-7 and/or on the PHQ-9, indicating severe significant anxiety or depressive symptom. Participants with moderate symptoms only (10-14 on the PHQ-9 and/or 8-14 on the GAD-7) will be block randomized to either the low-intensity stepped care or to the enhanced usual care (EUC control). Participants with moderate to severe symptoms will be block randomized to either the high-intensity stepped care intervention or the EUC control. Block sizes will be chosen randomly to ensure that future assignments cannot be inferred from previous ones.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The GAD-7 is a self-report measure of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Longitudinal changes in the GAD-7 will be measured in participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anxiety. Patients select 1 of 4 numbers with &quot;0&quot; indicating not all, to &quot;3&quot; indicating nearly everyday.

    <description>The PHQ-9 is a self-report measure of DSM-IV symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder where participants rate how often they experienced 9 symptoms over past 2 weeks. Patients select 1 of 4 numbers with &quot;0&quot; indicating not all, to &quot;3&quot; indicating nearly everyday. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.

    <description>A combined variable will be created that indicates if a participant had moderate/severe depression or anxiety at mid- or post-intervention. Each stepped care group will be compared with EUC using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach with a logit link to determine if rates of the combined outcome differ at mid- or post-intervention.</description>

ISI scores of 0-7 = no clinically significant insomnia; 8-14 =subthreshold insomnia; 15-21 clinical insomnia of moderate severity; 21-28 =severe clinical insomnia.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI; severity subscale) will be used to measure self-reported fear of recurrence of cancer. Items are rated on a 5-point scale, where 0 = never/not at all, 1 = rarely/a little, 2 = sometimes/somewhat, 3 = most of the time/a lot and 4 = all the time/a great deal. Longitudinal changes in the FCRI scores will be measured in participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on fear of cancer recurrence.</description>

    <description>Includes costs of intervention implementation &amp; health care costs for each participant. Implementation costs determined using data on time spent on intervention activities (tracking logs,staff interviews). Other costs (e.g., telephone, printed materials) valued using project records on expenses. All costs summed related to each intervention to obtain total cost of implementing. Total costs in each arm will be divided by # of patients served to obtain average cost/patient. Sensitivity analyses conducted to assess how implementation costs vary depending on inputs used, such as salaries. Health care cost determined using data from self-reported utilization of heath care services (Cornell Services Index). To calculate these costs, published data on avg costs of these events or data from sources (such as Medicare Fee Schedule, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) will be used. Analyses conducted to examine impact of interventions on health care utilization and costs. Use of linear models with</description>
