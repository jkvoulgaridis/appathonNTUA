  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PreTBI III study aims to investigate the prognostic potential of prehospital and repeated
      in-hospital S100B, NSE and GFAP measurements as predictors of neurological outcome in
      patients suffering severe TBI. Knowledge on prehospital S100B, GFAP and NSE levels as
      predictors of neurological outcome and mortality may underline the potential of a
      point-of-care analysis. Possibly, the early biomarker levels may contributed to accurate
      monitoring of biomarker dynamics and hereby support neurosurgeons and anaesthetists in the
      clinical decision-making regarding treatment and level of care offered to the patient.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Prehospital S100B level is a significant predictor of unfavourable neurological outcome
           (dichotomized disability rating scale (DRS) and glasgow outcome scale extended (GOS-E)
           measures) in severe TBI patients.

        2. Prehospital GFAP level is a significant predictor of unfavourable neurological outcome
           (dichotomized DRS and GOSE measures) in severe TBI patients.

        3. Prehospital NSE level is a significant predictor of unfavourable neurological outcome
           (dichotomized DRS and GOSE measures) in severe TBI patients.

        4. combined panel of prehospital S100B, GFAP and NSE levels is a significant predictor of
           unfavourable neurological outcome (dichotomized DRS and GOSE measures) in severe TBI
           patients.

        5. Unfavourable neurological outcome (dichotomized DRS and GOSE measures) in severe TBI
           patients can be predicted by dynamics in repeated measurements of S100B, GFAP and NSE.
