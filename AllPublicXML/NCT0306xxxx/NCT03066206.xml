  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well poziotinib works in treating patients with non-small
      lung cancer with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutation that is stage IV or has come back. Poziotinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) to poziotinib according to Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with
      EGFR exon 20 mutations.

      II. Assess the objective response rate (ORR) to poziotinib according to RECIST 1.1 criteria
      in NSCLC with HER2 (ErBB2) exon 20 mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable response) of poziotinb
      in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently.

      II. Progression free survival of poziotinb in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently.

      III. Overall survival of poziotinb in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently. IV. Duration of
      response of poziotinb in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently.

      V. Safety and toxicity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess molecular markers associated with resistance and response to poziotinib,
      including secondary mutations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive poziotinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
