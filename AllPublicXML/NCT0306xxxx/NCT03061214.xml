    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. The aim of the trial is to
      compare the effect of once-weekly dosing of two dose levels of semaglutide versus sitagliptin
      100 mg once-daily on glycaemic control after 30 weeks of treatment. Subjects will remain on
      their stable pre-trial metformin.

    <measure>Change in Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire: SF-36v2™ Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form (SF)-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey that measures patient's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured 8 domains of functional health &amp; well-being and 2 component summary scores (physical component summary-PCS and mental component summary-MCS). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 30. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire: DTSQs Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 30. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 3 -8. For items 1 and 2 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 1) or low (item 2). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 3-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in HbA1c</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was evaluated. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period and 'in trial' observation period. 'On-treatment without rescue medication' observation period: started at the date of first dose to either the day of last dose plus 7 days or first initiation of rescue medication, whichever came first. 'In-trial' observation period: started when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature treatment discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Change in Self-measured Plasma Glucose (SMPG) - Mean 7-point Profile</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in SMPG mean 7-point profile was evaluated. SMPG was recorded at the following 7 time points: before breakfast, 90 minutes after start of breakfast, before lunch, 90 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 90 minutes after dinner and at bedtime. Mean 7-point profile was defined as the area under the profile, calculated using the trapezoidal method, divided by the measurement time. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period which started at the date of first dose to either the day of last dose plus 7 days or first initiation of rescue medication, whichever came first.</description>

        <title>Change in Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire: SF-36v2™ Score</title>
        <description>Short Form (SF)-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey that measures patient's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured 8 domains of functional health &amp; well-being and 2 component summary scores (physical component summary-PCS and mental component summary-MCS). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 30. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire: DTSQs Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 30. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 3 -8. For items 1 and 2 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 1) or low (item 2). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 3-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

          <description>Severe or blood glucose (BG)-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia is an episode that is severe according to the American Diabetes Association classification or blood glucose-confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Percentage of participants who achieved HbA1c below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes and no weight gain (yes/no) is presented. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period, which started at the date of first dose to either the day of last dose plus 7 days or first initiation of rescue medication, whichever came first.</description>

        <title>Participants With Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Number of participants with treatment emergent severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes defined as treatment-emergent if the onset of the episode occurs within the on-treatment observation period. Severe or BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia is an episode that is severe according to the American Diabetes Association classification or blood glucose-confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Results are based on the 'on-treatment' observation period. On-treatment observation period is defined as the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication.</description>

        <description>This outcome measure is only applicable for the semaglutide arms. Anti-semaglutide antibody level at week 30 and week 35 are presented. Antibody levels were measured in percentage of bound radioactivity-labelled semaglutide/total added radioactivity-labelled semaglutide (%B/T; B =Bound, T = Total). Evaluation was based on 'in trial' observation period, which is the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature treatment discontinuation.</description>

          <description>Participants were randomised to 2 different groups (Group 1: sitagliptin + semaglutide placebo 0.5 mg and Group 2: sitagliptin + semaglutide placebo 1.0 mg). Both groups were pooled together for data analysis. Participants took 100 mg sitagliptin tablets once-daily for 30 weeks. Participants also took semaglutide placebo injection with volume matched to different doses (0.25 mg/0.5 mg/1.0 mg) of semaglutide injection for 30 weeks. Both sitagliptin and semaglutide placebo were taken any time of the day irrespective of meals. Participants continued taking their pre-trial metformin with the same dose and frequency throughout the trial.</description>
