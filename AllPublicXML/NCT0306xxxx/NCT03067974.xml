    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of intranasal ketamine for adequate
      sedation of children undergoing minor procedures in the Emergency Department. An intranasal
      dose of 10mg/kg will be used in patients requiring procedural sedation. The investigators
      hypothesize that this dose of intranasal ketamine will be able to provide adequate sedation
      and analgesia for the physician to successfully complete the planned diagnostic or
      therapeutic intervention (Pediatr Emer Care 2012;28: 767-70). The primary endpoint will be
      successful sedation, as defined by the ability to complete the planned procedure without
      rescue medication, which includes re-dosing of the same medication.
