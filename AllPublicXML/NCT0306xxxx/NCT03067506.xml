  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and compliance with a novel method
      for assessing mood and cognition in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel method being tested in this study for assessing mood and cognition in participants
      with MDD was wearable technology. This study looked at the correlation of mood and cognition
      outcomes on wearable technology with traditional objective neuropsychological cognitive
      function tests and self-reported mood outcomes.

      The study enrolled approximately 30 patients. Participants were provided with a watch on
      which brief cognitive and mood tests were evaluated daily up to 6 weeks.

      All participants prompted to complete cognitive and mood assessments on 3 occasions across
      the day. Two occasions (morning and afternoon) comprised assessment of cognition, and the
      final assessment in the evening constituted a review of the day focusing on self-reported
      depressed mood.

      This single-center trial was conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in
      this study was 6 weeks. Participants took part up to 5 study visits (1 in-person on-site
      visit, 3 web-based and 1 at home visit) assessing performance on traditional objective
      neuropsychological cognitive function tests and self-reported measures of depression symptom
      severity and social function.

    <measure>Correlation Coefficient Between Measures of Cognition (N-back Scores) and Performance on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Tests: Spatial Working Memory Between Errors (SWMBE) and Spatial Working Memory Strategy (SWMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The n-back was used to assess cognition 3 times a day. Participants responded by touching the watch face when a symbol matched the one presented 2-back. Average daily n-back score (d-prime) was calculated.
CANTAB tests consists of a battery of neuropsychological tests. Spatial Working Memory (SWM) assessed retention of spatial data, ability to manipulate remembered items and strategize. Participant was asked to find tokens in on-screen boxes and move them.
SWMBE=cumulative number of times participant went back to box that a token was previously removed per each successful study. Lower score was better.
SWMS=number of unique boxes participant searched in two 6 and 8 box trials. Total of 4 trial scores ranged from 4-28. Lower score indicated better performance.
Pearson's correlation coefficient measured linear correlation between n-back scores from Apple Watch and CANTAB tests, provided as a value +1=positive correlation to -1=negative correlation. 0=no correlation.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Coefficient Between Measures of Cognition (N-back Scores) and Performance on the CANTAB Test: Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The n-back was used to assess cognition 3 times a day. Participants responded by touching the watch face when a symbol matched the one presented 2-back. Average daily n-back score (d-prime) was calculated.
CANTAB tests consists of a battery of neuropsychological tests. RVP measures sustained attention. A white box appears in the center of the computer screen, inside which digits, from 2 to 9, appear in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are requested to detect target sequences of digits.
RVPA=measure of sensitivity to the target, regardless of response tendency (expected range is 0.00 to 1.00).
Speed of Processing (RVPMDL)=The mean response latency during assessment sequence blocks where the participant responded correctly.
Pearson's correlation coefficient measured linear correlation between n-back scores from Apple Watch and CANTAB tests, provided a value +1=positive correlation to -1=negative correlation. 0=no correlation.</description>

        <title>Correlation Coefficient Between Measures of Cognition (N-back Scores) and Performance on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Tests: Spatial Working Memory Between Errors (SWMBE) and Spatial Working Memory Strategy (SWMS)</title>
        <description>The n-back was used to assess cognition 3 times a day. Participants responded by touching the watch face when a symbol matched the one presented 2-back. Average daily n-back score (d-prime) was calculated.
CANTAB tests consists of a battery of neuropsychological tests. Spatial Working Memory (SWM) assessed retention of spatial data, ability to manipulate remembered items and strategize. Participant was asked to find tokens in on-screen boxes and move them.
SWMBE=cumulative number of times participant went back to box that a token was previously removed per each successful study. Lower score was better.
SWMS=number of unique boxes participant searched in two 6 and 8 box trials. Total of 4 trial scores ranged from 4-28. Lower score indicated better performance.
Pearson's correlation coefficient measured linear correlation between n-back scores from Apple Watch and CANTAB tests, provided as a value +1=positive correlation to -1=negative correlation. 0=no correlation.</description>

        <description>The n-back was used to assess cognition 3 times a day. Participants responded by touching the watch face when a symbol matched the one presented 2-back. Average daily n-back score (d-prime) was calculated.
CANTAB tests consists of a battery of neuropsychological tests. RVP measures sustained attention. A white box appears in the center of the computer screen, inside which digits, from 2 to 9, appear in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are requested to detect target sequences of digits.
RVPA=measure of sensitivity to the target, regardless of response tendency (expected range is 0.00 to 1.00).
Speed of Processing (RVPMDL)=The mean response latency during assessment sequence blocks where the participant responded correctly.
Pearson's correlation coefficient measured linear correlation between n-back scores from Apple Watch and CANTAB tests, provided a value +1=positive correlation to -1=negative correlation. 0=no correlation.</description>
