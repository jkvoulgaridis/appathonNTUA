  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the leading cause of death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for about one-third of
      U.S. mortality. Physical inactivity, one of the main CVD risk factors, causes 6% of coronary
      heart disease worldwide. The American Heart Association has identified cardiovascular health
      behaviors including smoking, obesity, diet, and aerobic exercise; however, resistance
      exercise was not included due to the limited evidence of its efficacy. Comparatively, the
      cardiovascular benefits of aerobic training have been well-documented whereas the independent
      and additive benefits of resistance training on cardiovascular health have not been
      established. Thus, this project is aimed to answer one of the most common questions about
      exercise and health:&quot;What type or combination of exercise is most effective for CVD
      prevention?&quot; This project will significantly contribute to developing more effective CVD
      prevention approaches, advancing more comprehensive physical activity guidelines, and
      providing important insights and novel opportunities for the future science of physical
      activity and health.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, combined
      aerobic and resistance exercise, or a no exercise control group for 1 year. Participants in
      all four groups will receive healthy diet and lifestyle education sessions and will track
      their daily steps, body weights, and food intake throughout the 1-year intervention. They
      will also complete baseline, 6-month, and 12-month physical examinations, which will include
      assessments of blood pressure, blood lipids, body composition, and aerobic and muscular
      fitness.

    <description>The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the composite cardiovascular disease risk score (z-score) calculated using resting blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and percent body fat. Each risk factor will be individually standardized and expressed as sex-specific z-score by using the formula = (value - mean)/standard deviation for each participant.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Aerobic exercise (AE)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>AE training will consist of 60 min of treadmill, elliptical, or bike exercise at a moderate to vigorous intensity (50-80% of heart rate reserve). Intensity of the exercise sessions will be built up gradually. Sessions will occur 3 times per week for the duration of the 1 year trial.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Resistance exercise (RE)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>RE will consist of 3 sets of 8-15 repetitions at 50-80% of 1 rep-max of each exercise for 12 exercises (chest press, shoulder press, pull-down, back extension, abdominal crunch, torso rotation, biceps curl, triceps extension, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, and calf raise). Weight loads will be increased gradually. With one minute of rest between sets, this plan is estimated to take approximately 60 minutes per session. Sessions will occur 3 times per week for the duration of the 1 year trial.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Combined Resistance and Aerobic Exercise</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will perform exactly the same AE and RE exercises as listed previously; however, the time of AE and RE will each be reduced to 30 min (for 60 min/session total). For the RE aspect, participants will perform 2 sets of 8-15 repetitions of 9 exercises (excluding biceps curl, triceps extension, and calf raise, as these are minor muscle groups). Exercise intensity and resistance will be increased gradually. Combined AE and RE sessions will take place 3 times per week for the duration of the trial.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>No training control</arm_group_label>

    <description>Participants in this group will be asked to maintain their current level of activity during the 1 year study period. After 1 year, they will be offered the training program of their choice (AE, RE, or combined).</description>

    <ipd_description>Datasets will be available to outside researchers and public health professionals through the web sites of the ClinicalTrials.gov and The Physical Activity Epidemiology Laboratory at Iowa State University. Outside researchers can learn what data are available and request a de-identified dataset (stripped of all personal health identifiers). All outside investigators must pass an NIH-approved equivalent course on the Protection of Human Subjects. All data requests will be discussed with the research team and approval will be obtained from the institutional review board overseeing the proposal of the data analysis project. Findings from the proposed study will also be disseminated at national and international meetings and publish the findings in peer-reviewed journals. The investigators seek to maximize the knowledge discovered from this study by sharing data to expedite the translation of research into practice to improve cardiovascular health.</ipd_description>
