  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using CARTOFINDER™ maps
      created by the RHYTHMFINDER-192 catheter and the CARTOFINDER™ Algorithm to terminate
      persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF) to either Normal Sinus Rhythm or Atrial Tachycardia
      compared to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in treating PsAF. The RHYTHMFINDER-192 catheter is
      investigational, while the CARTOFINDER™ system is CE marked in Europe.

      All subjects with persistent AF who are scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated ablation
      procedure for management of their persistent AF will be the target population for screening.
      The study will enroll approximately 40-70 subjects. Subjects will undergo CARTOFINDER™ guided
      ablation (CFGA) followed by PVI. Subjects will have follow-up visits at 7 days, 3, 6 and 12
      months postprocedure.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with adverse device effects was reported. Adverse Device Effect (ADE's) are adverse events related to the use of an investigational medical device. This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition includes any event resulting from use errors or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Procedural Related Serious Adverse Event and Non-serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment and therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. TEAEs were defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on after start of study drug(s) dosing through safety follow-up visit. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulting in any of following outcomes: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.</description>

          <description>Number of participants with adverse device effects was reported. Adverse Device Effect (ADE's) are adverse events related to the use of an investigational medical device. This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition includes any event resulting from use errors or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment and therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. TEAEs were defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on after start of study drug(s) dosing through safety follow-up visit. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulting in any of following outcomes: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.</description>
