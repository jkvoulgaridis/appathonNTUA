  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a feasibility pilot of an intervention to respond to positive screening
      tests for mental health(MH) and substance use (SU) captured through the Patient Reported
      Outcomes questionnaires (PROs). The PROs are currently performed in the clinic, however, the
      results are neither reviewed with patients nor transmitted to providers. This pilot assesses
      the feasibility of moving the PROs into the clinical realm by having patients review the PRO
      results, identifying an issue to discuss at the patient's next HIV primary care visit, and
      determining whether this process increases discussion of MH and SU disorders in the
      subsequent clinical visit and/or increases referrals to MH and/or SU treatment.
