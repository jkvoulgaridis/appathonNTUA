  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of a mindful walking intervention for management of knee
      osteoarthritis. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions
      i.e. mindful walking intervention or a self-care intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with knee osteoarthritis have low levels of physical activity, especially walking
      activity. They also walk with abnormal walking biomechanics that are associated with greater
      knee loading. Therefore, it is important to increase the levels of walking activity in people
      with knee osteoarthritis, but also change their walking patterns to reduce knee loading.

      This study will last 12 months and participants will be randomized into 2 groups. For the
      first 6-months, half of the participants will attend sessions at a community location that
      include training in mindful walking technique. The other half will meet for the same
      frequency and duration at a community location for education on osteoarthritis and its
      management (focusing on symptom management, importance of physical activity, weight
      management, etc.). Both groups will also receive a wrist-worn activity monitor and a
      smartphone application that they will use throughout the study. After 6-months all
      participants will be allowed to practice on their own.

      All participants will complete gait analysis, knee MRI, questionnaires, physical function
      assessment at baseline and at 6-months. All participants will also complete questionnaires at
      3,9, and 12 months. Weekly physical activity and knee pain data will be collected using the
      mobile health technology for 12- months.
