  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lifetime risk for a woman to undergo surgery for either vaginal prolapse or urinary
      incontinence is high. There are many different surgical techniques for treatment of prolapse,
      but there is a lack of knowledge about factors that contribute to objective result and
      patient satisfaction after surgery.

      The aim of the study is to investigate factors that could be related to patient satisfaction
      and objective result such as pelvic floor muscle contractility/strength and muscle injury,
      objective measures of prolapse and women's symptoms. This study will investigate whether
      systematic pelvic floor exercise and life style advise before surgery can improve outcomes
      after surgery for either vaginal prolapse. Another aim is to determine an ultrasound scale
      for measure of pelvic floor muscle contraction.

    <description>In preparation for surgery, patients receive individual information by a physiotherapist on pelvic floor anatomy and correct pelvic floor contraction. Patients are told to do the following pelvic floor exercises 3 times a day: 8-12 maximal contractions, hold contractions during 10 seconds, and 3 fast contractions after each long contraction. In addition exercise in groups with skilled physical therapists once a week during 12 weeks.</description>
