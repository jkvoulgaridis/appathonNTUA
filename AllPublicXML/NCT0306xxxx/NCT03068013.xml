  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with advanced cancer suffer from a variety of psycho-social symptoms
      that impair quality of life and may benefit from psychotherapeutic treatment. We describe
      here the methodology of a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a novel
      and brief semi-structured psychotherapeutic intervention, called Managing Cancer and Living
      Meaningfully (CALM), originally developed in Canada and now cross-culturally tested in Italy.

      Methods/Design: The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions:
      CALM intervention versus nonspecific supportive intervention (SPI) and assessments at
      baseline, 3 and 6 months. The coordinating site is the Program on Psycho-Oncology and
      Psychiatry in Palliative Care, University of Ferrara and Integrated Department of Mental
      Health, S. Anna University Hospital, in Ferrara, Italy. Other centres from northern and
      southern Italy will collaborate. Eligibility criteria include: ≥ 18 years of age; Italian
      fluency; no cognitive impairment; and diagnosis of advanced cancer. The intervention consists
      of 12 sessions , following the CALM manual and allowing for flexibility to meet individual
      patients' needs. It is delivered over a 6-month period and provides reflective space for
      patients (and their primary caregivers) to address 4 main domains: symptom management and
      communication with health care providers; changes in self and relations with close others;
      sense of meaning and purpose; and the future and mortality. The primary outcome is depression
      and the primary endpoint is at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include demoralization,
      generalized anxiety, death anxiety, spiritual well-being, quality of life, attachment
      security, posttraumatic growth, communication with partners, and satisfaction with clinical
      interactions.

      Discussion: This trial is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of CALM in an
      Italian cancer setting. The intervention has potential cross-national relevance and, if shown
      to be effective, has the potential to be disseminated as a new approach in oncology to
      relieve distress and promote psychological well-being in patients with advanced cancer.

    <textblock>
      The study is coordinated by the Program on Psycho-Oncology and Palliative Care, Institute of
      Psychiatry, University of Ferrara and University Hospital Psychiatry Unit, Integrated
      Department of Mental Health, S. Anna University Hospital and Health Authorities in Ferrara,
      Northern Italy. Other centres from northern and southern Italy will collaborate. The authors
      R.C. and L.G. were directly trained in CALM in the Department of Supportive Care, Princess
      Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto. Other trained professionals in psychotherapy and
      psycho-oncology will also provide CALM interventions, after having attended a training course
      carried out by the principal investigators (RC, LG). The study is designed as a
      single-blinded randomized-controlled trial with two arms, experimental group and control
      group. Participants in the experimental group will receive the CALM intervention for advanced
      cancer, while those in Control Group will receive a supportive intervention (SPI) , which is
      usual psycho-oncology care in our settings.

      The primary outcome is the improvement of depression. The primary endpoint is 6 months.
      Secondary outcomes include demoralization, generalized anxiety, death anxiety, spiritual
      well-being, quality of life, attachment security, posttraumatic growth, communication with
      partners, and satisfaction with clinical interactions.

      The study has been submitted for approval to the University Hospital and Health Authorities
      Ethical Committee of Ferrara, and to the Ethical Committees of the other collaborating
      centres in Turin, Florence and Cosenza, Italy.

      Pilot phase - In line with the approach of the original authors and other international CALM
      investigators, a preliminary pilot un-blinded study was carried out over a one-year period in
      our centre, prior to initiating the CALM randomized controlled trial . This pilot phase had
      the aim of testing and assessing the feasibility of and the standard operating procedures
      outlined for the CALM randomized controlled trial, and the acceptability of the intervention
      within an Italian context. This was important since concepts of meaning, spirituality,
      existential growth and attachment might emerge differently in the Italian setting than in the
      Canadian setting where CALM was developed. The subjective experience of participants
      receiving this intervention was also examined qualitatively. Patient recruitment followed the
      procedure outlined for the CALM randomized controlled trial, except there was no blinding.

      Interventions

      Patients in the experimental group will receive the brief, individual, manualized CALM
      intervention, a semi-structured psychotherapy designed for patients with advanced cancer.
      CALM was developed based on empirical results, clinical observation and the theoretical
      foundations of supportive-expressive and existential approaches, as well psychodynamic and
      attachment theories. In this Italian adaptation, CALM consists of 12 individual sessions
      (45-60 minutes each), instead of the original 6 sessions. The sessions are delivered
      bimonthly over a period of 6 months.

      According to the original protocol and the CALM manual, the intervention covers four domains,
      namely: 1) Symptom management and communication with health care providers, aimed at
      improving cooperation and communication with health care providers, and consequently medical
      decision-making and control of symptoms; 2) Changes in self and relations with close others,
      aimed at supporting disruptions of self-esteem and identity related to cancer and its
      treatment. 3) Spiritual well-being, sense of meaning and purpose, aimed at addressing changes
      in life priorities and the meaning of the suffering related to the advanced phase of cancer;
      4) Preparing for the future, sustaining hope and facing mortality, aimed at addressing
      existential fears and concerns, planning advanced treatment, and preparing for the process of
      dying.

      All domains are addressed with each patient, but the time devoted to each module varies,
      based on the concerns that emerge as most relevant to each patient in specific sessions. The
      participant's principal caregiver is invited to participate in one or more of the sessions,
      as deemed appropriate by the therapist.

      At any time during the intervention, patients deemed to be at acute risk for suicide, or who
      demonstrate significant worsening of depression, or who require treatment for other
      psychiatric co-morbidities, based on the clinical judgment of the therapists, are referred
      for psychiatric assessment and treatment.

      Non-manualized supportive psycho-oncology intervention (SPI) The Control group intervention
      (SPI) includes counseling, information, crisis intervention, which is the usual care
      intervention provided in our center. As with CALM patients, SPI patients receive up to twelve
      sessions of individual therapy during a period of 6 months, each session lasting 50 minutes.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria

      Eligible patients referred to receive psychosocial support from any of the collaborating
      departments are invited by a research assistant to take part in the study and signed informed
      consent will be obtained from consenting patients. Inclusion criteria are: 1) 18 years of age
      or more; 2) fluency in Italian language; 3) absence of cognitive deficit documented in the
      clinical records; 4) diagnosis of &quot;wet&quot; stage IIIB or IV lung cancer; any stage of pancreatic
      cancer, stage III or IV ovarian and fallopian tube cancers, or other stage IV gynecological
      cancer; and stage IV breast, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, melanoma, sarcoma, or endocrine
      cancers (all with an expected survival of 12-18 months); a score ≥10 at the Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ9) and/or ≥ 20 at the Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS). Exclusion
      criteria are: 1) language barriers hindering psychotherapy; 2) inability to commit to the
      required 12 sessions; 3) concomitant psychotherapy.

      Randomization procedure

      Study participants are randomly assigned to receive either CALM or SPI. After obtaining
      informed consent by a patient, a research assistant includes his/her data on the random
      allocation list and informs the PI's about treatment allocation (CALM or SPI). The patient is
      not informed about their treatment condition (CaLM or SPI).

      Quality standards and therapists training

      The CALM Treatment Manual The research group translated and adapted the CALM Treatment Manual
      into the Italian language.

      Therapist qualifications The investigators and therapists are psychiatrists and clinical
      psychologists trained in psychotherapy with psycho-oncology expertise.

      CALM training CALM therapists receive a comprehensive CALM training at the study center.
      Therapists randomized to the control condition do not receive any additional training.

      Supervision In order to ensure the quality of therapy and treatment fidelity, both CALM and
      SPI therapists receive regular supervision by experienced supervisors.

      Measures

      The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 9-item measure of depression. It is composed by
      nine items, reflecting DSM-IV criteria for major depression. A four-point Likert scale scores
      from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), with a cut-off score of ≥10 suggesting
      depression. For study purposes, two additional items assessing self-harm intention and rating
      how difficult these symptoms have made it to do lead one's life, have been included.

      The Demoralization Scale (DS) is a 24-item self-report tool assessing demoralization
      components of loss of meaning and purpose, dysphoria, disheartenment and helplessness. Items
      are scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (all the time). Low
      levels of demoralization were indicated by a score 10, moderate demoralization by a score
      11-36, and high demoralization by a score &gt; 37.

      The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) is a 7-item self-report instrument
      screening the severity of GAD symptoms. Items are scored on a four-point Likert scale ranging
      from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores ≤4 indicate absence of anxiety, scores
      from 5 to 9 suggest that mild anxiety is present, and scores from 10 to 15 indicate moderate
      levels of anxiety. An eighth item rating how difficult these symptoms have made it to lead
      one's daily life has been included.

      The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-SP)[v]
      is a 12-item self-report tool, exploring spiritual well-being, in terms of sense of meaning,
      faith and inner peace. Items are scored on a five-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4
      (very much), with higher scores indicating a greater spiritual wellbeing.

      The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) is a 21-item self-report measure of positive
      psychological changes after traumatic events. It consists of four subscales: New
      Possibilities, Appreciation of Life, Relating to Others and Spiritual Change. Items are
      scored on a three-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 2 (very much) with higher
      scores indicating greater post-traumatic growth.

      The Quality of Life at the End of Life-Cancer Scale (QUAL-EC) is a self- report measure of
      quality of life in patients near the end of life. It originally consists of four subscales:
      Symptom Control, Relationship with Health Care Providers, Preparation for End of Life and
      Life Completion. For this study purposes, the symptom control subscale is not included, thus
      only items 4-17 are used. Items are scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not
      at all) to 5 (completely), with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.

      The Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS), is a 15-item self-report measure assessing
      specific concerns of advanced cancer patients about end of life, feeling a burden to others
      and wasted opportunities. It is scored on a six-point Likert scale from 0 (no distress) to 5
      (very much distress), with higher scores indicating higher death anxiety and distress.

      The Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory Modified Short Form Version (ECR-M16), is
      used in its 16-item self-report form to measure the attachment style. The scale yields scores
      on two dimensions of attachment: avoidance and anxiety. Items are scored on a seven-point
      Likert scale ranging from 1 (disagree) to 7 (agree), with a total sum score on each subscale
      ranging from 16 to 56. Higher scores on both subscales indicate higher attachment insecurity.

      The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) [x]assesses the disease symptom severity. The
      scale, in its shortened version (MSAS- short form), measures the presence and severity of 28
      common physical symptoms of cancer. Items are scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging
      from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).

      The Couple Communication Scale (CCS) is used for participants who have a partner. The 10-item
      CCS taken from the PREPARE/ENRICH Inventory is concerned with an individual's feelings,
      beliefs, and attitudes about the communication in his/her romantic relationship. Each item is
      scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

      Intervention and control participants will complete the Clinical Evaluation Questionnaire
      (CEQ) at 3 and 6-months. The CEQ is a seven-item self-report questionnaire which assesses the
      amount of clinical benefit patients have experienced by from therapy at the time of the
      assessment. Items are rated from 0 to 4, with 0 (no clinical benefit) and 4 (a great clinical
      benefit).

      Satisfaction of patients will also be qualitatively assessed by inviting them to share
      comments in a written form after completing CEQ questionnaire.

      Assessment

      At baseline (T0), participants provide demographics and medical and treatment data using a
      standardized questionnaire and will complete all outcome measures, with the exception of the
      CEQ. The PHQ-9 and DADDS are first administered to assess eligibility prior to study entry,
      followed by the remaining baseline outcomes. Follow-up assessments on all outcomes are
      collected at three months (T1) and six months (T2). The CEQ is administered only at three
      months (T1) and six months (T2) as it is an evaluation of the intervention received to date.
      At T2, participants will also be queried about their having remained blind (or not) to
      randomization.

      Statistical methods

      Power Calculation

      to detect an affect size (Cohens'd) of 0.45 with 80% power and alpha set to 0.05 with a
      correlation of 0.70 between baseline and endpoint assessment, a sample size of 41 individuals
      per group would be required at study end. Assuming a study completion rate of 80% and a
      treatment compliance rate of 90%, then 63 individuals per group would be required at
      baseline, or a total of 126 individuals at baseline.

      Data Analysis

      Statistical analyses will be carried out by using the Statistical Package for Social Science
      Statistic program. For the final analyses we will use an intention-to- treat approach and
      compare patients in the assigned groups. Main analyses to evaluate effectiveness regarding
      primary and secondary outcomes will be performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). We
      hypothesize that mean depression scores in the intervention group will be lower than in the
      control group at 3 and 6 months, when controlled for baseline and relevant disease-related
      covariates. As a sensitivity analysis, we will use multiple imputation to examine the
      influence of missing values. Lastly, prior trial results suggest that there may be group
      differences in the processing of death-related distress such that individuals with moderate
      death anxiety are more responsive to intervention than those with low death anxiety
      (approximately the lower third of the distribution) or high death anxiety (the upper third).
      We plan to conduct a subanalysis to confirm this effect.

      Discussion

      Failure to sustain &quot;double awareness&quot; of engaging with life while facing one's imminent death
      is a risk in advanced phases of cancer and may be associated with depression, demoralization
      and other facets of existential distress, thus complicating adjustment at the end of life.
      CALM is a novel psychotherapeutic intervention aimed at reducing depression, anxiety and
      demoralization in advanced cancer patients, while promoting meaning-making processes. This
      trial is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of CALM in an Italian cancer setting.
      The intervention has possible cross-national relevance and, if shown to be effective, has the
      potential to be disseminated as a new approach in oncology to relieve distress and promote
      psychological well-being in patients with advanced cancer.
