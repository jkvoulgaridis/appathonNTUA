  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-interventional study in women 18 to 84 years of age. Subjects will provide
      a sample for genetic testing and information about their medical and family history. The
      results of the genetic test will be combined with clinical data to validate a method of
      predicting breast cancer risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non- interventional study. Women presenting at imaging centers for
      routine breast cancer screening or breast cancer diagnostic assessment and who provide
      written informed consent will undergo genetic testing. Subjects will also provide information
      about their personal medical and cancer history and family cancer history. The results of the
      genetic test will be combined with the subject's clinical information, family history, and a
      risk assessment model to validate a new method of predicting breast cancer.
