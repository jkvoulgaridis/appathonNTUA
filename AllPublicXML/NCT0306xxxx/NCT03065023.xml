    <time_frame>Up to 90 days post last injection (Up to approximately 192 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered study treatment which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-related was defined as having a &quot;Possible&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; relationship to study treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. Severity of AE referred to the extent to which an AE affected the participants daily activities as assessed by the Investigator and was based on NCI CTCAE grades: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening); Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequences); or Grade 5 (Death related to AE). The number of participants who experienced at least one treatment-related AE or laboratory abnormality are presented by severity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days post last injection (Up to approximately 192 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE was defined as any AE, regardless of dose, causality or expectedness, that:
Resulted in death;
Was life-threatening;
Required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing inpatient hospitalization;
Resulted in persistent or significant incapacity or disability;
Was a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
Was any other medically important event.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a study treatment which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-related was defined as having a &quot;Possible&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; relationship to study treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to a treatment-related AE is presented.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) by Severity Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Up to approximately 28 days); Each cycle was 28 days.</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs were assessed during the first treatment cycle (28 days) &amp; were defined as any drug-related toxicity that occurred during the 28-day DLT period and included:
Non-hematologic toxicity grade ≥3 (except diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting unless lasting &gt;3 days despite optimal supportive care);
Confirmed (with a second measurement after 24 hours) non-hematologic appropriately graded laboratory findings of Grade ≥3 that were ≤ Grade 1 at baseline;
Hematologic toxicity:
Grade 4 neutropenia ≥5 days, or Grade 3 neutropenia with fever (fever is &gt;38.4ºC)
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting &gt;7 days or with bleeding; and
Any other toxicity assessed as related to MK-4621, and which, in the opinion of the Investigator and the Sponsor physician constituted a DLT.
The number of participants who experienced a DLT is presented by NCI CTCAE version 4.03 severity grade.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate as Evaluated Radiologically Using Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days post last injection (Up to approximately 162 days)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response. Per irRECIST, CR (irCR) was defined as the complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable lesions. Lymph nodes must also have decreased to &lt;0 mm in short axis. And, per irRECIST, Partial Response (irPR) was defined as a decrease of ≥30% in total measured tumor burden (TMTB) relative to baseline. For this study, irRECIST was modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experienced an irCR or irPR based on irRECIST is presented.</description>

          <description>Participants with transdermally/transmucosally injectable tumors including cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph node injectable tumors received MK-4621 0.8 mg via IT/IL injection twice each week over a period of 4 weeks during Cycle 1. Participants may have continued to receive study treatment beyond Cycle 1 for the remaining duration of the study as long as clinical benefit (no overt clinical progression or toxicity considered to be intolerable as per Investigator’s assessment) was present (could have been up to approximately 2 years). Each cycle was 28 days.</description>

          <description>Participants with injectable liver tumors or liver metastases were to receive escalating doses of MK-4621 via IT/IL injection once each week over a period of 4 weeks. Participants were to have been able to continue to receive study treatment beyond Cycle 1 for the remaining duration of the study as long as clinical benefit (no overt clinical progression or toxicity considered to be intolerable as per Investigator’s assessment) was present (could have been up to approximately 2 years). (Group B was not started for business reasons. Development will continue with new protocol.)</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-related Adverse Event (AE) or Laboratory Abnormality by Severity Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 Criteria</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered study treatment which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-related was defined as having a &quot;Possible&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; relationship to study treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. Severity of AE referred to the extent to which an AE affected the participants daily activities as assessed by the Investigator and was based on NCI CTCAE grades: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening); Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequences); or Grade 5 (Death related to AE).

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) by Severity Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 Criteria</title>
        <description>DLTs were assessed during the first treatment cycle (28 days) &amp; were defined as any drug-related toxicity that occurred during the 28-day DLT period and included:
Non-hematologic toxicity grade ≥3 (except diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting unless lasting &gt;3 days despite optimal supportive care);
Confirmed (with a second measurement after 24 hours) non-hematologic appropriately graded laboratory findings of Grade ≥3 that were ≤ Grade 1 at baseline;
Hematologic toxicity:
Grade 4 neutropenia ≥5 days, or Grade 3 neutropenia with fever (fever is &gt;38.4ºC)
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting &gt;7 days or with bleeding; and
Any other toxicity assessed as related to MK-4621, and which, in the opinion of the Investigator and the Sponsor physician constituted a DLT.

Per irRECIST, CR (irCR) was defined as the complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable lesions. Lymph nodes must also have decreased to &lt;0 mm in short axis. And, per irRECIST, Partial Response (irPR) was defined as a decrease of ≥30% in total measured tumor burden (TMTB) relative to baseline.

          <description>Sequential participant tumor biopsies were assessed via immunohistochemistry for the presence of tumor infiltrating CD3 T cell co-receptor-marked cells and Ki-67 nuclear protein-marked cells in tumor biopsies. CD3 is a marker of T cells and KI-67 is a cell marker of proliferation and activation. The percentage of positive CD3-marked cells and double-positive CD3 and Ki-67 nuclear protein-marked cells in tumor biopsies predose on Day 1 are presented.</description>
