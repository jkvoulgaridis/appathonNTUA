  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SYNTAX score (SS) has been recommended by clinical guideline and appropriate use criteria
      for coronary revascularization (CR) to provide guidance on optimal treatment strategies for
      patients with stable coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, discrepancy in SS between
      angiographic core lab (ACL) and cardiologists has been found. Whether the misestimate will
      lead to inappropriate CR and whether a SS intervention will improve CR appropriateness in
      patients with stable CAD remain unknown.

      Thus, our study aims at evaluating whether a real-time feedback from ACL rightafter the
      angiographies will improve CR appropriateness. A before-and-after controlled trial was
      designed. In the first period of time, stable CAD patients undergoing elective coronary
      angiographies with at least one coronary lesion stenosis ≥ 50% from one Chinese cardiac
      center will be continuously recruited as the control group. In the second period, eligible
      patients will be recruited continuously and a real-time SS category feedback from ACL
      rightafter the angiography will be given to the cardiologists. Appropriateness of treatment
      strategies in two groups will be analyzed to determine whether a real-time SS feedback can
      improve the treatment appropriateness. The appropriateness of treatment strategies will be
      adjudicated by Chinese version appropriate use criteria for CR.
