  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to develop and pilot-test a web-based smoking
      cessation program that specifically addresses heavy drinking (HD). The project builds upon a
      well-established, free evidence-based smoking cessation website, BecomeAnEX.org (&quot;EX&quot;), which
      is supported by Truth Initiative, a national non-profit public health organization, and its
      research arm, the Schroeder Institute. Investigators will develop an alternative version of
      BecomenAnEX that will include detailed content on alcohol's relation to smoking relapse,
      health effects of alcohol (including moderate drinking recommendations) along with related
      worksheets, feedback materials, and links to resources for drinking. Once a version of
      BecomeAnEX is developed that specifically addresses HD (called EX-HD), the investigators will
      conduct a one-arm open pilot of the site with 30 HD smokers recruited from newly registered
      BecomeAnEX users. The study will gather participant feedback on the site as well as site use
      metrics (e.g., number of logins, number of pages viewed, use of interactive components) and
      will revise EX-HD in response to this feedback in preparation for Stage 1b work. Stage 1b
      will use the updated EX-HD version to run a small scale randomized clinical trial where 120
      participants will be randomly assigned to the standard version of BecomeAnEX or to EX-HD.
