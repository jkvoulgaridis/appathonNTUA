    <textblock>
      This clinical study will assess the metal concentrations present in the blood serum of
      patients who receive surgical treatment with the PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc at two contiguous
      cervical levels from C3-C7. The information obtained from this clinical investigation will be
      used to support the post market surveillance for a PMA supplement for the PRESTIGE LP™
      Cervical Disc implanted at two contiguous levels.

    <measure>Concentrations of Titanium, Vanadium, and Aluminum in the blood serum</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative, 6 weeks, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The concentrations of Titanium, Vanadium, and Aluminum at different time points will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall success</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients enrolled in the study who receive the PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc at two contiguous levels will be considered an overall success if the following criteria are met:
NDI score improvement of at least 15 points from baseline;
Maintenance or improvement in neurological status;
No serious AE classified as implant associated/related or implant/surgical procedure associated/related;
No secondary surgical procedure classified as a &quot;failure&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NDI success</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Neck Disability Index (NDI) Questionnaire (Vernon and Mior, 1996) will be used. Success for each individual patient will be defined as pain/disability improvement postoperatively according to the following definition:
Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt; 15</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck pain and Arm pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales adapted in part from Measuring Health (McDowell and Newell, 1996) will be used to evaluate neck pain and arm pain. The pain score is derived by adding the numerical rating scores from the pain intensity and duration scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological success</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on motor function, sensory function, and reflexes. Each of the categories is comprised of a number of elements. Postoperative evaluations of each element will be compared to the preoperative evaluations. Success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in each element for the time period evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product(s) under study. This definition includes events related to the procedures involved and/or worsening of pre-existing conditions.</description>

    <measure>Secondary surgery at index level</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Some AEs or treatment failures may lead to a secondary surgical intervention at an operated index level. All patients undergoing a secondary surgical intervention at any operated index level will be followed.</description>

    <description>The PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc is an artificial cervical disc comprising of two low-profile metal plates that interface through a ball and trough mechanism, permitting segmental spinal motion. The PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used at a single and two contiguous levels.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study:

          1. Has cervical degenerative disc disease at two (2) contiguous cervical levels (from C3
             to C7) requiring surgical treatment and involving intractable radiculopathy,
             myelopathy or both;

          2. Has a herniated disc and/or osteophyte formation at each level to be treated that is
             producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord compression. The condition is
             documented by patient history (e.g., neck and/or arm pain, functional deficit and /or
             neurological deficit), and the requirement for surgical treatment is evidenced by
             radiographic studies (e.g., CT, MRI, x-rays, etc.);

          3. Has been unresponsive to non-operative treatment for at least six weeks or has the
             presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord compression in the
             face of continued non-operative therapy;

          4. Has no previous surgical intervention at the involved levels or any other
             planned/staged surgical procedure at the involved levels;

          5. Has preoperative neck pain score ≥ 8 based on the preoperative Neck and Arm Pain
             Questionnaire;

             perioperative anti-inflammatory drugs;

         16. Has history of an endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g.,

             imperfecta);

         17. Has a condition that requires postoperative medications that interfere with the
             stability of the implant, such as steroids. (This does not include low-dose aspirin
             for prophylactic anticoagulation and routine perioperative anti-inflammatory drugs.);
