      Testing an mHealth mobile interventionist texting program on illness management.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective is to evaluate a validated mHealth intervention that can be
      realistically integrated into community mental health settings to increase the availability,
      reach, and broad impact of illness management approaches for people with serious mental
      illness (SMI).

    <measure>Psychiatric Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS). The PSYRATS inquires about the specific dimensions of hallucinations and delusions. There are 17 items and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (severe). The PSYRATS has 2 subscales: the auditory hallucinations subscale (AHS) consisting of 11 items, and the delusions subscale (DS) consisting of 6 items. These subscale scores are added to create a total score ranging from 0-68. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Psychiatric Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The Beck Depression Inventory is a psychometric test for measuring the severity of depression. There are 21 items, each rated from 0-3, and total scores range from 0-63. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS). This scale measures mental health recovery. There are 24 items, each rated from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree), and total scores range from 24-120. Higher scores indicate better recovery.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with satisfaction items established from previous SMI research. This measure consists of 5 items, each rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), and total scores range from 5-35. Higher scores indicate more satisfaction with treatment.</description>
