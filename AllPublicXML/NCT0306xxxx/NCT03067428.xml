  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging health problem as it can lead to end
      stage liver failure and cardiovascular complications. Diet play an important role in the
      development of NAFLD. Many studies have addressed the effects of added fructose on NAFLD. To
      date, little attention has been paid to the effects of a diet devoid of fructose. Therefore,
      the investigators aim to study the effects of fructose restriction on hepatic fat
      accumulation and vascular function using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Body mass index ≥ 28 kg/m2

          -  Fatty liver index ≥ 60

          -  Fructose intake ≥45 grams/day

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history of liver disease

          -  (History of) excessive alcohol consumption (defined as &gt; 2 units/day for women, and &gt;
             3 units/day for men)

          -  Major change in weight and/or physical activity prior to the study

          -  Use of glucose lowering drugs

          -  Recent illness

          -  Pregnancy and/or lactation

          -  Contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging

          -  Inability to give informed consent

        Protocol change (implemented on July 18, 2018): in order to increase the inclusion of study
        participants, subjects with an average daily fructose intake &lt; 45 gram/day will also be
        eligible for participation. In subjects who have an average daily fructose intake &lt; 45
        gram/day, supplementation of either fructose or glucose (see 'Arms and Interventions') will
        be increased to 45 gram/day.
