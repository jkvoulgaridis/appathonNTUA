  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3008348 is being developed as a treatment for IPF. A first-time-in-human study showed that
      single nebulized doses of 1âˆ’3000 micrograms (mcg) GSK3008348 in healthy volunteers were well
      tolerated, with pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures within the defined limits set in the protocol.
      The proposed study is a 2-cohort study of single doses, intended to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and PK of the drug in participants with IPF not currently treated with
      pirfenidone or nintedanib, and to obtain preliminary information on target engagement. Cohort
      1 will be a 2-period, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled group with at least 7 days
      washout between doses, and follow-up period of up to 7-14 days. Cohort 2 is optional. It will
      be designed to further explore safety and to provide additional information on the target
      engagement profile of GSK3008348. The total duration of the study will be up to 62 days.

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose) and 30 minutes post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the uptake of [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2 in the whole lung, assessed by VT derived from kinetic analysis of the dynamic PET data, was used to evaluate target engagement in the lung after single nebulized doses of GSK3008348.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, other situations judged by physician. Intent-to-Treat population consisted of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 3 sites in the United Kingdom from 13-June-2017 to 18-July-2018. At the interim analysis following review of Cohort 1 data it was agreed to stop the study without proceeding into optional Cohort 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 11 participants were screened, of which 3 were screening failures. Two screening failure participants did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and 1 participant withdrew consent. Hence, 8 participants were enrolled in this study.</pre_assignment_details>

In dosing period 2 only, they received up to 150 MBq of [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2, via IV infusion, prior to PET imaging at Baseline, 30 minutes and approximately 24 hours post-GSK3008348 dose. Total [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV administration was &lt;=100 mcg per participant. A wash out period of at least 7 and no more than 28 days was maintained between doses in Periods 1 and 2.</description>

        <description>The change in the uptake of [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2 in the whole lung, assessed by VT derived from kinetic analysis of the dynamic PET data, was used to evaluate target engagement in the lung after single nebulized doses of GSK3008348.

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, other situations judged by physician.

        <title>Period 2: Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters: Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Total Neutrophils, Platelet Count and WBC Count</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, total neutrophils, platelet count, platelet count and WBC count. Baseline was considered as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value for Baseline (Day -1). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Period 1: Number of Participants With Abnormal Urinalysis Results by Dipstick</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected at indicated time points to analyze urinalysis parameters including specific gravity, potential of hydrogen, glucose, protein, blood and ketones by dipstick. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as positive, Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline was considered as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value for Baseline (Day -1). Only categories with abnormal urinalysis values are presented.</description>

Total [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV administration was &lt;=100 mcg per participant. A wash out period of at least 7 and no more than 28 days was maintained between doses in Periods 1 and 2.</description>

          <title>Period 1: Number of Participants With Abnormal Findings for 12-lead Electrocardiograms (ECG) Parameters</title>
          <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG were obtained to measure ECG parameters. Abnormal findings were categorized as clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS). Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG were obtained to measure ECG parameters. Abnormal findings were categorized as CS and NCS. Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

            <description>Participants received a single dose of placebo (solution), inhaled via nebulization on Day 1 in dosing periods 1 and 2. In dosing period 2 only, they received up to 150 MBq of a [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2, via IV infusion, prior to PET imaging at Baseline, 30 minutes and approximately 24 hours post-GSK3008348 dose. Total [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2 administration was &lt;=100 mcg per participant. A wash out period of at least 7 and no more than 28 days was maintained between doses in Periods 1 and 2.</description>

        <description>FEV1 and FVC is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 and FVC was measured using standard spirometry equipment. Baseline was considered as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value for Baseline (Day -1). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>
