      The purpose of this study is to look at patient outcomes when docetaxel is started prior to
      ADT with degarelix.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at two drugs, docetaxel and degarelix, which are both FDA approved for
      the treatment of prostate cancer. Docetaxel is a standard chemotherapy treatment for
      metastatic prostate cancer. Degarelix is an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) agent that
      decreases the amount of testosterone in the body, which helps to fight tumor growth. Usually,
      docetaxel is given after ADT. This study will look at how your cancer changes when docetaxel
      is started before ADT. You are being asked to participate in this study because you have
      metastatic prostate cancer that can be treated with docetaxel and ADT.

    <measure>PSA response at 10 months</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA complete response is defined as PSA level less than or equal to 0.2 ng/ml for two consecutive measurements at least three weeks apart. Date of complete response will be defined as the date of first recorded value less than 0.2 ng/ml. PSA partial response is defined as a decline of PSA from trial baseline of &gt; 50% for two consecutive measurements at least three weeks apart. Date of partial response will be defined as the date of first recorded decline of &gt; 50% baseline. Date of partial response will be defined as the date of first recorded decline of &gt; 50% baseline. PSA progression will be defined as &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir (lowest PSA value recorded since trial enrollment) and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir. Two consecutive increases must be recorded at least three weeks apart. Date of PSA progression will be defined as the first recorded PSA value that is a &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of disease progression at 12 weeks using PSA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PSA progression will be defined as &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir (lowest PSA value recorded since trial enrollment) and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir. Two consecutive increases must be recorded at least two weeks apart. Date of PSA progression will be defined as the first recorded PSA value that is a &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir. PSA progression will not be established during the first 12 weeks of therapy (4 cycles of docetaxel) as defined by PCWG2 criteria. Thus subjects with no PSA decline from baseline during therapy will have date of PSA progression defined as first PSA value after 12 weeks that is a &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir.</description>

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients eligible for study participation CANNOT meet any of the following criteria:

          1. CNS metastases (brain or leptomeningeal).

          2. Osseous metastases felt in the opinion of the clinician to be high-risk for impending

             coronary intervention within 6 months of registration.

          4. Prior malignancy requiring systemic therapy within the last 5 years except for treated
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer. History of low-grade malignancies with limited
             potential to progress as determined by the primary investigator may be enrolled.

          5. Subjects must not have received any previous androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH
             agonist or LHRH antagonist) or cytotoxic therapy for prostate cancer in the metastatic
             setting.

             Exception Patients may have received no more than 30 days of anti-androgen (e.g.
             bicalutamide) in the metastatic setting prior to the start of study treatment.

          6. Subjects must not have had more than 36 months of hormonal therapy in combination with
             prostatectomy or radiation in the setting of localized disease and must not have shown
             any evidence of disease recurrence within 12 months after stopping hormonal therapy.
             Disease recurrence after hormonal therapy is defined as PSA &gt; 0.2ng/dl after
             prostatectomy + hormonal therapy or PSA that is 2.0ng/dl more than the PSA nadir after
             radiotherapy + hormonal therapy. Previous hormonal therapy to the prostate must have
             stopped at least 12 months prior to enrollment.

          7. Subjects must not have been treated with prior docetaxel in the setting of metastatic

             prostatectomy or radiation.) Subjects treated with this approach must not have shown
             any evidence of disease recurrence within 12 months after stopping docetaxel. Disease
             recurrence after docetaxel is defined as PSA &gt; 0.2ng/dl after prostatectomy +
             docetaxel or PSA that is 2.0ng/dl more than the PSA nadir after radiotherapy
             +docetaxel. Previous docetaxel in the setting of localized prostate cancer must have
             stopped at least 12 months prior to study enrollment.

             to study treatment.

          9. Presence of peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1.

         10. Known HIV-positive

         11. Presence of any severe or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition felt in the
             opinion of the investigator to increase the risk of serious toxicity from the study
             therapy.

         12. Prior hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study drugs.
