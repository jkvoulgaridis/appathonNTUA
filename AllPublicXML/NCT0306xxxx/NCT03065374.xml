      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent will be screened for eligibility.
      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to
      participate.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized up to 3 weeks post diagnosis of Clostridium-difficile
      Infection given SOC initiated already.

      Each subject will return to the study clinic for assessment and required study procedures on
      Day 7, Day 14, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 post randomization. Treatment duration will be 28
      days and follow up will last up to 12 weeks post randomization.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study was stopped due to slow recruitment. All subjects completed their participation including
    follow up period per protocol. No safety issues.
