    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b work in treating
      patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome that has come back
      (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon
      gamma-1b may boost the immune system activity. Giving pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b
      together may work better in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and Sezary
      syndrome.

      combination of interferon gamma-1b (ACTIMMUNE) and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) improves the ORR
      of pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma. (Treatment
      Group 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unexpected
      toxicity. Patients also receive interferon gamma-1b subcutaneously (SC) 3 times per week for
      12 weeks, and then follow 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off schedule for up to 2 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and interferon gamma-1b SC once
      a week. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for up to 1 year.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2

          -  Patients who have received an investigational agent or have used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug

          -  Has a history of a well-characterized and defined immune deficiency before the
             diagnosis of mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome or is receiving systemic steroid
             therapy greater than 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 4 weeks or any other
             form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days before the first dose of trial
             treatment

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks before study day 1 or who has not
             recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from AEs due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier

               -  Note: the following will not be exclusionary: patients may have any grade
                  alopecia or lymphopenia and still participate if other inclusion/exclusion
                  criteria are met; patients may have grade 1 or 2 neuropathy at baseline and still
                  participate if other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment;
             exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;
             patients with carcinomatous meningitis should also be excluded; patients with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without
             evidence of progression by imaging using the identical imaging modality for each
             assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan,
             for at least 4 weeks before the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days before trial treatment

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and interferon-gamma; patients who are
             hypersensitive to Escherichia (E). coli are also excluded

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or
             immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis, congestive
             heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade &gt;= 3, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is an
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab); these potential
             risks may also apply to Interferon-gamma; MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and Interferon-gamma
             may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475
             (pembrolizumab) or Interferon-gamma have transient adverse effects on the composition
             of sperm; patients are excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or
             expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial,
             starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial
             treatment

                  with other immunotherapies

          -  Active or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases as determined by computed
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation during screening and
