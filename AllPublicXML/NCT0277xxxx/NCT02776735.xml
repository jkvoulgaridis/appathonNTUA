      Primary Objective:

      To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sarilumab in patients aged 2-17 years with
      Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pcJIA) in order to identify the dose and
      regimen for adequate treatment of this population

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile, the efficacy and the long-term safety of
      sarilumab in patients with pcJIA.

      For approximately 72 patients enrolled in the dose-finding and second portions, the total
      study duration per patient will be 166 weeks that will consist of a 4- week screening, a
      12-week core treatment phase, a 144-week extension phase, and a 6-week post-treatment
      follow-up. For approximately 28 patients enrolled in the third portion, the total study
      duration per patient will be 106 weeks that will consist of a 4- week screening, a 12-week
      core treatment phase, a 84-week extension phase, and a 6-week post-treatment follow-up.
