      A one year, open-label, study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of risperidone implants
      as a maintenance treatment in patients with schizophrenia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is to evaluate the 48-week safety and tolerability of risperidone implants as
      maintenance therapy in subjects with schizophrenia. This will be measured by the incidence of
      psychotic symptoms exacerbation/impending relapse, PANSS, CGI-I, CGI-S, adverse events, vital
      signs, clinical laboratory, physical exam and ECG findings, Abnormal Involuntary Movement
      Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) and
      Investigator assessments.
