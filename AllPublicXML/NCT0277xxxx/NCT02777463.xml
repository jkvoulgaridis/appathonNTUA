       11. Three correlation between high ADC value/low ADC value/the ratio of
           posttreatment/pretreatment ADC value and decreasing rate of CA19-9 value.

       12. The correlation between tumor's limb sign in diffusion MRI and the rate of tumor cell
           destruction more than 10%.

    <description>Diffusion MRI Patients undergo MRI within 3 weeks before start of neoadjuvant therapy/ 5 weeks after the last dose. The setting of MRI scans for b-values is 0, 50, 1000 s/mm2. The same MRI (the MRI system/scanner Intera Achieva 3.0T from Philips Medical Systems) in the independent institution is used for all patients analyzed on this study. The region of interest is determined by consensus between two experienced MR radiologists in a largest diameter based on images of abdominal CT scans avoiding the vascular area on the image of ADC map. The mean ADC values for each tumor are automatically calculated on the image of ADC map using a tomographic software program.</description>

        The coefficient of correlation (Peason's r) was r=0.625 in our pilot study in patients with
        borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. To comfirm the producibility, it is judged as bad
        if the result is less than 10% from our previous study,the correlation coefficient
        threshold is 0.56 or more. At the setting of 90%confidential interval as 0.2, the number of
        case is estimated as 28. Considering unexpected situation, 30 cases is enough to analyze
        the correlation.
