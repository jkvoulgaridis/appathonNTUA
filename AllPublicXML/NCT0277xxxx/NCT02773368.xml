    <time_frame>After 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (SF)-36v2™ patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire was used to assess the subject's overall health related quality of life (HRQoL). PRO questionnaire (SF-36v2™) measured the HRQoL which contains 36 items covering 8 domains of physical and mental health status. The raw scale scores from the SF-36 were transformed to a 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better health status) which is further converted to norm-based scores using a T-score transformation in order to obtain a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 reference population . The total/overall (SF-36v2™) scores for physical and mental health from baseline to week 26 are presented here.</description>

The TRIM-D questionnaire consists of 5 sub-domains (treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance and psychological health), where each question is scored to a 1-5-point scale with a higher score indicating a better health state (less negative impact). Mean TRIM-D domain scores and the total scores are later transformed to a 0-100 scale for analysis. Summary scores from baseline and week 26 for total/overall scores are presented here.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 74 sites in 11 countries as follows: Argentina (3), Canada (5), Finland (6), Hungary (5), India (8), Russian Federation (7), Slovakia (5), Slovenia (4), Spain (6), Switzerland (5) and United States (20).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus on oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) therapy with stable daily dose of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin ± dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) ± pioglitazone according to locally approved label for at least 90 days prior to screening.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>IDegLira</title>
          <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

IGlar was supplied in a 3 mL pre-filled Solostar® pen at 100 U/mL solution. IGlar treatment was initiated with the starting dose of 10 U and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Evaluation After 26 Weeks: Eye Examination: Fundoscopy/Fundus Photography</title>
        <description>Reported results are fundus photography/fundoscopy (for both left and right eye) findings at screening and week 26 of randomised treatment. Since the values measured at the baseline (week 0) were not collected, the screening data (week -2, which is &lt;= 2 weeks before baseline) is presented here. The findings are categorised as: 1) Normal. 2) Abnormal (not clinically significant [NCS]). 3) Abnormal (clinically significant [CS]). 4) Missing.</description>

        <population>The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational product or comparator. Subjects in the safety set contributed to the evaluation “as treated”. Number analysed = Number of subjects contributed to the analysis at screening and week 26.</population>

            <title>IDegLira</title>
            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in pulse rate was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomised treatment.</description>
        <time_frame>After 26 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational product or comparator.

            <title>IDegLira</title>
            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) After 26 Weeks: Summary Scores of Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36v2)</title>
        <description>The Short Form (SF)-36v2™ patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire was used to assess the subject's overall health related quality of life (HRQoL). PRO questionnaire (SF-36v2™) measured the HRQoL which contains 36 items covering 8 domains of physical and mental health status. The raw scale scores from the SF-36 were transformed to a 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better health status) which is further converted to norm-based scores using a T-score transformation in order to obtain a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 reference population . The total/overall (SF-36v2™) scores for physical and mental health from baseline to week 26 are presented here.</description>

            <description>Subjects were administered with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira: 100 U/3.6 mg per mL) subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for a duration of 26 weeks. IDegLira was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled PDS290 pen-injector with a fixed IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 U/3.6 mg per mL solution. IDegLira treatment was initiated at 10 dose steps (containing 10 units IDeg /0.36 mg liraglutide) and adjusted twice weekly on fixed days. Dose adjustment was based on the mean of three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values that were measured on the days of the titration and two days prior to the titration (target SMPG: 4.0-5.0 mmol/L [72 - 90 mg/dL]). The maximum daily dose was 50 dose steps (50 U IDeg /1.8 mg Lira). Pre-trial OAD treatments were continued according to current local label. The randomised subjects would be on either SGLT2i monotherapy or SGLT2i ± metformin ± pioglitazone, this treatment was to be unchanged throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) After 26 Weeks: Summary Scores of Treatment Related Impact Measure for Diabetes (TRIM-D)</title>
        <description>The patient reported outcomes are calculated based on TRIM-D questionnaire. The TRIM-D questionnaire consists of 5 sub-domains (treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance and psychological health), where each question is scored to a 1-5-point scale with a higher score indicating a better health state (less negative impact). Mean TRIM-D domain scores and the total scores are later transformed to a 0-100 scale for analysis.
