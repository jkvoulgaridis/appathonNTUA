      Objectives:

      To investigate the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on patients with
      chronic nonspecific low back pain (NLBP).

      Methods and Materials:

      Twenty-nine patients with chronic NLBP were randomly divided into experimental and control
      groups. For 8 weeks, participants in the experimental group received omega-3 PUFA at 3000
      mg/day plus physical therapy, while those in the control group received placebo plus physical
      therapy. The visual analog pain scale, pressure algometer, Biering-Sorenson test,
      Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire (RMQ), and occupational burnout
      inventory (OBI) were used in assessments at baseline (T0) and after 4 (T1) and 8 weeks (T2).
      Serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
      were checked at baseline and T2.

      Low back pain is a common symptom in modern society. However, nearly 85% of those who seek
      medical care for low back pain have no specific history and no specific finding in image
      study, and therefore do not receive a specific diagnosis. This type of low back pain is
      termed &quot;nonspecific low back pain.&quot; Fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA can reduce
      the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. They are also the precursors of the E-resolvin and
      D-resolvin that suppress inflammatory cytokine production and act to resolve inflammation.
      Several previous studies showed that fish oil has the effect of anti-inflammation and pain
      reduction without side effect that affecting stomach and renal function. Therefore, fish oil
      is considered a new type of NSAID, and many studies are investigating its effect of
      anti-inflammation and pain reduction on different diseases. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of fish oil on patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.
