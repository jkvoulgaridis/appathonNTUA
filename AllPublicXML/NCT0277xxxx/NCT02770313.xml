      The goal of this study is to determine how effective repeated fasting over 26 weeks (6
      months) is at improving risk parameters that are surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular
      diseases, metabolic dysregulation and cognitive impairments.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to water-only fasting or to their ad libitum usual diet, with
      randomization performed within strata based on fasting history (≤180 hours or 181-720 hours
      of total fasting for &gt;12 consecutive hours per episode in the previous two years). Subjects
      will be assessed at 4, 13 and 26 weeks following randomization.

Shannon's diversity index will be used because it measures the uncertainty in finding a specific type of microbe from one that is randomly selected from a stool sample. The index ranges from 0 to infinity. A higher value indicates that more diversity in species exists in the stool sample. It is calculated as negative one multiplied by the sum across each species of the proportion of the whole that the species constitutes in the stool multiplied by the natural log of that proportion. The change score will be the value at week 26 minus the value at baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female, 21-70 years of age,

               -  who are not currently taking a statin medication,

               -  who have either pre-diabetes (clinical diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c ≥5.6%, or
                  untreated fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL within 6 months of screening) and are not
                  taking medications to control diabetes OR diagnosed, diet-controlled type 2
                  diabetes but do not require medications to control diabetes OR one or more of the
                  components of the metabolic syndrome measured within 6 months of screening (other
                  than fasting glucose level &gt;100 mg/dL, i.e.: 1. systolic blood pressure ≥130
                  mmHg, or diastolic ≥85 mmHg, or use of an antihypertensive medication, 2.
                  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dL for males or &lt;50 mg/dL for

             during the past two years (i.e., &gt;720 hours over two years), except for those who fast
             during multiple weeks once per year (e.g., Muslim, Baha'i) who will be allowed to

             fasting ends (e.g., Ramadan or the Baha'i fast) and ending at six months prior to the
             beginning of the next annual observance, as long as they do not fast routinely outside
             of the one annual period of fasting.

             transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular thromboembolism,
             chronic kidney disease stage III or higher, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             immunodeficiency, solid organ transplant, eating disorder, type I diabetes, dementia,

          5. Pre-diabetics or diabetics on diabetes medication.

          6. Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed
             products within 30 days prior to entry in the study.

             to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.
