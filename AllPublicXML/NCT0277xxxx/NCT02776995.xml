  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to investigate the correlation between tumor temperature difference and
      biological factors, such as size, metabolism, treatment response, and tumor aggressiveness.

      In addition, normal tissue response to adjuvant radiation therapy in treated organs following
      surgery, will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During radiation session, the investigators would evaluate the changes that will be detected
      by thermal imaging and correlate them with visible side effects as well as with known tumor
      biology factors and skin-tumor distance.
