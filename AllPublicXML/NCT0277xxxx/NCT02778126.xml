    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as
      Prexasertib (LY2606368) in participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to
      other parts of the body. This study will involve a single dose of ¹⁴C radiolabelled
      Prexasertib . This means that a radioactive substance, carbon 14, will be incorporated into
      the study drug. This will provide information about the study drug and its breakdown products
      and will help determine how much passes from the blood into urine, feces and expired air.
      After a minimum 14-day washout period following the [¹⁴C] Prexasertib dose, participants will
      be allowed to receive continued access to Prexasertib as outpatients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histological or cytological diagnosis of cancer (solid tumour), with clinical
             or radiologic evidence of locally advanced and/or metastatic disease, for which no
             life-prolonging therapy exists

          -  Have the presence of measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the
             Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours

          -  Have Body Surface Area (BSA) greater than or equal to (≥)1.62 meter squared (m²) and

             investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device

          -  Have serious pre-existing medical conditions (left to the discretion of the

          -  Have current haematologic malignancies or acute or chronic leukaemia

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection

          -  Have participated in a ¹⁴C (carbon) study within the last 6 months prior to screening
             for this study

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor
