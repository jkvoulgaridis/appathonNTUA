      Aim of the study:

      To define insulin requirement during pregnancy and to identify the rapid changes in insulin
      sensitivity around parturition and the first 6 months post partum. Such knowledge would be
      clinically useful and markedly improve insulin treatment before and after parturition for
      women with type 1 diabetes and serve to identify the best possible timing of testing women
      with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) for the development of type 2 diabetes post partum.

      Method:

      Botnia clamp in women before, immediately after delivery and 6 months post partum. The
      investigators will compare 20 women with GDM in late pregnancy, day 15 post partum and 6
      months post partum with 20 normal women investigated at the same time points. In addition the
      investigators will collect feces samples from the mother and baby in order to determine
      microbiota.

      Perspectives:

      Diabetes is a common condition with important implications for pregnancy outcome and
      long-term morbidity for mother and offspring. Accordingly, tailoring the best treatment is
      expected to have beneficial consequences both for the pregnant women and the future
      generation.
