  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive dimension of cognitive-emotional
      status of cancer patients on the chronic pain development 6 months after different cancer
      treatment protocol (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy
      ...).

      This is an observational, longitudinal and multicenter study assessing in cancer patients the
      link between the cognitive-emotional status and the development of chronic pain.

      Cognition, anxiety, depression, quality of life, social vulnerability, cancer perception,
      pain and analgesic consumption are assessed.

    <description>Quality of life assessment by:
- The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. This questionnaire assesses the quality of life of cancer patients. It is divided in 9 subscales consisting of several items: 5 subscales measuring functional status (physical, role, social, emotional, cognitive), three subscales measuring symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting) and a global subscale of quality of life and health. Finally, six items/isolated symptoms, covering cancer symptoms and frequent side effects of cancer therapies (e.g. loss of appetite) are also included in the EORTC QLQ-C30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 Score ranges from 0 to 126</description>
