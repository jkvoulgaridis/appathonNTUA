  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens
      that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe
      infectious complications. Infectious complications are the leading cause of treatment related
      mortality among AML patients, but there are little clinical data to inform whether management
      of neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting.
      Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management
      strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML and their caregivers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study, where the primary objective of this study
      is to compare patient and caregiver quality of life and other patient-centered outcomes for
      inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenia in children with AML or MDS receiving
      standard intensive AML frontline chemotherapy.

      Local study investigators (pediatric oncologists and study coordinators) at each of the
      fifteen participating pediatric institutions will communicate on a weekly basis with their
      inpatient leukemia service to identify AML or MDS patients potentially eligible for study
      enrollment. Once identified, study personnel will review each patient for study eligibility
      criteria. Three visits with the patient and their caregivers will occur: a screening visit,
      initial survey visit, and a follow-up visit.

      Screening Visit: The eligibility criteria for participation will be confirmed prior to
      approaching for consent. Eligible patients interested in the study will be approached for
      consent at any time from AML/MDS diagnosis through last day of chemotherapy in the treatment
      course under study. In some cases, the patient's caregivers may not be present in the
      hospital to provide consent. In these cases, study personnel will obtain verbal consent from
      the caregivers and child assent (if appropriate).

      Visit 1 will occur prior to the last day of chemotherapy administration in the course. This
      visit will include:

        -  2 Brief demographic surveys to capture covariates unavailable in the medical record

        -  Baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) surveys

        -  A baseline financial toxicity assessment

      Surveys will be administered via paper or a smart device and will last a total of 15-30
      minutes per respondent. In the case that the child is 5 years of age or older, the child
      self-report and parent proxy-report scales will be separately administered to the child and
      caregiver, respectively. If the child is under 5 years of age, only the parent-proxy version
      will be administered. Only the caregiver completes the baseline financial toxicity
      assessment. We will provide a $25 gift card to each child-parent dyad upon completion of the
      baseline surveys

      Visit 2 will occur within the period after absolute neutrophil count recovery and ideally
      prior to the start of the subsequent course of chemotherapy, but no later than the last day
      of chemotherapy in that next treatment course. This visit will include:

        -  Follow-up HRQOL surveys

        -  Patient-centered outcome survey developed previously from qualitative interviews of AML
           patients and their caregivers

        -  A follow-up financial toxicity assessment

      Surveys will be administered via paper or a smart device and will last a total of 15-30
      minutes per respondent. In the case that the child is 5 years of age or older, the child
      self-report and parent proxy-report scales will be administered to the child and caregiver,
      respectively. If the child is under 5 years of age, only the parent-proxy version will be
      administered. The follow-up financial toxicity assessment and the patient-centered outcome
      survey are completed by the caregiver only. We will provide a $25 gift card to each
      child-parent dyad upon completion of the follow-up surveys.

    <measure>Compare Differences in HRQOL Scores Between Outpatient Versus Inpatient Management</measure>
    <time_frame>PedsQL assessments were administered at two points - at the start of the study-contributed chemotherapy course prior to the patient becoming neutropenic (baseline) and again within the period between neutropenia resolution (follow-up); follow-up reported.</time_frame>
    <description>1 Course of Chemotherapy (Approximately 30-40 days). The primary outcome of interest was patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured using the acute PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales.31 These scales use a 7-day time frame. The multidimensional assessment includes items in four domains: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Respondents document responses to each question using a 5-point Likert scale anchored by never a problem (0) to almost always a problem (4). PedsQL™ items were reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 0 to 100 such that higher scores reflect better HRQOL.</description>

        course at any of the fifteen pediatric institutions across the US between June 1, 2016 and
        December 31, 2019. Patients discharged within 3 days after chemotherapy completion will be
        categorized as 'early discharge' to outpatient management during neutropenia. Patients
        remaining in the hospital more than 3 days after chemotherapy completion will be
        categorized as inpatient management.

          <title>Early Discharge Patients</title>
          <description>Patients receiving or having received chemotherapy for AML who are discharged to outpatient management within 3 days after chemotherapy completion. Subjects will complete a health related quality of life (HRQOL) survey at baseline and again at the start of the next treatment course. Survey questions will collect information such as patient race and educational level.
HRQOL questions will be scored on a 5-point Likert response scale (0=never a problem to 4=almost always a problem). The total score includes a 23 item multidimensional core (physical, emotional, social and school functioning); an 18 item multidimensional fatigue scale (general, sleep/rest and cognitive fatigue) and a 27 item multidimensional cancer module (pain, nausea, anxiety, communication, and cognitive problems). Total score is calculated with a lower score representing a higher health related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Compare Differences in HRQOL Scores Between Outpatient Versus Inpatient Management</title>
        <description>1 Course of Chemotherapy (Approximately 30-40 days). The primary outcome of interest was patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured using the acute PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales.31 These scales use a 7-day time frame. The multidimensional assessment includes items in four domains: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Respondents document responses to each question using a 5-point Likert scale anchored by never a problem (0) to almost always a problem (4). PedsQL™ items were reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 0 to 100 such that higher scores reflect better HRQOL.</description>
        <time_frame>PedsQL assessments were administered at two points - at the start of the study-contributed chemotherapy course prior to the patient becoming neutropenic (baseline) and again within the period between neutropenia resolution (follow-up); follow-up reported.</time_frame>
