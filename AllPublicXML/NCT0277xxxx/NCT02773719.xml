  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, healers are willing to look after, two out of three French citizens have
      already appealed to them at least once during their lives. Many healers in good faith are
      exercising their magnetism as a &quot;gift&quot; often inherited from elders. Now, they create interest
      of doctors who do not hesitate in some cases to ensure their cooperation, to implicitly
      recognize their mysterious talents. Some serious studies have examined these practices:
      Several studies have been conducted on the influence of biofield therapies in pain,
      depression and fatigue in cancer disease. The investigators propose a study of the effect of
      magnetism on the wart disease whose cure is objectively assessable.

      Sixty-two subjects in total would be included, comparing 2 proportions observed: the
      proportion of healing in the group treated with a &quot;real&quot; biofield therapist (recognized and
      affiliated to the National Group for Alternative Medicine in France) to the proportion of
      healing in the group treated with a &quot;fake&quot; biofield therapist (someone assessed as not having
      capacity to magnetize). The &quot;fake&quot; biofield therapist, placebo, has been trained to replicate
      gestures during a training validated by an independent recognized biofield therapist.

        Patients with common warts on hands or feet for over at least 3 months are eligible for the
        study. Patients fulfilling one or more of the following criteria will not be included: lack
        of informed consent prior to randomization, younger than 18 years or under judicial
        protection, treated with oral corticotherapy for more than 6 months, immunosuppressed or
        with history of transplant surgery, undergoing chemotherapy or suspected to have
        carcinomatous warts, or patients with infected warts, injured warts or already treated
        within 90 days with chemical processing, medical device, surgery or ever treated with
        biofield therapy.

        Subject will be excluded from the study if its warts was treated by other treatment during
        protocol.

          -  ulcerated wart

          -  cancerous wart
