    <textblock>
      Up to 180 patients with bone metastasis and requiring analgesic treatment will be followed
      during 4 to 10 weeks. All patients will continue to receive their cancer therapeutic
      treatments and be treated for pain relief exactly as they would normally be by the
      Investigator based on their needs. During their regular visits to the Investigator, patients
      will complete questionnaires and Clinical Pain Assessments.

    <measure>Patient's Change From Baseline of Pain Severity as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline up to after at least 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain severity score of BPI is an arithmetic average of the 4 severity scores reported on an 11- point NRS going from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine).
The BPI severity questions are:
3. Your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours? 4. Your pain at its least in the last 24 hours? 5. Your pain on the average? 6. How much pain you have right now?</description>

    <description>Pain scale of the Quality-of-Life Questionnaire in 30 questions (QLQ-C30); 2 items in the Pain scale ranging each from 1 to 4 (high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems); Pain score is sum of of the 2 items</description>

    <measure>Patient's Change From Baseline of Pain Interference as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline up to after at least 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain interference score of BPI is an arithmetic average of the 7 interference scores reported on an 11-point NRS going from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)
The BPI interference questions are:
9. Pain has interfered in the last 24 hours with
General Activity?
Mood?
Walking Abililty?
Work?
