  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how an investigational treatment (maribavir) is
      handled by the body when administered with two already approved drugs (digoxin and
      dextromethorphan). The study will also look at the safety and tolerability when maribavir is
      coadministered with digoxin and dextromethorphan versus digoxin and dextromethorphan alone.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product (IP) and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AE was considered to be study-related if there was any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE. An AE was considered a TEAE if it had a start date on or after the first dose of IP or if it had a start date before the date of the first dose of IP, but increased in intensity on or after the date of the first dose of IP. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence (related either to the test product or to the other IP or not) that at any dose resulted in death; was life-threatening; required or prolongation of hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital abnormality/birth defect; was an important medical event.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product (IP) and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AE was considered to be study-related if there was any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE. An AE was considered a TEAE if it had a start date on or after the first dose of IP or if it had a start date before the date of the first dose of IP, but increased in intensity on or after the date of the first dose of IP. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence (related either to the test product or to the other IP or not) that at any dose resulted in death; was life-threatening; required or prolongation of hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital abnormality/birth defect; was an important medical event.</description>
