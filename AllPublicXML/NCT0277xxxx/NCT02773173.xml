      The purpose of this study is to assess the post-operative recovery quality of the
      Individualized Pneumoperitoneum Pressure Therapy in Colorectal laparoscopic surgery versus
      standard therapy using a quality validated scale of postoperative recovery of their stay in
      the Post-Anaesthesia Recovery Unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last two decades laparoscopic surgery has settled as a less invasive surgical approach
      compared to open surgery. It is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and hospital
      stay. There is growing evidence that increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), even for short
      periods of time, is associated with increased perioperative morbidity (pain, increased
      inflammatory markers peritoneal injury worse splanchnic perfusion abnormalities hemodynamic
      and ventilatory ...).

      The study is a prospective multicenter randomized clinical intervention trial to assess the
      impact of IAP individualization strategy (IPP-Individualized pneumoperitoneum Pressure)
      relative to a IAP standard strategy (SPP-Standard pneumoperitoneum Pressure) using a
      validated scale (VAS) (PQRS- Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale). Postoperative pain in
      the first 24 hours (area under VAS curve , opioid rescue, referred pain to the shoulder) and
      surgical stress and inflammatory markers (neutrophil/lymphocyte, ratio,C-reactive protein,
      interleukin-6, procalcitonin) are also measured. Postoperative complications are evaluated by
      Clavier-Dindo classification.

    <description>The primary outcome of the IPPCollapse II study is the recovery of the Physiologic' component of the PQRS score over the assessed time points. The PQRS is a validated multidimensional patient Reported Outcome (PRO) tool designed to assess patients' recovery to baseline status in the postoperative period (www.postopqrs.com). In every patient a baseline measurement of PQRS is performed prior to surgery. After surgery, the measurement of the PQRS is repeated at 15 min (T15) and at 40 min (T40) after arrival in the PACU, as well as in the ward on the morning of postoperative day ( POD) one and three. Physiologic domain includes 9 variables scored from 1-3, 9 is the minimum and worse recover and 27 is the maximum and full recover. But recovery is related to baseline. Each patient is scored at the predefined time points and is classified as either 'recovered' if the score reaches at least the predetermined baseline score or 'not recovered' .</description>

    <description>The PQRS domains, 'nociceptive', 'emotional', 'cognitive', and 'functional' components, as well as the 'overall score' are used as secondary outcomes. In every patient a baseline measurement of PQRS is performed prior to surgery. After surgery, the measurement of the PQRS is repeated at 15 min (T15) and at 40 min (T40) after arrival in the PACU, as well as in the ward on the morning of postoperative day ( POD) one and three. Nociceptive and emotional domains are scored from 1-5 ( from worse to better) and include 4 variables. Functional domain is scored from 1-3 ( From worse to better) and include 4 variables, and cognitive is depicted as recover or not versus baseline score.</description>

    <description>Deep neuromuscular blockade can only be reversed with sugammadex, so in the IPP group, it will be used as neuromuscular blocking agent and its effect will be reversed with sugammadex (4mg / kg) at the end of the surgery. During surgery: deep neuromuscular blockade (PTC 1-5), Protective ventilation strategy, Optimal position and Pre stretching as a tool to decrease intraabdominal pressure maintaining optimal workspace.</description>
