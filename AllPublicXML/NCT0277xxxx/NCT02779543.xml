  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to validate three new commercial sleep monitoring devices: Fitbit, Jawbone
      UP, and Microsoft Band by comparison against concurrent polysomnography (PSG), which is
      considered the gold standard for sleep assessment. This research is being done because if
      proven to accurately analyze sleep,these devices may make conducting in-home sleep studies
      easier and more affordable in the future.

      This study seeks to validate three new commercial sleep monitoring devices: Fitbit, Jawbone
      UP, and Microsoft Band by comparison against concurrent polysomnography (PSG), considered the
      gold standard assessment for sleep physiology. The investigators emphasize here that the
      commercial sleep monitoring devices (Fitbit, Jawbone UP, and Microsoft Band) are used in
      addition to PSG and not in place of it. Subjects will be recruited from those patients
      attending a regularly scheduled overnight PSG sleep study at the Weill Cornell Medical
      College Center for Sleep Medicine. Willing subjects, after providing informed consent, will
      be fitted with one of the three aforementioned sleep monitoring devices (randomly assigned)
      on the wrist of their non-dominant hand when prepared for the sleep study by a technician.
      Subjects willing to wear more than one sleep monitoring device may be fitted with two
      different sleep monitoring devices, e.g., a Fitbit and a Jawbone UP or a Fitbit and a
      Microsoft Band. Sleep monitoring device(s) will be removed from the subject's wrist in the
      morning at the conclusion of the sleep study. Data will be transferred from the sleep
      monitoring device(s) for later statistical analysis and comparison with scored polysomnogram.
      Device(s) will be cleaned (using antiseptic wipes), reset,recharged, and otherwise prepared
      for reuse.
