    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot study will be to develop a clinically meaningful,
      patient-centric, and pragmatic protocol to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of
      different strategies for achievement of the ideal balance between analgesia and functional
      mobility following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain management for total knee replacement (TKR) patients has evolved rapidly over the
      previous decade. The most recent advances in anesthesia include peripheral nerve blockade,
      which offers the promise of earlier postoperative mobilization in addition to effective pain
      relief. The rapidity with which these advancements have been adopted seems to have outpaced
      the science to support them. The result has been the institution of countless combinations of
      perioperative pain management strategies in centers nationwide with little standardization,
      consistency, or objective evidence. The extent to which these various strategies achieve safe
      and effective perioperative pain control or functional preservation remains poorly defined.
      This prospective randomized control trial will aim to identify meaningful patient-centric
      outcome measures, differentiate from among three perioperative TKR anesthetic and analgesic
      strategies, and provide a template for interdisciplinary collaboration among orthopedic
      surgeons, anesthesiologists, physical therapists, and patients. With the knowledge gained
      further study will continue to refine the most optimal early pain control protocol.

      All primary TKR patients undergoing surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina who
      are able to receive spinal anesthesia will be randomized prior to surgery to one of three
      forms of lower limb nerve blockade: 1) Continuous femoral nerve catheter plus single
      injection sciatic nerve block, 2) Adductor canal catheter plus selective tibial nerve block,
      3) Adductor canal catheter alone. All patients will receive additional standardized pain
      medications as well as early mobilization with physical therapy. The primary outcome measure
      will be postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS), with secondary measures to include
      validated patient-reported outcome measures, objective functional measures (timed-up-and-go
      (TUG), patient satisfaction scores, length of stay, discharge disposition, and complications.
      The investigators plan to enroll approximately 90 patients. This will allow us to reach our
      randomization goal of at least 75 patients while taking into account withdrawals. The 75
      patients will be randomized into the three treatment three treatment arms over a 6-month
      recruitment period, with a 3 month follow-up for patient reported outcome and satisfaction
      data. A focus group will facilitate patient engagement and provide information for generation
      of a preference survey to guide future study design.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) score area under the curve (AUC) for 48 hours, recorded every six hours. Score Scale is 0 (no pain)- 10(most pain). A higher score corresponds to a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Functional Outcome Measures- Exstension/Knee Buckling</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 days after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Functional outcome measures will be administered by members of the physical and occupational therapy team, who typically evaluate and treat patients once on the day of surgery and twice daily each day thereafter. They will document the patient's ability to perform independent terminal knee extension and grade knee buckling with ambulation on a scale of 0-2 during each encounter. A grade of 0 indicates no knee buckling, 1 indicates slight buckling, and a grade of 2 represents knee buckling significant enough in the opinion of the physical therapist to require a knee immobilizer while ambulating. I higher score corresponds to a worse outcome. The numbers below in the outcome measure table are the number of patients who achieved terminal knee extension for had ANY knee buckling respectively.</description>

    <measure>Functional Outcome Measures- AMPAC (Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care)</measure>
    <time_frame>Morning of post-op day 1 - 2 days after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Functional outcome measures will be administered by members of the physical and occupational therapy team, who typically evaluate and treat patients once on the day of surgery and twice daily each day thereafter. On the morning of postoperative day #1, the therapist will calculate the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score. The Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) measures function in three domains: basic mobility, daily activities,and applied cognitive function. AM-PAC scores in each functional domain have a mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 10 and scores are distributed along a continuum of function. The AM-PAC tracks outcomes as a participant progresses across an episode of care with higher scores indicating an improved level of functioning.</description>

    <description>Short Form Health Survey (SF-12): 12 item abbreviated form of SF-36 survey that provides information about how participants feel, and how well they have been able to perform their usual activities. Transformed physical component summary score (PCS) and transformed mental component summary score (MCS) are derived using the sum of all 12 items and scored onto a 0-100 scale such that a higher score indicates a better health state and better functioning.
Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS): evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health. The minimum possible score is 20 and the max is 100.
Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-Specifically Pain and Symptom Score: A Likert scale is used. All items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=extreme; 100= none).</description>

        <description>Functional outcome measures will be administered by members of the physical and occupational therapy team, who typically evaluate and treat patients once on the day of surgery and twice daily each day thereafter. They will document the patient's ability to perform independent terminal knee extension and grade knee buckling with ambulation on a scale of 0-2 during each encounter. A grade of 0 indicates no knee buckling, 1 indicates slight buckling, and a grade of 2 represents knee buckling significant enough in the opinion of the physical therapist to require a knee immobilizer while ambulating. I higher score corresponds to a worse outcome. The numbers below in the outcome measure table are the number of patients who achieved terminal knee extension for had ANY knee buckling respectively.</description>

        <title>Functional Outcome Measures- AMPAC (Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care)</title>
        <description>Functional outcome measures will be administered by members of the physical and occupational therapy team, who typically evaluate and treat patients once on the day of surgery and twice daily each day thereafter. On the morning of postoperative day #1, the therapist will calculate the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score. The Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) measures function in three domains: basic mobility, daily activities,and applied cognitive function. AM-PAC scores in each functional domain have a mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 10 and scores are distributed along a continuum of function. The AM-PAC tracks outcomes as a participant progresses across an episode of care with higher scores indicating an improved level of functioning.</description>

          <description>Femoral nerve catheter and sciatic nerve block
Femoral nerve catheter and sciatic nerve block: This nerve block is believed to cause both muscle weakness and numbness. A catheter remains in place for up to 36 hours after surgery for the purpose of adding additional medication should the patient require it. This technique causes both the front and the back of the knee to be numb.</description>

Adductor canal catheter and selective tibial block: This nerve block is believed to cause numbness only, without any muscle weakness. A catheter remains in place for up to 36 hours after surgery for the purpose of adding additional medication should the patient require it to control pain. This technique causes both the front and the back of the knee to be numb.</description>
