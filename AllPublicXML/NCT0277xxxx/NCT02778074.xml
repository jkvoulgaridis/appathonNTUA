  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and aims Tailored internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (I-CBT) is a new
      innovative and person-centred method that is promising that may be used to decrease
      depression in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with CVD, depressive
      symptoms is a common co-morbidity leading to decreased wellbeing, and increased morbidity and
      mortality. Depressive symptoms are both underdiagnosed and undertreated in CVD patients.
      Earlier studies have demonstrated the efficiency of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for
      many psychiatric conditions, but few studies have evaluated CBT in patients with CVD.

      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the tailored I-CBT program on
      reducing depressive symptoms and other patient reported outcomes in patients with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to explore factors related to implementation of the I-CBT
      program in clinical cardiac care.

      The primary aim:

      -To evaluate the effects of the tailored I-CBT depression program on depressive symptoms.

      Secondary aims:

        -  To evaluate effects on quality of life´, sleep and anxiety

        -  To evaluate factors that can influence the I-CBT programs effect on depressive symptoms.

        -  To gain knowledge about the I-CBT program, as perceived by patients and health care
           professionals.

        -  To explore facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the I-CBT program in
           clinical practice from the perspectives of patients, health care professionals and
           policymakers.

    <description>The PHQ-9 is a nine-item instrument for measurement of depressive symptoms during the last two weeks. Each item is answered on a four graded scale where zero represents that the item do not affect the person and numbers one to three represents that the item affects the person several days to almost every day. The answers are summed to a total sum score, range 0-27, with higher numbers representing higher level of depressive symptoms. A cut off &gt;5 represents minor depression and a cut off &gt;10 represents major depression</description>
