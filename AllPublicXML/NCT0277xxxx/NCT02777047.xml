  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulants (OACs - warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) are the
      very top cause of serious drug-related harm. More than 7 million prescriptions are dispensed
      annually for oral anticoagulants (OAC) in Canada, with more than 340,000 elderly recipients
      in the Ontario Drug Benefit Program alone. Because of their very high and chronic
      utilization, their large benefit in lowering important clinical events (stroke, clots, death)
      and their high potential for major harm (primarily bleeds, which can be fatal), OACs are the
      highest priority for improving medication safe and effective use. The early period after
      hospital discharge is clearly high risk, with three times the usual rate of major bleeds
      compared with later.

      Patients and families frequently note confusion about their medications after leaving the
      hospital due to errors or lack of detailed communication to their health care team at the
      time of discharge. The confusion, errors, and lack of communication are highly associated
      with lack of adherence to medications and resulting worse health outcomes. The combination of
      waste of medication and bad outcomes that result from medication errors, are estimated to
      cost our health care system several billion dollars annually. Since our leading economists
      are declaring health care to be unsustainable in its current delivery forms, it is time to
      find and evaluate more cost-effective ways to improve anticoagulation safety. The
      investigators will do this by structuring discharge medication assessment, with more expert
      management, formal written and verbal handovers to the patients, their family and their
      hospital and community doctors, pharmacists and home care; follow-up by virtual visits after
      discharge, and coordinate advice and communication to extend access to and reduce the cost of
      expert guidance. The investigators expect that this intervention will decrease
      anticoagulant-related adverse events and improve ratings of the coordination of care. If this
      occurs, the investigators will develop a business plan for regions, provinces and territories
      to scale up the intervention to a national level.

      Design: Randomized controlled pilot trial, two parallel groups, blinded outcome assessment.

      Participants: Patients discharged from any of the six Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo, Brantford
      or St. Catharines acute care hospitals with a discharge prescription for an oral
      anticoagulant intended to be taken for at least 4 weeks will be eligible for recruitment.
      Patients will be excluded if they are less than 18 years of age, expected lifespan is less
      than 3 months, are discharged to long-term care or institution, do not speak English, or if
      they are to be followed post-discharge by the Thromboembolism service.

      Intervention: Intervention patients will receive:

        1. Expert, detailed discharge medication management, a process mandated by Accreditation
           Canada but with incomplete and variable uptake, which reviews hospital-administered
           medications compared to pre-admission medications in light of old and new diagnoses,
           personal characteristics and risk factors, previous medications and revises to optimize
           benefit and minimize harm. The medication management will also focus on anticoagulant
           choice, dosage, indication, duration, potential drug interactions, patient risk factors
           for thromboembolism versus bleeding, access to medications, adherence challenges and
           health literacy.

        2. Hand-overs to the patient's care team including the patient, their main caregiver,
           hospital MRP team, family physician, community specialist(s), community pharmacist, and
           home care, using an Oral Anticoagulant Monitoring Checklist. These are based on: a) Best
           evidence (international guidelines led by experts including the applicants, Thrombosis
           Canada guidelines, and decision aids for patients and their family to assist in
           anticoagulant knowledge, decisional conflict, adherence), b) Best practices regarding
           discharge medication management, coordination of care with clear accountability,
           follow-up virtual visits with teletriage where situations require medical intervention,
           with expert Thrombosis and Clinical Pharmacology specialist physician back-up, c)
           Virtual visit phone calls placed by the research pharmacist post-discharge within 24
           hours (ensure OAC Rx obtained and understood, OAC Monitoring Checklist, solicit
           concerns), 1 week and 1 month (ensure OAC compliance, OAC Monitoring Checklist, solicit
           concerns). After each call, OAC Monitoring Checklist results sent to all caregivers and
           any clinical events or serious concerns will be directed to MRP or designate via phone
           call. Expert Thrombosis and Clinical Pharmacology specialists will be available as
           needed.
