    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of an aid in
      assessment of concussion based on eye-tracking, in comparison to a clinical reference
      standard appropriate for the Emergency Department (ED) or concussion clinic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent.

          -  Be between the ages of 4 and 67 years old.

          -  Have a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury with a potential for concussion.

          -  Subjects must have baseline vision correctable to within 20/500 bilaterally.

          -  Subjects must have intact ocular motility.

          -  Subjects must have ability to provide a complete ophthalmologic, medical and
             neurologic history as well as medications/drugs/alcohol consumed within the 24 hours
             prior.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ER visit has been more than 2 weeks since the injury which may have caused the
             concussion.

          -  Have received penetrating trauma or have a head CT demonstrating evidence of acute
             brain injury (subdural, epidural or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, edema/mass effect per
             attending radiologist read).

          -  Suffering burns, anoxic injury or multiple/extensive injuries resulting in any
             medical, surgical or hemodynamic instability.

          -  Blind (no light perception), are missing eyes, do not open eyes.

          -  It is pertinent that subjects be able to detect light and have both eyes in order for
             the eye tracking data to be effective and significant.

          -  Previous history of: ocular motility dysfunction or extensive prior eye surgery.

          -  Any physical or mental injury or baseline disability rendering task completion
             difficult.

          -  Obvious intoxication or blood alcohol level greater than 0.2.
