      The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical study was to compare implant survival,
      patient satisfaction, and radiographic, clinical, and aesthetic outcomes following immediate
      loading (IL) and delayed loading (DL) of single dental implants after 1,3 and 5 years of
      follow-up.

      Purpose: The objective of the present prospective randomized clinical study was to compare
      the overall treatment outcome following immediate loading (IL) and delayed loading (DL) of
      single implants after 5 year of follow-up.

      Patients with a missing maxillary tooth (15-25) were randomly assigned to IL or DL. The
      protocol included implant installation in healed sites, immediate loading, delayed loading,
      temporary screw-retained restoration, and replacement with a permanent single implant crown.
      Outcome measures were implant survival, marginal bone level, soft tissue changes, papillae
      index, pink, and white esthetic score (PES and WES), patient judged aesthetics, and oral
      health impact profile (OHiP-14).

    <description>The Pink esthetic score (PES) measures the aesthetic appearance of mucosa tissue at the implant site.
Intraoral photographs from the aesthetic baseline and follow-up appointments are used to register the pink esthetic score, an objective aesthetic scale were the shape,size,colour and structure of the soft tissue is rated.
The scale consists of 7 variables that are scored 0,1 or 2, the 7 variables scores are combined.
Scale range 0-14, 0 minimum and 14 maximum. A higher score represent a better aesthetic outcome.</description>

    <description>The Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14) measure oral health related quality of life.
The oral health-related quality of life is calculated using the Swedish validated version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The questionnaires are completed at the beginning of the treatment and 12 months after the definitive crown placement.
The scale consists of 14 variables that are scored 1,2,3,4 or 5, the 14 variables scores are combined.
Scale range 14-70, 14 minimum and 70 maximum. A low score represent a better oral health related quality of life.</description>

The scale consists of 5 variables that are scored 0,1 or 2, the 5 variables scores are combined.
Scale range 0-10, 0 minimum and 10 maximum. A higher score represent a better aesthetic outcome.</description>

        <description>The Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14) measure oral health related quality of life.
The oral health-related quality of life is calculated using the Swedish validated version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The questionnaires are completed at the beginning of the treatment and 12 months after the definitive crown placement.
The scale consists of 14 variables that are scored 1,2,3,4 or 5, the 14 variables scores are combined.
Scale range 14-70, 14 minimum and 70 maximum. A low score represent a better oral health related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Pink Esthetic Score</title>
        <description>The Pink esthetic score (PES) measures the aesthetic appearance of mucosa tissue at the implant site.
Intraoral photographs from the aesthetic baseline and follow-up appointments are used to register the pink esthetic score, an objective aesthetic scale were the shape,size,colour and structure of the soft tissue is rated.
The scale consists of 7 variables that are scored 0,1 or 2, the 7 variables scores are combined.
Scale range 0-14, 0 minimum and 14 maximum. A higher score represent a better aesthetic outcome.</description>

        <population>In the delayed group 1 implant was lost prior to evaluation and therefore not possible to include in this evaluation. Reported as a serious event.
1 patient was lost to follow-up in the immediate loading group and 1 in the delayed loading group.</population>
