  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, safety, and pharmacokinetic study of MB-102 versus iohexol and the use
      of the non-invasive optical renal function monitor (ORFM) device in normal and compromised
      renal function participants with different skin color types.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is the first to assess pharmacokinetics and function of the ORFM device
      in participants with impaired kidney function. In addition, it will evaluate the impact of
      different skin color types on readouts by the ORFM prototype devices QuantumLeap, Radiance,
      and Brilliance. These data will be used to further refine the algorithms used in the ORFM
      device for the pivotal trial and commercial development. Safety and tolerance of MB-102 will
      also be assessed in a larger population of subjects.
