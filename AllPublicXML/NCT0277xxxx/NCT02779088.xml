      The aims of this study are to establish the cohort of elder population based on parameters of
      health-related fitness, body compositions, blood biochemistry, blood biomarker, balance,
      quality of life, and musculoskeletal ultrasonography; and to evaluate the association between
      fitness parameters and disease incidence with those data.

      The aims of this study are to establish the cohort of elder population based on parameters of
      health-related fitness, body compositions, blood biochemistry, blood biomarker, balance,
      quality of life, and musculoskeletal ultrasonography and to evaluate the association between
      fitness parameters and disease incidence with these data. We expect to recruit 1200 adults
      who attend the annual health check-up in National Taiwan University, BeiHu Branch in 2016 and
      2017 and to train 60 individuals having sarcopenia with strengthening exercise. This study
      will establish the urban elderly cohort, measure both physical and functional parameters,
      find the risk factors for aging, and validate the role of strength training for those
      sarcopenia patients. We hope this study will be widely cited in related fields in the future.

    <description>Enrolled participants with sarcopenia will be randomized to receive either strengthening exercise and nutrition or education courses (DVD and handbook) first and then will receive the opposite intervention subsequently. The study will consist of two periods of 12 weeks separated by a washout period of 2 weeks. It's the AB/BA study. Subjects in the AB arm receive exercise and nutrition intervention first, followed by the education course.</description>
