  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This expanded access protocol is for infants or children with conditions preventing them from
      taking in enough nutrients from food and must receive nutrition intravenously. Standard
      intravenous nutrition contains fat emulsion made from soybean. If this fat emulsion is given
      over a long period of time, it can cause problems within the liver and if persistent and not
      addressed can even lead to severe and/or permanent injury to the liver.

      It is believed that a type of fish oil blend, called Omegaven®, may be used in place of the
      soybean fat blend. The Omegaven® fish oil blend may greatly reduce the risk of liver injury.

      Omegaven® is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is only offered under
      an &quot;expanded access&quot; protocol as an alternative to the soybean fat blend.
