  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is a commonly used anesthetic medication which is used for induction of anesthesia
      as well as as an analgesic. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties which may
      decrease post-operative complications following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
      that are thought to associated with inflammation. Some studies have shown that ketamine does
      decrease these complications when compared with anesthetics that are not commonly used in our
      cardiac anesthesiology practice. Propofol is another commonly used anesthetic medication
      which is used for induction of anesthesia. Ketamine has not been compared with propofol for
      potential to reduce post-operative complications associated with the inflammatory process.
      This study aims to see if ketamine will reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction,
      delirium, and renal dysfunction in comparison with propofol. In addition, the hemodynamic
      impact of ketamine compared propofol will be investigated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  age greater than or equal to 75 years presenting for cardiac surgery at the Mayo
             Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota;

          -  schedule to undergo complex cardiac surgery. Complex cardiac surgery will be defined
             as surgery involving more than one heart valve, redo-sternotomy procedures, or
             combined valvular and CABG procedures.

        Exclusion criteria will include:

          -  left or right ventricular assist device implantation or explantation,

          -  procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass,

          -  active infection or sepsis, severe hepatic disease or ascites,

          -  pre-operative renal dysfunction including a baseline creatinine equal to or greater
             than 1.5 mg/dL or requiring dialysis,

          -  immunosuppressive medication use (including steroid use),

          -  immunodeficiency syndrome,

          -  known neurologic or psychiatric disorder, or

          -  use of drugs for psychosis.
