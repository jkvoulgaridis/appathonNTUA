    <textblock>
      With this study researchers will evaluate the effects of the GLB intervention on weight loss,
      chronic disease indicators and self-perceived function and well-being in an active duty
      population. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the GLB program
      [compared with two currently available programs, the Fitness Improvement Program (FIP) and
      the Better Body Better Life (BBBL) program], on the following health indicators: improvement
      of individual physical fitness as measured by change in abdominal circumference, weight and
      physical activity; decrease in risk associated with chronic disease as measured by changes in
      lipid and HbA1c levels; and improvement in self-perceived function and well-being as measured
      by the RAND 36 Item Short Form Health Survey (RAND SF- 36). In addition, the researchers seek
      to obtain feedback about the programs from the participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many active duty personnel struggle with weight gain and becoming overweight during the
      course of their active duty service. This can lead to difficulty in maintaining fitness
      standards and limit their ability to fully function in performing their mission. In addition,
      this may lead to increased risk for chronic disease development. Few published studies exist
      that evaluate interventions aimed at weight loss and chronic disease prevention in the active
      duty population. The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program has been shown to be effective in
      facilitating weight loss and reducing chronic disease risk in civilian populations. However,
      the effectiveness of this class in preventing chronic illnesses, facilitating weight loss,
      increasing physical activity and promoting perceptions of improved functioning and well-being
      has not been studied in active duty populations. The purpose of this study will be to examine
      the effectiveness of the GLB program compared with the currently available Fitness
      Improvement Program (FIP) and Better Body Better Life (BBBL) on the following health
      indicators: individual physical fitness as measured by change in weight, abdominal
      circumference and minutes engaged in physical activity; changes in risk associated with
      chronic disease as measured by changes in lipid and HbA1c levels; and changes in
      self-perception of function and well-being as measured by the RAND SF-36 questionnaire.

      This will be a quantitative randomized control intervention study to determine the effects of
      a GLB class on physical indicators of fitness, disease risk and overall perception of
      functional health and well-being in an active duty population, and to compare outcomes with
      the FIP intervention (care as usual) and newly implemented BBBL intervention currently
      offered to Airmen. This study will be conducted at David Grant Medical Center (DGMC), Travis
      AFB, California.

    <description>The content of the GLB program consists of educating participants about the association between high calorie and fat intake with excessive weight, how to determine the fat and calorie content of foods they eat, and how to make changes in their diet to reduce the fat and calorie content. Participants are also given information about increasing activity in their daily routines. In addition, they are given information about negative behaviors that lead to overeating and decreased activity and are taught ways to develop positive behaviors to facilitate weight loss and increased activity. GLB instructors function as lifestyle coaches for class participants. They provide individual feedback and encouragement on documented eating and activity habits. The instructors make themselves available to be contacted by participants outside of class to address participant concerns and issues as needed</description>

    <description>The FIP is a standardized course that can be accessed on-line through the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) and takes approximately 90 minutes to view all of the course material. The on-line FIP can be done all in one sitting or in segments. There is no restriction on the frequency with which the FIP is viewed however, because it is accessed through ADLS, it may be difficult to view at a non-military computer. The FIP consists of an introduction, three core components (nutrition, physical training, and spiritual well-being), and a summary. Each section has a short video presentation. The core components have short quizzes at the end to assess knowledge and the training asks participants to set goals. Participants are then responsible for using the information for their own self-directed program.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment began August 2015 and ended April 2018. Participants were recruited through flyers table tents in the Medical Group clinics and cafeteria and email blasts through unit fitness monitors.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Once participants were enrolled to the study, initial measurements (with the exception of lab work requiring blood draws) were taken before assignment to groups. The reason for this was to avoid bias on the part of the research team that might occur with knowledge of group assignment before obtaining initial data.</pre_assignment_details>

Group Lifestyle Balance: Content consists of educating participants about the association between high calorie and fat intake with excessive weight, how to determine the fat and calorie content of foods they eat, and how to make changes in their diet to reduce the fat and calorie content. Participants are also given information about increasing activity in their daily routines. In addition, they are given information about negative behaviors that lead to overeating and decreased activity and are taught ways to develop positive behaviors to facilitate weight loss and increased activity. GLB instructors function as lifestyle coaches for class participants. They provide individual feedback and encouragement on documented eating and activity habits. The instructors make themselves available to be contacted by participants outside of class to address participant concerns</description>

Fitness Improvement Program: The FIP is a standardized course that can be accessed on-line through the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) and takes approximately 90 minutes to view all of the course material. The on-line FIP can be done all in one sitting or in segments. There is no restriction on the frequency with which the FIP is viewed however, because it is accessed through ADLS, it may be difficult to view at a non-military computer. The FIP consists of an introduction, three core components (nutrition, physical training, and spiritual well-being), and a summary. Each section has a short video presentation. The core components have short quizzes at the end to assess knowledge and the training asks participants to set goals. Participants are then responsible for using the information for their own self-directed program.</description>
