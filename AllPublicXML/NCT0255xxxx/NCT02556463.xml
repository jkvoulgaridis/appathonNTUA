    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the TLR 7/8 agonist MEDI9197 delivered by
      IT injection to subjects with solid tumors and in combination with durvalumab in subjects
      with solid tumors. The study has a dose escalation design using mTPI-2 to evaluate a range of
      doses.
