  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to
      and within the lungs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a focal adhesion-associated protein
      kinase involved in cellular adhesion and spreading processes which leads to stiffening and
      thickening of blood vessels in lungs. This further increases the blood pressure within the
      lungs and impairs their blood flow. This study aims to demonstrate biodistribution of FAK
      inhibitor, GSK2256098, in cardiopulmonary sites i.e. heart and lung tissues. The uptake of
      11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within the lung and / or heart of healthy subjects and
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) patients will be assessed using Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET). Based on study results the decision as to whether a follow-on
      phase 2 trial should be initiated to investigate the therapeutic utility of GSK2256098 in
      iPAH will be decided. Sufficient number of subjects will be screened (up to 30 days prior to
      scan) to enrol 12 healthy subjects and 12 PAH patients in the study. Enrolled subjects will
      receive a microdose of [11C]-GSK2256098 on a scanning day which will be followed by the
      follow-up visit (2-4 weeks post-last dose).

      <recruitment_details>Healthy volunteers and participants with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) were included in this study to evaluate the bio-distribution of [11C]- GSK2256098 in the lungs and heart using Positron Emission Tomography (PET).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 14 participants were screened, of which 4 participants were screen failures. Remaining 10 participants were included in the study.</pre_assignment_details>
