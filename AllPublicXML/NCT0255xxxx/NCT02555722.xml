  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a masked, multi-center, daily wear, monthly replacement, bilateral, randomized,
      lens blocked (subjects remain in the same lens brand throughout the study) concurrent control
      study enrolling up to 90 subjects with a study duration of approximately three months.
      Subjects will be randomized into the study contact lenses in a two to one (2:1) ratio of
      fanfilcon A lens (test) to enfilcon A lens (control).

      Subjects will be randomized into the study contact lenses in a two to one (2:1) ratio of
      fanfilcon A lens (test) to enfilcon A lens (control). This should result in a study
      population of approximately 60 test subjects and 30 control subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be at least 18 years of age as of the date of evaluation for the study.

               -  Read the Informed Consent

               -  Been given an explanation of the Informed Consent

             to keep all specified appointments.

          -  Be an adapted, current full-time silicone hydrogel or soft contact lens wearer. An
             adapted full-time wearer is defined as wearing contact lenses at least 5 days per week
             for at least 8 hours per day for at least one month prior to participation in the
             study.

          -  Possess or obtain prior to dispensing, wearable and visually functional (20/40 or
             better) eyeglasses.

          -  Be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge.

          -  Require spectacle lens powers between -0.50 and -8.00 diopters sphere with no more
             than 1.50 diopter of refractive astigmatism and be willing to wear contact lenses in
             both eyes.

          -  Have manifest refraction Snellen visual acuities (VA) equal to or better than20/25 in

             in a monovision modality at any time during the study as it will interfere with the
             visual acuity analysis.

          -  Poor personal hygiene.

          -  Any active participation in another clinical trial during this trial or within 30 days
             prior to this study.

             keratoconus or uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  The need for topical ocular medications or any systemic medication which might
             interfere with contact lens wear or require the lenses to be removed during the day.

          -  The presence of clinically significant (grade 2, 3 or 4) anterior segment
             abnormalities; or the presence of any inflammations such as iritis; or any infection
             of the eye, lids, or associated structures.

          -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), corneal ulcer,
             corneal infiltrates, iritis, bacterial or fungal infections.

          -  A history of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with contact lens wear.

          -  Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear, including but not
             limited to:

               -  Pathological dry eye or associated dry eye symptoms with decreased tear levels
                  and punctuate staining &gt; Grade 2
