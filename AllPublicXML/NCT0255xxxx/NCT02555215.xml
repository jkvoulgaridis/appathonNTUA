    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of BG00012 in subjects
      who completed Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200). Secondary objectives are as follows: To evaluate
      the long-term efficacy of BG00012 and to describe the long-term Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      outcomes in subjects who completed Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

    <description>T2 hyperintense lesions were measured by MRI brain scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the Investigator. New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that evolved gradually over months were considered disability progression, not an acute relapse, and were not treated with steroids.
The ARR was calculated as the total number of relapses that occurred during the previous 12 months and during the 120 weeks on treatment for participants in Study 109MS202 that continued into Study 109MS311, divided by the total number of person-years followed prior to the study and by the total number of person-years followed during the study, respectively.</description>

    <description>Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the Investigator.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Degree of Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Disability Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by at least a 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS ≥1.0 that is sustained for 24 weeks, or at least a 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS = 0 that is sustained for 24 weeks.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability of parents, legal guardians, and/or subjects to understand the purpose and
             risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to
             use confidential health information in accordance with national and local subject
             privacy regulations. Subjects will provide assent in addition to the parental or
             guardian consent, as appropriate, per local regulations.

          -  Subjects who completed, as per protocol, the previous BG00012 clinical study 109MS202
             (NCT02410200) and remain on BG00012 treatment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements, including the presence
             of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the subject's
             ability to comply with the protocol.

          -  Any significant changes in medical history occurring after enrollment in the parent
             Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200), including laboratory test abnormalities or current
             clinically significant conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would have
             excluded the subject's participation from the parent study. The Investigator must
             re-review the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any factors
             that would preclude treatment.

          -  Subjects from Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200) who could not tolerate study treatment.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

The ARR was calculated as the total number of relapses that occurred during the previous 12 months and during the 120 weeks on treatment for participants in Study 109MS202 that continued into Study 109MS311, divided by the total number of person-years followed prior to the study and by the total number of person-years followed during the study, respectively.</description>

        <description>Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the Investigator. New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that evolved gradually over months were considered disability progression, not an acute relapse, and were not treated with steroids.</description>
