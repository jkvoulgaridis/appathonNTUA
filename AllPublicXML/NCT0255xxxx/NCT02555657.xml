  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) will be
      randomly assigned to receive either single agent pembrolizumab or single agent chemotherapy
      chosen by the treating physician (Treatment of Physician's Choice, TPC) in accordance with
      local regulations and guidelines, consisting of either capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine,
      or vinorelbine. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab extends overall survival
      compared to TPC.

        <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS), based on BICR assessment per RESIST 1.1, was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.</description>
