  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active Axial Spondyloarthritis without x-ray evidence of Ankylosing Spondylitis
      and with signs of inflammation will be randomly assigned to receive certolizumab pegol (CZP)
      200 mg every two weeks or placebo. The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of
      CZP in these patients.

    <measure>Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response criteria response at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is considered as primary in all countries except for Canada (and any other country where applicable or where requested by Regulatory Authorities) where it is considered as secondary variable.
ASDAS-MI is achieved when there is a reduction (improvement) &gt;= 2.0 in the ASDAS relative to Baseline.
The ASDAS is calculated as the sum of the following components:
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Q2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA) 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm of the C-reactive protein (CRP) [mg/L] + 1) Back pain, PGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).</description>

    <description>This variable is considered as primary for Canada (and any other country where applicable or where requested by Regulatory Authorities) and as secondary variable in all other countries.
The ASAS40 response is defined as relative improvements of at least 40 % and absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in at least 3 of the 4 domains: Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA), Pain assessment (total spinal pain NRS scores), Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)), Inflammation (mean of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) questions 5 and 6 concerning morning stiffness intensity and duration) and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.</description>

Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardize the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above</description>
