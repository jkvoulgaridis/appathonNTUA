  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that post-exercise milk protein feeding will enhance the
      mitochondrial protein synthesis (biogenesis) response to an exercise-training program. In
      addition, the investigators propose that this stimulatory effect of protein feeding will
      overcome the potential blunting effect of metformin on exercise responses. The investigators
      will investigate these outcomes over a 12-week exercise-training program in older adults with
      pre-diabetes with or without metformin treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. 60 men and women over the age
      of 55 with indications of pre-diabetes will be recruited for participation and randomly
      assigned to one of four 12 week exercise training programs: 1)Supervised aerobic exercise 3
      days per week followed by a carbohydrate drink along with daily oral administration of
      Metformin. 2) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a protein drink along
      with daily oral administration of Metformin. 3) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week
      followed by a carbohydrate drink along with daily oral administration of matching placebo. 4)
      Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a protein drink along with daily oral
      administration of placebo.

      Daily administration of Metformin will begin as one 500 mg tablet for the first week and will
      increase by 500 mg/day/week until reaching 2000 mg/day by week 4 during a 12 week exercise
      training program. The titration dosing scheme and taking metformin/placebo with meals will
      help reduce the most common side effects (i.e.,gastrointestinal discomfort). If participants
      experience gastrointestinal discomfort, the dose will be lowered to 1500 mg/day.

    <description>Oxygen consumption was assessed via high-resolution mitochondrial respirometry in permeabilized skeletal muscle.
