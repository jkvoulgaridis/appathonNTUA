    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind phase 2b clinical trial.
      Patients with Thalassemia will participate in this study and will be treated with Denosumab
      or placebo. The effect of Denosumab on lumbar spine BMD in patients with Thalassemia Major
      and Osteoporosis will be evaluated as compared with control (placebo) at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind phase 2b clinical trial.
      Patients with Thalassemia and Bone Mass Density (BMD) T-score between -2.5 and - 4.0 in at
      least one of the examined sites will participate in this study and will be treated with
      Denosumab or placebo.

      Patients will be assigned into two (2) treatment groups:

        -  In Group A, 60 mg Denosumab will be administered sc, every 6 months for 12 months for a
           total of 2 doses (day 0 and day 180).

        -  In Group B placebo will be administered sc, every 6 months for 12 months for a total of
           2 doses (day 0 and day 180) (Appendix I and Appendix II).

      Patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 fashion, to the two therapeutic arms (Group A,
      Group B, respectively), upon enrollment in the study.

      The effect of Denosumab on lumbar spine BMD (bone mineral density) in patients with
      Thalassemia Major and Osteoporosis as compared with control at 12 months will be evaluated.
      Also the effect on femoral neck and wrist bone BMD, on markers of bone remodeling and the
      safety profile will be evaluated as well. All subjects will receive a subcutaneous injection
      of Denosumab or placebo administered by a health care professional on days 0 and 180 (±3).
