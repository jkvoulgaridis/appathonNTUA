  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability and demonstrate a dose response
      signal using Total Symptom Score (TSS), based on challenges with grass pollen in an
      Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), followed by estimation of the minimum effective dose of
      SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum (SP) after 10 months of treatment compared to placebo.

      The study has 4 treatment groups: 3 different doses of SP and placebo will be tested.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current dose range finding study with SP has been designed to test three different
      concentrations of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum (SP) that includes 3 doses (10,000 AUN/mL; 40,000
      AUN/mL; 80,000 AUN/mL) and placebo to demonstrate a dose response signal and to estimate the
      minimal effective dose of SP. The study will be conducted in the target population of
      seasonal allergic subjects in a fully validated Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) system.
      The EEC system is a facility that has temporal uniformity of airborne allergen (pollen)
      exposure to subjects. Use of the EEC ensures exposure to relatively consistent levels of
      allergen. This facility has been used in a number of immunotherapy trials and is an improved
      challenge model of AR compared to the previously used nasal provocation test. Treatment
      duration of this study is extended to 10 months.

    <measure>Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) After 10 Months of Treatment (Visit 6) Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months after treatment start (baseline - Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the TSS after 10 months of treatment (at visit 6). The mean TSS at visit 6 was calculated as an average of all non-missing TSS scores between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 6. TSS was computed as the sum of individual scores for eight nasal and non-nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, itchiness, itchy/gritty eyes, tearing/watery eyes, red/burning eyes, and ear/palate itching). Each of eight symptoms was rated on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The range of TSS is from 0 to 24 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences. Negative change of TSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 6 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.</description>

    <description>The change from baseline of the mean TNSS at visit 6. The mean TNSS at visit 6 will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TNSS between 1 and 6 hours after start of EEC challenge at visit 6. The baseline will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TNSS between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 2. TNSS will be computed as the sum of individual scores for four nasal symptoms (running nose, congestion, itchy nose, and sneezing). Each of the four symptoms will be rated on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. The range of TNSS is from 0 to 12 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences.Negative change of TNSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 6 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.</description>

    <measure>Mean Combined Symptom and Medication Scores (CSMS) During the Grass Pollen Season.</measure>
    <time_frame>during the grass pollen season: estimated between 6 and 10 months after start of treatment at Visit 2</time_frame>
    <description>The mean CSMS will be calculated as an average of all non-missing daily CSMS during the grass pollen season. Subjects that did not complete at least 75% of their diary data, and subjects who have been on holidays outside the region for more than 7 days during the actual grass pollen season will be excluded from the analysis. The daily CSMS will be computed according to the definition given by the EAACI Position Paper. The actual grass pollen season would start on the first of 3 consecutive days that have a grass pollen count ≥ 10 ppm3 per 24 hours and the season would end on the first of 3 consecutive days that have a grass pollen count &lt; 10 ppm3 per 24 hours. The defined pollen season could consist of several separate periods that comply with this definition. The CSMS has a range from 0 to 6 and the higher the score, the more severe symptoms a subject is experiencing.</description>

        <title>Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) After 10 Months of Treatment (Visit 6) Compared to Placebo</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint was the TSS after 10 months of treatment (at visit 6). The mean TSS at visit 6 was calculated as an average of all non-missing TSS scores between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 6. TSS was computed as the sum of individual scores for eight nasal and non-nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, itchiness, itchy/gritty eyes, tearing/watery eyes, red/burning eyes, and ear/palate itching). Each of eight symptoms was rated on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The range of TSS is from 0 to 24 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences. Negative change of TSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 6 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) After 10 Months of Treatment (Visit 6)</title>
        <description>The change from baseline of the mean TSS at visit 6. The baseline will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TSS scores between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 2. The range of TSS is from 0 to 24 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences. Negative change of TSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 6 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) After 10 Months of Treatment (Visit 6)</title>
        <description>The change from baseline of the mean TNSS at visit 6. The mean TNSS at visit 6 will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TNSS between 1 and 6 hours after start of EEC challenge at visit 6. The baseline will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TNSS between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 2. TNSS will be computed as the sum of individual scores for four nasal symptoms (running nose, congestion, itchy nose, and sneezing). Each of the four symptoms will be rated on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. The range of TNSS is from 0 to 12 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences.Negative change of TNSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 6 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Combined Symptom and Medication Scores (CSMS) During the Grass Pollen Season.</title>
        <description>The mean CSMS will be calculated as an average of all non-missing daily CSMS during the grass pollen season. Subjects that did not complete at least 75% of their diary data, and subjects who have been on holidays outside the region for more than 7 days during the actual grass pollen season will be excluded from the analysis. The daily CSMS will be computed according to the definition given by the EAACI Position Paper. The actual grass pollen season would start on the first of 3 consecutive days that have a grass pollen count ≥ 10 ppm3 per 24 hours and the season would end on the first of 3 consecutive days that have a grass pollen count &lt; 10 ppm3 per 24 hours. The defined pollen season could consist of several separate periods that comply with this definition. The CSMS has a range from 0 to 6 and the higher the score, the more severe symptoms a subject is experiencing.</description>
