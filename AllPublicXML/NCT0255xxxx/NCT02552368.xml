  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a functioning and clinically feasible method
      for restoring function to motor-impaired stroke survivors. This ultimate goal will be
      approached through two different means. The first method is to develop a functioning
      brain-computer interface that operates based on cortical activity ipsilateral to an intended
      movement on the motor-impaired side of the body. And secondly, to develop new methods of
      rehabilitation that involve stimulating peripheral muscles based upon cortical activity
      ipsilateral to intended movements. Finally, the study seeks to assess changes in functional
      connectivity as a result of using a BCI device.

      This study will be carried out in two phases designed to achieve the objectives described
      above. The first phase will determine the feasibility of recording ipsilateral
      (contralesional) motor commands and use the signals to control a computer. This phase will
      involve recording EEG signals during the performance of real and imagined motor movements of
      both the impaired and non-impaired hand in stroke survivors. After recording the signals and
      analyzing the data, the signals will be used to try to control a cursor on a computer screen
      or a robotic hand. The second phase of the study will determine if the BCI system can be used
      to impact rehabilitation. Motor commands would be performed as in phase 1 to determine the
      accompanying EEG signals. The EEG signals would then be used to control stimulation of the
      impaired limb. Rehabilitation would be assessed by examining changes in commonly used
      functional motor scores.

    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluative measure to assess specific changes in limb function among individuals who sustained cortical damage resulting in hemiplegia (Lyle, 1981). It assesses a client's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation (Platz, Pinkowski, Kim, di Bella, &amp; Johnson, 2005).
The ARAT's is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from:
3) Performs test normally 2) Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty
1) Performs test partially 0) Can perform no part of test
The maximum score achievable on this measure is 57 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is an evidence-based outcome measure designed to capture a client's self-perception of performance in 5 patient-identified tasks over time. Patients identified 5 functional activities that they wanted to perform more independently or with greater ease. COPM measurements consisted of a semi-structured interview in which patients rated their performance &amp; satisfaction with each activity on an ordinal scale from 1 to 10. A performance score of 1 indicated they are unable to perform identified task, &amp; a score of 10 indicates they are able to complete the functional task as easy as prior to stroke. A satisfaction score of 1 indicated they were not satisfied at all to 10 indicating they are extremely satisfied with how they complete the identified functional task. Patients would rate (5) functional tasks for their performance and satisfaction. Scores were averaged between the scores from the 5 functional activities.</description>

          <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluative measure to assess specific changes in limb function among individuals who sustained cortical damage resulting in hemiplegia (Lyle, 1981). It assesses a client's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation (Platz, Pinkowski, Kim, di Bella, &amp; Johnson, 2005).
The ARAT's is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from:
3) Performs test normally 2) Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty
1) Performs test partially 0) Can perform no part of test
The maximum score achievable on this measure is 57 points.</description>

        <title>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</title>
        <description>The COPM is an evidence-based outcome measure designed to capture a client's self-perception of performance in 5 patient-identified tasks over time. Patients identified 5 functional activities that they wanted to perform more independently or with greater ease. COPM measurements consisted of a semi-structured interview in which patients rated their performance &amp; satisfaction with each activity on an ordinal scale from 1 to 10. A performance score of 1 indicated they are unable to perform identified task, &amp; a score of 10 indicates they are able to complete the functional task as easy as prior to stroke. A satisfaction score of 1 indicated they were not satisfied at all to 10 indicating they are extremely satisfied with how they complete the identified functional task. Patients would rate (5) functional tasks for their performance and satisfaction. Scores were averaged between the scores from the 5 functional activities.</description>
