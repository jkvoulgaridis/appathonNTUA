    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of fitusiran in male patients with moderate
      or severe hemophilia A or B

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To investigate the long-term efficacy of fitusiran

        -  To characterize the safety and efficacy of concomitantly administered Factor VIII
           (FVIII), Factor IX (FIX) or bypassing agents (BPA) and fitusiran for treatment of
           bleeding episodes

        -  To assess changes in health-related quality of life (QOL) over time

        -  To characterize antithrombin (AT) reduction and thrombin generation (TG) increase

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of fitusiran

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that patients in this study will receive treatment with open label
      fitusiran for approximately 6 years or until fitusiran becomes commercially available,
      whichever occurs first.
