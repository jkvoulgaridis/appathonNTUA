    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death in the United
      States. It is projected to be the leading cause of death by 2020. As many as 24 million
      Americans are estimated to suffer from impaired lung function. Of those more than 12 million
      were actually diagnosed with COPD, and over 118,000 deaths were attributed to COPD in 2004.

      COPD has been linked with an increased risk for lung cancer. Both airway obstruction, defined
      by abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and CT scan diagnosed emphysema were shown to be
      independent risk factors for lung cancer.

      Treatment for COPD includes cessation of environmental exposures (i.e. smoking), dampening
      the inflammatory response, symptoms control and, for a small subgroup, surgical approaches
      and lung transplant. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these treatment options to change the
      natural history of this disease is very limited. Recent evidence suggests a new role for
      macrolides as immune-modulators in patients with COPD, although the mechanisms are not
      clearly determined.

      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with COPD, treatment with azithromycin will
      show reduced inflammatory markers, transcription factors changes, and lung function changes
      consistent with reduced inflammation.
