      A prospective, multi center, concurrently enrolled, propensity score controlled through Month
      60. The purpose is to evaluate coflex device performance in a &quot;real conditions of use&quot;
      study.Subjects will be evaluated pre-operatively, at the time of surgery, 3- month, 12- month
      and annually thereafter at 24-, 36-, 48-, 60-months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate 5-year clinical status of patients implanted with the coflex® device in conjunction with surgical decompression relative to decompression alone.</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This objective will be accomplished by a Baysesian test of superiority using Month 60 composite clinical success and has three parts: 1) At least a 15 point improvement relative to pretreatment baselin in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, range 0-100) 2) No reoperations, revisions, removals, or supplemental fixation at the index level(s); and 3) No ≥2 injections or series of injections for any lumbar level**, or nerve block procedures performed to treat spinal stenosis at any lumbar level(s) or a single injection within 12 months of the 5 year endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare clinical status of patients implanted with the coflex® device in conjunction with surgical decompression relative to surgical decompression alone</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The objective will be achieved by conducting a Bayesian test and Month 24 CSS will require:
No &quot;Treatment Failure&quot; on or before the exact 2-year anniversary of the index surgery. Treatment Failure will include:
Surgical intervention at the index level
No lumbar epidural steroid injection including nerve root blocks and facet blocks at any lumbar level
At least a 15 point improvement relative to pretreatment baseline in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, range 0-100).
No major device-related adverse event defined as an event simultaneously both 'Serious' and 'Definitely' on or before the exact surgical two-year anniversary or exact five-year anniversary. In the decompression alone group, since there is no device, this endpoint will be identified as any serious AE that is classified as definitely related to surgery as determined by the independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>If non-inferiority is shown at two-years, to evaluate evidence supporting superiority at two-years in terms of Month 24 CCS using the same informative prior distribution for the coflex group.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>No &quot;Treatment Failure&quot; on or before the exact 2-year anniversary of the index surgery. Treatment Failure will include:
Surgical intervention at the index level
No lumbar epidural steroid injection including nerve root blocks and facet blocks at any lumbar level
At least a 15 point improvement relative to pretreatment baseline in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, range 0-100).
No major device-related adverse event defined as an event simultaneously both 'Serious' and 'Definitely' on or before the exact surgical two-year anniversary or exact five-year anniversary. In the decompression alone group, since there is no device, this endpoint will be identified as any serious AE that is classified as definitely related to surgery as determined by the independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate coflex® device performance in a 'real conditions of use' study and to confirm that coflex® device performance is not clinically inferior in the PAS population compared to the pivotal IDE trial population.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The same Month 24 CCS endpoint used in the IDE trial will be used in these analyses to facilitate this comparison. The definition required no Treatment Failure, and ODI improvement greater than or equal to 15, as well as no new or worsening, persistent neurological deficit; and no major device-related adverse event defined as severe and definitely-related.</description>
