    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 52 (up to approximately 38 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. AEs, including AEs of Special Interest and AEs of Particular Interest, were reported based on the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for AEs, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE, v4.0). Reported are the number of subjects with AEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).</description>

Thrombocytopenia is defined as deficiency of platelets (&lt;150 x 10^9/L) in the blood. Infections include all events of infections under the SOC of infections and infestations in this study.</description>

MMF/MPA dose will be up titrated to a target dose of 2.0 - 2.5 grams per day (g/day) (or equivalent). Investigators, at their discretion, may use MPA as a substitute for MMF, with a 360 mg dose being equivalent to a 500 mg dose of MMF. During screening or at randomization, if clinically indicated, participants may receive 750-1000 mg methylprednisolone IV once daily for up to 3 days to treat underlying LN clinical activity. Participants will receive 0.5 mg/kg oral prednisone, tapering this prednisone dose, per protocol, starting on Day 16 and reducing the prednisone dosage to 7.5 mg/day by Week 12.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 126 patients were enrolled in the study however one patient randomized to obinutuzumab did not receive study treatment due to a positive pregnancy test, but prior to the first study drug infusion; therefore a total of 125 patients are included in the analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>OBINUTUZUMAB 1000MG and MMF</title>
          <description>Participants will receive obinutuzumab 1000 milligrams (mg) intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 15, 168, and 182 along with MMF/MPA at a starting dose of 1500 mg/day (or equivalent) administered orally in 2 or 3 divided doses. MMF/MPA dose will be up titrated to a target dose of 2.0 - 2.5 grams per day (g/day) (or equivalent). Investigators, at their discretion, may use MPA as a substitute for MMF, with a 360 mg dose being equivalent to a 500 mg dose of MMF. During screening or at randomization, if clinically indicated, participants may receive 750-1000 mg methylprednisolone IV once daily for up to 3 days to treat underlying LN clinical activity. Participants will receive 0.5 mg/kg oral prednisone, tapering this prednisone dose, per protocol, starting on Day 16 and reducing the prednisone dosage to 7.5 mg/day by Week 12.</description>

          <description>Participants will receive placebo matching to obinutuzumab IV infusion on Days 1, 15, 168, and 182 along with MMF/MPA at a starting dose of 1500 mg/day (or equivalent) administered orally in 2 or 3 divided doses. MMF/MPA dose will be up titrated to a target dose of 2.0 - 2.5 g/day (or equivalent). Investigators, at their discretion, may use MPA as a substitute for MMF, with a 360 mg dose being equivalent to a 500 mg dose of MMF. During screening or at randomization, if clinically indicated, participants may receive 750-1000 mg methylprednisolone IV once daily for up to 3 days to treat underlying LN clinical activity.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as deficiency of platelets (&lt;150 x 10^9/L) in the blood. Infections include all events of infections under the SOC of infections and infestations in this study.</description>

          <description>Participants will receive obinutuzumab 1000 milligrams (mg) intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 15, 168, and 182 along with MMF/MPA at a starting dose of 1500 mg/day (or equivalent) administered orally in 2 or 3 divided doses. MMF/MPA dose will be up titrated to a target dose of 2.0 - 2.5 grams per day (g/day) (or equivalent). Investigators, at their discretion, may use MPA as a substitute for MMF, with a 360 mg dose being equivalent to a 500 mg dose of MMF. During screening or at randomization, if clinically indicated, participants may receive 750-1000 mg methylprednisolone IV once daily for up to 3 days to treat underlying LN clinical activity. Participants will receive 0.5 mg/kg oral prednisone, tapering this prednisone dose, per protocol, starting on Day 16 and reducing the prednisone dosage to 7.5 mg/day by Week 12.</description>
