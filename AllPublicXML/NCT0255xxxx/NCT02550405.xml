    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The craving behavioral intervention (CBI) was developed based on the framework of craving, combining with behavior intervention (Dong and Potenza, 2014), and conducted among individuals with IGD.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group were individuals with Internet gaming disorder who did not receive any intervention but were scanned twice with the similar interval period as experimental group.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Craving behavioral intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The CBI was given once a week for 6 weeks, conducted by four therapists. A pair of therapists was randomly assigned to a CBI+ group. Each session included 5 parts in 2.5-3 hours: warming-up exercise, discussion about the homework from the last session, main structured activity, brief summary, and the homework assignment. There were 6 sessions with each focused on a topic: recognize craving and its relationship with IGD; reduce craving through ameliorating the salience of cues and irrational beliefs, withdrawal symptoms and other negative affects; enhance self-monitoring and control for craving through time management training; relieve fulÔ¨Ållment of psychological needs through Internet use and attenuate the relation between craving and gaming behaviors through coping skill training</description>
