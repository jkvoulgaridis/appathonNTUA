  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will enroll women with palpable cancers to assess the
      accuracy of the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) and the concomitant procedure as a vehicle to
      optimize and validate the approach in such surgical cases. This approach of adopting palpable
      cancer patients before initiating an evaluative trial of the BCL in non-palpable breast
      cancer cases ensures that the BCL does not substantially alter or modify the standard-of-care
      procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test whether the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) accurately defines
      the edges of the tumor. Twenty patients with palpable invasive breast cancer will undergo
      preoperative supine MRI, the creation of a BCL, and breast-conserving surgery using the BCL
      as an adjunct to palpation-guided tumor resection. Participants will also have the tumor
      position on their skin localized with the supine MR/optical scan/tracker method. The primary
      objective is to measure the distance from the center of the spots made by the BCL to the
      cancer edges.

Breast Cancer Locator (BCL): This locator is constructed pre-operatively, sterilized and provided to the surgeon at the time of the procedure. The outline of the breast cancer on the breast surface at the point where the cancer is closest to the skin is built into the locator so that the surgeon can simply apply the locator to the patient’s breast and trace the tumor outline on the skin.</description>
