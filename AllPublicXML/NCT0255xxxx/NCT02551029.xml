  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain imaging has shown abnormal brain activations in response to visceral stimulation in
      patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Functional Dyspepsia (FD). To
      investigate the possible role of the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS), the primary relay
      station in the brainstem for vagal afferents, its activation in IBS and functional dyspepsia
      patients will be evaluated. Prior to this, an exploratory study in healthy volunteers will be
      conducted. This will be the first high magnetic field fMRI study (7T) evaluating the possible
      role of NTS activation in visceral abdominal pain. Moreover, this will be the first
      pharmacological fMRI study using duodenal capsaicin infusion as a chemical stimulus, which is
      more physiological than mechano-stimulation in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scores, The BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score.

Each item is rated from 0, no pain, to 10, pain as bad as you can imagine, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference. The seven sub- items are rated from 0, does not interfere, to 10, completely interferes, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 70.</description>
