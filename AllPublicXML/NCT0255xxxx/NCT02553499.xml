  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with advanced solid tumors were assigned to receive escalating
      doses of either MK-1248 alone or MK-1248 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). This
      study used the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level to find and
      confirm the maximum tolerated dose (or maximum administered dose) for MK-1248 alone and in
      combination with pembrolizumab.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Up to 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 (21 days), if possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment, was considered a DLT: 1. Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity 2. Grade 4 hematological toxicity lasting &gt;7 days, except thrombocytopenia a. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration b. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia is a DLT if associated with bleeding 3. Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, with the exceptions 4. Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematological laboratory abnormality, if medical intervention was required, or abnormality led to hospitalization, or abnormality persisted for &gt;1 week 5. Febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4 6. Any drug-related AE which caused participant to discontinue study treatment during Cycle 1 7. Grade 5 toxicity 8. Any treatment-related toxicity which caused a &gt;2-week delay in initiation of Cycle 2.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-1248 in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the maximum (peak) concentration of MK-1248 observed in blood serum. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 Cmax. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 &amp; 15. Each cycle was 21 days.

    <measure>Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of MK-1248 in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Ctrough is the lowest concentration of MK-1248 in blood serum just before the next dose. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 Ctrough, except for during Cycle 1. No blood samples were collected for the analysis of Ctrough in Cycle 1. No samples were collected for the MK-1248 0.6 mg group in Cycles 3 or 4, for the MK-1248 10 mg group in Cycles 1-4, or for the MK-1248 60 mg + Pembrolizumab group in Cycle 4. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 &amp; 15. Each cycle was 21 days.

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of MK-1248 in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>AUC0-infinity is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. It is a measure of the amount of MK-1248 in blood serum from pre-dose to infinite time. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 AUC0-inf. No blood samples were collected for the MK-1248 0.6 mg group in Cycle 4, for the MK-1248 10 mg group in Cycle or for the MK-1248 60 mg + Pembrolizumab group in Cycle 4. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 &amp; 15. Each cycle was 21 days.

    <measure>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Glucocorticoid-induced Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-related Protein (GITR) Receptor Target Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>At designated timepoints (Up to ~4.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>GITR protein is internalized upon binding by MK-1248. To evaluate GITR target engagement, a GITR receptor availability assay was developed to assess the availability of surface GITR following administration of MK-1248. GITR is detected on CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD95+ T-cell sub-populations using flow cytometry and compared to pre-dose baseline. GITR target engagement is calculated as 100% - (%) GITR receptor availability. The Cmax of percent GITR target engagement on CD4+CD25+ T-cells is presented. Timepoints: Arm 1: Screening; Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose MK-1248, At end of MK-1248 infusion (0.5 hours), 2 hours after start of MK-1248 infusion (2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 8 &amp; 15. Arm 2: Screening; Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose pembrolizumab, At end of MK-1248 infusion (0.5 hours), 2 hours after start of MK-1248 infusion (2 hours): Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 8 &amp; Day 15: Cycles 5-6: Predose.

        <title>Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of MK-1248 in Serum</title>
        <description>Ctrough is the lowest concentration of MK-1248 in blood serum just before the next dose. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 Ctrough, except for during Cycle 1. No blood samples were collected for the analysis of Ctrough in Cycle 1. No samples were collected for the MK-1248 0.6 mg group in Cycles 3 or 4, for the MK-1248 10 mg group in Cycles 1-4, or for the MK-1248 60 mg + Pembrolizumab group in Cycle 4. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 &amp; 15. Each cycle was 21 days. (Up to ~3 months)</description>
        <time_frame>At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population consisted of all participants who received MK-1248 and had blood samples assessed for MK-1248 Ctrough. Ctrough data were not collected for the MK-1248 10 mg group</population>

          <title>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of MK-1248 in Serum</title>
          <description>AUC0-infinity is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. It is a measure of the amount of MK-1248 in blood serum from pre-dose to infinite time. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 AUC0-inf. No blood samples were collected for the MK-1248 0.6 mg group in Cycle 4, for the MK-1248 10 mg group in Cycle or for the MK-1248 60 mg + Pembrolizumab group in Cycle 4. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 &amp; 15. Each cycle was 21 days. (Up to ~3 months)</description>

        <title>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Glucocorticoid-induced Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-related Protein (GITR) Receptor Target Engagement</title>
        <description>GITR protein is internalized upon binding by MK-1248. To evaluate GITR target engagement, a GITR receptor availability assay was developed to assess the availability of surface GITR following administration of MK-1248. GITR is detected on CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD95+ T-cell sub-populations using flow cytometry and compared to pre-dose baseline. GITR target engagement is calculated as 100% - (%) GITR receptor availability. The Cmax of percent GITR target engagement on CD4+CD25+ T-cells is presented. Timepoints: Arm 1: Screening; Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose MK-1248, At end of MK-1248 infusion (0.5 hours), 2 hours after start of MK-1248 infusion (2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 8 &amp; 15.

          <description>GITR protein is internalized upon binding by MK-1248. To evaluate GITR target engagement, a GITR receptor availability assay was developed to assess the availability of surface GITR following administration of MK-1248.
