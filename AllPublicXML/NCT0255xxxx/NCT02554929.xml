    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the efficacy of a brief, 11-week, manualized Taming Sneaky Fears for
      Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and/or Selective Mutism (SM) child and parent group Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol. Children 4 to 7 years old (n = 88) meeting
      criteria for SAD and/or SM, and their parents are recruited from the Psychiatry Outpatient
      Program and participants will be randomized to either the Taming Sneaky Fears group or a
      parent psycho-education and child socialization group. Trained clinicians blinded to all
      measures and treatment assignment will administer pre, post and 6-month follow-up outcome
      measures. Investigators assess within-the-child and within-the-parent/environment factors
      that predict treatment outcomes.

      This study utilizes a repeated measures, longitudinal, randomized controlled trial design to
      compare the efficacy of two interventions in the treatment of children aged 4 to 7 years with
      SM and/or SAD. Participants are randomized into either the:

        1. Taming Sneaky Fears for SAD and/or SM parent and child group CBT treatment, or

        2. the Parent Psycho-education and Child Socialization comparison program.

      Both programs run for 10 consecutive weeks (plus one additional introduction week). To
      control for the nonspecific factors associated with treatment, such as the support, attention
      and expectation of improvement, parents and children in both treatment protocols receive
      comparable levels of attention from therapists (i.e., same duration of group sessions and
      total number of sessions with a therapist) and comparable opportunities for socialization
      (e.g., for the children: invitation to discuss how the previous week went, snack time, story
      time; for the parents: discussion of specific topics at each session). However, parents and
      children in the comparison group are not taught CBT strategies.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in CSR of SAD &amp; SM at 6 months after treatment ends. Treatment groups run for 11 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV): Parent Version (ADIS-P) is a semi-structured, clinician-administered, interview of parents used to diagnose anxiety and other related disorders in children and adolescents. Parents were asked to rate for interference or impairment using a 9-point scale ranging from 0 to 8, with 0 being not impaired or not interfering and 8 being significant impairment or interference. A final Clinician Severity Rating (CSR) was then established using the same scale, with a CSR of 4 (moderate degree of impairment) or greater required to establish a diagnosis.</description>

    <measure>Change in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline on the CGAS within 4 weeks of treatment end. Treatment groups run for 11 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) is a clinician rating of overall adaptive functioning during the previous month for children and adolescents between 4 to 16 years of age. CGAS scores are rated on a 100-point scale, with 1 being the most impaired and 100 being least impaired, and descriptors for each 10-point interval such that each 10-point interval defines a range of children's functioning in all areas of their life. CGAS scores were secondary outcome measures. The Change in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) measures level of general functioning on a 100 point scale - 1 (needs constant supervision) to 100 (superior functioning). Every 10 points global functioning moves to the next category.</description>

    <measure>Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>The SMQ was completed by parents at all 3 time-points: 1) Pre-treatment (baseline), 2) Post-treatment, and 3) 6-month follow-up (from baseline date).</time_frame>
    <description>The Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ) is a 17-item parent questionnaire that assesses the degree and frequency of speech in 3-to-11-year-old children and provides a proxy measure of selective mutism severity. Parents report on their child's behavior with regards to speaking in the previous two weeks across three broad domains (or subscales): at school (five items), at home/with family (five items), and in social situations (seven items). Parents rate items using a three-point scale that ranges from 0 = never to 3 = always. Lower total scores on the Selective Mutism Questionnaire suggest less speech.</description>

    <description>The Preschool Anxiety Scale - Parent report (PAS-P) is a 29-item parent-report questionnaire for use with 3- to 6-year-old children. Parents report on their child's anxiety symptoms in different scenarios. Parents rate items on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>

          <title>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS), Clinical Severity Rating (ADIS-CSR)</title>
          <description>The ADIS-CSR was used to assess SAD and/or SM. This measure has good reliability, is sensitive to treatment effects in child anxiety studies, and has been used in a number of studies on preschoolers and SM treatment. Clinical Severity Rating (ADIS-CSR) uses a 0 to 8 scale to measure clinical severity of diagnosis; a CSR of ≥4 indicates clinically significant symptoms and presence of an anxiety disorder. A trained independent clinician blinded to treatment type and time of assessment completed the CSR.</description>

        <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV): Parent Version (ADIS-P) is a semi-structured, clinician-administered, interview of parents used to diagnose anxiety and other related disorders in children and adolescents. Parents were asked to rate for interference or impairment using a 9-point scale ranging from 0 to 8, with 0 being not impaired or not interfering and 8 being significant impairment or interference. A final Clinician Severity Rating (CSR) was then established using the same scale, with a CSR of 4 (moderate degree of impairment) or greater required to establish a diagnosis.</description>

        <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Parent Version (ADIS-P) is a semi-structured, clinician-administered, interview of parents used to diagnose anxiety and other related disorders in children and adolescents. Parents were asked to rate for interference or impairment using a 9-point scale ranging from 0 to 8, with 0 being not impaired or not interfering and 8 being significant impairment or interference. A final Clinician Severity Rating (CSR) was then established using the same scale, with a CSR of 4 (moderate degree of impairment) or greater required to establish a diagnosis.</description>
        <time_frame>Change from Baseline in CSR within 4 weeks of treatment end. Treatment groups run for 11 weeks.</time_frame>

CGAS scores are rated on a 100-point scale, with 1 being the most impaired and 100 being least impaired, and descriptors for each 10-point interval such that each 10-point interval defines a range of children's functioning in all areas of their life. CGAS scores were secondary outcome measures. The Change in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) measures level of general functioning on a 100 point scale - 1 (needs constant supervision) to 100 (superior functioning).

Parents rate items using a three-point scale that ranges from 0 = never to 3 = always. Lower total scores on the Selective Mutism Questionnaire suggest less speech.</description>
