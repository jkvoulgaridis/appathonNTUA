    <measure>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) Levels Measured Using the Timed Capillary Blood Spot Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>At Weeks 21, 22 and 23</time_frame>
    <description>Fingertip capillary blood was collected using filter paper cards for the assay of capillary blood spot IGF-I in line with the monitoring recommendations of the Lawson Wilkins Paediatric Endocrine Society (LWPES) for treatment with recombinant GH therapy in children.
Capillary IGF-I assays were performed by the patient at home one day per week during Weeks 21, 22 and 23 only (same week day). The samples were scheduled in the evening prior to the injection of NutropinAq and between 7:00 and 9:00 the following morning. An extended window from 6:00 to 12:00 was allowed for defining protocol deviations.
The number of capillary blood spot IGF-I measurements and the optimal timing of samples to assess the IGF-I status of NutropinAq treated patients was assessed. IGF-I measurements for the morning and evening sampling are presented.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of IGF-I Levels: Categorised by Weekly Timing (Weeks 21-23) and Daily Timing (Morning and Evening)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Weeks 21, 22 and 23</time_frame>
    <description>The influence of daily and weekly timing on the IGF-I value as measured using the capillary blood spot method was analysed. A 3-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was performed with patient, day and daily timing as factors after appropriate transformation to obtain normally distributed parameters. The interaction day*time was tested and kept in the model only if p-value&lt;0.1. Parameter estimates from the statistical model are presented as least squares means for the categories of daily timing (Morning and Evening) and weekly timing (Week 21, Week 22 and Week 23). The values reported for Week 21, 22, and 23 represent the average IGF-I levels from the morning and evening samples at each week. The values reported for Evening represent the Evening IGF-I levels averaged across Weeks 21, 22, and 23, and similarly for the Morning values.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of IGF-I Levels: Categorised by Sex and Prepubertal Status</measure>
    <time_frame>At Weeks 21, 22 and 23</time_frame>
    <description>The influence of sex and prepubertal status on the IGF-I value as measured using the capillary blood spot method was analysed. Parameter estimates from the statistical model are presented as least squares means for the categories of sex (male and female) and prepubertal status (pubertal and prepubertal). The values reported represent average IGF-I levels as determined from the 6 measurements taken (i.e. morning and evening samples at Weeks 21, 22 and 23).</description>

    <measure>Multivariate Linear Regression Analyses to Assess Factors Affecting the Variability of IGF-I Levels: Categorised by Disease Condition and Location</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A multivariate linear regression analysis of factors on within-subject coefficient of variation (WCV) using a stepwise forward-backward elimination was used to determine the effect of individual factors on IGF-I values as measured using the capillary blood spot method (p=0.15 for a variable to enter and remain in the model). The WCV was computed from the series of 6 measurements (2 samplings in each of Weeks 21, 22 and 23). The influence of disease condition and country clusters on the IGF-I value were assessed.
Country clusters: cluster 1: France; cluster 2: Spain, Greece, Romania and Italy; cluster 3: UK, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia, Austria and Finland ; cluster 4: Russia ; cluster 5: Ukraine.
Parameter estimates from the statistical model presented as least squares means for categories of disease condition (GHD and TS) and location (Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in the Auxological Parameter Calculated Height SDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The auxological parameter, height, was measured at Visit 1 (Baseline measurement), Visit 2 (Week 12) and Visit 3 (Week 24). The French growth charts were used for the calculation of SDS parameters: the charts provide for each age range and sex a mean parameter and SD value, from which the SDS parameter can be derived assuming a normal distribution. For example: Height SDS = (height - reference mean height (age, sex)) / reference SD (age, sex). The SDS indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A SDS of 0 is equal to the mean with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. A positive change in SDS indicates an improvement in growth, therefore, a favorable outcome.

          <description>Patients received daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of NutropinAq 10 milligrams (mg)/ 2 milliliters (mL) for 6 months. The therapeutic daily doses administered were as follows:
GHD patients: 0.025 – 0.035 mg/ kilogram (kg) bodyweight
TS patients: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight
CRI patients: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight
Patients visited the study clinic for a baseline visit and for 2 other visits every 3 months (Weeks 12 and 24). Additional home assessments were made at Weeks 21, 22 and 23.
The investigator determined the dose administered to each patient, and it was recommended to perform the injection in the evening.</description>

          <title>Calculated genetic target height Standard Deviation Score (SDS)</title>
          <description>The genetic potential height, or target height was estimated as follows:
Boys Target Height = [(mother height cm + father height cm)/2] + 6.5 cm.
Girls Target Height = [(mother height cm + father height cm)/2] - 6.5 cm. The French growth charts were used for the calculation of standard deviation score (SDS) parameters: the charts provide for each age range and sex a mean parameter and standard deviation (SD) value, from which the SDS parameter can be derived assuming a normal distribution. For example: Height SDS = (height – reference mean height (age, sex)) / reference SD (age, sex).</description>

        <title>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) Levels Measured Using the Timed Capillary Blood Spot Samples</title>
        <description>Fingertip capillary blood was collected using filter paper cards for the assay of capillary blood spot IGF-I in line with the monitoring recommendations of the Lawson Wilkins Paediatric Endocrine Society (LWPES) for treatment with recombinant GH therapy in children.
Capillary IGF-I assays were performed by the patient at home one day per week during Weeks 21, 22 and 23 only (same week day). The samples were scheduled in the evening prior to the injection of NutropinAq and between 7:00 and 9:00 the following morning. An extended window from 6:00 to 12:00 was allowed for defining protocol deviations.
The number of capillary blood spot IGF-I measurements and the optimal timing of samples to assess the IGF-I status of NutropinAq treated patients was assessed. IGF-I measurements for the morning and evening sampling are presented.</description>

            <title>NutropinAq 10 mg/2 ml (30 IU)</title>
            <description>Patients received daily s.c. injections of NutropinAq 10 mg/ 2 mL for 6 months. The therapeutic daily doses administered were as follows:
GHD patients: 0.025 – 0.035 mg/ kilogram kg bodyweight
TS patients: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight
CRI patients: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight
Patients visited the study clinic for a baseline visit and for 2 other visits every 3 months (Weeks 12 and 24). Additional home assessments were made at Weeks 21, 22 and 23.
The investigator determined the dose administered to each patient, and it was recommended to perform the injection in the evening.</description>

        <title>Assessment of IGF-I Levels: Categorised by Weekly Timing (Weeks 21-23) and Daily Timing (Morning and Evening)</title>
        <description>The influence of daily and weekly timing on the IGF-I value as measured using the capillary blood spot method was analysed. A 3-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was performed with patient, day and daily timing as factors after appropriate transformation to obtain normally distributed parameters. The interaction day*time was tested and kept in the model only if p-value&lt;0.1. Parameter estimates from the statistical model are presented as least squares means for the categories of daily timing (Morning and Evening) and weekly timing (Week 21, Week 22 and Week 23). The values reported for Week 21, 22, and 23 represent the average IGF-I levels from the morning and evening samples at each week. The values reported for Evening represent the Evening IGF-I levels averaged across Weeks 21, 22, and 23, and similarly for the Morning values.</description>

        <title>Multivariate Linear Regression Analyses to Assess Factors Affecting the Variability of IGF-I Levels: Categorised by Disease Condition and Location</title>
        <description>A multivariate linear regression analysis of factors on within-subject coefficient of variation (WCV) using a stepwise forward-backward elimination was used to determine the effect of individual factors on IGF-I values as measured using the capillary blood spot method (p=0.15 for a variable to enter and remain in the model). The WCV was computed from the series of 6 measurements (2 samplings in each of Weeks 21, 22 and 23). The influence of disease condition and country clusters on the IGF-I value were assessed.
Country clusters: cluster 1: France; cluster 2: Spain, Greece, Romania and Italy; cluster 3: UK, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia, Austria and Finland ; cluster 4: Russia ; cluster 5: Ukraine.
Parameter estimates from the statistical model presented as least squares means for categories of disease condition (GHD and TS) and location (Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are presented.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT Population consisted of all treated patients (enrolled patients who received at least one injection of treatment) and who provided any follow-up data. Only evaluable subjects within each of the individual subgroups are presented for each category. As there was only 1 patient with CRI, no analysis was performed for this disease condition.</population>

            <description>Patients received daily s.c. injections of NutropinAq 10 mg/ 2 mL for 6 months. The therapeutic daily doses administered were as follows:
GHD patients: 0.025 – 0.035 mg/kg bodyweight
TS patients: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight
CRI patients: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight
Patients visited the study clinic for a baseline visit and for 2 other visits every 3 months (Weeks 12 and 24). Additional home assessments were made at Weeks 21, 22 and 23.
The investigator determined the dose administered to each patient, and it was recommended to perform the injection in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in the Auxological Parameter Calculated Height SDS</title>
        <description>The auxological parameter, height, was measured at Visit 1 (Baseline measurement), Visit 2 (Week 12) and Visit 3 (Week 24). The French growth charts were used for the calculation of SDS parameters: the charts provide for each age range and sex a mean parameter and SD value, from which the SDS parameter can be derived assuming a normal distribution. For example: Height SDS = (height - reference mean height (age, sex)) / reference SD (age, sex). The SDS indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A SDS of 0 is equal to the mean with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. A positive change in SDS indicates an improvement in growth, therefore, a favorable outcome.
