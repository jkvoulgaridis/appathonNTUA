  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MEDI4736
      (durvalumab) alone and in combination with either tremelimumab or AZD9150 in adult subjects
      with relapsed or refractory dIffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of MEDI4736
      (durvalumab) as monotherapy or in combination with either tremelimumab or AZD9150. The
      objectives are to describe any dose-limiting toxicities, determine the maximum tolerated
      dose, and evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of MEDI4736 as monotherapy or in combination with either tremelimumab or
      AZD9150 in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
