        <description>Molecular response used blood sample of the participants to evaluate response to treatment for CML. Based on the ELN 2013 definition: Molecular response used breakpoint cluster region/Abelson (BCR-ABL1) transcript measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR). Evaluation was expressed as percentage of ratio of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to ABL1 transcripts according to the international scale (IS) or the ratio of BCR/ABL1 transcripts to other internationally recognized control transcripts levels. MMR was defined as a BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 less than or equal to (&lt;=) 0.1% on the IS.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the duration between initiation of Bosutinib therapy and date of progression estimated by the treating physician or death of participant (all causes combined). Progression was defined as change from chronic phase of CML (CP-CML) to accelerated phase of CML (AP-CML) or to blast crisis of CML (BC-CML). CP-CML is frequently asymptomatic and diagnosed with &lt;10% blasts. Based on the ELN 2013 definition: AP-CML was defined by the presence of blast cells between 15-29% or blast cells plus promyelocytes &gt;30%, with blasts &lt;30% in blood or bone marrow, platelet count &lt;100*10^9 or clonal chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells. BC-CML was defined as blasts in blood or bone marrow &gt;=30%, extramedullary blast proliferation (excluding spleen), large foci or clusters of blasts in bone marrow biopsy. Participants who were alive at the date of last assessment were censored on the date of data collection.</description>
