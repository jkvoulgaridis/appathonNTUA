    <textblock>
      The investigators will use multiple methods (including Oxytocin intranasal inhalation,
      neuroimaging, behavioral measures, peripheral hormone measurements) to examine how
      individuals' behavior, cognition, and brain function is impacted by the neuro-hormone
      Oxytocin. Specifically, the investigators plan to evaluate the influence of Oxytocin
      administration on affective processing in non-trauma exposed and trauma-exposed adults (both
      with and without posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD).

      The investigators will use multiple methods (including Oxytocin intranasal inhalation,
      neuroimaging, behavioral measures, peripheral hormone measurements) to examine how
      individuals' behavior, cognition, and brain function is impacted by the neuro-hormone
      Oxytocin. Specifically, the investigators plan to evaluate the influence of Oxytocin
      administration on affective processing in non-trauma exposed and trauma-exposed adults (both
      with and without posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD). The investigators expect oxytocin
      (compared to placebo) to positively influence affect processing in healthy subjects, as well
      as among those diagnosed with PTSD. Given current literature, the investigators expect
      oxytocin to elevate the processing\perception of positive-related stimuli, and reduce the
      salience of aversive or un-pleasant cues. The investigators expect oxytocin to impact
      participants' brain function as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      while visually processing social and affect-related stimuli, rendering brain function and
      affective processing to be &quot;more typical&quot; or &quot;adaptive&quot; compared to placebo. Oxytocin's
      effect on human repertoire is not necessarily direct, but can interact with the individual's
      socioemotional characteristics, early life environment, and psychiatric symptoms. Therefore,
      the investigators will incorporate measures that capture the various dimensions that likely
      shape the effect of oxytocin.

    <time_frame>1 week; fMRI data collected at second and third visits, one week apart</time_frame>
    <description>Change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast signal in regions of interest relevant to fear/threat (e.g., decrease in amygdala activation) and reward processing (increase in ventral striatum activation) in oxytocin versus placebo sessions.
Forearm brush stroking targets C-tactile (CT) nerves, which respond to gentle touch and engage the insula and cortical brain regions that mediate social-emotional processing. Palm brush stroking is the control condition, in that CT afferents do not innervate the palm. We contrasted BOLD responses to gentle continuous brushing of the arm vs. palm (4 blocks of 8 trials each), expecting greater oxytocin-related increases in brain reactivity within the insula and other regions in the forearm condition versus the palm condition. The values are % signal change from baseline.</description>

        <title>fMRI Analysis: Change in Anterior Insula Region</title>
        <description>Change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast signal in regions of interest relevant to fear/threat (e.g., decrease in amygdala activation) and reward processing (increase in ventral striatum activation) in oxytocin versus placebo sessions.
Forearm brush stroking targets C-tactile (CT) nerves, which respond to gentle touch and engage the insula and cortical brain regions that mediate social-emotional processing. Palm brush stroking is the control condition, in that CT afferents do not innervate the palm. We contrasted BOLD responses to gentle continuous brushing of the arm vs. palm (4 blocks of 8 trials each), expecting greater oxytocin-related increases in brain reactivity within the insula and other regions in the forearm condition versus the palm condition. The values are % signal change from baseline.</description>

        <title>fMRI Analysis: Change in dACC Region</title>
        <description>Change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast signal in regions of interest relevant to fear/threat (e.g., decrease in amygdala activation) and reward processing (increase in ventral striatum activation) in oxytocin versus placebo sessions.
Forearm brush stroking targets C-tactile (CT) nerves, which respond to gentle touch and engage the insula and cortical brain regions that mediate social-emotional processing. Palm brush stroking is the control condition, in that CT afferents do not innervate the palm. We contrasted BOLD responses to gentle continuous brushing of the arm vs. palm (4 blocks of 8 trials each), expecting greater oxytocin-related increases in brain reactivity within the insula and other regions in the forearm condition versus the palm condition. The values are % signal change from baseline.</description>

        <title>fMRI Analysis: Change in vmPFC Region</title>
        <description>Change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast signal in regions of interest relevant to fear/threat (e.g., decrease in amygdala activation) and reward processing (increase in ventral striatum activation) in oxytocin versus placebo sessions.
Forearm brush stroking targets C-tactile (CT) nerves, which respond to gentle touch and engage the insula and cortical brain regions that mediate social-emotional processing. Palm brush stroking is the control condition, in that CT afferents do not innervate the palm. We contrasted BOLD responses to gentle continuous brushing of the arm vs. palm (4 blocks of 8 trials each), expecting greater oxytocin-related increases in brain reactivity within the insula and other regions in the forearm condition versus the palm condition. The values are % signal change from baseline.</description>

        <description>Expect within-session (30 min) increase in peripheral salivary oxytocin level during OT sessions (within-session), and higher OT levels in oxytocin administration vs. placebo sessions. Peripheral OT levels measured with Salivettes (sterile cotton participants will be asked to chew on for 1 minutes).</description>

However, despite best efforts, and assurances from the manufacturer, the assay performance remained unacceptable primarily in regards to inadequate sensitivity and significant variability in sample duplicates. Therefore, there are no results to report.</population>
