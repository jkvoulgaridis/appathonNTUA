  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the effectiveness of externally applied micro current electrical stimulation on
      improving the ETDRS visual acuity in subjects with vision loss from dry age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Micro-current electrical stimulation will be used to treat /each eye in a group of subjects
      with dry AMD. 60 subjects will be randomly divided into two groups. A ratio of 1:3 will be
      maintained between control and the experimental groups. In the treatment group, subjects will
      undergo a treatment session to the enrolled eyes daily for three days during week 1, followed
      by a single treatment session during weeks 2, 14 and 26 with the Nova Oculus device. A second
      group of subjects will act as the control group. This group will undergo sham treatment at
      the same treatment intervals with a non-functional Nova Oculus device. ETDRS visual acuity
      will be performed on all subjects at enrollment prior to each treatment and at four weeks
      from enrollment. The effect of treatments with the Nova Oculus device compared to sham
      treatment on the ETDRS visual acuity of subjects with dry AMD will be determined.

    <description>Patients will be fully consented before the start of the study. In the treatment group, subjects will undergo a treatment session to the enrolled eyes for three days during Week 1, followed by a single treatment session during Weeks 2, 14 and 26 with the Nova Oculus device. A treatment session is 15 minutes of treatment on each closed eye lid for a total of 30 minutes. ETDRS visual acuity will be performed on all subjects at enrollment (prior to the first treatment), prior to each treatment session, and at four weeks from enrollment. The effect of treatments with the Nova Oculus device compared to sham treatment on the visual acuity of subjects with dry AMD will be determined.e.</description>

    <description>A second group of subjects will act as the control group. This group will undergo sham treatment to the enrolled eyes at the same intervals as the treatment group (Weeks 2, 14 and 26), but with a nonfunctional Nova Oculus device.
