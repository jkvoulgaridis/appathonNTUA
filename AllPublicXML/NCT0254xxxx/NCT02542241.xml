  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine whether hypertonic saline solution is effective in the
      resuscitation of injured patients undergoing abdominal damage control surgery regarding early
      closure of the abdominal wall.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine the impact
      of an infusion of hypertonic saline 3% vs. isotonic saline 0.9% at a dose of 50 mL/hr for the
      first 72 hours in patients with abdominal trauma requiring damage control surgery regarding
      some clinically relevant outcomes. These outcomes were: The timing of abdominal cavity
      closure, fluids balance, abdominal hypertension, and abdominal compartment syndrome
      occurrence, organ dysfunction, and 28 days' mortality.
