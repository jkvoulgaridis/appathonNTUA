    <textblock>
      Financial ties with industry are common among doctors, academics and institutions. This trial
      aims to investigate the influence of different types of industry-linked activities on
      readers' perceptions of clinical reviews. Two clinical reviews have been selected on medical
      topics and study participants (practicing doctors) will be sent one review each. The reviews
      will be identical except for the inclusion of one of four different permutations of competing
      interest statements. Participants will be asked to rate the one review they are sent based on
      the study outcomes (confidence, interest, importance and likeliness to change practice). The
      study focus is on educational articles as these are intended to guide patient care and convey
      the authors' interpretation of selected data.
