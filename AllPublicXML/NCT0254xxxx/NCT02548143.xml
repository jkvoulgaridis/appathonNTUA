    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, PerSept 3, is to evaluate LR769 for the prevention of excessive
      bleeding and achievement of hemostasis in congenital hemophilia A or B patients who have
      inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX , are aged 6 months to 75 years, inclusive; and who
      are undergoing elective surgical or other invasive procedures. Administration of LR769 will
      be performed just prior to surgery/procedure and will be repeated during and after the
      surgery/procedure to achieve and maintain adequate hemostasis as determined by the
      investigator's judgment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 3 study. Patients aged 6
      months to 75 years, inclusive, who have congenital hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to
      Factor VIII or Factor IX and who are scheduled for an elective surgical or other invasive
      procedure will be enrolled. Both major and minor surgical or other invasive procedures are
      allowed in the study.

      Initial Treatment: Regardless of procedure, patients who meet all eligibility criteria will
      receive an initial intravenous (IV) bolus dose of LR769 within ≤2 minutes before the surgical
      incision or start of the invasive procedure. For a minor elective surgery or other minor
      invasive procedure, a dose of 75 μg/kg will be used as the initial dose; for a major elective
      surgery or other major invasive procedure, a dose of 200 μg/kg of LR769 will be used as the
      initial dose. For both minor and major procedures, administration will be repeated no more
      frequently than every 2 hours (±5 minutes) at a dose of 75 μg/kg during and after surgery or
      invasive procedure.

      Treatment for Major Surgical Procedures: The initial dose of LR769 will be followed by
      repeated administration of 75 µg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48
      hours after completion of the procedure. The minimum duration of LR769 treatment for major
      procedures will be 5 days and dosing frequency will be followed according to the guidelines
      specified in the protocol.

      Treatment for Minor Surgical or Other Invasive Procedures: The initial dose of LR769 will be
      followed by repeated administration of 75 µg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the
      first 48 hours. The minimum duration of LR769 infusion for minor procedures will be 2 days,
      except for certain procedures that may not require this duration of treatment to achieve
      hemostasis as noted in the protocol. Dosing frequency will be according to the guidelines
      specified in protocol for minor surgical or other invasive procedures.

          <title>Major Surgery (LR769 Initial Dose 200 μg/kg; Then 75 μg/kg)</title>
          <description>Major surgical procedures were those that usually required ≥5 days of factor replacement in hemophilia patients with inhibitors and typically involved entry into a body cavity and/or organ removal or similarly complex procedures.
A dose of 200 μg/kg of LR769 administered within ≤2 minutes of the onset of the procedure was used as the initial dose before the surgical incision or start of the invasive procedure. The initial dose was followed by repeated administration of 75 μg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48 hours after completion of the procedure. After 48 hours, dosing continued at 75 μg/kg of LR769 (not more frequently than every 2 hours) as follows:
Days 3-4: Intervals up to every 4 hours; Days 5-6: intervals up to every 6 hours; Days 7-10: Intervals up to every 8 hours; Days 11 to last administration of LR769: Intervals up to every 12 hours.</description>

          <description>Minor surgical or other invasive procedures were those that usually required &lt;5 days of factor replacement and usually involved the skin, mucous membranes, or superficial connective tissue. The minimum duration of LR769 infusion for minor procedures was 2 days. For less invasive procedures, the patient may have been treated for ≤48 hours if the investigator/designee determined a shorter duration was sufficient to achieve hemostasis.
A dose of 75 μg/kg of LR769 administered within ≤2 minutes of the onset of the procedure was used as the initial dose before the surgical incision or start of the invasive procedure. The initial dose was followed by repeated administration of 75 μg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48 hours. From Day 3, dosing could continue at 75 μg/kg of LR769 at intervals of up to every 24 hours, but not more frequently than every 2 hours.</description>

The initial dose was followed by repeated administration of 75 μg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48 hours after completion of the procedure. After 48 hours, dosing continued at 75 μg/kg of LR769 (not more frequently than every 2 hours) as follows:
Days 3-4: Intervals up to every 4 hours; Days 5-6: intervals up to every 6 hours; Days 7-10: Intervals up to every 8 hours; Days 11 to last administration of LR769: Intervals up to every 12 hours.</description>

          <title>Minor Surgery (LR769 Initial Dose 75 μg/kg; Then 75 μg/kg)</title>
          <description>Minor surgical or other invasive procedures were those that usually required &lt;5 days of factor replacement and usually involved the skin, mucous membranes, or superficial connective tissue. The minimum duration of LR769 infusion for minor procedures was 2 days. For less invasive procedures, the patient may have been treated for ≤48 hours if the investigator/designee determined a shorter duration was sufficient to achieve hemostasis.
A dose of 75 μg/kg of LR769 administered within ≤2 minutes of the onset of the procedure was used as the initial dose before the surgical incision or start of the invasive procedure. The initial dose was followed by repeated administration of 75 μg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48 hours. From Day 3, dosing could continue at 75 μg/kg of LR769 at intervals of up to every 24 hours, but not more frequently than every 2 hours.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Surgical or Other Invasive Procedures Defined as &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Excellent&quot; Response to LR769 Treatment as Assessed by the Investigator, Based on the Totality of the Assessments Performed on the Patient</title>
        <description>The final assessment was performed by the investigator at the study center 48 hours after the last dose of LR769 and was based upon the totality of the assessments performed on the patient at each time point. Excellent: postoperative blood loss similar to or less than expected following this type of procedure in a patient who does not have a bleeding disorder and who is undergoing the same surgical or other invasive procedure; no blood component transfusion is required.

            <description>Major surgical procedures were those that usually required ≥5 days of factor replacement in hemophilia patients with inhibitors and typically involved entry into a body cavity and/or organ removal or similarly complex procedures.
A dose of 200 μg/kg of LR769 administered within ≤2 minutes of the onset of the procedure was used as the initial dose before the surgical incision or start of the invasive procedure. The initial dose was followed by repeated administration of 75 μg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48 hours after completion of the procedure. After 48 hours, dosing continued at 75 μg/kg of LR769 (not more frequently than every 2 hours) as follows:
Days 3-4: Intervals up to every 4 hours; Days 5-6: intervals up to every 6 hours; Days 7-10: Intervals up to every 8 hours; Days 11 to last administration of LR769: Intervals up to every 12 hours.</description>
