  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Rabipur vaccine is indicated for active immunization
      against rabies in individuals of all ages. This includes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in
      both primary series and booster dose, and post exposure prophylaxis.The aim of this extension
      study is to evaluate the long-term (up to approx.10 years) persistence and to assess the
      boostability of immune responses in subjects who received a primary series of accelerated or
      conventional rabies PrEP IM regimen No new subjects were enrolled in this study.

      The protocol was amended to clarify:

        -  Timeframe between each yearly scheduled visit,

        -  Number of additional booster doses a subject may receive depending on the RVNA level
           reached,

        -  Premature withdrawal from the study

        -  Exclusion criteria on scheduled visits

        -  That only SAEs experienced by subjects who received the booster must be reported

        -  Rewording of the protocol.

    <description>An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in one or more of the following:
Death
Is life-threatening
Requires or prolonged hospitalization.
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/or birth defect.
An important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or resulting in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.
Safety is assessed as the number of subjects reporting SAEs after a booster dose of PCEC rabies vaccine following a primary series of accelerated or conventional rabies PrEP (pre-exposure) IM (intramuscular) regimen in the parent study V49_23.</description>

             Accelerated Rabies and JE vaccination or to Conventional Rabies groups during the
             parent study, who received the full PrEP regimen and completed the trial following
             V49_23 study protocol.

          2. Individuals who have voluntarily given written informed consent after the nature of
