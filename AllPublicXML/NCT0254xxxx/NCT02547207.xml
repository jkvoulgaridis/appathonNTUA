      The purpose of this study is to characterize left ventricular acute hemodynamic and
      electrical responses during cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with different Multipoint
      Pacing (MPP) settings, and assess the relationship between electrical activation patterns and
      hemodynamic measurements during these pacing settings.
