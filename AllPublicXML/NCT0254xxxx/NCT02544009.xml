      Background:

      Many people regain the weight they lose through diet and exercise. This might happen because
      the weight loss slows their metabolism. This slowing is called metabolic adaptation. It may
      cause people to regain weight if they do not keep up high levels of exercise or major caloric
      restrictions. Researchers want to find the long-term effects of metabolic adaptation in the
      previous Biggest Loser study participants. They hope to learn the body s response to
      lifestyle changes that result in weight loss. They also want to see if certain changes can
      lead to longer-term success in maintaining weight loss.

      Objectives:

      To better understand the long-term metabolic changes caused by rapid weight loss achieved
      through diet restriction and vigorous physical activity.

      Eligibility:

      Former Biggest Loser research study participants (Protocol No. PBRC29008).

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a phone interview.

      This study has 3 phases.

      Phase 1 will last at least 3 weeks. Participants will receive a physical activity monitor and
      wireless scale. These will send their daily weight and activity back to NIH.

      In Phase 2, participants will stay at NIH for 3 days. Their metabolism will be measured
      through:

      Their activity monitor

      Urine samples and daily body weight

      Medical review and physical exam

      Fasting for 12 hours each night for a blood draw the following morning

      DEXA: a low-dose x-ray of the body

      BIS: Electrodes on the hand/wrist and foot/ankle measure body water content.

      Phase 3 will last at least 3 weeks. Participants will:

      Continue to monitor their daily weight and activity

      Collect urine samples and send them back to NIH

    <textblock>
      Weight loss is accompanied by a slowing of metabolic rate. Metabolic slowing often occurs to
      a degree greater than predicted by the amount of weight lost, a phenomenon called metabolic
      adaptation , and is hypothesized to persist over time and promote weight regain. We
      previously discovered large metabolic adaptations in response to the intensive lifestyle
      intervention as part of The Biggest Loser weight loss competition. Those subjects rapidly
      lost massive amounts of weight and their resting energy expenditure decreased by ~500 kcal/d
      more than was expected based on their body composition at the end of the intervention. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether the metabolic adaptation has persisted in the
      years following the intervention in the same subjects. Furthermore, we will measure body
      weight and composition in these subjects and investigate the correlates of weight regain.

        This natural history study includes enrollment of 16 adult subjects who previously
        participated in the Biggest Loser intervention and participated in a study of body
        composition and metabolic changes [1]. Several years following weight loss intervention,
        these subjects may have experienced weight regain and either persistence or remission of
        the previously observed metabolic adaptation. The present study was designed to investigate
        the persistence of metabolic adaptation and explore whether the degree of metabolic
        adaptation during the weight loss intervention was correlated with body weight and body fat
        regain.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  16 subjects who previously participated in the Biggest Loser study (Pennington
             Biomedical Research Center protocol no. PBRC29008).

          -  Written informed consent

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Volunteers unwilling or unable to give informed consent.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding cannot participate in the study. A pregnancy
             test will be performed during the first day of the inpatient visit. If the pregnancy
             test is positive, the subject cannot continue to participate in the study.

          -  Subjects with implantable cardio-defibrillator or pacemaker may not participate in the
             bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) testing portion of the study.
