      Development and Clinical Evaluation of the Stemina Metabolic Biomarker-Based Test to Diagnose
      Autism Spectrum Disorder in Early Childhood.

      The purpose of this study is to identify metabolitic signatures in blood plasma and/or urine
      using a panel of biomarker metabolites that differentiate children with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) from children with delayed development (DD) and/or typical development (TD),
      to develop an algorithm that maximizes sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker profile,
      and to evaluate the overall algorithm as a diagnostic tool.

      A secondary objective is to define metabolites capable of classifying subtypes of ASD that
      may increase understanding of the metabolic basis of the condition, as well as inform on
      personalized therapy.

      The population targeted for this study includes children aged 18 months to 48 months,
      diagnosed with ASD or DD using behavioral criteria, and TD children, identified as having no
      indications of ASD or DD using behavioral criteria. The original target size for the study
      was 1500 subjects divided equally between the three groups. The targeted male:female ratio is
      4:1 in all three groups. During the study, it was determined that biomarkers capable of
      identifying ASD subjects could be obtained using a total of 1100 subjects divided with 58%
      ASD, 25%TD, and 17% DD. If the diagnostic biomarkers identified in the study do not perform
      well in females during the biomarker discovery phase, the study may be expanded to recruit
      more females to examine the possibility of a female-specific diagnostic test.

      Subjects will be qualified for entry into the study and will be invited to participate. On
      the first study day, subjects' parents will sign an informed consent form and will be asked
      questions on the mother's pregnancy and of both parents' medical history. A complete medical
      history, a physical examination, and information needed to obtain a diagnosis of ASD, DD, or
      TD will be obtained on the study subject. If possible, a urine sample will be collected
      during the visit. Up to four tubes of blood (&lt;25 mLs total) will be drawn at the clinic
      during the visit or within 14 days following this initial visit. An overnight fast is
      required prior to the visit where blood will be taken from the subject. A subset of the
      subjects will be asked to return to the clinic 30-60 days later to obtain a replicate
      metabolic profile.

      The study will be divided into a biomarker discovery/method development phase followed by a
      validation phase of the analytical methods and algorithm that will be used in the clinical
      test.

      The subjects will be randomized and divided equally between a discovery/training set and a
      validation set. The training set will be used for discovery of the biomarkers and development
      of the analytical methods intended for the diagnostic test. The validation sample set will be
      used to evaluate performance of the final clinical methods and algorithms.

      Consent will also be sought from all subjects for follow-up contact up to 5 years following
      enrollment of the last subject enrolled to determine the accuracy of the original behavioral
      diagnosis over time. Subjects chosen for follow-up will be identified based on the strength
      of the diagnosis from the behavioral scores and physician assessments as well as the
      biomarker profiles observed in individuals.

    <description>Study participants were randomized into two independent groups: a biomarker discovery/method development (training set) and a validation set. The validation set is used to assess the performance of the biomarkers identified in the training set once the analytical methods and algorithms are developed using the training set. These biomarkers and algorithms will be used in the clinical diagnostic tests. Using this approach and CLIA validated assays, two diagnostic panels are now able to correctly identify metabolic signatures in 53% of the ASD population in the CAMP study with a specificity of 91% when tested against the validation set of subject samples.</description>

    <description>Using the training set or the validation subject set described in the primary aim, the study will seek to identify additional biomarkers such that &gt;75% of the ASD population can be correctly identified with the same high specificity of &gt;90%. In addition, the study will attempt to link the new biomarkers to important metabolic pathways associated with ASD to give insight into the underlying pathophysiologies of the disorder.</description>

      Blood plasma for metabolite analysis and blood samples for DNA and RNA expression analysis
      will be collected from all children as part of the study protocol. Genetic analysis of
      samples will be performed only on subjects that have consented to allow this evaluation. In
      addition, a urine sample for metabolite analysis will also be obtained from children capable
      of providing the sample while at the clinical site.

        Subjects will be identified as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmentally delayed
        (DD) subjects by standard behavioral techniques; Typically developing (TD) subjects will be
        recruited from the communities in which the autism research centers are situated. The
        ADOS-2 (research reliable), the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), as well as an
        evaluation based on the DSM-V checklist will be administered to each subject enrolled in
        the study suspected to have a developmental delay or autism. Typically developing children
        enrolled in the study will be given an MSEL and a Social Communications Questionnaire (SCQ)
        evaluation to document that they are neither ASD nor DD subjects.
