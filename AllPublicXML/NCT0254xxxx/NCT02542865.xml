    <measure>Frequency of GI and Respiratory Illnesses at Month 9</measure>
    <time_frame>At month 9</time_frame>
    <description>Number of episodes of GI and respiratory illnesses was calculated at month 9 using a diagnosis form (DF) which were used to note the diagnosis, severity, and school absenteeism due to GI and respiratory illnesses only, as defined in the study protocol. The DF captured the start and end date of all occurrences of GI and respiratory illnesses in the week. The frequency was calculated as total number of GI and respiratory illness episodes, divided by duration of intervention, where each episode is defined as each incidence of illness followed by at least uninterrupted 3 symptom free days. Therefore, the formula for calculation used was: frequency (per month) = number of episodes multiply (x) 30 and divided by (/) number of days between first and last visit.</description>

        <title>Frequency of GI and Respiratory Illnesses at Month 9</title>
        <description>Number of episodes of GI and respiratory illnesses was calculated at month 9 using a diagnosis form (DF) which were used to note the diagnosis, severity, and school absenteeism due to GI and respiratory illnesses only, as defined in the study protocol. The DF captured the start and end date of all occurrences of GI and respiratory illnesses in the week. The frequency was calculated as total number of GI and respiratory illness episodes, divided by duration of intervention, where each episode is defined as each incidence of illness followed by at least uninterrupted 3 symptom free days. Therefore, the formula for calculation used was: frequency (per month) = number of episodes multiply (x) 30 and divided by (/) number of days between first and last visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Gut Integrity/ Health Measured by Urine Lactulose: Mannitol Test at Month 9</title>
        <description>Improvement in gut wall integrity was considered a possible factor to assess the micronutrient absorption. Lactulose mannitol test was used to evaluate change in gut wall permeability status to assess impact on micronutrient absorption. After 3h of fasting, pre-measured amount of lactulose/mannitol solution (2 milliliter/Kilogram [mL/Kg] of body weight) containing lactulose (250 milligram/milliliter [mg/mL])] and mannitol (50 mg/mL) was administered as a test solution. Participants were allowed to return to their regular diet 30 minutes after ingestion of the test solution. During the 2.5 h time, participants were offered liquids frequently in order to permit collection of an adequate volume of urine. After 2.5 h, urine collection was performed. All urine passed over duration of 2.5 h was collected and analysed. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) test method was used to measure the levels. The normal range of urinary lactulose: mannitol is less than [&lt;] 0.035.</description>

        <description>Quantity of salivary IgA was used to measure the impact of fortified malt based food on mucosal immunity. Saliva was collected using saliva collection aid (SCA). Ribbed-end of the SCA were securely placed into a pre-labeled collection vial. Participants were instructed to pool the saliva in mouth. SCA was placed on mouth entry. Then, participants were asked to tilt the head forward, and gently force saliva through the SCA into the vial to fill with at least 50 microliters (mcL) of volume. A small amount of air space was reserved in the vial to accommodate liquid expansion during freezing. After collection of sample, SCA was removed and discarded and cap was attached to collection vial and tightened. ELISA test method was used to detect the salivary IgA levels. The normal range of salivary IgA is 25.00-168.00 milligrams per liter (mg/L).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Levels of Micronutrient Vitamin A and Trace Elements Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) and Iron (Fe) at Month 9</title>
        <description>Quantity of micronutrients, serum vitamin-A and of trace elements Zn, Cu and Fe levels in serum were used to assess the impact of fortified malt based food product on nutrient biochemistry at month 9. To quantitate the nutrient biochemistry, a total volume of approximately 14 milliliters (ml), 7ml each at screening and at month 9, whole blood sample was collected from each participant after application of an anesthetic patch/ointment. The test methods used were ELISA for vitamin-A and colorimetric assays for Zn, Cu and Fe as 5-Br-PAPS; 3,5-Dibromo-PAES and TPTZ, respectively. The normal range of serum Vitamin-A is 26.00-49.00 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) and serum Zn is 78.00-105.00 (male and females aged 7-9 years), 78.00- 118.00 (females aged 10 years) and 78.00-98.00 (males aged 10 years) mcg/dL. The normal range of serum Cu is 51.00-121.00 mcg/dL and serum Fe is 50.00-120.00 mcg/dL.</description>

        <description>Quantity of serum vitamin-D (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) and serum folate micronutrients were used to assess the impact of fortified malt based food product on nutrient biochemistry at month 9. To quantitate the nutrient biochemistry, a total volume of approximately 14 milliliters (ml), 7ml each at screening and at month 9, whole blood sample was collected from each participant after application of an anesthetic patch/ointment. The test method ELISA was used to measure the levels. The normal range of serum Vitamin-D is 30.00-100.00 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) and serum folate is 5.00-21.00 ng/mL.</description>

        <description>Quantitative analysis of sTfR along with serum iron and serum ferritin was studied to measure iron status. In cases of a high prevalence of infection and inflammation, sTfR becomes the choice of iron status marker. To quantitate this load, a total volume of approximately 14 milliliters (ml), 7ml each at screening and at month 9, whole blood sample was collected from each participant after application of an anesthetic patch/ointment. The immunoturbidimetry test method was used to measure the levels. The normal range of sTfR is 1.90-4.40 milligrams per liter (mg/L).</description>

        <description>Quantity of dietary intake was also measured by energy intake which was assessed from 24-h dietary recall survey. A structured interview was conducted based on a questionnaire. Parent/LARs (legally appropriate representative) provided the majority of information, with the child making additions to fill in the gaps. Parents/LARs recalled all food and beverage consumed by the child during previous 24-h and information such as list and amount of ingredients, cooking method and portion size was recorded. Calculation on energy, protein, carbohydrates and fat were made using Dietsoft software based on Indian data (NIN and ICMR) was used.</description>
