      In child welfare services, structured behavioral parenting programs have been documented to
      reduce important child-welfare outcomes, including child maltreatment recidivism.1-3 In this
      study, we attempt to learn which factors impacted implementation of an evidence-based
      practice (EBP) in a diversity of child-welfare serving sites and systems. The primary aim of
      this study was to identify and assess barriers and facilitators of implementation of a
      structured behavioral parenting program (SC). We utilized a qualitative research strategy
      that included semi-structured interviews and focus groups with several levels of staff
      responsible for implementing the model: program administrators, supervisors, and frontline
      staff (providers). Our second aim was to understand parent and provider reactions to SafeCare
      (SC) services and Supportive Case Management (SCM), especially parents' perceptions related
      to trajectory of burden, engagement, satisfaction, and perceived impact across intervention
      receipt. We employed mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative data collection) to
      inform this question. Specifically, we (1) conducted qualitative interviews with families at
      two time points during the course of service, (2) collected session-by-session ratings from
      families on service reaction (perceived burden satisfaction, perceived effectiveness) and
      providers on family engagement, and (3) collected organizational environment surveys from
      providers at two time points. The final aim of this study wass to examine the short-term
      impact of SC versus SCM on client-centered outcomes. Quantitative surveys collected in the
      family's home at the beginning and end of services measured parenting variables, parent
      mental health and well-being, and child behavioral, social, and emotional well-being.

      The study design was a cluster randomized trial, with randomization occurring at the team
      level within each study site. We randomized providers within each site to be trained in
      SafeCare (n = 96) or to continue to deliver SCM (n = 96) which allowed us to control for site
      differences. From a statistical power perspective, it would have been preferable to randomize
      clients to interventions, but the fact that teams at community-based organizations typically
      served a defined geographic area would have meant that home visitors within each team would
      have had to deliver two distinct interventions raising the likelihood of cross-contamination
      which, in our experience, would have not been well managed by the study. Providers that were
      randomized were invited to participate in the study by completing a survey at baseline and
      1-year follow-up which included measures of demographics, work experience, organizational
      factors (culture, climate, leadership) and individual attitudes and beliefs that may affect
      implementation and service quality. We recruited caregivers into the research study that were
      receiving services from randomized providers. Measurement of client-level outcomes were
      collected at baseline and 6-month follow up, as well as during service provision. Both
      quantitative and qualitative data were collected to capture both breadth and depth of family
      outcomes and experiences of the interventions.74 By focusing on measures of well-being, this
      study holds potential to expand the way in which the program effectiveness is conceptualized.
      This could be particularly important for dissemination of parenting programs to at-risk
      parents, who may be interested in different outcomes (e.g., improving their child's behavior)
      than child welfare systems, and findings may be useful for making interventions more
      appealing to consumers. To measure barriers and facilitators to implementing an
      evidence-based practice (EBP), we used a qualitative research strategy that included
      semi-structured interviews and focus groups with several levels of staff, responsible for
      implementing the model: program administrators, supervisors, and frontline staff (providers).
      This strategy would yield insight into an array of stakeholder perspectives concerning
      implementation. In contrast to most implementation studies, ours is the first to conduct a
      complementary set of interviews and focus groups with staff who have not been trained in SC,
      the SCM providers.

    <measure>Parenting Young Children Scale-Supporting Positive Behavior Sub-scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (follow-up).</time_frame>
    <description>The Supporting Positive Behavior sub-scale of the Parenting Young Children Scale is made up of 7 items that assess supporting positive behavior (Example question: &quot;Notice and praise your child's good behavior&quot;). This subscale score is generated by calculating a mean of seven items on a 7-point scale (1=Not at all - 7=Almost Always). Theoretical range of means: 1-7; Actual range of means: 1-7. Higher scores represent higher degree of positive parenting skills. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring 6 or below were rated as low (n=125) and participants rating higher than 6 were rated as high (n=159).</description>

    <description>The Family Resources Scale - Revised is a 40-item scale that assesses the adequacy of family needs in four domains: basic needs, money, time for self, and time for family. (Example question: &quot;How well is the following need being met: House or apartment&quot;). A total count of resources needed out of 40 assessed. Resources were considered needed if the participant indicated the resource was 'Not at all' met, 'A little' met, or 'Sometimes' met (5-point scale: 1=Not at all - 5=Almost always). Theoretical range of means: 0-40; Actual range of means: 0-40. Higher ratings indicating a higher number of resources needed. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants with 9 or fewer needs not met were rated as low (n=152) and participants with 10 and higher needs not met were rated as high (n=132).</description>

        <title>Parenting Young Children Scale-Supporting Positive Behavior Sub-scale</title>
        <description>The Supporting Positive Behavior sub-scale of the Parenting Young Children Scale is made up of 7 items that assess supporting positive behavior (Example question: &quot;Notice and praise your child's good behavior&quot;). This subscale score is generated by calculating a mean of seven items on a 7-point scale (1=Not at all - 7=Almost Always). Theoretical range of means: 1-7; Actual range of means: 1-7. Higher scores represent higher degree of positive parenting skills. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring 6 or below were rated as low (n=125) and participants rating higher than 6 were rated as high (n=159).</description>
        <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (follow-up).</time_frame>
        <population>Data for four surveys were corrupted causing the Row population to differ from the Overall population. In addition, Some participants missed or refused to answer questions.</population>

Specifically, participants scoring 6.3 or below were rated as low (n=141) and participants rating higher than 6.3 were rated as high (n=143).</description>

        <title>Parenting Stress Inventory - Short Form</title>
        <description>Parenting Stress Inventory - short form is a 36-item scale designed to measure stressors in parenthood including parental distress, dysfunctional interactions, and stressors related to having a difficult child. (Example question: &quot;Sometimes I feel like my child doesn't like me and doesn't want to be close to me&quot;). A total score generated by summing all 36 items on a 5-point scale (1=Strongly Agree - 5=Strongly Disagree). Theoretical total range: 36-180; Actual total range: 38-146. Lower scores represent more stress/dysfunction. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring 71 or below were rated as low (n=136) and participants rating higher than 71 were rated as high (n=148).</description>
        <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (follow-up).</time_frame>

Specifically, participants scoring below 6 were rated as low (n=146) and participants rating 6 and higher were rated as high (n=133).</description>

(Example question: &quot;How much were you distressed by nervousness or shakiness inside&quot;). The Global Severity Index calculated a mean of all of the BSI subscales which includes 53 items on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all—4=Extremely). Theoretical range of means: 0-4; Actual range of means: 0.0-3.5). Higher scores indicate higher existence of symptoms. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, females scoring below .77 and males scoring below .57 were rated as low (n=197) and females rating .78 and higher and males rating .58 and higher were rated as high (n=87).</description>

        <title>Devereaux Early Child Assessment-Initiative Sub-scale</title>
        <description>The Initiative sub-scale of the Devereaux Early Child Assessment (DECA) is made up of 11-18 items (depending on child's age) that assesses the child's initiative behavior. (Example question: &quot;Did the child do things for himself&quot;). This subscale score generates a t-score of standardized norms from a sum of the 11-18 items on a 5-point scale (0=Never - 4=Very frequently). Theoretical range of means: 28-72; Actual range of means: 28-72. Higher ratings represent a higher degree of child initiation. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring below 56 were rated as low (n=110) and participants rating 56 and higher were rated as high (n=118).</description>
        <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (Follow-up).</time_frame>
        <population>Data for four surveys were corrupted causing the Row population to differ from the Overall population. In addition, Some participants missed or refused to answer questions. Lastly, errors in survey branching based on child's age required discarding those responses which reduced the total number of participants analyzed.</population>

This subscale score generates a t-score of standardized norms from a sum of the 11-18 items on a 5-point scale (0=Never - 4=Very frequently). Theoretical range of means: 28-72; Actual range of means: 28-72. Higher ratings represent a higher degree of child initiation. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring below 56 were rated as low (n=110) and participants rating 56 and higher were rated as high (n=118).</description>
          <population>Data for four surveys were corrupted causing the Row population to differ from the Overall population. In addition, Some participants missed or refused to answer questions. Lastly, errors in survey branching based on child's age required discarding those responses which reduced the total number of participants analyzed.</population>

        <title>Mother-Child Neglect Scale (MCNS)</title>
        <description>The Mother-Child Neglect Scale (MCNS) is a 22-item scale designed to assess caregiving behaviors in four domains: physical, cognitive, supervision, and emotional needs. (Example question: &quot;I make sure my child sees a doctor when he/she needs one&quot;). A total score generated by calculating a mean of the 22 items rated on a 4-point scale (1=Strongly Agree - 4=Strongly Disagree). Theoretical range of means: 1-4; Actual range of means: 1.2-3.9. Lower scores indicate less neglectful behaviors. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring 3.65 and below were rated as low (n=139) and participants rating higher than 3.65 were rated as high (n=145).</description>
        <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (Follow-up).</time_frame>

        <description>The CHAOS scale (Confusion, Hubbub, and Order) is a 15-item scale used to measure structure and chaos in the home environment.

        <title>Family Resources Scale - Revised</title>
        <description>The Family Resources Scale - Revised is a 40-item scale that assesses the adequacy of family needs in four domains: basic needs, money, time for self, and time for family. (Example question: &quot;How well is the following need being met: House or apartment&quot;). A total count of resources needed out of 40 assessed. Resources were considered needed if the participant indicated the resource was 'Not at all' met, 'A little' met, or 'Sometimes' met (5-point scale: 1=Not at all - 5=Almost always). Theoretical range of means: 0-40; Actual range of means: 0-40. Higher ratings indicating a higher number of resources needed. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants with 9 or fewer needs not met were rated as low (n=152) and participants with 10 and higher needs not met were rated as high (n=132).</description>
        <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (Follow-up).</time_frame>

          <title>Family Resources Scale - Revised</title>
          <description>The Family Resources Scale - Revised is a 40-item scale that assesses the adequacy of family needs in four domains: basic needs, money, time for self, and time for family. (Example question: &quot;How well is the following need being met: House or apartment&quot;). A total count of resources needed out of 40 assessed. Resources were considered needed if the participant indicated the resource was 'Not at all' met, 'A little' met, or 'Sometimes' met (5-point scale: 1=Not at all - 5=Almost always). Theoretical range of means: 0-40; Actual range of means: 0-40. Higher ratings indicating a higher number of resources needed. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants with 9 or fewer needs not met were rated as low (n=152) and participants with 10 and higher needs not met were rated as high (n=132).</description>

        <title>Devereaux Early Child Assessment-Attachment Sub-scale</title>
        <description>The Attachment sub-scale of the Devereaux Early Child Assessment (DECA) is made up of 8-18 items (depending on child's age) that assesses the child's attachment behavior. (Example question: &quot;Did the toddler accept comfort from a familiar adult&quot;). This subscale score generates a t-score of standardized norms from a sum of the 8-18 items on a 5-point scale (0=Never - 4=Very frequently). Theoretical range of means: 28-72; Actual range of means: 28-72. Higher ratings represent a higher degree of child attachment. Because the data were heavily skewed toward the positive end of the scale, the measure was dichotomized into high vs. low based on an approximate median split. Specifically, participants scoring below 52 were rated as low (n=101) and participants rating 52 and higher were rated as high (n=138).</description>
        <time_frame>Families were assessed at two time points: 1) after being invited into the study during a visit with their provider (Baseline) and, 2) approximately 6-months later (Follow-up).</time_frame>
        <population>Data for four surveys were corrupted causing the Row population to differ from the Overall population. In addition, Some participants missed or refused to answer questions. Lastly, errors in survey branching based on child's age required discarding those responses which reduced the total number of participants analyzed.</population>
