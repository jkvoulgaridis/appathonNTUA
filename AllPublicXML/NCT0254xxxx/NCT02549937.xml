      Primary Objective Dose Escalation:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of surufatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors
      and to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

      Primary Objective Dose Expansion:

      To evaluate the anticancer activity of surufatinib in patients with advanced Biliary Tract
      Cancer (BTC), patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), patients with
      locally advanced, unresectable, metastatic extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (EP-NETs),
      and patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STS) treated at a dose of 300 mg QD.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple dose surufatinib in patients with
      advanced solid tumors and to evaluate the anti cancer activity of surufatinib in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, dose escalation and expansion clinical trial of surufatinib
      orally once daily (QD) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The study consists of two phases:

      Dose escalation phase - A 3+3 design will be used for this portion of the study.

        -  Approximately 15 to 35 evaluable patients will be enrolled. The actual number of
           patients depends on the Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) situation as well as the RP2D dose
           level reached in this trial.

        -  The trial will approximately evaluate five surufatinib dose levels at 50,100, 200, 300
           and 400 mg/day.

      Expansion phase:

      Approximately 105 patients will be enrolled into one of four open-label treatment arms during
      this phase: at least 30 patients with advanced BTC that has progressed on standard ﬁrst-line
      chemotherapy will be assigned to Arm A, at least 15 patients with advanced pNET that has
      progressed on either everolimus, sunitinib, or both will be assigned to Arm B, at least 15
      patients with advanced EP-NET that has progressed on everolimus will be assigned to Arm C,
      and at least 45 patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma will be assigned to Arm D. Subjects
      enrolled in this phase are to be evaluated for the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) characteristics to confirm the selected surufatinib dose.

      Subjects will receive surufatinib daily treatment continuously with every 28-day treatment
      cycle until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity at the investigator's
      discretion for a favorable benefit to risk balance.
