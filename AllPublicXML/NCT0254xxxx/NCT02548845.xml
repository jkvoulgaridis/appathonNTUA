    <textblock>
      In 2014, the Spanish Sociedad Española de Oncología Médica (SEOM) algorithm for the treatment
      of hyponatraemia secondary to to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in
      oncology patients was developed. Since it is hypothesised that the adherence to the SEOM
      algorithm is not 100%, the current retrospective non-interventional study will investigate
      the perceived and actual adherence of participating centres to the SEOM algorithm and its
      impact on patient outcomes

        <description>Improvement is defined as a change in the baseline sodium level category (mild, moderate or severe) from a worse category to a better category or eunatraemia. Note that the time to improvement of sodium levels was defined as the first date/time of improvement of sodium levels - date/time of collection of serum sodium levels at baseline (for patients where there was an improvement in sodium levels) or as the final date/time of collection of serum sodium levels - date/time of collection of serum sodium levels at baseline (for patients that did not achieve an improvement in sodium levels [censored patients]).</description>
