      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of transcutaneous electric acupoint
      stimulation(TEAS) at single acupoint or dual acupoints on opioid consumption and
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing radical mastectomy

    <masking_description>For all patients, electrodes were placed at the bilateral PC6 and RN17 and connected to the Hwato Electric Acupuncture Treatment Instrument. No patients in the study had previous experience of undergoing transcutaneous electrical stimulation treatment. Patients were told that they might or might not feel the electrical stimulation. Interventions were performed by a designated investigator who was not involved in the anaesthesia or the follow-up. The stimulator was placed in an opaque box to blind the surgical team and the anaesthetists to the group allocation.</masking_description>
