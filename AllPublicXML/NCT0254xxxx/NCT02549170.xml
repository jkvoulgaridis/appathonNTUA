  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, prospective, multicenter study with two study parts (epochs) to evaluate
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of HYQVIA/HyQvia (IGI, 10% with recombinant human
      hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) administered subcutaneously) for maintenance therapy to prevent
      relapse (Epoch 1) and GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG (immunoglobulin G intravenous (IGIV) 10%
      administered intravenously) for the treatment of CIDP (Epoch 2). This study will enroll adult
      subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CIDP and who have remained on a stable dosing regimen
      (monthly equivalent dose of 0.4 to 2.4 g/kg body weight (BW) with a dosing interval of 2 to 6
      weeks) of IGIV therapy for at least 3 months prior to screening. In this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled phase of the study (Epoch 1), eligible subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either HYQVIA/HyQvia or 0.25% albumin placebo solution with rHuPH20
      every two, three, or four weeks in a double-blind fashion for a period of 6 months or until
      relapse. Subjects who relapse during Epoch 1 will enter Epoch 2 to receive IGIV treatment for
      a period of 6 months.

    <description>Relapse rate is defined as proportion of participants who experience a worsening of functional disability. Worsening of functional disability defined as an increase of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)1 point relative to the pre- subcutaneous (SC) treatment baseline score in 2 consecutive adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score. The INCAT disability score is an effective and responsive tool to assess clinical response to treatment in CIDP. The disability score ranges from 0 to 10 points, where 0 is normal (eg, no upper limb problems and walking not affected) and 10 is severely incapacitated (eg, inability to move either arm for any purposeful movement and restricted to wheelchair, unable to stand and walk a few steps with help).</description>

    <time_frame>Throughout Epoch 1, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participant administered an Investigational Product (IP) that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (eg, rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causally related to the IP. A SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the following criteria: outcome is fatal/results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a medically important event, thromboembolic events, hemolytic anemia. A nonserious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participant administered an Investigational Product (IP) that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (eg, rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causally related to the IP. A SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the following criteria: outcome is fatal/results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a medically important event, thromboembolic events, hemolytic anemia. A nonserious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria.</description>
