  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CINRYZE administered with
      plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or immune adsorption treatments and sucrose-free
      immunoglobulin (IVIg) for the treatment of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of renal
      allograft in kidney transplant recipients as measured by the proportion of participants with
      new or worsening transplant glomerulopathy (TG) at 6 months after treatment initiation.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With New or Worsening Transplant Glomerulopathy (TG) at Month 6 Post-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>New or worsening TG at month 6 by the standard score was defined as an increase in one or more between qualifying biopsy and 6-month biopsy. New or worsening TG was measured by Banff 2013 criteria (standard score) using allograft glomerulopathy (Cg0-Cg3): Cg0- No GBM double contours by light microscopy (LM) or electron microscopy (EM); Cg1- no GBM double contours by LM but GBM double contours in at least 3 glomerular capillaries by EM; Cg2- Double contours affecting 26 to 50% of peripheral capillary loops in the most affected of nonsclerotic glomeruli; Cg3- Double contours affecting more than 50% of peripheral capillary loops in the most affected of nonsclerotic glomeruli with a score range of 0 (no allograft glomerulopathy) and 3 (severe glomerulopathy). Percentage of participants with new or worsening TG at Month 6 post-treatment was reported.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 and less than or equal to (&lt;=) 70 years of age.

          2. Weigh &gt;= 45 kg with a body mass index (BMI) less than (&lt;) 35 kilogram (kg)/meter (m)^2
             at screening.

          3. Have human leukocyte antigen (HLA) donor-specific antibody (DSA) identified at the
             time of diagnosis of AMR. If it is anticipated that the local DSA results will not be
             available within the screening period, previously obtained local DSA results can be
             used to assess eligibility, if obtained after kidney transplant and within 30 days
             prior to the qualifying AMR episode. In any instance, a local DSA test should still be
             performed at the time of AMR diagnosis.

          4. Have a first qualifying episode of AMR in the participant's current renal allograft
             between 72 hours (h) and 12 months after transplant defined by a renal allograft
             biopsy demonstrating neutrophil and/or monocyte infiltration in the peritubular
             capillaries (PTC) and/or glomeruli with or without evidence of 4th complement protein
             degradation product (C4d) deposition by immunohistopathology according to 2013 Banff
             criteria.

          5. Have achieved adequate renal function defined as: Pre-AMR baseline estimated
             glomerular filtration rate calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
             (eGFRMDRD) &gt;=20 millilitre (mL)/minute (min) /1.73m^2 for a qualifying AMR episode
             occurring &lt;=21 days after transplant or pre-AMR baseline eGFRMDRD &gt;=30 mL/min/1.7m^2
             for a qualifying AMR episode occurring greater than (&gt;) 21 days after transplant. The
             pre-AMR baseline is the highest eGFRMDRD value obtained following the kidney
             transplant and within 30 days prior to the qualifying AMR episode. If more than 1
             eGFRMDRD value is available, a mean of the 2 highest values (at least 1 day apart and
             both prior to the AMR episode) will be used as the pre-AMR baseline value. If no
             eGFRMDRD was obtained within 30 days prior to biopsy, it can be evaluated within a 60
             day period.

          6. Receive first dose of investigational product after 7 days after the kidney transplant
             procedure and within 7 days after the qualifying renal allograft biopsy procedure that
             was positive for AMR.

          7. Be informed of the nature of the study and provide written informed consent before any
             study-specific procedures are performed.

             test at the Screening Visit and must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Day 1
             visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have received pediatric en bloc kidney transplant.

          2. Have primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, rapidly progressive
             glomerulonephritis, membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis type 1 (including C3

             of native kidney failure.

          3. Have prior or concurrent non-renal solid organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell
             transplant (HSCT) or have more than 2 completed kidney transplant procedures (note: 1

             and documented in the operative report) any major technical complications of the renal
             artery, renal vein, or ureteral anastomosis

          6. Have ongoing treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

        <description>New or worsening TG at month 6 by the standard score was defined as an increase in one or more between qualifying biopsy and 6-month biopsy. New or worsening TG was measured by Banff 2013 criteria (standard score) using allograft glomerulopathy (Cg0-Cg3): Cg0- No GBM double contours by light microscopy (LM) or electron microscopy (EM); Cg1- no GBM double contours by LM but GBM double contours in at least 3 glomerular capillaries by EM; Cg2- Double contours affecting 26 to 50% of peripheral capillary loops in the most affected of nonsclerotic glomeruli; Cg3- Double contours affecting more than 50% of peripheral capillary loops in the most affected of nonsclerotic glomeruli with a score range of 0 (no allograft glomerulopathy) and 3 (severe glomerulopathy). Percentage of participants with new or worsening TG at Month 6 post-treatment was reported.</description>
