      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled in 2 centers in Belgium and the Netherlands from November 2015 until November 2017 when the study was terminated early due to slow recruitment rate.

      <pre_assignment_details>12 participants received treatment in Part A to determine the lowest pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) dose that triggered a migraine-like attack (MLA). PACAP-38 responders from Part A and PACAP-38 naïve participants were randomized in Part B (17 in total). 35 participants were enrolled in the study (Parts A and B).</pre_assignment_details>

PACAP-38 naïve participants entered the study at Part B. On day 1 of the Part B challenge phase participants received the dose of PACAP-38 determined from Part A of the study: 100 pmol/kg (administered as 10 pmol/kg/minute PACAP-38 over 10 minutes).

PACAP-38 naïve participants entered the study at Part B. On day 1 of the Part B challenge phase participants received the dose of PACAP-38 determined from Part A of the study: 100 pmol/kg (administered as 10 pmol/kg/minute PACAP-38 over 10 minutes). Responders who experienced a MLA within 24 hours were screened for the randomization phase.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a MLA Within 24 Hours of Challenge Agent Infusion</title>
        <description>On day 1 of the double-blind randomization phase participants received 140 mg intravenous erenumab over 30 minutes or matching placebo. On day 8, participants received 10 mol/kg/minute PACAP-38 over 10 minutes and were observed for 24 hours after PACAP-38 infusion.
A MLA was defined as fulfilling 1 of the 2 criteria:

          <description>At baseline, 12-lead ECGs were performed in a standardized method, in triplicate, and approximately 30 seconds apart, prior to blood draws or other invasive procedures. Single ECGs were performed from Day 1 to EOS. ECG results were reviewed by the investigator and classified as: normal, abnormal not clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant. The number of participants with abnormal, clinically significant changes in ECG results at EOS are presented.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was terminated early due to slow recruitment rate.</limitations_and_caveats>
