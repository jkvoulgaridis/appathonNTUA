  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim was to determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a nation-wide
      population based cohort from Spain (di@bet.es study). The target was the Spanish population.
      The sample consisted of 5072 people older than 18 years, in 100 clusters (health centres
      randomly selected from all over Spain). The following variables were recorded:
      Socio-demographic and clinical data, survey on habits (physical activity and frequency of
      selected food consumption) and a physical examination was made (weight, height, waist, hip,
      blood pressure). A fasting blood draw and an oral glucose tolerance test were performed.
      Determinations of serum glucose were made. In the follow-up the same variables were collected
      and HbA1c was determined. A total of 2408 subjects participated in the follow-up (7.5±0.6
      years, 39.7% men). In total, 154 people developed diabetes (6.4% cumulative incidence in the
      7.5 years of follow-up). The incidence of total diabetes adjusted for the structure of age
      and sex of the Spanish population was 11.6 cases/1000 person-years (IC95%=11.1-12.1). The
      incidence of known diabetes was 3.7 cases/1000 person-years (IC95%=2.8-4.6) and the incidence
      of unknown diabetes was 7.9 cases/1000 person-years (IC95%=5.3-8.1). The main risk factors
      for developing diabetes were the presence of prediabetes in cross-sectional study, age, male
      sex, obesity, central obesity, increase in weight, and family history of diabetes. This work
      provides data about population-based incidence rates of diabetes and associated risk factors
      in a nation-wide cohort of Spanish population.

        The study is based on the di@bet.es study, a cross-sectional study undertaken from
        2007-2010 from a random cluster sampling in the Spanish population over 18 years of age
        (Soriguer et al. Diabetologia 2012;55(1):88-93).
