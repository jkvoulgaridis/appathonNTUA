  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare (FPH) is developing a new nasal mask.

      This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance of the trial nasal mask, focused
      specifically on how the different seal sizes will perform on Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      participants who are currently on Positive Airway Pressure therapy.

      Participant's prescribed treatment pressure with their usual mask will be collected for 7
      days ± 3 days prior to mask fitting with the trial nasal mask. They will then be issued with
      the trial nasal mask to use in-home for 14 days ± 4 days.
