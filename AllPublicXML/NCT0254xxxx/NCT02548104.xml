  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, more distal approach to femoral nerve branches (saphenous) in the adductor canal in
      the medial compartment of the thigh have shown to provide comparable anesthesia and analgesia
      without quadriceps muscle weakness than traditional femoral nerve blocks (FNB) after total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA). Adductor canal block (ACB) has the unique advantage of providing
      localized analgesia to the peripatellar and intra-articular aspects of the knee joint without
      reducing the patient's ability to perform a straight leg raise. However, it does not
      adequately address the incisional pain component on the anterior surface of the knee
      innervated by anterior femoral cutaneous nerve. This pain may be improved by addition of the
      anterior femoral block (AFB). Additionally, the ACB does not provide analgesia to the
      posterior aspect of the knee, which is commonly moderate to severe after surgery. This pain
      may be decreased by addition of the genicular block, also known as the iPACK block
      (interspace between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee). There is no study that
      has evaluated the potentially analgesic benefits of the AFB or the iPACK block combined with
      ACB after TKA. Therefore, the investigators designed this randomized, prospective, and
      double-blinded study to assess our hypothesis that the addition of the AFB and/or iPACK block
      to the ACB will improve analgesic effects, decrease pain scores, deceased opioid requirement,
      and as well as facilitate early recovery and improve patient satisfaction with pain
      management in patient after TKA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain associated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can pose significant
      challenges in the recovery process of the patients undergoing this procedure. Traditionally,
      opioids have played a significant role in treating postoperative pain. It is well established
      that opioids are highly effective in relieving pain at rest, but are less effective in
      relieving pain associated with motion (e.g. ambulation, passive motion, and physical
      rehabilitation). Furthermore, the use of opioids for analgesia is associated with well-known
      side effects (such as: nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, bladder dysfunction,
      respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, sedation, and allergic reaction). These opioid
      side effects, which range in severity, can significantly interfere with the rehabilitation
      process and contribute to a delay in hospital discharge.

      Significant interest exists in the application of regional anesthetic techniques as an
      adjuvant to traditional opioid analgesics for pain control in patients after TKA.
      Specifically, the incorporation of femoral nerve blocks (FNB) as an adjunct in postoperative
      pain control has been widely reported in the anesthesia literature. While it has shown to be
      effective in post-operative pain control, it has introduced additional challenges for
      physical therapy and raised new concerns regarding the associated quadriceps muscle weakness.
      Until adequate quadriceps function returns, the need for knee immobilization devices to
      protect patients with traditional FNB from falls interferes with the early recovery process
      and the achievement of physical therapy milestones.
