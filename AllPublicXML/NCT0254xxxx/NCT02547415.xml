  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medically unexplained chronic pain - without identifiable somatic origin - is yet an
      insufficiently known and explored field in children and adolescents by international clinical
      works. This research aims to characterize somatic, psychological, psychopathological and
      environmental (particularly attachment styles and family functioning) processes trough an
      observational study with three pain management centers.

      The study concerns children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years old, suffering of medically
      unexplained chronic pain and their parents who are referred to a pain center. It is composed
      of a somatic, psychological and family functioning assessment on the one hand and
      psychopathological and attachment evaluation on the other hand.
