  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to determine if epigenetic priming with a DNA
      methyltransferase inhibitor (DMTi) prior to chemotherapy blocks is tolerable and carries
      evidence of a clinical efficacy signal as determined by minimal residual disease (MRD),
      event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). Tolerability for each of the agents, as
      well as total reduction in DNA methylation and outcome assessments will be done to
      simultaneously obtain preliminary biological and clinical data for each DMTi in parallel.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the tolerability of five days of epigenetic priming with azacitidine and
           decitabine as a single agent DMTi prior to standard AML chemotherapy blocks.

        -  Evaluate the change in genome-wide methylation burden induced by five days of epigenetic
           priming and the association of post-priming genome-wide methylation burden with
           event-free survival among pediatric AML patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Describe minimal residual disease levels following Induction I chemotherapy in patients
           that receive DMTi.

        -  Estimate the event-free survival and overall survival of patients receiving a DMTi prior
           to chemotherapy courses.

    <textblock>
      To determine tolerability, priming with DMTi (azacitidine or decitabine) will be limited to
      Induction I and II during Part 1 of the study. If DMTi treatment is tolerated during Part 1,
      the investigators will go on to an Expansion Phase (Part 2) that includes DMTi priming prior
      to all chemotherapy blocks.

      Treatment will consist of 5 blocks of conventional chemotherapy: Induction I, Induction II,
      Intensification I, Intensification II, and Intensification III over approximately 5 months.

      RANDOMIZATION: Patients will be randomized to receive one of two DMTi (azacitidine or
      decitabine) for 5 days prior to Induction I. Intrathecal (ITHMA) treatments will be given
      right before treatment on this study or on Day 1 of Induction I treatment. Leucovorin will be
      given 24-30 hours following ITHMA.

      INDUCTION I CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide.

      INDUCTION II CHEMOTHERAPY; Patients receive their assigned DMTi for 5 days followed by
      fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF, and idarubicin.

      Patients are then evaluated and assigned to either the low-risk arm, intermediate-risk arm,
      or the high-risk arm for Intensification therapy.

      Patients with ≥ 5% blasts following Induction II will be considered refractory and will go
      off therapy. The rare high risk patient with an MRD &lt; 0.1% following Induction I may proceed
      directly to stem cell transplant (SCT) after Induction II - if a suitable donor is available
      and the transplant can be performed without delay. MDS patients may proceed to SCT once they
      have achieved MRD &lt;0.1% irrespective of the number of chemotherapy courses received.

      INTENSIFICATION I CHEMOTHERAPY - LOW-RISK AML, INTERMEDIATE-RISK AML, and HIGH-RISK AML with
      no donor: Patients receive cytarabine and etoposide. After administration of 5 days of a DMTi
      prior to Inductions I and II satisfies a tolerability determination criterion, patients will
      also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to cytarabine and etoposide.

      INTENSIFICATION II CHEMOTHERAPY - LOW RISK AML, INTERMEDIATE-RISK AML, and HIGH-RISK AML with
      no donor: Patients receive mitoxantrone and cytarabine. After administration of 5 days of a
      DMTi prior to Inductions I and II satisfies a tolerability determination criterion, patients
      will also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to mitoxantrone and
      cytarabine.

      INTENSIFICATION I CHEMOTHERAPY - HIGH-RISK AML with a donor: Patients receive mitoxantrone
      and cytarabine followed by stem cell transplant (SCT). Treatment related AML patients and
      patients with treatment related MDS who have a donor but are not able to receive a SCT
      without delay will proceed to HR Intensification III and receive erwinia asparaginase and
      cytarabine. After administration of 5 days of a DMTi prior to earlier courses satisfies a
      tolerability criterion, patients will also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days
      prior to mitoxantrone and cytarabine or erwinia asparaginase and cytarabine.

      Treatment related AML patients and treatment related MDS patients that are not able to
      receive a SCT should go off treatment following Intensification II.

      INTENSIFICATION III CHEMOTHERAPY - INTERMEDIATE-RISK AML and HIGH-RISK AML with no donor:
      Patients receive erwinia asparaginase and cytarabine. After administration of 5 days of a
      DMTi prior to earlier courses satisfies a tolerability criterion, patients will also receive
      their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to erwinia asparaginase and cytarabine.

                  abnormality [e.g., t(8;21), inv(16), t(9;11)], or

               -  Myeloid sarcoma (also referred to as extramedullary myeloid tumor, granulocytic

               -  Male and female participants of reproductive potential must use an effective
                  contraceptive method during the study and for a minimum of 6 months after study

          -  Use of investigational agents within 30 days or any anticancer therapy for this
             malignancy within 2 weeks before study entry with the exception of IT therapy,
             hydroxyurea, or low-dose cytarabine as specified in the protocol document. The patient
             must have recovered from all acute toxicities from any previous therapy.

          -  Systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled (defined as
