    <textblock>
      National trial, multicenter, randomized, phase II comparing treatment intensification with
      hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy plus systemic chemotherapy (CT) to systemic
      chemotherapy alone in patients with liver-only colorectal metastases (CRLM) considered still
      non resectable after at least two months of systemic induction chemotherapy.

      to compare the efficacy of CT intensification combining hepatic arterial infusion(HAI)
      oxaliplatin plus IV FOLFIRI plus targeted therapy (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) or bevacizumab) to conventional systemic CT alone plus targeted therapy (anti-EGFR or
      antiangiogenic antibody), in patients with liver-only CRLM not amenable to curative-intent
      resection (and/or ablation) after systemic induction CT in terms of conversion to complete
      (R0 R1) resection (or ablation) rate (CRR).

             combined with a fluoropyrimidine combined or not to a targeted therapy (e.g.,
             anti-EGFR or antiangiogenic antibody) for metastatic disease (patients ending their
             adjuvant chemotherapy after primary tumor resection since more than 6 months should
             also have received first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease). Further systemic
             chemotherapy lines are allowed.

          3. Unresectability of the CRLM will be confirmed by a centralized multidisciplinary
