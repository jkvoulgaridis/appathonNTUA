  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to is to evaluate the occurrence of late onset (i.e., greater
      than 5 years after treatment) safety events of special interest in participants who have
      received sub-retinal transplant of human embryonic stem cell derived - retinal pigment
      epithelial (hESC-RPE) cells in an AIRM-sponsored clinical trial. The events of special
      interest are adverse events (AEs) that are presumed to have a potential causal relationship
      to the hESC-RPE cells.

      Participants will be contacted by the Patient Outreach Center (POC) on an annual basis to
      complete a questionnaire about the occurrence of safety events of special interest, as
      defined in the Outcome Measure section.

      The questionnaire will be completed directly by the participant (via a secure web based
      platform) or will be administered via telephone by a POC staff member. In the event of the
      occurrence of a safety event of special interest, study participant will be encouraged to
      contact the POC as soon as possible, rather than wait for the annual questionnaire
      completion. Follow up data is inclusive of the 1 year in the core trial, 4 years in the long
      term follow up trial and 10 years in this long term safety follow up. Participation for
      United Kingdom participants will be life-long.
