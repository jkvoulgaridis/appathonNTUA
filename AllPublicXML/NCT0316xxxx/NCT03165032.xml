  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the right ventricular function during graded
      cycling on an ergometer by transthoracic echocardiography in Kyrgyz highlanders with high
      altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH) by performing a cross-sectional case-control study.
