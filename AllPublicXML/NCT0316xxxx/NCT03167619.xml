  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, international, multicenter, Phase II study designed to explore the
      efficacy of olaparib or olaparib in combination with durvalumab in platinum-treated mTNBC.
      The primary objectives are to explore olaparib or olaparib in combination with durvalumab as
      maintenance therapy following clinical benefit with platinum-based therapy in subjects with
      mTNBC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects suitable for enrollment into this trial are adult subjects with histologically
      documented triple negative adenocarcinoma of the breast that is inoperable, locally advanced,
      or metastatic, and is not amenable to resection with curative intent, and who have received
      at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in the 1st or 2nd line setting AND derived
      clinical benefit (CR / PR / SD) per RECIST 1.1 with platinum-based therapy as determined by
      the treating physician.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to either olaparib or olaparib in combination with
      durvalumab. Study treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity,
      elective withdrawal from the study, or study completion or termination. Upon treatment
      discontinuation, subjects will be followed every 2 months for survival.

      Although randomization will be used to allocate subjects to either the olaparib or olaparib
      in combination with durvalumab arm, no comparisons between treatment regimens are planned.
      The purpose of randomization was to reduce bias due to subject selection into either
      treatment arm.
