  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis has a devastating impact on quality of life of postmenopausal women, and is a
      significant cause of disability and morbidity. Many drugs are approved for the prevention and
      treatment of osteoporosis, but are associated with high costs and side effects. Some data
      from animal studies suggests that supplementation with probiotics can safely treat and
      prevent osteoporosis. The probiotic VSL#3 is commercially available, is safe for human
      consumption, and has been widely used in human clinical trials, and has known
      health-promoting effects in both children and adults.

      The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of VSL#3 will be conducted for 12
      months in 40 postmenopausal women to determine if VSL#3 improves bone mineral density and
      related bone markers. Study visits will include all or some of the following procedures: a
      medical exam, urine collection, height and weight measurement, a blood draw to assess bone
      biomarkers, a DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan to measure bone density, and
      health questionnaires.

      This is one of the first clinical trials proposed to investigate the effects of probiotics in
      bone in humans. If successful, this proposal will provide the first evidence that nutritional
      supplementation with the probiotic VSL#3 is a safe and effective strategy for preventing
      postmenopausal bone loss.

      Osteoporosis has a devastating impact on quality of life of postmenopausal women, and is a
      significant cause of disability and morbidity. Many drugs are approved for the prevention and
      treatment of osteoporosis, but are associated with high costs and side effects. Some data
      from animal studies suggests that supplementation with probiotics can safely treat and
      prevent osteoporosis. The probiotic VSL#3 is commercially available, is safe for human
      consumption, and has been widely used in human clinical trials, and has known
      health-promoting effects in both children and adults.

      The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of VSL#3 will be conducted in a
      population of ambulatory, otherwise healthy, postmenopausal women for 12 months. Control and
      VSL#3-treated postmenopausal women will be matched by age (± 3 years). Study visits will
      include all or some of the following procedures: a medical exam, urine collection, height and
      weight measurement, a blood draw to assess bone biomarkers, a dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure bone density, and health questionnaires.

      The primary endpoint is the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the L1-4 lumbar spine
      over one year of study. Changes in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip area will be
      secondary endpoints. All BMD data will also be used as a tool for future studies power
      calculation and design. Additional endpoints will include changes in bone turnover markers
      and inflammatory/osteoclastogenic cytokines. Measurements of indices of bone turnover and
      cytokine levels will provide much needed mechanistic information.The data will allow to
      establish whether VSL#3 prevents bone loss and/or increases bone mass by regulating bone
      resorption, formation, or both.

    <masking_description>Only the Emory Investigational Drug Service (IDS) pharmacy will know which dose of probiotic was given to the subject. The study team, parents, subjects, individuals entering the data, statistician, individuals performing laboratory tests and DEXA scans, research center nurses and investigators will remain blinded as to which treatment the subjects received. Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier, which will be used in the database. In addition, all lab specimens will only include the patient's unique identifier. Permuted block sizes will not be disclosed to the blinded study personnel to minimize the likelihood of their being able to predict the next randomization assignment in the series. Investigators and all study personnel will remain blinded until the final subject has completed her final visit and primary and secondary endpoints have been analyzed.</masking_description>

        <title>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating</title>
        <description>Study drug tolerance will be assessed by obtaining serial measures of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). These will be obtained with in-person interviews at the baseline and month 6 and 12 visits and by telephone contact with all subjects by the study coordinator every 2 weeks. Data will be analyzed within the 5 symptom domains depicting symptoms related to gastric reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation.The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms. A GSRS total score, the sum of all 5 domains, will also be assessed.</description>
