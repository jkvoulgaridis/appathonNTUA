    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well chemotherapy with or without radiation or surgery works
      in treating participants with esophageal or gastric cancer that has spread to less than 3
      places in the body (oligometastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy
      uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Surgery, such as complete
      surgical resection, may stop the spread of tumor cells by surgically removing organs or
      tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation or surgery may work better than chemotherapy alone
      in treating participants with oligometastatic esophageal or gastric cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether esophageal or gastric patients with oligometastatic cancer without
      disease progression after first line chemotherapy therapy will demonstrate improved overall
      survival (OS) with early local therapy (concurrent chemotherapy/radiation and surgery).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the relationships between progression-free survival and overall survival between
      both treatment arms.

      II. Report local control, loco-regional control. III. Report time to progression of distant
      metastases. IV. Report toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive induction chemotherapy for a minimum of 6 cycles and a maximum of 8
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants are then
      randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (MAINTENANCE CHEMOTHERAPY): Participants receive fluorouracil and capecitabine per
      instructions of the treating physician in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II (LOCAL THERAPY): Participants receive fluorouracil and capecitabine and undergo
      radiation therapy (RT) per instructions of the treating physician in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants may also undergo surgery to some or all of
      the remaining sites of disease as is clinically prudent and indicated by treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 4-8 weeks, 2-3 months,
      every 3-6 months for up to 3 years, and then every 6-12 months thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a pathologic diagnosis of tumor biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA)
             of esophageal or gastric cancer of adenocarcinoma histology

          -  The patient is staged with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)/esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy
             (EGD) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan

          -  The patient has three or less observable metastatic lesions. Metastatic lesions
             include distant M1 lymph node group; which will be counted as one site (M1 metastatic
             lymph nodes to include cervical, mediastinal, gastric, retroperitoneal lymph nodes
             will be counted as one lesion). Osseous metastases or visceral metastases will each
             count as one metastatic site. Each central nervous system (CNS) metastases will count
             as one metastatic site. Satellite lesions in the primary esophageal malignancy such as
             skipped esophageal primaries are not considered metastatic sites. Symptomatic
             metastatic sites can be treated locally prior to randomization or by palliative
             radiation

          -  Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of 0-2, with life expectancy of at
             least 6 months

             symptomatic sites of metastases but not definitive local therapy to esophageal or
             gastric primary prior to randomization. All patients may be enrolled on protocol then
             start systemic therapy; if they do not have evidence of disease progression at
             re-staging following initial therapy, they may be randomized

          -  Patients with fistula documented radiographically or by EDG/EUS, endobronchial
             ultrasound (EBUS)

          -  Patients with life expectancy less than 6 months, ECOG &gt; 3
