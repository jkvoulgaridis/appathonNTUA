  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to research the effects of exercising at high intensities for
      short periods of time on exercise tolerance and motivation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will investigate whether adding a treatment component that focuses on
      positive outcome expectations of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention
      produces greater improvements in psychological and physiological study outcomes. This project
      will yield empirical evidence that will inform how to help Americans meet physical activity
      guidelines; how to develop exercise programs that are more likely to promote exercise as a
      habit; and maintenance of health and a healthy body weight.

    <measure>Change in relative reinforcing value (RRV) of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>

    <measure>Changes in preference for intense physical activity and tolerance for exercise discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in preference for intense physical activity and tolerance for exercise discomfort will be assessed by self-report questionnaire responses to the Preference for and Tolerance of the Intensity of Exercise Questionnaire (PRETIE-Q). The PRETIE-Q measures preference for high intensity vs. low intensity exercise and ability to persist or tolerate the discomfort associationed with intense exercise. The PRETIE-Q consists of two subscales: Preference for Exercise Intensity and Tolerance of Exercise Intensity. Each subscale has 8 items rated on a 5 point response scale (range 8 - 40). Higher scores indicate greater preference for intense exercise and/or greater tolerance for exercise discomfort. Total scale scores are not used. Scale averages will be used.</description>

    <description>Changes in perceptions of how much exercise satisfies autonomy, relatedness, and competence needs will be assessed by self-report questionnaire responses to the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise Scale. This scale measures how much the psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence are satisfied during exercise. There are three subscales: autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Each subscale has 6 items rated on a 6-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater amounts of the construct. Total subscale scores may range from 6 to 36. Subscale averages will be used in analyses.</description>
