    <textblock>
      A recent study (Saltmarche et al., 21017) examined the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM), a
      kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared light to heal and protect tissue that
      has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying, in 5 older adults with
      dementia. After 12 weeks of PBM treatments, delivered with a commercially available, wearable
      device, the patients with mild to moderately severe dementia showed improvements on the
      Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE, p&lt;0.003) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive,
      ADAS-cog, p&lt;0.03). The caregivers, who kept daily journals of their experiences during the 12
      weeks of PBM treatment, reported better sleep, fewer angry outbursts, decreased anxiety and
      wandering in their loved-ones with dementia. The goals of this trial are to: (1) replicate
      this finding in a larger group of individuals with dementia and (2) to examine the underling
      brain mechanisms behind the changes in cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared
      light to stimulate, heal, regenerate, and protect tissue that has either been injured, is
      degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. Human cadaver studies have shown near-infrared
      wavelengths can penetrate 40-50 mm through the scalp and skull. Saltmarche et al. (2017)
      recently reported that 12-weeks of transcranial treatment with a commercially available PBM
      device (i.e., the Vielight &quot;Neuro &quot;) benefits cognitive function in patients with
      mild-to-moderately severe dementia. Specifically, Saltmarche et al. reported improvements on
      the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, p&lt; 0.003) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog, p&lt; 0.03) in 5 dementia patients after 12-weeks of PBM
      treatment.

      The first aim of this trial is to replicate Saltmarche et al' s findings that the effects of
      12-weeks of PBM treatment can improve cognitive function in older adults with dementia.
      Because the Vielight Neuro device targets nodes of the default mode network (DMN), which is
      dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the second aim of this pilot study is to
      investigate whether 12 weeks of PBM therapy with the Vielight Neuro device improves DMN
      connectivity in older adults with dementia. Finally, because there is suggestive evidence
      that PBM therapy enhances blood flow, the third aim of the trial is to examine whether
      12-weeks of PBM therapy improves cerebral blood flow (CBF) in older adults with dementia. The
      trial will also explore the effects of PBM treatment on quality of life in older adults with
      dementia and on caregiver burden.

      Ten older adults with dementia (i.e., the primary study participants, PP) and their
      caregivers (CG) will be enrolled in a randomized, wait-list control trial. Five PPs will be
      randomized to the &quot;immediate&quot; PBM treatment group after the baseline psychometric and MRI
      assessments. Five PP will be randomized to a &quot;delayed&quot; PBM treatment group that will not
      receive PBM treatment with the Vielight Neuro device until after the 12 week psychometric and
      MRI assessments.

      Neuroimaging measures will be assessed in all PPs at baseline and week 12. Cognitive function
      and quality of life will be assessed in all PPs at baseline, weeks 6 and 12. Caregivers (CGs)
      will be asked to fill out questionnaires Caregivers (CGs) will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires about caregiver burden, positive aspects of care giving, depressive
      symptomology, and dementia-related behaviors in the PP at baseline, weeks 6 and 12.

      PPs randomized to the &quot;immediate&quot; PBM treatment group will receive PBM with the Vielight
      Neuro device once a day, every other day (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) for 12 weeks. PPs randomized
      to the &quot;delayed&quot; PBM treatment group will keep doing their usual activities for 12 weeks.
      After the 12 week psychometric and MRI assessments, PPs randomized to the &quot;delayed&quot; PBM
      treatment group will receive PBM with the Vielight Neuro device once a day, every other day
      (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) for 12 weeks. PPs randomized to the &quot;delayed&quot; PBM treatment group will
      undergo additional psychometric assessment at weeks 18 and 24. CGs of PPs randomized to the
      &quot;delayed&quot; PBM treatment group will be asked to fill out additional questionnaires about
      caregiver burden, positive aspects of care giving, depressive symptomology, and
      dementia-related behaviors in the PP at baseline, weeks 18 and 24.

    <measure>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) test is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in research studies and clinical trials for new drugs and other interventions. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis (e.g., ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute the complex sequences of motor actions), attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The ADAS-cog score is based on the number of errors made in each item. Total score ranges from 0 to 70. A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment. A score of 0 represents the least impairment.
This outcome is a change score, derived by subtracting Baseline ADAS-cog score from Week 12 ADAS-cog score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clock-drawing Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The clock-drawing test is used for screening for cognitive impairment and dementia and as a measure of spatial dysfunction and neglect. The score ranges from 0 (none correct) to 5 (all correct). A score greater than or equal to 4 is considered &quot;normal&quot; The outcome is a change score: Baseline - Week 12 score. Or Week 12 - Week 24 for Delayed PBM participants who opted to undergo 12 weeks of PBM treatments after 12 weeks of Usual Care. A negative change score = improvement; a positive change score = decline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Default Mode Network (DMN) Functional Connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DMN is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other and distinct from other networks in the brain. This outcome consists of the strength of the connection between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a hub of the DMN, and the left (L) and right (R) lateral parietal cortex (LP) at baseline and at Week 12. Studies in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest there is diminished connectivity between nodes of the DMN in AD. Therefore increased connectivity between nodes of the DMN from baseline to Week 12 (or higher T-scores of the connection) indicate better outcomes. The measure type of &quot;number&quot; for this assessment is the T-score that was calculated for each &quot;group&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) Perfusion MRI Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome consists of measures of blood flow to the brain at baseline and at Week 12. Total perfusion values were derived by averaging across the superior frontal, superior parietal, and supramarginal regions of interest (ROI), based on the location of the transcranial LED clusters. The perfusion values were normalized to the precentral gyrus (i.e., motor cortex) perfusion .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QOL-AD is a standard quality of life measure that asks parallel questions of affected individuals and their caregivers. Current quality of life is rated as poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points) or excellent (4 points) in 13 areas: physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and life as a whole. Score range from 0 (worse quality of life) to 52 (best quality of life)
This outcome is a change score, derived by subtracting Baseline from Week 12 scores (or Week 12 - Week 24) for Delayed PBM participants who chose to undergo 12 weeks of PBM after 12 weeks of Usual Care). A higher change score = decline in perceived quality of life. A lower or negative change score = improved perceived quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in QOL-AD From the Caregiver's Perspective About the Individual With Dementia</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is a change in the quality of life of the individual with dementia from the caregiver's perspective. Scores range from 52 (best possible perceived quality of life) to 0 (worse possible perceived quality of life). A positive or larger change score = decreased quality of life. A negative or smaller change score = improved quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI).</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CBI is a standard measure that includes 24 items and 5 domains. Caregivers are asked to rate how often each statement describes their feelings (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, nearly always). The total score may range from 0 to 96 with higher scores reflecting greater feelings of burden. This outcome is a change score: Baseline CBI score - Week 12 CBI score. A positive (or larger) change score = decrease in caregiver burden. A negative (or smaller) chance score = increase in caregiver burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI assesses the frequency and severity of 12 common dementia-related behaviors (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and appetite/eating). It is a questionnaire completed by the caregiver about the individual with dementia. The total NPI score ranges from 0 to 144. A higher the total NPI score signifies more numerous, frequent, and/or more severe dementia-related behaviors.
This outcome is a change score: Baseline NPI score - Week 12 NPI score. (or Week 12 - Week 24 for Delayed PBM participants who opted to undergo PBM treatments) A positive (or larger) change score = decrease in the number and/or severity of dementia-related behaviors. A negative (or smaller) change score = increase in the number and/or severity of dementia-related behaviors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale is a standard measure that asks caregivers to rate their agreement/disagreement with 11 statements about positive aspects of caregiving on a 5-point likert scale (disagree a lot ... agree a lot). Scores can range from 11 (few positive aspects of providing care for someone with dementia) to 55 (many positive aspects of providing care for someone with dementia).
This outcome is a change score: Week 12 score - baseline score. A larger (or positive) change score = increase in positive aspects of caregiving. A negative (or smaller) change score = decrease in positive aspects of caregiving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) - Short Form in the Caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GDS-short form is a 15-item yes/no scale that measures depressive symptoms in older individuals. Scores range from 0-15. Higher scores reflect the presence of more depressive symptoms. A score of 0-5 is normal; a score &gt; 5 suggests depression; a score ≥ 10 is strong indicator of depression.
This outcome is a change score: Baseline GDS score - Week 12 GDS score. In participants randomized Delayed PBM treatment who opt to undergo PBM treatments after 12 weeks of Usual Care, Week 12 GDS score - Week 24 GDS score. A positive (or larger) change score = decrease in depressive symptoms in caregivers. A negative (or smaller) change score = increase in depressive symptoms in caregivers.</description>

The device is engineered for increased efficacy and easy domestic use for comprehensive brain photobiomodulation (PBM). The NIR lights are pulsed at a 40 Hz rate, which correlates with electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma brain wave entrainment.</description>

        <title>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</title>
        <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) test is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in research studies and clinical trials for new drugs and other interventions. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis (e.g., ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute the complex sequences of motor actions), attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The ADAS-cog score is based on the number of errors made in each item. Total score ranges from 0 to 70. A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment. A score of 0 represents the least impairment.
This outcome is a change score, derived by subtracting Baseline ADAS-cog score from Week 12 ADAS-cog score.</description>

        <description>The DMN is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other and distinct from other networks in the brain. This outcome consists of the strength of the connection between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a hub of the DMN, and the left (L) and right (R) lateral parietal cortex (LP) at baseline and at Week 12. Studies in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest there is diminished connectivity between nodes of the DMN in AD. Therefore increased connectivity between nodes of the DMN from baseline to Week 12 (or higher T-scores of the connection) indicate better outcomes. The measure type of &quot;number&quot; for this assessment is the T-score that was calculated for each &quot;group&quot;.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD)</title>
        <description>The QOL-AD is a standard quality of life measure that asks parallel questions of affected individuals and their caregivers. Current quality of life is rated as poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points) or excellent (4 points) in 13 areas: physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and life as a whole. Score range from 0 (worse quality of life) to 52 (best quality of life)
This outcome is a change score, derived by subtracting Baseline from Week 12 scores (or Week 12 - Week 24) for Delayed PBM participants who chose to undergo 12 weeks of PBM after 12 weeks of Usual Care). A higher change score = decline in perceived quality of life. A lower or negative change score = improved perceived quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</title>
          <description>The NPI assesses the frequency and severity of 12 common dementia-related behaviors (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and appetite/eating). It is a questionnaire completed by the caregiver about the individual with dementia. The total NPI score ranges from 0 to 144. A higher the total NPI score signifies more numerous, frequent, and/or more severe dementia-related behaviors.
This outcome is a change score: Baseline NPI score - Week 12 NPI score. (or Week 12 - Week 24 for Delayed PBM participants who opted to undergo PBM treatments) A positive (or larger) change score = decrease in the number and/or severity of dementia-related behaviors. A negative (or smaller) change score = increase in the number and/or severity of dementia-related behaviors.</description>

        <title>Change in Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale</title>
        <description>The Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale is a standard measure that asks caregivers to rate their agreement/disagreement with 11 statements about positive aspects of caregiving on a 5-point likert scale (disagree a lot ... agree a lot). Scores can range from 11 (few positive aspects of providing care for someone with dementia) to 55 (many positive aspects of providing care for someone with dementia).
This outcome is a change score: Week 12 score - baseline score. A larger (or positive) change score = increase in positive aspects of caregiving. A negative (or smaller) change score = decrease in positive aspects of caregiving.</description>

        <description>The GDS-short form is a 15-item yes/no scale that measures depressive symptoms in older individuals. Scores range from 0-15. Higher scores reflect the presence of more depressive symptoms. A score of 0-5 is normal; a score &gt; 5 suggests depression; a score ≥ 10 is strong indicator of depression.
This outcome is a change score: Baseline GDS score - Week 12 GDS score. In participants randomized Delayed PBM treatment who opt to undergo PBM treatments after 12 weeks of Usual Care, Week 12 GDS score - Week 24 GDS score. A positive (or larger) change score = decrease in depressive symptoms in caregivers. A negative (or smaller) change score = increase in depressive symptoms in caregivers.</description>
