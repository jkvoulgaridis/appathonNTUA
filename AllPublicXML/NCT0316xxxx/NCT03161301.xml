  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide mechanistic insight into the underlying causes and molecular level
      pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. We will identify key mechanisms that confer risk and
      protection. Ultimately this will lead to new and improved diagnostics and therapeutics.
      Because periodontal disease is a uniquely accessible biofilm-associated disease it will
      provide insight into many other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and chronic
      infections associated with indwelling catheters and artificial prostheses. Subjects with
      periodontal conditions will have therapeutic benefit from the treatments provided.

      A maximum of 440 subjects will be enrolled in this study with the goal of identifying 31 of
      each of the three types of IL-37 genotypes (93 total). Subject participation may include 1 to
      9 visits lasting over a period of 6 months. Clinical data and medical history data will be
      collected at the screening visit to ascertain eligibility. Saliva collected at screening will
      be used to determine genotype. If one of the three targeted genotypes results, these patients
      will be assigned to the appropriate genotype group until 31 subjects are in each group at
      which point recruitment and screening will stop. There are no plans to share genotype
      classification with subjects. All subjects will have saliva and dental plaque collected at
      baseline. Twenty four of the 93 subjects (8 from each group) will be selected for gingival
      biopsy. These 24 subjects will have GCF samples collected at baseline. All subjects will have
      GCF samples collected at visit 3. Enrolled subjects (31 of each type of the three genotypes)
      will be recalled up to four additional times spread over twelve weeks for blood collection,
      to be used for monocyte isolation and whole blood stimulation. Gingival tissue samples will
      be used for immunohistochemistry, laser capture and RNA extraction. Medical histories,
      demographics, height and weight, clinical and biological data described above will be
      recorded and stored on a secure server located at the University of North Carolina. Each
      participant enrolled into the study will have a unique identification number that has been
      stripped of any information that could be used by non-study members to identify the subject.
