  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, 2-way crossover, single-dose study that is being performed to
      establish the bioequivalence of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets from two manufacturers:
      manufacturer of the Phase 2/3 drug product and manufacturer of the Phase 3 and commercial
      drug product. This bioequivalence study will confirm (1) the drug product manufactured from
      these two manufacturers are therapeutically equivalent and (2) the efficacy and safety data
      obtained in clinical studies using TNX-102 SL from these two manufacturers are comparable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, bioequivalence, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-period,
      2 sequence, crossover study under fasting conditions.

      Potential subjects will be screened by medical and psychiatric history, and laboratory and
      physical examinations 2 to 30 days prior to drug administration. All eligible subjects will
      be admitted to the study unit on Day -1, the day prior to dose administration. Baseline
      values will be considered the last value obtained before dosing for each assessment. On Day
      1, the morning after admission, after all pre-dose assessments have been completed and
      subjects who remain eligible have agreed to continue, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      study medication and will receive the assigned test drug. Subjects will be required to fast
      for at least 10 hours prior to dosing until at least 4 hours post-dose.

      For each period, subjects will be confined to the study site from at least 10 hours before
      dosing until after the 24-hour post-dose blood draw. Subjects will come back for all
      subsequent blood draws. Subjects will be reassessed for eligibility prior to each dosing
      period.
