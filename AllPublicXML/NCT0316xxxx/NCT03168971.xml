  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the effects of Managing Anxiety from Cancer (MAC) therapy on
      anxiety compared to usual care, in patients and their caregivers. MAC is different from usual
      care because it uses a plan for managing anxiety that has been shown to work in previous
      studies. MAC has designed this plan for people 65 years of age and older. MAC also includes
      the primary caregiver which has been shown to help patients manage their anxiety.
