  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1,900 mutations in the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) protein are implicated in causing Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Potential therapies that
      directly target defective CFTR are being evaluated in important clinical trials, but most
      target the most common CFTR mutation F508del. Many patients with rare CF mutations are not
      able to participate in those studies. The RARE study is specifically designed for people with
      CF caused by rare mutations. Eligible rare mutations are listed below:

        -  CF patients who are homozygous for pre-mature stop codons

        -  CF patients with two mutations in the CFTR gene:

           i. One allele must be a F508del ii. The other allele must be a pre-mature stop codon
           mutation

        -  CF patients with two mutations in the CFTR gene:

           i. At least one allele must be a pre-mature stop codon mutation ii. The second allele
           can be any of the following: G85E, N1303K, R334W, 3849+10kb C-&gt;T, 621+1G-&gt;T

        -  CF patients who are homozygous for: G85E, N1303K, R334W, 3849+10kb C-&gt;T, or 621+1G-&gt;T

      This is a multi-site, specimen collection study. Investigators will collect blood, intestinal
      cells and nasal cells from each participant. Cells from these specimens will be used to test
      future CFTR modulators to see if they might work for people with study eligible rare
      mutations. Having cells to test in the lab is an important first step in identifying
      potential new therapies for people with these mutations.

      This is a multi-site, specimen collection study for people with Cystic Fibrosis who have rare
      mutations. This study is non-interventional so there is no study drug or investigational
      treatment involved.

        -  Once a potentially eligible participant is identified (either self-identified or by
           their CF care center), and the person has expressed interest in participating in the
           study, the participant will be referred to a participating study site to receive
           additional information about the study and about travel arrangements (if needed).

        -  The eligibility criteria are broad and inclusive: Often studies have restrictions around
           lung function that limit who can participate. The only real restriction for this study
           rare mutations as defined on the RARE study eligible mutations list.

        -  Blood, intestinal cells, nasal cells will be collected from all participants.

        -  Participants will be compensated for the time of the visit and travel expenses will be
           pre-paid by the study. The study site research coordinator can provide more detail on
           how much participants will be paid.

        -  This study is being conducted at six regional sites. Participants may travel to any of
           the regional study sites to participate, but the participant will need to talk with the
           research coordinator at the site of their choice to get all of the study details before
           making a decision to participate. The study site research coordinator will put
           participants in contact with the travel agency to arrange and pre-pay for travel
           (including hotel, airline/train arrangements as needed).
