  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the clinical and physiologic course of Kyrgyz
      highlanders with high altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH) by performing a longitudinal
      cohort study. To this end, the investigators will invite the same highlanders who
      participated in the study in 2012 to undergo follow-up examinations in 2017, in order to
      allow comparisons of current results with baseline data from 2012.
