  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter 2-arm study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy
      of the addition of a vaccine therapy to 1 or 2 checkpoint inhibitors for NSCLC.

      Arm A: mRNA Vaccine [BI 1361849 (formerly CV9202)] + anti-PD-L1 [durvalumab] Arm B: mRNA
      Vaccine [BI 1361849] + anti-PD-L1 [durvalumab] + anti-CTLA-4 [tremelimumab]

      For each arm of the study, there is a dose evaluation phase in which the Recommended
      Combination Dose (RCD) is determined according to a standard 3 + 3 design. The dose
      evaluation phase is followed by an expansion phase, in which the cohort at the RCD is
      expanded to 20 subjects (inclusive of the subjects from the dose evaluation cohort).

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Histologic confirmation of metastatic NSCLC. For subjects with known EGFR or ALK/ROS-1
             mutations, prior therapy must have included an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or
             ALK/ROS-1 inhibitor, respectively. Subjects may have had 1 prior line of
             anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Subjects who received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy must have
             progressed during or after treatment, but not prior to Week 12 of treatment.

          2. Availability of archival (diagnostic) specimens or willing to undergo a pre-treatment
             biopsy.

          3. Subjects with treated brain metastases must have been treated with surgery and/or
             radiation therapy ≥ 21 days pre-study and must be clinically stable with no
             requirement for steroids.

          4. Laboratory parameters for vital functions should be in the normal range.

          5. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects may not enter the study if they fulfill any of the following criteria:

          1. Treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks of starting treatment or prior
             treatment with anti-CTLA-4 therapy.

          2. Active, suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease, clinically significant
             cardiovascular disease, or clinically uncontrolled hypertension.

          3. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, or any unresolved immune-related
             adverse events following prior therapy.

          4. Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting treatment (or scheduled for surgery during
             the projected course of the study) or prior cancer vaccine treatment or allogeneic
             bone marrow transplantation.

          5. Subjects who are immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency or have
             active infection including tuberculosis or other serious illnesses.

          6. Skin disease (e.g., psoriasis) that may prevent intradermal administration of the
             vaccine into the target areas.
