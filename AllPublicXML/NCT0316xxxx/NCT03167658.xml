  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is great public and private interest in the use of workplace wellness programs to
      reduce health care spending, improve health outcomes, and enhance productivity for employees.
      However, there is little rigorous evidence on the effects of wellness programs. This study
      partners with a large multi-state U.S. employer (BJ's Wholesale Club) and an experienced
      wellness vendor (Wellness Workdays) to evaluate a multi-prong workplace wellness program,
      including components such as nutrition counseling, fitness challenges, and stress management
      workshops. The wellness program will be delivered by a team of experts including Registered
      Dieticians, and will include financial rewards for participation. The program will be
      available to employees in initially 20 of BJ's 200 worksites, and later expanded to 25
      worksites. These worksites have been randomly selected, allowing a randomized controlled
      trial evaluation of the effects of the wellness program. Data will be collected on a wide
      array of outcomes from multiple sources, including on-site biometric screenings and surveys,
      employment records, and health insurance claims for employees at both treatment and control
      worksites.
