      Title: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group Study to
      Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Denosumab in Pediatric Subjects With
      Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis

      Study Phase: 3 Indication: Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of denosumab on lumbar spine bone mineral density
      (BMD) Z-score as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at 12 months in children
      5 to 17 years of age with Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GiOP).

      Secondary Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of denosumab in children 5 to 17 years of age
      with GiOP with respect to:

        -  Change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score as assessed by DXA from baseline to 6, 18, 24, and 36
           months

        -  Change in proximal femur BMD Z-score as assessed by DXA from baseline to 6, 12, 18, 24,
           and 36 months

        -  Incidence of X-ray confirmed long-bone fractures and new and worsening vertebral
           fractures from pretreatment to posttreatment at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Incidence of improving vertebral fractures from pretreatment to posttreatment at 12, 24,
           and 36 months (overall, among subjects with clinical fracture reduction, and among
           subjects with clinical fracture increase)

        -  Incidence of pretreatment compared with posttreatment vertebral and nonvertebral
           fractures at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in Childhood Health Questionnaire - Parent Form-50 (CHQ-PF-50) Physical Summary
           Score at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in CHQ-PF-50 Psychological Summary Score at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) Disability Index Score at 12,
           24, and 36 months

        -  Change in Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in growth velocity, determined by calculating age-adjusted Z-scores for height,
           weight, and body mass index (BMI), at 24 and 36 months

        -  Serum concentration of denosumab at 1 and 10 days, and 6, 12, and 18 months (additional
           serum denosumab pharmacokinetics [PK] samples to be collected at day 30 and month 3 in a
           PK/bone turnover marker [BTM] substudy of up to 100 subjects) Hypotheses: The hypothesis
           of this study is that the change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z-score following 12
           months of denosumab treatment in children 5 to 17 years of age with GiOP will be greater
           than placebo.

                  [LLN], malabsorption should be clinically ruled out by the investigator to

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications. Further details are available at the link below.</ipd_access_criteria>
