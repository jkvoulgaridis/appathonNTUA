      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long-acting injectable agent
      cabotegravir (CAB LA) compared to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine
      (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-uninfected women.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long-acting
      injectable integrase inhibitor cabotegravir (CAB LA) compared to daily oral tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a
      population of sexually active HIV-uninfected women at risk for HIV.

      This study will take place in three steps. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      two arms:

      Arm A:

      Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB and TDF/FTC placebo for 5 weeks.

      Step 2: Participants will receive injections of CAB LA at two time points 4 weeks apart and
      every 8 weeks thereafter and daily TDF/FTC placebo beginning at Week 5.

      Arm B:

      Step 1: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and oral CAB placebo for 5 weeks.

      Step 2: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and intramuscular (IM) placebo injections at
      two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter beginning at Week 5.

      Step 2 will continue until the last enrolled participant reaches approximately 76 weeks on
      Step 2 (Week 81 for the last enrolled participant).

      In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily TDF/FTC for up to 48 weeks,
      starting no later than 8 weeks after the last injection.

      At the end of Step 3, all participants will then transition to locally available HIV
      prevention services, including services for PrEP, if available.

      Study visits will occur at Day 0 and at Weeks 2 and 4 during Step 1. During Step 2,
      participants will attend up to 24 visits, depending on when they enroll in the study. Study
      visits will occur every 12 weeks during Step 3. Study visits may include physical
      examinations; blood, urine, and vaginal swab collection; risk reduction, adherence
      counseling, and contraception counseling.

      HPTN 084-01 is a sub-study of HPTN 084. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety,
      tolerability, and acceptability of CAB LA for the prevention of HIV among adolescent females.
      Participants will receive oral CAB for 5 weeks, followed by 34 weeks on CAB LA, then
      quarterly visits for 48 weeks after final injection. All participants who have received at
      least one injection will be followed for 48 weeks after their last injection. Total study
      duration per participant will be approximately 21 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Born female

          -  18-45 years at the time of screening

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  Willing and able to undergo all required study procedures

          -  Non-reactive HIV test results at Screening and Enrollment. Note: HIV-uninfected, based
             on HIV test results obtained at Screening and just prior to randomization at the
             Enrollment visit. All HIV test results from the Screening visit must be obtained and
             must all be negative/non-reactive. This includes testing for acute HIV infection,
             which must be performed within 14 days of Enrollment. In addition, at least one HIV
             test result using blood drawn at the Enrollment visit must be obtained prior to
             randomization into the study and must be negative/non-reactive. Individuals who have
             one or more reactive or positive HIV test result(s) will not be enrolled, even if
             subsequent confirmatory testing indicates that they are not HIV-infected (see SSP
             Manual). Those with any enrollment HIV test result positive will proceed through the
             HIV algorithm per the SSP but will not be able to receive study product regardless of
             subsequent test results.

          -  Sexually active (i.e., vaginal intercourse on a minimum of two separate days in the 30
             days prior to Screening)

          -  Score of greater than or equal to 5 using a modified VOICE risk score

          -  No plans to re-locate or travel away from the site for greater than or equal to 8
             consecutive weeks during study participation

          -  Creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault
             equation) (use sex at birth for calculation)

               -  Although not protocol exclusionary, sites should carefully consider the
                  advisability of enrolling participants with calculated creatinine clearance
                  between 60-70 mL/min, as limited changes in creatinine clearance during study
                  conduct will lead to protocol-mandated product holds and may alter the
                  risk-benefit considerations of study participation

          -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and accepts vaccination

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total
             bilirubin (Tbili) less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN

          -  HCV antibody negative

          -  If of reproductive potential (defined as pre-menopausal women who have not had a
             sterilization procedure per self-report, such as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
             tubal ligation or salpingectomy), must have a negative beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test (sensitivity of less than or equal to 25 mIU/mL)
             performed (and results known) on the same day as and before initiating the
             protocol-specified study product(s) at Enrollment.

          -  Have documented evidence of surgical sterilization, OR documented evidence of no
             uterus (e.g., hysterectomy), OR must agree to use a reliable form of long acting
             contraception, during the trial and for 52 weeks after stopping the long acting
             injectable, or 30 days after stopping oral study product, from the list below:

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets less than 1%
                  failure rate as stated in the product label

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive that meets less than 1% failure rate when used
                  consistently and correctly as stated in the product label (implants or

          -  No medical condition that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would interfere
             with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by self-report, or found upon medical
             history and examination or in available medical records)

          -  No alcohol or substance use that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would
             interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by self-report, or found upon
             medical history and examination or in available medical records)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  One or more reactive HIV test results at Screening or Enrollment, even if HIV
             infection is not confirmed

          -  Pregnant or currently breastfeeding, or intends to become pregnant and/or breastfeed
             during the study

          -  Co-enrollment in any other HIV interventional research study (provided by self-report
             or other available documentation), with one exception: IMPAACT 2026 (co-enrollment in
             IMPAACT 2026 is permitted for participants who become pregnant)

          -  Current or past enrollment in an HIV vaccine or broadly neutralizing antibody trial

             symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
             surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or any clinically
             significant cardiac disease

          -  Inflammatory skin conditions that compromise the safety of IM injections, per the
             discretion of the Investigator of Record (IoR). Mild skin conditions may not be
             exclusionary at the discretion of the IoR or designee

          -  Has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the buttock region which in
             the opinion of the IoR or designee may interfere with interpretation of injection site

          -  Active or planned use of prohibited medications as described in the Investigator
             Brochure (IB) or listed in the Study Specific Procedures Manual (SSP) (provided by
