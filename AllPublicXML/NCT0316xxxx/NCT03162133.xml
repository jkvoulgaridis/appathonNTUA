  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 3- month pilot study was conducted in 68 breast cancer survivors receiving AIs. All
      patients were informed to participate in a 12-weeks of Baduanjin exercise training, which was
      90 minutes per session 2 times per week, group1(≥2 times per week Baduanjin exercise ) (n=33)
      or group2(＜2 times per week) (n=35). Participants completed fitness assessments, measurements
      of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6),
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β) ,C-reactive protein (CRP) ，BMI，BMD
      and questionnaires to measure QoL, fatigue, sleep quality, Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced
      Arthralgia, symptoms of climacteric syndrome were completed at baseline and 3 months.

    <description>Participants were classified into two groups respectively according to the Baduanjin exercise frequency (0, 1, 2, 3 times per week) and the minimum criteria recommended by the ACSM guidelines for duration (150 minutes per week), intensity (moderate). Group 1 was defined as patients who met 150 moderate and vigorous minutes per week, and according to the median44,45 of total Baduanjin exercise frequency per week (≥2 times per week)</description>
