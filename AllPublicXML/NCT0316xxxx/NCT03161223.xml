  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a, dose-finding study with an initial phase 1 portion,
      articulated in four separate treatment arms, followed by a dedicated phase 2 for qualifying
      treatment Arm(s).

      The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combinations of: Durvalumab, oral 5-azacitidine, and
      romidepsin (Arm A); durvalumab, pralatrexate, and romidepsin (Arm B); durvalumab and
      romidepsin (Arm C); or durvalumab and oral 5-azacitidine (Arm D), in patients with peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The safety and toxicity profile of these combinations will be
      evaluated throughout the entire study.

      If one or more of the combinations in Arms A, B, C, or D are found to be feasible and an MTD
      is established, the phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated for the combination(s)
      with the strongest efficacy signal provided acceptable toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive lymphoid
      neoplasms and account for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL). The current prevalence of PTCL in the United States is estimated to be approximately
      9,500 patient. Treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) PTCL have been
      limited. This study focuses on exploring rational combinations of these T-cell active agents
      in an effort to develop novel treatment platforms.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 A minimum of 3 patients will be treated at the entry Dose Level, that is the MTD, in each arm. An estimated 10 patients will be accrued in each Arm, assuming â‰¤ 1 patients experience DLT. If a DLT is reached early we will treat fewer patients. For each study Arm, we will expand the MTD cohort to a total of 10 patients. We estimate that a total of 40 patients will be needed.
Phase 2 Once the recommended phase 2 dose is identified, a planning meeting with the Sponsor and involved investigators will be convened to discuss which Arm(s) to advance to phase 2. The sample size of the phase 2 portion of the study will be calculated on an optimal 2-stage design. We will first enroll 8 patients. If at least 3 objective responses (PR or CR) are seen, then an additional 16 patients will be enrolled. If 10 or fewer patients respond, the combination will not be considered for further study. We will enroll a total of 24 patients per arm.</intervention_model_description>
