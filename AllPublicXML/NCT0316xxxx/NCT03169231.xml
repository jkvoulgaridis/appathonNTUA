    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess safety and efficacy of Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells (LMSCs) compared to placebo on 1) functional mobility and exercise tolerance, 2)
      patient-reported physical function, and 3) the inflammatory cytokine biomarker tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF-alpha).
