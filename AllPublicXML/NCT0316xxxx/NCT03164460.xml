  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy or intensity
      modulated radiation/proton therapy works in treating patients with head and neck cancer that
      has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a
      patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells
      with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Intensity
      modulated radiation/proton therapy uses high energy x-rays or protons to kill tumor cells and
      shrink tumors. It is not yet known whether stereotactic body radiation therapy or intensity
      modulated radiation/proton therapy may work better in treating patients with head and neck
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 2-year rate of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)-4.0
      grade 3 or higher toxicity at 2 years between the two treatment arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 2-year locoregional failure free survival (LFFS) in patients being treated
      with reirradiation with either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) versus intensity
      modulated radiation therapy/intensity modulated proton therapy (IMRT/IMPT).

      II. To determine if there is any difference in local control, progression-free survival, and
      overall survival between the two arms.

      III. To compare toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)-4.0 and
      Performance Status Scale-HN (Head and Neck).

      IV. To compare patient reported outcome (PRO) measures of symptoms using MD Anderson Symptom
      Inventory (MDASI), MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy (FACT)-HN, ACT-HN Symptom Index (FACT-HNSI), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain
      Tumor (MDASI-BT), for skull base only, Anterior Skull BASE Questionnaire (ASBQ), for skull
      base only, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS),
      Performance Status Scale For Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN), Work Productivity and
      Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem version (V)2.0 (WPAI:SHP), and
      University of Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale, Xerostomia and Health
      Questionnaire (European Quality of Life Five Dimension Three Level [EQ-5D-3L]).

      V. Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) comparison between IMPT and IMRT. VI. Compare
      cost-benefit economic analysis of treatment. VII. Perform dosimetric analysis and compare
      correlates of critical structures.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess potential differences between patients on study and patients who were considered
      eligible for randomized, were randomized to a treatment arm, but may have dropped out of the
      study for other reasons after being randomized to; or were denied insurance coverage for the
      treatment arm she/he was randomized.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo SBRT every other day for a total of 5 treatments.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo IMRT/IMPT once daily (Monday-Friday) for up to 30-35 treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-3 months, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 3-4 months for up to 2 years.

    <measure>Incidence of grade 3+ toxicity (Tox3+) assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will use the methods of Gooley et al. to estimate the cumulative incidence of Tox3+, as well as competing-risk regression to model cumulative incidence of Tox3+ while treating death not related to Tox3+ as a competing event. The student t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare continuous variables between patient groups. The chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test will be applied to evaluate the association between two categorical variables. Logistic regression models will be used to evaluate the effects of the important patient clinical factors including treatment on TOX3+.</description>
