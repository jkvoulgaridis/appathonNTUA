    <description>40 subjects will receive multiple doses of ACT-709478 at the planned dose levels of 30, 60, 100, and 200 mg.
Each dose level will be investigated in a new cohort of 10 healthy male and female subjects (4 male subjects on active drug and 1 on placebo, 4 female subjects on active drug and 1 on placebo) undergoing one treatment period with a once daily dosing scheme.</description>
