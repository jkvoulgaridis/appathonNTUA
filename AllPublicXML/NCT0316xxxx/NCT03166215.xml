      The purpose of this study is to characterize the multiple-dose safety and tolerability
      profile of TAK-935 in adult participants with developmental and/or epileptic
      encephalopathies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to treat
      people who have developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies. This study will look at
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of people who take TAK-935. Study drug will be
      administered in a double-blind manner in Part 1 and in an open-label manner in Part 2.

      The study will enroll approximately 20 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in Part 1-which will
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-935

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      Participants will receive placebo or 100 milligram (mg) TAK-935 tablets, orally or through
      stable G-tube/PEG tube, BID, in Part 1 (Day 1) and dose will be increased to 200 mg (Day 11)
      BID and to 300 mg (Day 21) BID in dose titration period. All participants who complete the
      Double-Blind Treatment Period in Part 1 will have the option to continue directly into the
      Open-Label Treatment Period in Part 2 where they will receive TAK-935 as two 100 mg tablets
      (total dose is 200 mg TAK-935) orally or through G-tube/PEG tube, BID and dose will be
      increased to three 100 mg tablets (total dose is 300 mg TAK-935), orally, BID (Day 41). This
      dose level will be maintained until the final visit (Day 85) for the dose de-escalation
      phase.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 121 days excluding screening period of 30-41 days. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, and a follow-up phone call will be conducted on Day 91 and at
      the end of the 30-day follow-up period (Day 121), participants will return to the clinic for
      a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug</description>

             with countable bilateral motor seizures, defined as an average of greater than or
             equal to (&gt;=) 2 per month during the past 3 months, based on the investigator's
             assessment, and a monthly average of &gt;=1 per month during the Baseline Period, based
             on the seizure diary record.

          2. Has been taking 1 to 4 antiepileptic drug (AEDs) at a stable dose for &gt;=4 weeks before
             Screening and the participant or participant's legally acceptable representative is
             willing to keep the regimen(s) stable throughout the study.

          3. Has an average of &gt;=1 bilateral motor seizure per month during the 4-week Baseline
             Period (that is., drop seizures, tonic-clonic, tonic, bilateral clonic, atonic,
             myoclonic-atonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic, focal seizures with bilateral hyperkinetic
             motor features).

          4. Must agree to not post any participant's personal medical data related to the study or
             information related to the study on any web site or social media site (example,

             mechanical respiration within 3 months before Screening.

          3. Had a vagal nerve stimulator implanted within 6 months before Screening and settings
             have been changed within 1 month of the Screening Visit and/or anticipated to change
             during the study.

          4. Is on ketogenic diet that has been started within 6 months of the Screening Visit, has
             been changed within 1 month of the Screening Visit, or is anticipated to change during
             the study.

          5. Has degenerative eye disease.

          6. Has a history of suicidal behavior or any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Screening. If the participant is
             unable to comply with the C-SSRS due to developmental status, a parent proxy may be
             used for the completion of the C-SSRS. The Investigator may also use clinical
             judgment, which must then be documented in the source document.

          7. Positive for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infections.
             (Note that participants who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B [hepatitis B
             surface antibody (Ab)-positive] who are negative for other markers of prior hepatitis
             B infection [example, negative for hepatitis B core Ab] are eligible. Also note that
             participants who are positive for hepatitis C Ab are eligible as long as they have a
             negative hepatitis C viral load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]).

          8. Has an abnormal and clinically significant ECG at Screening in the opinion of the
             investigator, for example, second or third degree heart block or a corrected QT
             interval (QTc) greater than (&gt;) 450 millisecond (msec). Entry of any participant with
             an abnormal but not clinically significant ECG must be approved and documented by
             signature by the principal investigator or appropriately qualified delegate.

          9. Has abnormal clinical laboratory test results at Screening that suggest a clinically
             significant underlying disease. If the participant has alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.5*the upper limit of normal (ULN), the
             Medical Monitor should be consulted.

         10. Has received any excluded medications, procedures, or treatments during the time
             periods.

         11. Has any a history of alcohol, opioid, or other drug use disorder, as per the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, within the
             previous 2 years before Screening. Medical marijuana use is allowed.

         12. Has unstable, clinically significant neurologic (other than the disease being
             studied), psychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic,
             gastrointestinal, urologic, immunologic, hematopoietic, or endocrine disease or other
             abnormality, which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or
             potentially confound the study results.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug</description>
