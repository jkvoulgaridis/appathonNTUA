  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work collectively suggests that rod-mediated dark adaptation (RMDA) is a promising
      candidate as a functional endpoint measure for evaluating interventions to slow early
      progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, there is no agreement among
      the clinical, research and regulatory communities as to what constitutes a clinically
      (practically) significant slowing in RMDA. Treatments for AMD are often not considered
      efficacious if they do not result in a criterion level of improvement in vision. But how much
      change in the rate of dark adaptation constitutes a clinically significant change? Until this
      issue is resolved, progress in developing clinical trials on early AMD are at a standstill
      since there is no functional endpoint to be used in the trial. One approach to establishing
      clinical significance is to examine how RMDA relates to the performance of an everyday visual
      task under low luminance conditions, such as night driving or reading. However, such data are
      not yet available. The purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between RMDA
      and night-time driving and reading under poor illumination. This information will guide the
      development of a definition of a clinically significant difference in RMDA that can be used
      in designing clinical trials on early AMD.

      The specific aims of this study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To examine the association between RMDA as assessed by the rod intercept time and self
      reported driving difficulty and experiences during night time driving.

      Aim 2: To examine the association between RMDA as assessed by rod intercept time and reading
      performance as assessed by the MNREAD test administered under a low light level. Reading
      performance will be defined in terms of maximum reading speed, critical print size (i.e., the
      smallest print size that supports maximum reading speed), reading acuity (i.e., the smallest
      print size that can be just read) and the reading accessibility index (i.e., an individual's
      access to text over the range of print sizes found in everyday life).
