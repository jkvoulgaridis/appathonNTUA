    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission
      tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) works in diagnosing solid tumors. Using
      18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside with PET-CT may help doctors plan better treatment for
      patients with solid tumors. 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside may help to show how much oxygen
      is present in a tumor during a PET-CT scan.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of PET-CT using 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([18F]FAZA) and
      to determine the optimal imaging time to detect hypoxia in solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the variability of imaging findings from repeated [18F]FAZA PET-CT studies
      over &gt;= 24 hours up to 10 days.

      II. To confirm the safety of [18F]FAZA administered during PET-CT imaging of hypoxia of solid
      tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside intravenously (IV) and after 60
      minutes undergo 5 PET-CT scans at 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes on days 1 and 2.

      GROUP B: Patients receive 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside IV and after 60 minutes undergo 5 or
      less PET-CT scans on day 1 and 5 or less PET-CT scans &gt;= 24 hours later up to 10 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours and at 30 days.

Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histopathologic diagnosis of a solid tumor. All solid tumors will be
             considered, but patients with breast, pancreas, and colorectal masses will be
             prioritized.

          -  Patient must have a solid tumor with a short-axis greater than or equal to 1 cm (by
             CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasonography or mammography) to allow
             reliable PET imaging.

          -  A patient who has not received systemic or loco-regional treatment of the tumor within
             the last month.

          -  Ability of the subject, or the legally authorized representative (LAR) if the patient
             is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably
             impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is
             questionable, to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent.

          -  Patients who are not expected to receive cancer therapy before imaging sessions are
             completed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women: pregnant women are excluded from this study because the
             effects of [18F] FAZA in pregnancy are not known. A urine or serum pregnancy test will
             be performed before accrual after informed consent is obtained.

          -  Lactation should be suspended for at least two days following the administration of
             [18F] FAZA to the mother, because of the unknown but potential risk for adverse events
             in nursing infants secondary to administration of the radionuclide to a lactating
             woman.

          -  Subjects with contraindications to the use of [18F] FAZA including confirmed allergy.

          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a body mass index (BMI) which
             precludes their entry into the bore of the PET/CT scanner, because the findings will
             probably be compromised in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI.

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with
             study compliance.
