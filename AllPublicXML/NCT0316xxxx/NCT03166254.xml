  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive stage small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC) are incurable with current therapies, but due to mutations induced by
      cigarette smoke, typically express a large number of altered proteins that can be recognized
      as foreign by the immune system. This antigenicity is thought to explain the efficacy of
      pembrolizumab as either a first or second line treatment in this disease. For patients who
      receive chemotherapy plus immunotherapy as a first line therapy, there is sound rationale for
      combination treatment with immunotherapy and a therapeutic antitumor vaccine as a maintenance
      strategy. Regardless of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, monoclonal antibodies that block
      PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are effective second line therapies after chemotherapy in both NSCLC
      and SCLC. In addition, by targeting the immune system against tumor specific antigens using a
      peptide vaccine, the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone is expected to be enhanced, with an
      improved response rate and prolonged overall survival with no additional toxicity.

      This pilot study will provide a preliminary test of the feasibility of generating a
      personalized, tumor neoantigen-specific therapeutic vaccine and the safety of combining it
      with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.

      Please note that this study originally opened with ID# 201707041 but was withdrawn due to
      change in standard of care chemotherapy. This study was revised and submitted as an amendment
      to the same IND but our IRB required it to be submitted as a new study and it received a new
      ID#.

Progressive disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>
