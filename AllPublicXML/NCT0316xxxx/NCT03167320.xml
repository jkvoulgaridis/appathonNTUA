    <textblock>
      The Low Von Willebrand in Ireland Cohort (LoVIC) study focuses on the bleeding phenotype and
      biological mechanisms underlying low Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) levels.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with bleeding disorders in Ireland are registered on a national bleeding
      disorder database and attend the National Coagulation Centre in St. James's Hospital, Dublin,
      Ireland or the paediatric centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin for annual review.
      At review eligible patients will be invited to participate in the Low Von Willebrand in
      Ireland Cohort (LOVIC) study.

      Following consent, an extensive bleeding assessment tool will be administered by a
      coagulation haematologist to all participants from which the International Society of
      Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool (ISTH BAT) and the Condensed Molecular
      and Clinical Markers for the Diagnosis and Management of Type 1 Von Willebrands Disease
      (MCMDM-1 VWD) scores can be derived. In addition, blood will be drawn for von Willebrand
      factor (VWF) measurements, VWF propeptide, platelet VWF. Citrated plasma and DNA will be
      stored for each patient. The relationship between laboratory parameters, (including von
      Willebrand factor, platelet VWF, FVIII and concomitant coagulation disorders) and the
      clinical phenotype in patients with low VWF will be studied. We will assess the effect of the
      laboratory parameters on the severity of bleeding tendency. In the future mutation analysis
      of the VWF gene will be performed in all participants in the LOVIC study.

      Historical patient records and laboratory results will be reviewed and DDAVP
      (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) fall off studies documented where available. If no
      previous DDAVP fall off study has been performed patients will be invited to attend.

    <description>The ISTH-BAT and Condensed MCMDM-1 VWD score of all participants will be determined at enrollment using a physician directed questionnaire using only symptoms prior to their diagnosis with Low VWF. This will help elucidate the bleeding phenotype, if any, associated with Low VWF.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients with Low VWF with abnormal plasma VWF clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For each individual enrolled the Von Willebrand factor propeptide (VWF:pp, U/dL), Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag IU/dL) and Factor VIII:C (FVIII:C IU/dL) levels at enrolment will be determined. From this data the plasma VWF clearance will be ascertained using the plasma VWF:pp/VWF:Ag ratio. In addition, the FVIII:C/VWF:Ag ratio will be calculated to determine the contribution of altered VWF synthesis to Low VWF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of response to DDAVP in Irish patients with low Von Willebrand factor levels</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For each individual with no contraindication a DDAVP trial will be performed with plasma VWF levels taken pre and at 1 and 4 hours post DDAVP. The rate of plasma VWF level fall off for each trial will be determined and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. Complete response will be defined as a three fold increase from baseline.</description>

    <description>Irish patients with low Von Willebrand levels will be have both venous blood sampling and a bleeding score administered at study entry. A DDAVP (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) fall off study was organised for those patients in the cohort with no previous fall offs available and no contraindications to DDAVP.</description>
