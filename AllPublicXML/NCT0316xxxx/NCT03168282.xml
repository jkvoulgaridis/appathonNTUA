  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of identifying novel etiologic
      agents associated with SARI in patients who have required intubation and in whom, after
      analysis, a causative agent was not identified by standard microbiologic (culture) and
      multiplex real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) platforms. Taking into account that
      isolation of any pathogens is generally time sensitive, the study will evaluate subjects that
      are culture negative at the time of consent. Not all subjects will actually prove to be
      culture negative. Additionally, the study will compare etiologic agents identified on
      broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) to etiologic agents identified by routine upper airway testing
      on all subjects with SARI.

        Subjects will be selected from hospitalized patients who seek medical care due to SARI at
        the participating sites of LaRed Network, and who meet inclusion criteria and do not meet
        any exclusion criteria. For those who accept participation, either personally or through a
        Legally Authorized Representative (per all applicable legal and regulatory requirements
        complying with the sites regulations) the study will be explained and informed consent will
        be obtained. The study population will not include children. Pregnant women are not
        eligible.

          -  Willing to provide informed consent; or a legal representative is willing to sign
             informed consent;

          -  Intubated due to an independent clinical decision by a clinician responsible for the
             patient's clinical care and NOT affiliated with the research);

          -  Meet WHO's SARI definition (modified) - all of the criteria below:

          -  History of fever, subjective feverishness or measured fever of ≥ 38.0 °C, or
             hypothermia as defined for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) (&lt;36.0 °C );

          -  Cough or other respiratory symptoms, such as rapidly progressing dyspnea;

          -  Onset within the last 21 days (as long as the clinical condition is considered acute
             and due to the severity it requires intubation); and

          -  Requiring hospitalization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intubated for reasons other than SARI (cardiovascular accident, surgery);

          -  Known microbiologic diagnosis of SARI or respiratory illness:

          -  Any contraindication to BAL by bronchoscopy as determined by the treating physician

          -  Bacterial culture or other microbiologic testing for underlying etiology positive
             would be excluded;
