  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the underlying consumer
      motivations associated with choosing foods labeled as &quot;natural&quot;; and further, how the use of
      this term impacts the amount of food consumed.

      This study is a randomized, 1-arm, parallel trial design focused on determining the types of
      food labels people associate with 'natural.' A planned sample size of 100 will be enrolled
      into the study. This study will require one initial screening visit and 1 Study Day. This
      study will take approximately 1 day to 1 week per subject to complete.

      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood
      glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey relate to general eating, health, and
      exercise habits.

      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will be invited to participate in the study
      for 1 Study Day that participants can choose to continue on to after the Screening visit.

      Subject will arrive at the center in a fasted. During the Study Day, each participant will be
      asked to complete a health and mindfulness questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire,
      participants will be confronted with 7 bowls of granola, each with a different food label.
      The participant will be asked to choose the most natural granola to eat with the yogurt.
      After the participant chooses, the participant will then have a selected amount of time to
      consume the food and then after complete a debrief questionnaire regarding their intake
      choice. Subjects will be randomized to receive the food items labelled in different orders.
      The sequences of receiving the food items will be randomly assigned to one of sequences.
