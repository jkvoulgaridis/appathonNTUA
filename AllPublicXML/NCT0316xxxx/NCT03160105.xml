  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether maintenance antiretroviral therapy could be
      simplified to DTG + FTC dual therapy and/or patient-centered monitoring once virological
      suppression is achieved. Using a factorial design, the study aims to assess the efficacy of
      DTG + FTC dual therapy to maintain virological suppression through 48 weeks of follow-up as
      well as the costs of a patient-centered ART laboratory monitoring.

      This is a pragmatic multicentre, 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial with 1:1:1:1
      randomization to switching to DTG-based maintenance dual therapy in association with FTC or
      continuation of cART, and to patient-centered monitoring or continuation of standard
      monitoring.

      Patients will be followed during 48 weeks.

          4. ≥ 18 years of age;

          5. HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at screening and for at least 24 weeks before screening on
             effective suppressive cART, one blip with less than 200 copies/mL being allowed during
             this period if followed by at least 2 results &lt; 50 copies/mL.

          6. On standard cART at the time of inclusion, i.e.:

               -  2 NRTIs + either 1 NNRTI, 1 boosted PI or 1 INSTI;

               -  NRTI-sparing triple ARV regimen (e.g. 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI + 1 InSTI);

               -  Dual therapy with protease inhibitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-2 infection;

          2. Previous ART change for unsatisfactory virological response, i.e. slow initial
             virological suppression, incomplete suppression or rebound. Change of drug or drug
             class for convenience or toxic effect prevention or management is allowed.

             Note: patients with documented genotype(s) presenting only a M184V mutation remain
             eligible;

          3. Creatinine clearance &lt; 50ml/min;

          4. ASAT or ALAT &gt;2.5x upper limit of the norm;

          5. Known hypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy to DTG or FTC;

          6. Known or suspected non-adherence (defined as &lt;80% adherence, i.e. missed doses &gt;
             1x/week) to current treatment in the last 6 months;

          7. Concomitant use of drugs that decrease DTG blood concentrations including
             carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St John's wort and
             rifampicin;

          8. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding;

          9. a. Presence of any INSTI-resistance. Non-availability of INSTI resistance testing is
             NOT an exclusion criteria.

             b. Non availability of previous routine resistance test, at least for reverse
             transcriptase and protease genes.

             Note: Subjects remain eligible in the absence of any previous resistance test only if
             they are on their first-line antiretroviral regimen;

         10. Evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection based on results of serology
             testing.
