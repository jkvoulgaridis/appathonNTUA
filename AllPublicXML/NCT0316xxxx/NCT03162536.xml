      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study of ARQ 531 in patients with selected
      hematologic malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes 2 parts: phase 1 (dose escalation) and phase 2 (dose expansion). In phase
      1, patients were enrolled using 3+3 dose escalation design. The starting dose of ARQ 531 in
      oral tablet form was 5mg/day continuously. The RP2D has been determined at 65mg/day, patients
      will be enrolled to one of 9 cohorts depending on tumor histology and prior treatment
      history. Cycle length will be 28 days.

             procedures.

          2. 18 years of age and older.

          3. For the dose escalation cohorts, relapsed or refractory subjects with a diagnosis of
             B-cell NHL, CLL/SLL and WM who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.
             Subjects must have failed or are intolerant to standard therapies and cannot be a
             candidate for standard salvage regimens. Subjects with low grade lymphoma must be
             progressing and requiring treatment.

          4. For the expansion cohorts, the following criteria must be met:

               -  Cohort A: Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) CLL/SLL subjects with at least 2 prior
                  systemic therapies and previously treated with a covalent BTKi and must have a
                  documented BTK mutation on C481 residue.

               -  Cohort B: R/R CLL/SLL subjects who have failed or were intolerant to a BTKi with
                  documentation of the absence of BTK mutation on C481 residue. In this study,
                  intolerance to standard therapy is defined as having experienced a grade 3 or

                  therapy.

               -  Cohort D: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) subjects who have failed at least 2 prior
                  systemic therapies and are histology grade 1, 2, or 3A.

               -  Cohort E: Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) subjects who have failed at least 2 prior
                  systemic therapies.

                  prior systemic therapies.

               -  Cohort I (Food Effect): Relapsed or refractory subjects with a diagnosis of
                  B-cell NHL, CLL/SLL and WM who have received at least two prior systemic
                  therapies. Subjects must have failed or are intolerant to standard therapies and

             Note: A washout period of at least 5 times the half-life after the last dose of any of
             the above treatments is required for a subject to be eligible for study enrollment.

          4. Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

             beats/min). If the screening ECG has a QTcF &gt; 450 msecs, the ECG can be submitted for
             a centralized, cardiologic evaluation.

         10. Active Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection.

         11. Other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would either compromise the subject's safety or interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety of the study agent.
