  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metacognition, in-the-moment awareness of performance while engaging in cognitive tasks, is
      negatively affected by traumatic brain injury (TBI). Metacognitive deficits can greatly
      reduce quality of life for individuals with TBI as functioning in this domain has been
      closely linked with successful independent living and community re-integration.
      Problematically, there are currently no empirically validated treatment options that address
      metacognitive deficits after TBI. Recent research in healthy samples demonstrates that
      specific listening interventions may alter neural activation in brain works associated with
      metacognition and can improve metacognitive functioning; however, it remains unknown if these
      effects generalize to individuals with TBI. Thus, the objective of the proposed study is to
      use a double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of
      applying a specific listening intervention to improve metacognition after TBI and to employ
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to document the neural mechanisms by which the
      intervention operates.

    <description>While participants are in the scanner, they will perform a metamemory paradigm that involves the completion of 2 components per trial: 1) a memory task (a non-verbal recognition task), and 2) a metacognitive task that immediately follows completion of every recognition item. Accuracy of metacognitive functioning can be quantified using the Goodman and Kruskal gamma coefficient,16 a value between -1 and 1, indicating the discrepancy between the participant's judgment and objective performance that is commonly used in the metacognitive literature.</description>
