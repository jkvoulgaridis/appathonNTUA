  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo controlled trial evaluating the effect of acetazolamide on cognition in
      lowlanders with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travelling from 760 m to 3200 m.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial evaluating the effect
      of acetazolamide (375 mg per day) vs. placebo on visuomotor learning performance at altitude
      (Tuja Ashu, 3200 m). Randomization to acetazolamide or placebo will be carried out after
      baseline measurements in Bishkek (760 m).

      Visuomotor learning performance will be tested by Motor Task Manager (MTM). The MTM requires
      the subjects to reach visual targets with a hand-held cursor. During progression of the test,
      the movement direction from the cursor on the computer screen will increasingly differ from
      the direction of the hand movement, forcing the unaware subject to implicitly adapt to the
      imposed cursor rotation. This test assesses a subjects ability to visuomotor adaption,
      perception and attention. Furthermore, as the task will be performed in the evening and after
      sleep in the next morning, the investigators will be able to assess overnight improvement of
      implicit learned skills.
