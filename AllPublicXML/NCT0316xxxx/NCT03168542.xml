    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, non-randomized, open label, bilateral, non- dispensing clinical
      trial with only one visit. The Eye Care Providers will be provided with a fitting guide and
      will determine the initial study lens selection. Each subject will wear either the
      investigational contact lenses or marketed contact lenses for approximately 30-90 minutes.
      This study aims to evaluate the ECPs impression of the fitting guide for a novel multifocal
      lens and also their success in fitting the lenses.

    <intervention_model_description>While this study utilizes two contact lenses, the purpose was to evaluate the JJVC fitting guide. This was a non-randomized study in which eye care practitioners used the JJVC fitting guide to fit subjects with a study contact lens. Subjects may fit either in a bilateral or a contralateral fashion.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ECP followed the fitting guide to assess the vision provided by the study lenses and determined if a lens change was needed. The ECP modified the lenses based upon the subject's responses in accordance with the Fitting Guide. Two modifications were allowed. The number of modifications required by the ECP to optimize vision was recorded.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 23 subjects were enrolled into this study. Of the enrolled subjects 21 were dispensed a study lens and 2 subjects failed to meet the eligibility criteria. Of the dispensed subjects all 21 completed the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This was a non-randomized study. The JJVC fitting guide, subjects responses and eye car practitioner options dictated which study lens the subject was to be fit with. Lens type and lens sequence are not experimental design factors. The first lens pair (Right/Left) on eye was the same lens pair (Right/Left) the subject ended with.</pre_assignment_details>
