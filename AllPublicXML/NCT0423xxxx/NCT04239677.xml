  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with an increased risk of
      blood transfusions. The primary setup of the CPB circuit demands a priming volume of
      approximately 1600 mL of crystalloid solution which leads to a relevant hemodilution. The
      retrograde autologous priming (RAP) procedure minimizes hemodilution by displacing the
      crystalloid priming volume of arterial and venous lines via passive exsanguination of native
      blood prior to CPB initiation, resulting in higher hematocrits and reduction of red blood
      cell transfusion. RAP can also minimize the dilution of coagulation factors as well as red
      blood cells. Thus, the investigators hypothesized that RAP could maintain better coagulatory
      function after CPB. In this study, the investigators investigate the impact of RAP on the
      coagulation profile assessed by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in participants
      undergoing cardiac surgery.
