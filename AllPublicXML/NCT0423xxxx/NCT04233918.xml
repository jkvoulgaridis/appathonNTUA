    <textblock>
      The primary objective for Part A of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      evinacumab in pediatric patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

      The primary objective for Part B of the study is to demonstrate a reduction of low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by evinacumab in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) patients
      with HoFH.

      The secondary objective for Part A of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      evinacumab administered intravenous (IV) in pediatric patients with HoFH.

      The secondary objectives for Part B of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of evinacumab on other lipid parameters (ie, apolipoprotein B
           (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC),
           lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) in pediatric patients with HoFH

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of evinacumab administered IV in pediatric
           patients with HoFH

        -  To assess the PK of evinacumab in pediatric patients with HoFH

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of evinacumab in pediatric patients with HoFH over time

        -  To evaluate patient efficacy by mutation status
