        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood pressure
             (BP), Pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (inclusive) at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive) as measured at screening

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, highly effective
             contraception from the time of administration of trial medication until 30 days after
             administration of trial medication. Adequate methods are:

               -  Condoms plus use of hormonal contraception by the female partner that started at
                  least 2 months prior to administration of trial medication (e.g., implants,
                  injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device) or

               -  Condoms plus surgical sterilization (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to
                  enrolment) or

               -  Condoms plus surgically sterilised partner (including hysterectomy) or

               -  Condoms plus intrauterine device or

               -  Condoms plus partner of non-childbearing potential (including homosexual men)
                  Subjects are required to use condoms to prevent unintended exposure of the
                  partner (both, male and female) to the study drug via seminal fluid. Male
                  subjects should use a condom throughout the study and for 30 days after last
                  Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration. Alternatively, true
                  abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the subject's preferred and
                  usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually active but becomes active,
                  with their partner, they must comply with the contraceptive requirements detailed
                  above Male subjects should not donate sperm for the duration of the study and for
                  at least 30 days after last IMP administration

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood pressure (BP), Pulse rate
             (PR), Electrocardiogram (ECG), physical and neurological examination) deviating from
             normal and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 40 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 40 to 100 bpm at screening and pre-dose of first period

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of

             medication or its excipients). Inactive hayfever is permitted.

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/QTc

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 90 days of planned
             first administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent

             predose

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  History of relevant neurological disorder affecting the peripheral or central nervous

             to use male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from time point of first
             administration of trial medication until 30 days after the last administration of
