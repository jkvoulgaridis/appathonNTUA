  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will compare the clinical outcomes of the natural orifice
      specimen extraction surgery versus traditional robotic-assisted surgery in the treatment of
      colorectal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on investigators' experience, compared to robotic-assisted colorectal cancer radical
      resection, robotic colorectal cancer radical resection with natural orifice extraction has
      more advantages in postoperative stress response, postoperative pain, postoperative recovery
      and postoperative abdominal aesthetics. However, in terms of tumor radicality, there may be
      no obvious differences. There are no randomized controlled trails to discuss these
      questions.This research is based on the above conditions. Investigators use prospective
      randomized controlled trial to analyze the surgical data, postoperative complications,
      postoperative recovery of the robotic colorectal cancer radical resection with natural
      orifice extraction and conventional robotic-assisted colorectal cancer radical resection in
      order to summarize clinical experience and explore the advantages and disadvantages of
      robotic colorectal cancer radical resection with natural orifice specimen extraction and to
      provide a new direction for the surgical treatment of colorectal cancer, which is beneficial
      to the promotion of NOSES(Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery ) technology and
      treatment of colorectal cancer.
