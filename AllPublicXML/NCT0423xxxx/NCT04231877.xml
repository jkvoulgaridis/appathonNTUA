    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of polatuzumab vedotin when given with combination
      chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with untreated large B-cell lymphoma that grows
      and spreads quickly and has severe symptoms (aggressive). Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal
      antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B
      positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Drugs used in
      combination chemotherapy such as etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and
      rituximab work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving polatuzumab
      vedotin in addition to etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab may
      help treat patients with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1, polatuzumab vedotin IV on day 1,
      prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, etoposide IV on days 1-4, doxorubicin
      IV on days 1-4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 5. Patients also receive filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) 24-72 hours after the last dose of each treatment cycle. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5
      years.

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from

             of =&lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 12 months after the
             last dose of study treatment. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same
             period. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is
             post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (=&lt;12 continuous months of
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of
             childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or
             requirements. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of =&lt;1% per year
             include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that
             inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine
             devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
             duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test result during
             screening period. Women who are considered not to be of childbearing potential are not
             required to have a pregnancy test

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With female
             partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain
             abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after
             the last treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The
             reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of
             the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure. Male patients
             considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before study treatment

             screening, including prior to finalization of staging (not included as part of
             pre-phase treatment) If glucocorticoid treatment is urgently required at higher doses
             for lymphoma symptom control prior to the start of study treatment, tumor assessments
             must be completed prior to initiation of &gt; 30-100 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.
             Prednisone &gt; 30-100 mg/day or equivalent may be given for a maximum of 7 days as a

             may proceed with screening during treatment for infection, but systemic treatment must
             be completed by cycle 1 day 1

          -  Positive test results for chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as positive hepatitis
             B surface antigen [HBsAg] serology):

             * Patients with occult or prior hepatitis B infection (defined as positive total
             hepatitis B core antibody and negative HBsAg) may be included if hepatitis B virus
             (HBV) DNA is undetectable at the time of screening. These patients must be willing to
             undergo monthly DNA testing and appropriate antiviral therapy as indicated by
             institutional standard

          -  Positive test results for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody serology
             testing)

             * Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)

          -  History of uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

             * Patients with known diagnosis of HIV must have undetectable viral load and be on
             anti-retroviral therapy

          -  Patients with a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

          -  Pregnancy or lactation or intending to become pregnant during study
