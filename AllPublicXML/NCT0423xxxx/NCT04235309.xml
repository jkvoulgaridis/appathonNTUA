  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine underlying physical resilience (the ability to bounce
      back) in response to a specific stressor (total knee replacement).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In general, a person's specific resilience (ability to bounce back from a stressor) is
      thought to be dependent upon that person's specific biological and genetic makeup. However,
      these specific elements remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to identify
      important predictors and characteristics of resilience in response to a total knee
      replacement by examining baseline resilience (prior to surgery) and post-surgical resilience
      at multiple time points, allowing us to track resilience outcomes over time.
