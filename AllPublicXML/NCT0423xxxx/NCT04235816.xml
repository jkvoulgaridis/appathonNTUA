      To provide the evidence needed to inform policy and practice and to accelerate the
      implementation of this intervention, a large-scale clinical trial on the impact on all-cause
      mortality up to 18 months of age of azithromycin (AZi) administration through the World
      Health Organisation (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) will be carried out in
      Sierra Leone. The clinical trial will be individually randomised, placebo-controlled with a
      factorial design whereby AZi will be administered alongside routine preventive health
      interventions of the EPI, such as immunisations and Intermittent Preventive Treatment in
      infants (IPTi), which is recommended by the WHO for malaria prevention in this age group. The
      potential development of antibiotic resistance, the interactions with routine immunisations,
      the safety and the impact on the health system of AZi administration will be all assessed in
      this trial.

      The goal of this project is to improve child survival in areas with high mortality rate.

      The specific objectives are:

      Primary:

        1. To assess the effect on all-cause mortality up to 18 months of age of AZi administration
           at 6 weeks and 9 months of age alongside routine EPI immunisations

        2. To determine the effect on all-cause mortality up to 18 months of age of AZi
           administration at 6 weeks, 9 and 15 months of age alongside routine EPI immunisations

        3. To evaluate the safety of repeated AZi administration through the EPI

        4. To contribute to the capacity building of young African researchers

        5. To catalyse research synergies between European and African countries to tackle
           poverty-related diseases

      Secondary:

        1. To evaluate the effect on all-cause mortality up to 18 months of age of an additional
           dose of AZi at 15 months of age

        2. To evaluate the effect on all-cause mortality of an additional dose of IPTi at 15 months
           of age

        3. To assess the potential development of resistance to macrolides

        4. To assess the impact on gut microbiota

        5. To evaluate the potential interaction with routine EPI immunisations (measles and yellow
           fever)

        6. To examine the health system implications of the addition of AZi to the EPI and its
           acceptability by health providers and participants
