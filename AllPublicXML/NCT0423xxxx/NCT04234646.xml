      This study evaluates whether a &quot;Patient Navigation 2.0 Checklist&quot; intervention is effective
      in addressing patients' social determinants of health and recommended cancer-related
      screenings, behavioral counseling, and immunizations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patient navigation (PN) is an effective strategy for resolving patient barriers to
      care and improving completion and consistency of cancer screening, follow-up of abnormal
      findings, and treatment initiation. However, as the current standard one-on-one PN model is
      challenging to scale across cancers and economically difficult to sustain, the investigators
      propose to convert one-on-one PN into a learning health system &quot;PN 2.0 Checklist&quot; that will
      help coordinate navigation workflow and integrate clinical team members with community/local
      resources. This pragmatic, randomized trial tests whether this checklist strategy is as
      effective as one-on-one PN in addressing patients' social determinants of health and
      recommended cancer-related screenings, behavioral counseling, and immunizations.

      In this study, half of the participants will be navigated using the &quot;PN 2.0 Checklist&quot;. The
      other half will be navigated using the &quot;One-on-One PN&quot;. All participants enrolled in the
      study will have their medical records reviewed and be asked to complete a patient survey at
      the beginning of the program, at the end of the program, and one year after the end of the
      program.
