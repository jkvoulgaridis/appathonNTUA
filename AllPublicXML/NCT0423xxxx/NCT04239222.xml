  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, interventional, multicenter pilot study to characterize differences in
      performance and patient reported outcomes between the Taleo, Proflex XC, and the new Revo
      prosthetic foot.

      The purpose of the Revo-M Study is to characterize differences in performance and patient
      reported outcomes between the Revo investigational prosthetic foot and a comparative
      prosthetic foot (Taleo or Proflex XC) when compared to the control foot which is the
      subject's currently used energy storage and return (ESR) prosthetic foot. The data obtained
      from this study may also serve to determine the long-term performance of Revo.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-perceived mobility (PLUS-M) compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after fitting with Revo-M</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline perception of mobility as measured by the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility (PLUS-M) 12-item short form. The PLUS-M questionnaire provides a T-score that ranges from 21.8 to 71.4. Higher PLUS-M scores correspond with greater mobility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-perceived activity restrictions (TAPES-AR) compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after fitting with Revo-M</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline level of activity restrictions as measured by the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales Activity Restrictions subscale (TAPES-AR). The TAPES-AR questionnaire provides a score ranging from 0 to 2. A high score is indicative of activity restriction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects showing improvement in walking endurance or perceived exertion in the 6-minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after fitting with Revo-M</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects showing an improvement in baseline walking endurance as measured by the distance walked in the six minute walk test OR a decrease in the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) as measured by Borg CR100 while wearing the Revo-M. A clinically-significant improvement in the 6MWT is defined as a change in distance of greater than 45 meters. A clinically-significant improvement in the RPE is defined as a change greater than 10 points. The Borg CR100 scale has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. Greater scores indicate higher perceived exertion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient perceived balance (ABC) compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after fitting with Revo-M</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline perception of balance confidence as measured by the extended Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale. The questionnaire provides a score that ranges from 0 to 100%. Higher scores indicate greater balance confidence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional satisfaction with prosthesis (TAPES-FUN) compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after fitting with Revo-M</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the level of functional satisfaction as measured by the TAPES Functional Satisfaction (TAPES-FUN) subscale while wearing the Revo-M compared to the everyday feet. The subscale provides a score that ranges from 5 to 15. Higher scores indicate greater functional satisfaction.</description>

             unstable cardiovascular conditions that preclude physical activity such as walking,
             problems with vestibular system, etc.).

          6. Ulceration or skin breakdown of the residual limb.

          7. Person currently has residual limb issues that significantly reduce their ability to
