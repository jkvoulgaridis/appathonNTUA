  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of non-narcotic multi-modal analgesia to be used in the pre-operative, peri-operative
      and post-operative period to reduce or potentially eliminate narcotic usage following scrotal
      surgery. Research study results have shown that the use of anti-inflammatories in the
      peri-operative period reduces both pain and narcotic use. The hypothesis is that adding
      another agent in the multi-modal pathway will further reduce pain and potentially reduce
      narcotic usage.

      This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial that will recruit patients
      categorized into two study arms. Patients in the gabapentin arm will receive gabapentin 600mg
      taken pre-operatively and 300mg taken three times a day for 3 days, while patients in the
      placebo arm will receive a placebo drug taken pre-operatively three times a day for 3 days.
