  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      robotic-assisted endovascular embolization procedures compared to objective performance
      criteria for traditional, manual operation based on the scientific literature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, international, multi- center, non-inferiority study to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the CorPath GRX System for endovascular cerebral
      aneurysm embolization compared to historical controls. Subject selection requires a clinical
      indication for endovascular coil and/or stent-assist coiling embolization of cerebral
      aneurysms.
