    <description>16 and 20 aqua polo sessions (adapted water polo) over a period of 20 weeks, at the rate of one session per week at the Cercle des Nageurs de Marseille (CNM). They will be divided into 3 cycles imitating the preparation of the season of a high-level athlete: a first cycle intended for physical preparation, a second cycle intended for practical learning (technique and tactics) and the third cycle for preparation of a mini tournament.
Each session will be organized as follows: 1 hour of training in the water followed by 30 min of &quot;debriefing&quot; as a team or individually with the coach. The announced duration of the session will be 2 hours, transport and changing rooms included.</description>

    <description>Validated questionnaires in French will measure fatigue, quality of life, post-traumatic growth and the coach-athlete relationship. All questionnaires will be administered face to face before the sessions by a member of the social psychology research team.
The collection of qualitative data (semi-structured interviews) will be carried out by one of the members of the research team in social psychology on three occasions (inclusion, Week 10 and Week 20) in order to assess the psychological variables of interest (quality interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, post-traumatic growth) and their dynamics.
Physiological variables (weight, fat / lean mass, capacity of the operated arm) will be evaluated monthly. The physical measurement data will be recorded in an electronic case report form</description>
