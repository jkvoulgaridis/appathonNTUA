  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulation in pregnancy has been proposed to decrease stress and anxiety, increasing preterm
      birth. Whether ambulation is causally related to latency is unknown. The FitBit will be used
      for tracking the number of steps taken daily by each participant, and for encouraging the
      intervention group to walk. The FitBit is the most widely used physical activity tracker in
      medical research, and its use has been validated for research use in pregnant women. The
      purpose of the study is to evaluate whether ambulation in patients with preterm premature
      rupture of the membranes (PPROM) prolongs latency.

    <description>Participants in the ambulation arm will be allowed ad lib activity and instructed that they should walk at least once per day out of their room with a goal of 2,000 steps per day. The Fitbit InspireTM devices will be set to this goal and notifications will be given on the device for the participants meeting their goals. Upon enrollment, they will be given a pamphlet with instructions to ambulate out of the room at least once per day with a goal of 2,000 steps daily and their Fitbits will be pre-programmed with this goal. Study staff will also remind participants to ambulate via email, text or in-person if they are not meeting their goal of 2,000 steps per day.</description>
