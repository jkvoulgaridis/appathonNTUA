      The purpose of this study is to describe the Crohn's Disease (CD)-related secondary
      healthcare resource utilisation of patients in the 6 months pre- and 12 months

    <description>Adult participants with moderate to severe CD who agree to be part of the study and who fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria and use Care4Today inflammatory bowel disease (C4T IBD) alongside standard of care (SOC) at participating centers will be observed. Data available per clinical practice and via the C4T IBD application will be collected within this study. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires that are sent directly to the patients, which are not completed as part of clinical practice or via the application. Relevant data will be collected by prospectively following participants from the index date for 12 months, and also by retrospectively collecting data for the 6-month period prior to the index date from participant's medical records. Index is the activation date of C4T IBD application in participant's smartphone.</description>
