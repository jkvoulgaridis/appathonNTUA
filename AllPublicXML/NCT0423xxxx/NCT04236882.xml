    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well sleep and physical activity interventions work in increasing the
      physical activity of overweight or obese and sedentary African Americans. Sleep and physical
      activity interventions may help to increase physical activity among overweight and obese
      African American adults who do not get enough exercise.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility and satisfaction of a brief sleep intervention prior to or
      following a physical activity (PA) intervention and a contact control among overweight/obese
      sedentary African Americans.

      II. Examine experiences of sleep among overweight/obese sedentary African Americans using
      qualitative focus groups.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pilot test and evaluate the efficacy and sequential effects of a brief sleep intervention
      prior to or following a PA intervention in improving sleep, increasing physical activity, and
      reducing sedentary behavior, compared to a contact control group.

      II. Explore the correlations among psychosocial (e.g., perceived stress, affect, neighborhood
      characteristics), biomarker (e.g., non-fasting glucose levels, blood pressure), and health
      behavior (e.g., diet and sedentary behavior) with sleep and PA.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive a web-based sleep intervention during weeks 1-4. Participants
      then receive 2 web-based health coaching sessions over 30-45 minutes consisting of topics
      such as healthy shopping, increasing physical activity, identifying barriers, and eating out
      at weeks 5 and 7. Participants may optionally complete an interview over 1 hour at week 9.

      GROUP II: Participants receive 2 web-based health coaching sessions over 30-45 minutes
      consisting of topics such as healthy shopping, increasing physical activity, identifying
      barriers, and eating out at weeks 1 and 3. Participants then receive a web-based sleep
      intervention during weeks 5-8. Participants may optionally complete an interview over 1 hour
      at week 9.

      GROUP III: Participants receive educational material on healthy homes. Participants also
      receive 2 web-based health coaching sessions over 30-45 minutes consisting of topics such as
      healthy shopping, increasing physical activity, identifying barriers, and eating out at weeks
      1 and 3. Participants may optionally complete an interview over 1 hour at week 9.
