    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, multicenter study is to determine the long-term safety,
      pharmacokinetics and effects of ALK-001 (C20-D3-retinyl acetate) on the progression of
      Stargardt disease. This study is an extension of NCT02402660 and enrolls participants who are
      at least 8 years old. Enrollment is by invitation only.
