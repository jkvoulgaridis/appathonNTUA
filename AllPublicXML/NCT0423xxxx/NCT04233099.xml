      BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: The paucity of biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients
      affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is one of the greatest concerns in ALS
      clinics and research. Phenotypic signs, electrophysiological test and clinical scales are
      currently used for ALS diagnosis and follow up before and after treatments. Nowadays, the
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis used to discriminate ALS from other comparable
      neurodegenerative diseases, are time-consuming and complex processes that reduce the time for
      a prompt intervention. Thus, the scientific community is asked to strive for new, measurable,
      fast and objective biomarkers for the diagnosis and stratification of patients. Saliva is a
      complex biofluid composed of bioactive molecules that can be collected by means of a
      non-invasive procedure. The possibility to simultaneously monitor all the variations in the
      endocrine, electrolytic and metabolic messengers in saliva has recently suggested its use for
      the diagnosis of complex diseases, like neurodegenerative diseases, but only limited
      information are available on the potential of saliva as alternative carrier of ALS
      biomarkers.

      OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present project is to optimize an innovative, non-invasive and
      fast procedure for the ALS onset and for the stratification of ALS patients, taking advantage
      of the sensitivity of Raman Spectroscopy (RS) and of accessible saliva. Fondazione Don
      Gnocchi (FDG) preliminary results on a small cohort of subjects demonstrated the feasibility
      of the methodology and the ability of LABION protocol to obtain a reproducible Raman
      fingerprint of saliva that can be used for the discrimination of healthy subjects, ALS
      patients and subjects affected by other types of neurological diseases.

      METHODS: Starting from FDG preliminary results, the biochemical composition of saliva in
      patients with diagnosed ALS will be evaluated and statistically compared with the one
      obtained from age and sex-matched healthy subjects and from patients affected by other
      neurological diseases (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases). Moreover, an intra-group ALS
      clustering will be analysed in order to verify a different Raman fingerprint obtained from
      ALS patients with a bulbar or spinal onset. The collected Raman data will be processed using
      a multivariate analysis approach through Principal Component Analysis - Linear Discriminant
      Analysis (PCA-LDA). The classification model will be created using cross-validation and
      subset validation. Thanks to RS, the overall composition of saliva will be established with
      minimal sample preparation, providing comprehensive biochemical fingerprint of the sample. In
      parallel, routine salivary parameters will be measured including viscosity, pH, total protein
      and carbohydrates concentration, amylase and pepsin, cortisol and Chromogranin A.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: By the end of this study, the investigators expected to verify the
      possibility to use the Raman salivary pattern as new promising biomarker for ALS diagnosis
      and progression to be related with clinical scales for the personalized and fine tuning of
      the therapeutic approach. The intent of this project is to create a classification model able
      to:

        1. Determine the ALS onset

        2. Discriminate the signal obtained from ALS patients from the one collected from other
           neurodegenerative diseases

        3. Stratify ALS patients into bulbar and spinal onset

        4. Correlate the Raman data with clinical and paraclinical scales used nowadays for ALS
           diagnosis and monitoring

      SAMPLE COLLECTION: Saliva collection from all the selected subjects will be performed
      following the Salivette (SARSTEDT) manufacturer's instructions. To limit variability in
      salivary content not related to ALS, saliva will be obtained from all subjects at a fixed
      time, after an appropriate lag time from feeding and teeth brushing. Pre-analytical
      parameters (i.e. storage temperature and time between collection and processing), dietary and
      smoking habit will be properly recorded. Briefly, the swab will be removed, placed in the
      mouth and chewed for 60 seconds to stimulate salivation. Then the swab will be centrifuged
      for 2 minutes at 1,000 g to remove cells fragments and food debris. Collected samples will be
      stored at -80° C.

      SAMPLE PROCESSING: Before the Raman acquisition, saliva samples will be filtered with
      different cut-off ranges (3, 10 and 30 kDa), collecting and analysing by RS the eluted sample
      and discarding the concentrated counterpart. For the Raman analysis, a drop of each sample
      will be casted on an aluminium foil in order to achieve the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
      (SERS).

      DATA COLLECTION: Raman and SERS spectra will be acquired using an Aramis Raman microscope
      (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a laser light source operating at 785 nm with laser
      power ranging from 25-100% (Max power 512 mW). Acquisition time between 10-30 seconds will be
      used. The instrument will be calibrated before each analysis using the reference band of
      silicon at 520.7 cm-1. Raman spectra will be collected from 15 points following a line-map
      from the edge to the centre of the drop. Spectra will be acquired in the region between 400
      and 1800 cm−1 using a 50x objective (Olympus, Japan). Spectra resolution is about 1.2 cm-1.
      The software package LabSpec 6 (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) will be used for map design and
      the acquisition of spectra.

      DATA PROCESSING: All the acquired spectra will be fit with a fifth-degree polynomial baseline
      and normalized by unit vector using the dedicated software LabSpec 6. The contribution of the
      substrate will be removed from each spectra. The statistical analysis to validate the method,
      will be performed using a multivariate analysis approach. Principal Component analysis (PCA)
      will be performed in order to reduce data dimensions and to evidence major trends. The first
      20 resultant Principal Components (PCs) will be used in a classification model, Linear
      Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to discriminate the data maximizing the variance between the
      selected groups. The smallest number of PCs will be selected to prevent data overfitting.
      Leave-one-out cross-validation and confusion matrix test will be used to evaluate the method
      sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the LDA model. Mann-Whitney will be performed on PCs
      scores to verify the differences statistically relevant between the analysed groups.
      Correlation and partial correlation analysis will be performed using the Spearman's test,
      assuming as valid correlation only the coefficients with a p-value lower than 0.05. The
      statistical analysis will be performed using Origin2018 (OriginLab, USA).
