  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well itacitinib works for the treatment of bronchiolitis
      obliterans syndrome after donor hematopoietic cell transplant. Itacitinib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the safety of itacitinib in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
      (BOS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment failure at 3 months and 6 months. II. To assess change in
      symptom-based lung score at 3 months and 6 months. III. To assess change in the St. George
      Respiratory Questionnaire and Study Short Form 36 at 3 months and 6 months.

      IV. To assess change in the Lee chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) symptom scale at 3
      months and 6 months post-treatment.

      V. To assess change in 6-minute walk test at 3 months and 6 months. VI. To assess
      failure-free survival at 6 months. VII. To assess non-relapse mortality at 6 months. VIII. To
      assess overall survival at 6 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patents receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
