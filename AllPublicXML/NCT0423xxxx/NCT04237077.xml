  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the last few decades, developed societies have been evolving towards a global aging of
      their populations. This evolution has been accompanied by the problematic of the dependence
      of aging populations. Dependence is today a challenge posed to social, healthcare or
      medico-social organizations.

      Many studies have shown the positive effect of changes in health (physical activity,
      nutrition, socialization) on functional abilities of aged subjects. Intervention at subject's
      home is an easy and inexpensive way to delay the onset of dependence in the elderly
      population. Health coaching is defined as &quot;a regular series of phone calls between the
      patient and the health care professional to support and encourage the patient and promote
      healthy behaviors such as treatment control, healthy eating and physical activity &quot;.

    <description>Evolution of autonomy score between inclusion and 12 months follow up. The autonomy score (on 14 points) is the sum of the Katz's Activities of Daily Living (on 6 points) and the Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (on 8 points).
Katz's Activities of Daily Living comprises 6 items (bathing, dressing, transferring, using the toilet, eating, continence).
Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily comprises 8 items (ability to use the telephone, do the shopping, meal preparation, do the housework, do the laundry, use public transport, take responsibility for own medication and manage a budget.)</description>
