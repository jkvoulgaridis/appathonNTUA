  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new leg compression device in
      preventing post-surgical deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) that can occur after major and
      complex spine surgery. We aim to show that this new compression device is no worse than the
      standard sequential compression device (SCD) at preventing DVT and may be able to detect deep
      vein thrombosis in patients who are not typically screened for this diagnosis after surgery.
      This new device may be able to capture an important post-surgical complication while
      providing a more comfortable treatment option.

    <textblock>
      Compression therapy of the leg is a proven and well-established modality to prevent deep vein
      thrombosis in immobilized and post-surgical patients. We aim to compare a new sequential
      compression for the leg that utilizes a servo motor for compression as opposed to a
      traditional pneumatic motor that is typically used in the hospital and after surgery.
      Pneumatic sequential compression devices are cumbersome, expensive and not mobile. This new
      compression device was developed to provide a cheaper, mobile device that can be worn by the
      patient after surgery and while at home during ambulation. The addition of the servo motor
      and fine sensors may also be able to detect sub-clinical DVT's that contribute to
      post-surgical pulmonary embolus and post-surgical complications. We aim to learn how this new
      device performs in the subset of patients undergoing complex spine surgery, the incidence of
      post-surgical DVT with this new device compared to traditional SCD and if this new device is
      capable of detecting sub-clinical post-surgical DVT.
