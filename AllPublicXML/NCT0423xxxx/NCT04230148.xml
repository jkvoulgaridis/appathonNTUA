  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, non-comparative, single arm multi-country study in
      approximately 300 adult and pediatric subjects (≥ 6 years of age) with fascioliasis. The
      study population consists of male and female adult and pediatric patients (≥ 6 years of age).
      The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects with acute (minimum 15% of overall study
      population) or chronic fascioliasis. Enrolled subjects will receive two doses of 10 mg/kg of
      Egaten given approximately 12 hours apart. Subjects will be treated and followed up on an
      outpatient basis. After screening and post treatment, at Day 3 and Day 6 the subjects will be
      followed for safety and tolerability. These visits are primarily for safety follow up and may
      be telephonic or home visit by qualified personnel or onsite visits based on the
      investigator's discretion. During visits Day 10, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90 post-treatment,
      the subjects will be followed for safety, tolerability and efficacy. On Day 15, Day 45 and
      Day 75, telephonic follow-up (primarily for safety) will be conducted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study protocol specific
             assessment is performed.

               1. Parental/legal guardian informed consent must be obtained and signed for
                  pediatric subjects (formally documented and witnessed, via an independent trusted
                  witness) prior to any study related procedure.

               2. Subjects &lt; 18 years old, who are capable of providing assent, must provide assent
                  with parental/legal guardian consent or as per local ethical guidelines.
