  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how 2 different semaglutide versions reach and stay in the blood after
      injection. The study aims to show similar levels of semaglutide in the blood when using the
      different semaglutide versions. Participants will get 1 of the 2 versions of semaglutide -
      which version is decided by chance. One version is the one that doctors already can prescribe
      and the other is the new version. Participants will get the medicine as an injection under
      the skin of the belly with a pen-injector. The type of pen-injector is different for the 2
      versions of semaglutide. Participants will receive 7 once-weekly injections in total. The
      study will last for about 80-106 days. Participants will have 19 study visits with the study
      doctor. For 2 of the visits, participants will stay in the clinic, 1 visit for 2 days and 1
      night and the other visit for 4 days and 3 nights. Participants may have to stop the study if
      the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Participants cannot take part
      in this study if they have any disease or disorder that the study doctor thinks is a health
      problem. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant
      during the study period.

             g alcohol daily for women -12 g of alcohol equals about 300 mL of beer or lager, 100
             mL of wine, or 25 mL spirits)

          -  Positive alcohol test at screening
