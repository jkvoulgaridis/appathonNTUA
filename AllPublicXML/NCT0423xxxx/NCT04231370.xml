      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab in combination
      with lenalidomide in the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma patients who
      failed pegaspargase-based regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pegaspargase is the backbone of treatment for NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), and patients with
      ENKTCL who failed pegaspargase-based regimens have extremely poor survival outcomes. Previous
      study has confirmed the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies (including pembrolizumab or
      sintilimab). Constitutive activation of NF-kB pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in
      the development of ENKTCL and plays critical role in therapy resistance. Lenalidomide, an
      immuno-modulatory drug, has been found to inhibit NF-kB pathway, and synergize with anti-PD-1
      antibody in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of
      lenalidomide and sintilimab will further deepen the remission status and benefit patients who
      failed pegaspargase-based regimens.
