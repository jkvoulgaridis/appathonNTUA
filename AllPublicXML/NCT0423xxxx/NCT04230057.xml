      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose oral pharmacokinetics of an herbal
      supplement - Antitumor B - in healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antitumor B (ATB), also known as Zeng Sheng Ping, is a Chinese herbal mixture composed of six
      plants: Sophora tonkinensis, Polygonum bistorta, Prunella vulgaris, Sonchus brachyotus,
      Dictamnus dasycarpus, and Dioscorea bulbifera. ATB is available as 300 mg tablets and has
      been traditionally used in China for dysplasia (dose 4-8 tables/ twice daily). Several
      studies in rodents and humans have been published demonstrating the chemopreventive activity
      of ATB against various cancers (e.g. lung, esophageal and oral). However, we currently do not
      know what pharmacologically relevant concentration levels can be achieved systemically for
      different components of ATB in humans. Since it is a complex herbal mixture containing
      various key active components (KACs), relative levels of KACs in the ATB mixture can
      influence the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic of the individual KACs. The proposed study
      aim to estimate the plasma concentration of four key active components in a tablet with a
      chemical-defined ATB mixture. We are interested in doing a human single-dose (8 tablets once)
      full pharmacokinetic study of ATB tablets. We plan to collect 9 blood and 9 saliva samples
      from 8 healthy volunteers over a period of 24 hrs (at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24
      hrs) to

        1. determine the saliva and plasma concentration of four key constituents of ATB (matrine,
           dictamnine, maackiain, fraxinellone) and

        2. develop the in vivo correlation between plasma and saliva concentrations
