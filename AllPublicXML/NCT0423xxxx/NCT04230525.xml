  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Independent form anesthetic methods, during C/S, considering both maternal and fetal
      conditions, some crucial hemodynamic changes can appear and can be claimed non invasively
      with the whole body bioimpedance. In this research, any kind of hemodynamic difference
      between this method and urgent or elective C/S case will be detected and the clinic pursuit
      can be developed creating an advantage in favor of both maternal and fetal conditions.

      general anesthesia, measuring the hemodynamic changes with the method of non-invasive
      whole-body bioimpedance system during C/S.

      Detection of in which phase of operations the potential changes densify and differences
      between urgent and elective conditions non invasively.

    <description>Noninvasive hemodynamic changes will be observed by using whole-body impedance method urgent or elective cesarian section patients under general anesthesia. The whole-body bioimpedance method will be used to monitör the hemodynamic changes non invasively. This method can evaluate such as cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volüme, stroke index, stroke volüme variations, cardiac reserve, etc. Parameters with a completely noninvasive method by using only electrots. The device consists of a laptop, a software which calculates cardiac parameters and two electrodes. The measurement is done by the following process: one of these electrodes, which looks like ECG electrodes, is stuck to the wrist and the other one to the opposite ankle or each one to two wrists.</description>
