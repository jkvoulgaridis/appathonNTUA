  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves an emergency department (ED)-based intervention utilizing Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) techniques and patient-centered eHealth materials (e.g., a tailored,
      mobile-friendly website and text messages) to promote the correct and consistent use of
      size-appropriate child passenger restraints (car seats, booster seats, and seat belts). This
      study is designed as an adaptive randomized controlled trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remain the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths among
      children in the United States (U.S.) and racial/ethnic minority children are
      disproportionately impacted as suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors are more prevalent
      in some communities. Existing universal approaches to promote child passenger safety have
      fallen short of ensuring that all child passengers are correctly using size-appropriate child
      passenger restraints according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics
      and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Precision prevention programs are
      urgently needed to improve child passenger safety behaviors among caregivers who have not
      been responsive to guidelines, laws, and public education campaigns. The proposed research
      will test the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal (TCBD), an emergency department (ED)-based
      precision prevention intervention grounded in Self-Determination Theory. TCBD integrates
      personalized counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and eHealth
      components including a tailored educational mobile-friendly website &quot;site&quot; and short message
      service (SMS) communications with the goal of improving child passenger safety. We
      hypothesize that by providing tailored child passenger safety education and personalized
      skills for restraint use in a manner that supports autonomous motivation the TCBD
      intervention will be more efficacious than universal approaches (laws/guidelines) for
      realizing correct use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints.

    <intervention_model_description>After the baseline survey, all participants will be randomized into one of two groups: 1) control group or 2) basic intervention group. Block randomization (block sizes from four to eight) will be applied to assign eligible subjects to their group in a 3:1 ratio. Blocks will be stratified by age groups related to child passenger safety recommendations and the child passenger safety behavior that led to eligibility for study (not using the recommended restraint currently or planning a premature transition in the coming 6 months).
After the 6-month follow-up, subjects in the intervention group only who continue suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the basic or enhanced intervention. The enhanced group will get another motivational interviewing (MI) session by phone in Month 7/8 and 1-2 additional tailored text messages in Months 7-12 (7 tailored tips during these months compared with 4 tailored tips for those in the basic group).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a single-blinded study where a portion of the study will include blinding of study team members who are assessing outcomes. The blinding will not include the participants.
The portion of the study that includes blinding are the monthly photo submissions that participants will send us via text message over the course of 12 months. Study team members that directly enroll participants in the ED will not be able to review any monthly photo submissions from those families they recruited. They will only be able to review and score [using the Child Passenger Safety Score (CPaSS) tool] photo submissions of families that they did not directly enroll, so they are blinded to which study arm the family is enrolled in.
Study team members that are only assisting with the review and scoring (using the CPaSS tool) of photo submissions each month will be blinded to the study arm for all participants enrolled.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to this arm after completion of the baseline survey. They will receive no intervention throughout the study.
Group 1 will not have access to the study's website throughout the study. They will gain access to the site after their 12-month follow-up appointment.
All participants will complete the baseline visit and a 6- and 12- month follow-up appointment. Also, all participants will get text messages related to monthly photo requests and receive the same study handouts.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to this arm after completion of the baseline survey. They will receive the motivational interviewing intervention in the ED or after an ED visit.
Group 2 will gain access to the study's website after completion of the baseline survey. The site will provide custom feedback based on their answers within the surveys regarding how their child normally rides in a car and general child passenger safety practices.
All participants will complete the baseline visit and a 6- and 12- month follow-up appointment. Also, all participants will receive text messages related to monthly photo requests and receive the same study handouts. Group 2 will receive additional tailored text messages each month based on their answers within the surveys.</description>

    <description>Participants could be randomized to this arm after completion of their 6 month follow-up visit if they are continuing suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors. Only participants in group 2 could be re-randomized to group 3.
In addition to the Group 2 intervention elements described above, Group 3 will receive a second motivational interviewing session (by phone) after the 6-month follow-up assessment.
Group 3 will receive more frequent tailored text messages between months 7-12 based on their answers within the surveys.</description>
