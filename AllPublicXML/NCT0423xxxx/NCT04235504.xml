      The purpose of this study evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop
      (AHCL) system in sub‐optimally controlled patients with T1D, in comparison with Multiple
      Daily Injection (MDI) therapy with Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) or Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring (CGM). Patient with a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes currently under MDI+ FGM or
      MDI+ CGM therapy will be enrolled.

      This study is a pre‐market, multi‐center, prospective, open label, adaptative, randomized
      controlled trial in insulin‐requiring adult subjects with type 1 diabetes on MDI therapy. The
      study will have three period:

        1. Run-in Phase: The Run-in period is of 4 weeks (and can be extended for 2 additional
           ones) during which time a blinded CGM sensor will be worn for two weeks.

        2. Study Phase: There will be a 6 months randomized study period with two arms: Treatment
           Arm (AHCL) and the Control Arm.

        3. Continuation Phase: There will be a 6 months continuation phase during which time all
           the subjects will use the AHCL system.

      Approximately 124 subjects will be enrolled in the study up to 20 investigational centers in
      EMEA.
