  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite good progress in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), this
      arrhythmia remains one of the major causes of stroke, heart failure, sudden death, and
      cardiovascular morbidity in the world. Furthermore, the number of patients with AF is
      predicted to rise steply in the coming years.

      Even if the amount of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) is constantly increasing, there is a group
      of patients who has AF, resistant to AAD therapy. In such cases they are being offered
      alternative minimally invasive procedures, such as catheter or thoracoscopic ablation. With
      the discovery that AF often is initiated and maintained by electrical instability inside and
      around the pulmonary veins (PV) catheter and thoracoscopic ablation are now widely accepted
      invasive strategies to cure AF.

      Even though the results of both of the procedures are very promising in treating patients
      with paroxysmal AF, the decision making process, which approach should be used in patients
      with persistant or LSPAF, is still very controversial.

      According to 2016 ESC Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in
      collaboration with EACTS, catheter or surgical ablation should be considered in patients with
      symptomatic persistent or long-standing persistent (LSP) AF refractory to AAD therapy to
      improve symptoms, considering patient choice, benefit and risk, supported by an AF Heart Team
      (IIaC).

      Since, there is no actual evidence base, which approach is more effective and save in
      patients with persistant and LSP AF, the aim of the investigator's study is to evaluate the
      results of both of the approaches in such group of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare 2 approaches for AF treatment, endocardial catheter
      isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV) versus minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgical
      epicardial ablation.

      The patients in both groups will be comparable and have persistant or LSP AF only. Patients
      with previous catheter ablations or any interventions or open heart procedures in the
      anamnesis will be excluded. The catheter ablation will be Ablation Index-guided, which means
      that every ablation point will be taken according to ablation quality marker which corporates
      power, delivery time, contact force (CF), and catheter stability, called Ablation Index (AI).
      Both of the procedures will be performed by a single identical protocol including wide
      complete circumferential ablation around the right and left PVs, and additional lines between
      the lower and upper PVs. The thoracoscopic procedure will be supplemented with removal of
      left atrial appendage (LAA).

      In cases of AF or other atrial tachycardia recurrence after both procedures, every patient
      will undergo the opposite procedure (for example, if patient after thoracoscopic ablation
      will be diagnosed an AF recurrence, he will undergo catheter ablation). That is why there
      will be the third group, the so-called Hybrid procedure group of patients.
