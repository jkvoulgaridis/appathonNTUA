        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum with synchronous
             metastatic disease (localized in liver or in liver and lung) eligible for surgery
             immediately or after neo-adjuvant treatment.

          2. Planned primary treatment at one of the REDCLOUD participating hospital centers.

          3. Evidence of at least one measurable lesion, as per RECIST 1.1.

          4. Male or female â‰¥ 18 years of age at time of informed consent.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. No prior
             chemotherapy neither for localized nor for metastatic disease.

          6. No major comorbidities that would preclude the compliance with the planned therapeutic
             program as judged by the Investigator.

          7. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          8. Availability of biological samples (blood and tumor tissue).

          9. Patients enrolled in local prospective protocols, in which samples have been collected
             according REDCLOUD procedures may be included.

         10. Signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any physical or medical condition that would contraindicate chemotherapy and/or
             surgery.

          2. Any other metastatic site, except for liver and lung metastases

          3. Transplant recipients

          4. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Note: HIV testing will
             only be conducted in jurisdictions specifically requiring it.

          5. Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          6. Pregnant or lactating women

          7. Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of localized basal and squamous cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in
             situ adequately treated
