  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide attempts (SA) constitute a major public health issue worldwide. Research suggests
      that 2.7% of adult people ever attempt suicide; among children and adolescents this is
      estimated to be 6.0%. SA are related to subsequent suicide which represents an annual loss of
      34.6 million years of life worldwide. Suicide attempts are also related to persistent
      physical and mental health issues, psychiatric hospitalizations, impaired academic
      performance, unemployment, partner abuse victimization and perpetration, having children
      removed by social services, loneliness, relationship difficulties, impaired social
      functioning and low life satisfaction. Despite this considerable societal impact, there is a
      lack of epidemiological research focussing on providing suicide attempt surveillance in the
      population, to inform public health action aimed at reducing risk for suicide attempts in the
      population, and to provide data-driven support for suicide risk assessment across healthcare
      settings. To address this shortcoming, the investigators designed the Catalonia Suicide Risk
      Code Epidemiology study. Using centralized Electronic Healthcare Record data from the entire
      public healthcare system of Catalonia, Spain, the CSRC-Epi study aims to estimate reliable
      suicide incidence rates, identify suicide attempt risk factors, and develop validated suicide
      attempt risk prediction tools.

    <description>The target population consists of the dynamic cohort of all Catalan residents during the 6-year period 2014-2019. Annual total population of Catalonia is between 7.5-7.6 million, with annual rates for immigration, emigration, birth and death being ~2.5%, ~1.9%, ~0.9%, and ~0.8%, respectively. Based on these figures, we expect a maximum of ~9.1 million individuals with Catalan residency status on at least one point in time over the 2014-2019 period. However, we expect SA in Catalonia to be extremely rare before the age of 10, in line with findings that self-injurious behaviour generally occurs as from the adolescent period. We will therefore exclude cases and controls that have not reached age 10 by the end of the 2014-2019 period (i.e., ~10.9%), lowering the total expected target population to ~8.1 million.</description>
