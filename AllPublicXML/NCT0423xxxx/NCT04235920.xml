      The aim of this study is to assess the use of ASPECTS and stroke biomarkers to predict the
      outcome and cognitive impairment in acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      150 patients (79 males, and 71 females with a mean age of 64.05±11.55 years) were included in
      this study presented by acute middle cerebral artery territory ischemic stroke. Vascular risk
      factors were determined from the history taking. Assessment of GCS and NIHSS at the initial
      presentation was done to assess the stroke severity. Cognitive functions were evaluated in
      all study participants by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Arabic version. An initial
      and follow up non-contrast CT brain was done after 7 days which were assessed by ASPECTS.
      Functional outcomes in stroke cases were assessed after three months by Glasgow Coma Scale,
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale. Biomarkers of cognitive
      impairment like ESR, CRP, S100B, MMP9 and glutamate were evaluated.

    <measure>Assessment of CT brain was done by ASPECTS.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ASPECTS scoring was calculated for all patients. CT brain images were assessed for proof of localized parenchymal hypo-attenuation, loss of differentiation between gray and white matter, and if there is effacement of sulci. ASPECTS gives reliable methods for evaluation of ischemic stroke by utilizing a ten-point score &quot;M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, I: insula, IC: internal capsule, L: lentiform, and C: caudate&quot; everyone represents one point. A Score of 10 means a normal CT scan. One point is decreased for each affected area on the CT brain. So, a score of 0 indicates widespread ischemia affecting the MCA territory</description>

        79 males and 71 females with a mean age of 64.05 ±11.55 were included in this study and
        were admitted with the first attack of acute MCA territory infarction within 2 days from
        the onset and aged more than 18 years. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was defined as a rapidly
        developing neurological deficit with an obvious known onset, and an initial CT brain with
        no proof of ICH.
