      This protocol is a Phase 2 multi-site study which aims to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of MYDAYIS&amp;#174; as adjunctive therapy for adults with bipolar depression.
      Results from this study WILL NOT be used to contribute to an approval of MYDAYIS &amp;#174; for
      this indication.
