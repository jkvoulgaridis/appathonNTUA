  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives delivered in
      real-time at point of purchase, on low-income consumers' purchase of fruits and vegetables,
      fruits and vegetables consumption, diet quality, and weight/BMI. The study will test
      real-time incentives compared to a no-incentive control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address diet quality disparities in low-income families, policy makers and health experts
      recommend strategies such as financial incentives to promote consumption of fruits and
      vegetables. Real-time incentives for purchasing fruits and vegetables are promising
      strategies to improve families' diets and health.

      The aims of the study are:

        1. To test the effects of financial incentives, delivered in real-time at the point of
           purchase, on low-income consumer purchases of fruits and vegetables

        2. To evaluate the impact of real-time financial incentives compared to a control condition
           on FV consumption among adults and their children ,shopping habits, home food
           environments, diet quality, and weight/BMI

        3. To adapt mobile platform technology to provide regular feedback to participants to
           motivate use of the incentive program to increase purchases and consumption of fruits
           and vegetables

        4. To evaluate participant satisfaction with real-time healthy food choice incentives
           technology in both SNAP participants and income-eligible non-SNAP participants

        5. To assess the acceptability and ease of use of real-time healthy food choice incentives
           technology among retails supermarket managers and staff in low-income neighborhoods.

Only eligible fruits and vegetables products (fresh and select frozen and canned FV) will be included in the primary outcome data. FV purchases will be measured by type of FV in pounds, and converted into servings as defined as edible cup equivalents using USDA Economic Research Service estimates.</description>
