      efficacy and safety of INCMGA00012 in Advanced Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma

    <textblock>
      Men age ≥ 18 years with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PSqCC stage 4 (i.e. T4 or
      N3 or M1) that are presenting with radiologic progression of disease (PD) following or not
      standard treatment with chemotherapy.

      After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will receive INCMGA00012 500 mg by
      intravenous infusion on Day1 of each cycle, once every four weeks for up to 2 years.

      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.

      Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up
      period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every
      3 months (± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product until the end of study
      (EoS).
