  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well durvalumab and epacadostat work in treating patients
      with Epstein-Barr virus positive nasopharyngeal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable), has come back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic). Epacadostat blocks the enzyme, IDO1, from working. Blocking this enzyme may
      allow for a stronger immune response against cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving durvalumab and
      epacadostat may work better in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer compared to
      durvalumab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine whether adding an IDO inhibitor to PD-L1 antibody therapy improves the
      probability of remission in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether adding an IDO inhibitor to PD-L1 antibody therapy improves long-term
      clinical outcomes in NPC.

      II. Determine whether the combination of durvalumab and epacadostat in recurrent and
      metastatic NPC patients is safe and well tolerated.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify potential associations between pre-treatment and on-treatment regulatory and
      effector immune cell populations and clinical outcomes in NPC patients treated with
      durvalumab and epacadostat.

      II. Characterize the oral and fecal microbiome in responding and non-responding patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and epacadostat orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 12 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression who are
      benefiting from treatment in the opinion of the principal investigator may continue
      durvalumab and epacadostat for up to an additional 12 months from the initiation (or
      re-initiation) of treatment on study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until start of a
      new anti-cancer treatment, until 30 days after documented disease progression, until death,
      or until 36 months from the initiation of treatment on study, whichever comes first.

             measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
             (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally
