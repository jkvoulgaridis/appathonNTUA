  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examine the effect of Pericapsular Nerve Group (PENG) Block on analgesia after
      elective hip arthroplasty. Half of participants will receive a PENG Block with local
      anesthetic, while the other half will receive a PENG Block with a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimized analgesia is crucial for early mobilization after hip arthroplasty. Regional
      anesthesia, like fascia iliaca block or femoral nerve block, have limited indication because
      of motor blockade whereas local infiltrations analgesia have shown conflicting analgesic
      efficacy results in hip arthroplasty.

      Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a new regional anesthesia technique targeting
      specifically sensory nerve branches of the hip articulation. It has been originally described
      in hip fracture patients.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PENG block on analgesia after elective
      hip arthroplasty.
