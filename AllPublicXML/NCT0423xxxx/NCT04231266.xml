  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GNE myopathy is a rare genetic muscle disease characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and
      weakness. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme that
      initiates and regulates N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) biosynthesis and glycan sialylation.
      Currently, there is no therapy available for this disease. N-Acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), an
      orphan drug in development for GNE myopathy, is an uncharged monosaccharide and the first
      committed precursor in Neu5Ac biosynthesis. In this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial the efficacy and long-term safety of ManNAc will be evaluated in
      subjects with GNE myopathy.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study to evaluate the
      long-term safety and clinical efficacy of ManNAc in subjects with GNE myopathy.

      A total of 51 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ManNAc at
      4 g three times daily (total of 12 g/day) or placebo. Subjects will have follow-up visits
      every 6 months (±7 days) and take study drug for a minimum of 24 months, until their final
      study visit . The final on-site study visit for a subject is the last expected 6-month
      follow-up visit that occurs prior to the time the last randomized subject is expected to
      reach 24 months (extended follow-up).

      Subjects will undergo screening and baseline evaluations that include clinical laboratory
      tests, Quantitative Muscle Assessment (QMA), the GNE Myopathy Physical Function Scale
      (GNEM-PFS), other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and rehabilitation medicine functional
      assessments. Follow-up evaluations will occur every six months following baseline, until 24
      months after randomization of the last subject. Phone follow-up will occur every month
      without a clinic visit for the duration of the trial, and the last visit for each subject
      will be followed by phone follow-up 1 month after stopping study drug.

      The primary endpoint is the change in muscle strength of ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion,
      knee extension, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and grip reported as proportion of
      predicted strength. Muscle strength will be measured by fixed-frame Quantitative Muscle
      Assessment (QMA; Aeverl Medical).

      The primary analysis is based on comparing the rate of disease progression under placebo to
      that under treatment. The design of the trial is based on a Disease Progression Model of GNE
      myopathy that was generated using QMA muscle strength data collected in subjects with GNE
      myopathy as part of a prospective Natural History Study of the disease.

      It was estimated that 51 subjects with 2:1 randomization (ManNAc: Placebo) will provide a
      power of 89% under a treatment-related slowing in the rate of decline of 50% and a Type I
      error of 1%, accounting for lost-to follow-up and intend to treat analysis.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the change in muscle strength decline under treatment compared to placebo.

    <description>The effect of ManNAc on patient reported physical functioning will be assessed by the GNE Myopathy Physical Function Scale (GNEM-PFS). This is a newly developed, disease-specific patient-reported outcome that consists of 18 items scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (unable to do) where lower scores indicate better patient reported physical functioning. The GNEM-PFS is assessed at baseline and then again every six months until 24 months after the final subject is randomized. Change from baseline to each follow-up time point on the 18-item Total score will be calculated, and comparisons between the ManNAc group and placebo group will be based on a linear mixed effects model.</description>
