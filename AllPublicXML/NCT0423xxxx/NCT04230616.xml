  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to compare the efficacy, safety and costs of the NAVIO™ system with
      the conventional intramedullary alignment guide for total knee replacement in a clinical
      setting. The hypothesis is that total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with the use of NAVIO™ is at
      least as efficient and safe as TKA with the use of conventional intramedullary alignment
      guiding.
