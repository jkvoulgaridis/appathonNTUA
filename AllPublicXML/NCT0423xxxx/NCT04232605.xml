      The purpose of this study is to examine the association between vasodilation and intensity of
      headache triggered by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in healthy volunteers and migraine
      patients without aura.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase one: In a randomized, single-blind, multiple-ascending-dose finding pilot study we investigate the safety and tolerability of GLP-1 on three healthy volunteers. The following GLP-1 doses will be given intravenously ( 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 picomol/kg/min) over 20 min. The dose with considerable dilatory effect will be chosen for main study.
Phase 2 and 3:The study is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. It involves two arms, GLP-1 and placebo. Each participant will in a randomized order receive placebo or GLP-1 intravenous infusion over 20 min on the two experiment days.
The study consists of two separate substudies, one for healthy volunteers and one for migraine patients. The substudies are otherwise identical.</intervention_model_description>
