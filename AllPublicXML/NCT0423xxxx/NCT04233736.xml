  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of bilateral erector spinae
      plane (ESP) blocks after lumbar and lumbo-sacral spine surgery by assessing postoperative
      pain scores and opiate requirements as the primary outcome measures. We are aiming to
      investigate how ESP blocks, performed under ultrasound guidance at the T12 vertebral level,
      contribute to postoperative pain control. This will be determined by measuring numerical
      rating pain scores repeatedly following surgery and opiate consumption until patient
      discharge from hospital. These primary outcome measures will be compared between a treatment
      group of participants, who will receive ESP blocks and a control group who will receive a
      sham block. Our primary hypothesis is that ESP blocks significantly reduce postoperative pain
      and opiate requirements

    <description>Pain scores will be measured and documented as part of routine clinical care using the standard NRS (numerical rating scale, ranging from 0= no pain to 10= worst imaginable pain). Pain assessments will be made several times per day starting pre-operatively and continued during hospitalization.</description>

    <description>Peri-operative opiate consumption will be assessed by measuring opiate administration intra- and post-operatively (during hospitalization) and expressed as oral morphine equivalents (OMEs).</description>
