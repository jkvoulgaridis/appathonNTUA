      Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of electromyographic (EMG)
      biofeedback training applied in addition to early passive motion protocol on electrical
      muscle activity (EMA) and functional status in zone I-III flexor tendon injuries.

      Materials and Methods: Cases who underwent surgery for flexor tendon injuries in zone I-III
      were included in this prospective randomized controlled trial. Cases were randomly divided
      into two groups of 11 cases each by block randomization. In the first group, EMG biofeedback
      training was applied in addition to the early passive motion method (modified Duran
      protocol), while the second group was followed only by early passive motion method. The
      treatment program was performed by the same physiotherapist three times a week, for 12 weeks.
      At the postoperative 5th, 12th and 24th weeks, joint range of motion (ROM) and EMA were
      evaluated, and the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (MHQ) was administered to the
      patients. The grip strength at 12th and 24th weeks were also assessed. The Mann-Whitney U
      Test was used to compare the two groups.
