  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to voluntarily move the ankles is important for walking. After spinal cord injury
      (SCI), this ability is impaired because of changes in the communication between the brain,
      spinal cord, and body. Whole body vibration (WBV) is a treatment that increases voluntary
      muscle control and decreases uncontrollable muscle movement in people with SCI. The purpose
      of this study is to understand how WBV can impact ankle control and uncontrollable muscle
      movement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury can result in impaired walking ability and decreased independence in daily
      activities such as standing and transfers. The ability to voluntarily control the ankle
      muscles is an important component of walking that is impacted by changes in the corticospinal
      tract and the spinal reflex circuits. These changes have been associated with the inability
      to dorsiflex the ankle during swing phase (foot drop) and uncontrollable muscle spasms and
      stiffness in the ankle during terminal stance (spasticity), as well as during transfers. In
      order to improve functional outcomes and further develop rehabilitation techniques, the
      underlying contributions of the corticospinal tract and spinal reflex circuit to ankle
      control needs to be better understood. Non-invasive tools that target the corticospinal and
      spinal reflex circuit are being used in clinical settings in order to improve functional
      outcomes in persons with spinal cord injury. Whole body vibration (WBV) is a non-invasive
      tool that has been shown to increase voluntary motor output and decrease spasticity in
      persons with spinal cord injury. These improvements in function may be due to changes in the
      corticospinal tract and spinal reflex circuits. In order to determine the relative
      contributions of the corticospinal tract and spinal reflex circuits to increased voluntary
      ankle control and decreased spasticity, we will measure changes in the corticospinal tract
      and spinal reflex excitability before and after a single session of vibration. We will then
      determine which change (corticospinal or spinal) contributes more to increased voluntary
      ankle control and decreased spasticity. This information will help guide future research to
      further improve walking ability in persons with spinal cord injury.

    <measure>Volitional Ankle Control-Tapping Task Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be seated with the foot positioned on a pressure sensitive switch embedded in a platform. Participants will be asked to voluntarily contract and relax the muscles that lift the front of the foot (while the heel stays in place on the platform) as quickly as possible for 10s for 4 trials with a 60s rest in between.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle Spasticity-Ankle Clonus</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the amount of spasticity in the ankle. Motion sensors to record the ankle joint angles will be used. For this test participants will sit upright. The leg will be raised and released allowing the front of the foot to land on the edge of a platform. The angle of the ankle and movement of the foot will be recorded as it drops and catches on the platform.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corticospinal tract excitability-Motor Evoked Potentials</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a test to evaluate the connection between the brain and spinal cord. The skin over the muscles of the leg will be cleaned with an alcohol swab and a mildly abrasive paste (similar to the feel of toothpaste). Sensors that detect muscle activity will be placed over these sites. The location of these sensors will be marked on the skin at the beginning of each session using a non-toxic cosmetic pencil. Pulses of stimulation will be applied to the head using a type of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The strength of the stimulation will be increased until it causes the muscles of the leg to twitch, and the size of the muscle response will be recorded with the sensors placed over the muscles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low frequency depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures how the spinal cord responds to brief pulses of stimulation to the nerves of the legs. Recording electrodes will be taped to the muscles of the legs and brief pulses of stimulation will be applied to the legs.</description>

    <measure>Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the amount of spasticity in the legs. A clinician will perform a series of 3 short tests commonly performed in the clinic to test the spasticity in the legs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle Isometric Strength Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Test measures how strong the ankle muscles are. Participants will sit in a chair with foot pressed against a device that measures force. Participants will be asked to lift the front of the foot against the device as hard as possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking speed and walking pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures how fast participants walk and the way the legs move during walking. Participants will wear sensors that track the position of the legs as they walk across the floor. They will be able to use whatever assistive devices they typically use (e.g., lower extremity orthotics, walker, forearm crutches).</description>

    <measure>Heart rate and %SpO2</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the heart rate of participants and the amount of oxygen in the blood. These 2 measures will be taken by placing a sensor on the finger, before and after each intervention.</description>
