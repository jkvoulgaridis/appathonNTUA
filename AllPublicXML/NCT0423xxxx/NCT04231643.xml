  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use is associated with younger age at onset of bipolar disorder, poor outcome, and
      more frequent manic episodes, but the effects of cannabis on cognition are less clear.
      Contrary to reports among non-psychiatric patients, cannabis may improve cognition among
      people with bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, no study to date has systematically tested the
      acute effects of cannabis on cognition in bipolar disorder. Therefore, the investigators
      propose to determine the effects of oral cannabinoid administration on cognitive domains
      relevant to bipolar disorder, e.g., arousal, decision making, cognitive control, inhibition,
      and temporal perception (sense of timing). In addition, the investigators will evaluate
      different doses of the two major components of cannabis, cannabidiol and
      âˆ†9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and compare them to placebo on these neurocognitive measures. The
      investigators will also test the effects of acute exposure to cannabinoids on cerebrospinal
      levels of anandamide and homovanillic acid - markers of endocannabinoid and dopamine activity
      in the brain, respectively. These studies will provide information that effectively bridges
      the fields of addiction and general psychiatry, informing treatment development for co-morbid
      substance abuse and psychiatric disorders.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For subjects in BD group, DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar Disorder as determined by the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID).

          2. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) &lt; 12.

          3. Infrequent cannabis use as defined by a history of cannabis use but &lt;5 times per month
             [37] and no use in the past 14 days prior to experimental sessions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score &gt; 10.

          2. Suicidality. Exposure to cannabis does not lead to depression but it may be associated
             with suicidal thoughts and attempts. Therefore, the Center for Epidemiological
             Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) subscale measuring suicidal ideation (&quot;I wished I
             were dead&quot;. &quot;I wanted to hurt myself&quot;) will be completed. Should any of these items be
             answered affirmatively, e.g., the subject has endorsed these items for at least 1-2
             days in the last week, the subject will not be enrolled in the study.

          3. The Substance Abuse Module of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-5 will be
             administered to exclude individuals with current substance use disorders.

          4. Clinically significant or unstable medical condition. Subjects will undergo a medical
             evaluation (H&amp;P, toxicology screening, and for females of childbearing potential,
             pregnancy testing (utilizing a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test).
             Individuals with significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., angina, myocardial
             infarction or stroke), hepatic or renal disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and
             chronic pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma, COPD), will be excluded. With respect to
             cardiovascular and pulmonary status, a clinician will screen participants with a tool
             developed for this purpose (Appendix 3 Cardiopulmonary Screen). Hepatic and renal
             disease will be evaluated with liver and renal function laboratory tests. Females who
             are pregnant or lactating will be excluded.

          5. Infections - evidence of skin infection at lumbar puncture site.

          6. To avoid confounding of cognitive testing, a neurological disorder such as seizures,
             stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, or a history of head injury with loss of
             consciousness for at least 15 minutes will be excluded.

          7. Unwilling to refrain from driving or operate heavy machinery for four hours after
             consuming study medication. This criterion is consistent with current expert
             recommendations on driving following the use of cannabis.

          8. Additionally, because the hBPM paradigm requires participants to be ambulatory, those
             who cannot ambulate independently (e.g., require a wheelchair) or those who have a
             motor disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy) will be excluded.

          9. A previous adverse reaction to cannabinoids will be cause for exclusion as will a
             historical diagnosis of cannabis use disorder.

         10. Positive result on Draeger 5000 test indicating recent cannabis use.

         11. Unwillingness to prevent pregnancy during the cannabinoid administration portion of
             the study (using birth control in female participants of child-bearing age) Acceptable
             methods of birth control are: oral contraceptive pills, diaphragm, condom, progestin
             implant, intrauterine contraceptive device, sterilization, etc.

         12. Any active opportunistic infection or malignant condition requiring acute treatment.
