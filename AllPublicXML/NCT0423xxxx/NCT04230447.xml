  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to initially explore and describe the expression
      profiles, pathological processes, and molecular mechanisms of cytokine differential
      indicators such as NLRP3, NLRP1, and AIM2 in patients with SAE by establishing a cohort of
      SAE patients; and anchoring by enrichment analysis Risk cytokines and pathways related to the
      occurrence of SAE patients; provide theoretical guidance and basis for in-depth study of SAE
      occurrence mechanism and screening of early warning indicators and treatment targets.

      According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study, relevant patients who
      attended the emergency department of our hospital were collected, and the SAE cohort was
      established. participants were divided into SAE group and non-SAE group based on whether SAE
      occurred after discharge and one year follow-up. Another 20 patients with non-infected SIRS
      were selected as the control group.For the above three groups of patients, at the same time
      as the biochemical, routine, and culture examinations of lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal
      fluid, 5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid was retained for cytokine detection such as NLRP1, NLRP3,
      AIM2, and NURRI.All were given active anti-shock, and actively sought for infections through
      traditional imaging and quantum dot spectroscopy techniques for targeted anti-infective
      therapy, maintenance of circulation and stable internal environment.Research main
      indicators:Patient baseline data, GCS, CAM-ICU, RASS, APACHE-II, SOFA, IL, IL6, CPR, PCT,
      WBC, N%, liver and kidney function indicators, NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2 and other indicators,
      follow-up of patient survival rate.
