  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) affects up to 75% of patients receiving
      chemotherapy and older adults are at greater risk of developing CRCD, which can negatively
      affect their functional independence and quality of life. Memory and Attention Adaptation
      Training (MAAT) is a promising treatment for CRCD that improves perceived cognition in
      younger cancer survivors, but needs to be adapted for older adults to address their unique
      needs. The proposed study will adapt MAAT for older adults using feedback from key
      stakeholders (older adults with cancer and their caregivers), and subsequently test the
      ability of MAAT to improve or maintain cognition for older adults with breast cancer
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) is a significant problem, affecting up to 75% of
      patients receiving chemotherapy. Older adults are at greater risk of developing CRCD which
      can negatively affect their functional independence and quality of life. Memory and Attention
      Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a promising tool that improves perceived cognition in younger
      cancer survivors with CRCD. For older adults with cancer, MAAT could be delivered alongside
      chemotherapy to mitigate the development of CRCD (when risk is highest) and CRCD-related
      effects on functional independence for older adults. However, MAAT will require adaptation to
      meet the unique needs of older adults to optimize usability and efficacy for this population.
      The overarching goal of this project is to adapt MAAT for older adults using input from
      patient and caregiver stakeholders (phase I), and subsequently gather data on the preliminary
      effects of the adapted MAAT (MAAT-Geriatrics [G]) on perceived cognition, objective cognitive
      measures and functional independence. The provided details pertain to Phase I of the study,
      which will focus on the adaptation process. The investigators will adapt and refine MAAT-G
      using feedback from key stakeholders through iterative testing of MAAT-G with 10
      patient-caregiver dyads. The research plan combines the use of standardized quantitative
      measures of cognition and functional independence with semi-structured interviews (mixed
      methods), so that data from both can be integrated to optimize the adaptation and to gain a
      better understanding of MAAT-G's effects that are not fully captured by traditional
      quantitative measures alone.

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition (FACT-COG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition tool is a 50-question tool that evaluates memory and mental function in the past 7 days. The range of scores for the tool are 0 to 4 with higher scores generally indicating worse health outcomes. (Patients only)</description>

    <measure>Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CANTAB Delayed Matching to Sample assesses both simultaneous visual matching ability and short-term visual recognition memory, for non-verbalisable patterns. The subject is shown a complex visual pattern, followed by four similar patterns after a brief delay. The subject must select the pattern which exactly matches the sample. Better speed of response and higher number of correct patterns indicate better health outcomes. (Patients only)</description>

    <measure>Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) tool is a measure of verbal fluency evaluating expressive language and executive function. Subjects are asked to freely generate as many words as they can that start with one of the prompted letters (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;) in the span of one minute. Greater numbers of words indicate better health outcomes. (Patients only)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) tool is a test of verbal learning and memory. Researchers read a list of 12 words to subjects and ask them to report as many of the words as they can recall. The reporting period is timed. Higher numbers of correctly remembered words, along with lower reporting times, are indicative of better health outcomes. (Patients only)</description>

    <description>Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention for CRCD. As a CBT-based intervention, MAAT focuses on an individual's psychological response to injury as compared to the biological events triggering CRCD. MAAT is a series of manualized workshops delivered by a psychologist via video-conferencing, supplemented by a participant workbook, which provide instruction and practice with adaptive behavioral coping skills, stress management techniques, and compensation strategies. MAAT-G will be evaluated in 10 patient-caregiver dyads to further adapt MAAT-G to optimize usability.</description>
