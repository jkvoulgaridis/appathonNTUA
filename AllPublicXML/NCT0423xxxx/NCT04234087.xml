  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the short- and medium-term effectiveness of additional
      moderate dynamic resistance and balance training to the CR-program of old adults after valve
      surgery or intervention compared to usual care-CR.

    <description>The supervised exercise program included: continues endurance training on cycle ergometers (6 sessions a week). Every session included warm up (&lt;50% target intensity 2 min, gradually increasing load 1-10 w/min up to target intensity within 5 - 10 min); exercise phase (100% of the target intensity (30-50% watts or 30-50% HRmax), starting with &gt;5 minutes and gradually prolonged up to 30 min); cool down with gradual reduction of the load within 3 minutes); additional aerobic exercises performed sitting and/or standing (30 minutes, 5 days/week); respiratory muscle training (7 days/week, for 15 minutes) using ball trainer.</description>

    <description>Exercise program as for a control group together with additional resistance and balance training 3 sessions/week. The resistance training was started with low intensity (&lt;30% 1-RM, RPE ≤ 11, 5-10 repetitions), increased gradually to moderate intensity (30-50% and up to 60% 1-RM, RPE 12-13, after 8-15 repetitions) with 3 sets and 3 minute rest between sets, if tolerated. The balance training included exercises to improve static as well as dynamic balance ability. It was performed on 2-3 days/week for 10-15 minutes. The complexity of the balance exercises was selected and incremented individually by changing the stand-position, the base on which the stands were performed and/or using unstable surfaces. If tolerated, the visual information was varied and/or additional tasks performed while balancing. After completion participants were encouraged to continue exercise training at home according to recommendations.</description>
