    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled trial to
      evaluate the contribution of Triamcinolone Hexacetonide (TH) to pain relief, both in terms of
      magnitude and duration, when used within a single injection of Cingal® compared to a single
      injection of TH in subjects with OA of the knee.
