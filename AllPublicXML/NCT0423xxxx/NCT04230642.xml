  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and performance of a new robotic device in the treatment of
      hepatic thermoablation in adults. The new robotic device will be used in all patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device is a user controlled, stereotactic accessory intended to assist in the planning
      and manual advancement of needle, as well as in verification of needle position during CT
      guided percutaneous ablation procedures.

      After validation of the correct positioning of the needle, the tumor ablation procedure is
      conducted with a device routinely used by the investigator. The Acquisition of a
      post-interventional CT-guided image is realized to evaluate adverse events occurrence.
