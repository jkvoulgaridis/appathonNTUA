  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy guided by stroke volume response to repeated fluid challenges is used for
      hemodynamic optimization during general anesthesia. Two types of devices that measure stroke
      volume non-invasively are primarily available for intermediate-risk surgery under general
      anesthesia. They are based on two different techniques, (1) pulse contour analysis, and (2)
      transthoracic bioimpedance. They have never been compared with each other. Therefore, it is
      not known (1) whether they are interchangeable for the measurement of stroke volume changes
      (usually assessed as the &quot;concordance&quot; of two techniques), and (2) whether one is better than
      the other.

      The aim is to study the concordance of these two non-invasive hemodynamic devices. it will
      use both of them in patients undergoing intermediate risk surgery. They will be tested during
      modifications of cardiac preload induced by Trendelenburg and anti-Trendelenburg positioning,
      as well as during intraoperative fluid challenges, vasopressor boluses and alveolar
      recruitment maneuvers.

      The main objective is to assess the concordance of two non-invasive devices using the
      technology described above : the Clearsight (Edwards Lifesciences, pulse contour analysis),
      and the Niccomo (Medis, bioimpedance). Both will be used in each patient included in the
      study. They will be tested during modifications of cardiac preload induced by sequences of
      position changes (see below) including Trendelenburg and anti-Trendelenburg positioning,
      performed systematically before and after the procedure, as well as during fluid challenges,
      vasopressor boluses and alveolar recruitment maneuvers (performed during the procedure
      according to the needs of the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient). Both monitors will
      also be compared with an invasive monitor of stroke volume (Vigileo/Flotrac, Edwards
      Lifesciences), and the respiratory pulse pressure variation will also be measured during the
      sequences of position changes and will be used as a gold standard for fluid responsiveness.

    <intervention_model_description>The primary outcome will be based on measurements performed during a sequence of position changes.
Sequence A will consist of starting from 0° position, shift to position +20°, then tilt to -20°, and finally back to the 0° position.
Sequence B will consist of starting from 0° position, shift to position -20°, then tilt to +20°, and finally back to the 0° position.
Patients will be randomized to take sequence A before the procedure, and then the sequence B at the end of the procedure, or vice-versa (sequence B before sequence A).
The randomization is not intended to compare the two groups with each other, but only to compensate for a possible&quot;order-effect&quot; in the execution of the maneuvers.</intervention_model_description>
