  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current first-line treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in Canada is
      buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone). The standard induction method of buprenorphine/naloxone
      requires patients to be abstinent from opioids and thereby experience withdrawal symptoms
      prior to induction, which can be a major barrier in starting treatment. Rapid micro-induction
      (micro-dosing) involves the administration of small, frequent does of buprenorphine/naloxone
      and removes the need for a period of withdrawal prior to the start of treatment. This study
      aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of rapid micro-induction versus standard
      induction of buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with OUD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label superiority trial involving 50 individuals with
      OUD. Participants will be randomized into two arms: rapid micro-induction and standard
      induction (based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine Practice Guidelines and
      product monograph) of buprenorphine/naloxone.

    <description>On Day 1, participants will receive 0.5mg buprenorphine sublingually (SL) every 3 hours (Q3H) - total daily dose of 4mg. On Day 2, they will receive 1mg buprenorphine SL Q3H - total daily dose of 8mg. On Day 3, they will receive 12mg buprenorphine SL once and 1-4mg buprenorphine SL Q3H as needed (PRN) - maximum daily dose of 24mg. On Day 4, their day 3 total dose will be consolidated to once daily dosing - maximum daily dose of 24mg. On Days 1 and 2, participants will concurrently receive 1-8mg hydromorphone orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly (PO/IV/SC/IM) every 2 hours (Q2H) PRN to meet their opioid requirements, titrated to effect - maximum daily dose of 96mg. Hydromorphone will be discontinued on Days 3 and 4.</description>

    <description>Day 1 is initiated when participants score 11 or above on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, and when they have been abstinent from short-acting opioids for at least 6-12 hours or from long-acting opioids for 24-72 hours. On Day 1, participants will start with 2-4mg buprenorphine SL. If they do not experience withdrawal symptoms 60-90 minutes after this dose, additional dosing can be done in increments of 2-4mg buprenorphine SL. The suggested total dose target for Day 1 is 8-12mg. On Day 2, participants will start with a dose equal to the total amount of buprenorphine SL administered on Day 1. The dose will be then titrated in increments or decrements of 2-8mg buprenorphine SL to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal. On Day 3, their day 2 total dose will be consolidated to once daily dosing. For both Days 2 and 3, the suggested total daily dose is at least 8mg, recommended 12-16mg, maximum daily dose of 24mg.</description>
