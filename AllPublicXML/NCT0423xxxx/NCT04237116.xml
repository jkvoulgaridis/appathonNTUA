    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of secukinumab on the psoriatic
      skin and to explore the anti-inflammatory (reduction of hepatic inflammation and cell
      damage), anti-steatotic (reduction of hepatic triglyceride content) and anti-fibrotic
      (reduction of hepatic fibrosis) effects of secukinumab in patients with psoriasis and
      coexisting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

    <intervention_model_description>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of secukinumab compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with respect to psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 90 response at Week 12.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) level</measure>

    <description>ALT is an enzyme that the liver releases when it becomes inflamed or damaged. ALT level measures liver function Parameter.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is calculated by summing the score of each domain resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more Quality of Life was impaired. Meaning of DLQI Scores: 0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect on patient's life, 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life, 11-20= very large effect on patient's life, 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life.</description>
