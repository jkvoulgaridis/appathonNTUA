  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-operative hypotension is linked to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
      Intra-operative MAP below 60-70 mmHg or SBP below 100 mmHg increase the risk of post
      operative myocardial injury, acute kidney injury and death. accurate measurement of blood
      pressure is fundamental in proper mangement of intraperative hypotension.

      Measurement of arterial blood pressure through an arterial catheter is restricted to patients
      with major, rapid changes in blood pressure in the operating room as well as the intensive
      care units. Among non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitors, oscillometric blood pressure
      measuring technology is considered the standard and the most widely used method in medical
      practice. In oscillometric blood pressure monitor, a pressure transducer located in the cuff
      senses the maximal arterial oscillation, which represents the mean arterial pressure, and
      according to the device's algorithm the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP)
      will be calculated.

      The upper arm is the standard location of application of the blood pressure cuff as it is
      aligned with the heart level regardless the patient position. Many surgical procedures,
      sometimes major, are conducted in the lateral position; during these operations, the choice
      of the side for application of the NIBP cuff is a challenging decision with no clear
      recommendations. The non-dependent upper limb is claimed to be inaccurate measurement site
      because the cuff position is above the level of the heart. While, the dependent upper limb
      might be affected by compression of the axilla and the upper arm. No data, to the best of our
      knowledge are available for the accuracy of NIBP in both upper limbs in the lateral position
      using the invasive arterial blood pressure (IBP) as a reference for detecting intraoperative
      hypotension.

      Preoperatively, the upper limb circumference will be measured at the mid arm, and the NIBP
      cuff size will be selected according to the recommendations of American Heart Association
      (cuff length and width will be 80% and 40% of arm circumference respectively) Upon arrival to
      the operating room, a non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) reading will be obtained in both
      upper limbs in supine position. Patients with difference of 10 mmHg or above between both
      limbs will be excluded from the study.

      Induction of general anesthesia will be achieved by administration of 2 mg/kg propofol, 2
      mcg/kg fentanyl and 0.5 mg/kg atracurium. A 20 G radial arterial catheter will be inserted in
      the upper limb which is planned to be dependent. The arterial catheter will be connected to a
      pressure transducer at the level of the heart. Supine IBP reading will be recorded 5-minutes
      after intubation of the trachea in the supine position with simultaneous NIBP in both upper
      limbs at 3-minutes intervals. Five-minutes after settling in the lateral position, NIBP will
      be obtained alternating between the dependent and non-dependent limbs at 5-minutes intervals
      till the end of the operation or till reaching a maximum of 10 readings from each side.

      The reading of the IBP will be obtained from the contralateral upper limb during inflation of
      the cuff of the NIBP. Whilst, the reading of the IBP will be obtained from the same upper
      limb just before the inflation of the cuff of the NIBP
