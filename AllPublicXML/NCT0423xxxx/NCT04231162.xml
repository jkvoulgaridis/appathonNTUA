  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, two-arm (parallel groups), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      multi-center clinical trial will investigate the effects of an 8-week Bifidobacterium lactis
      HN019 supplementation on stool frequency and on other constipation parameters in adults
      suffering from functional constipation according to ROME III criteria. The hypothesis is that
      Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 is superior, in comparison with a placebo, for the increase of
      stool frequency of at least 1 stool per week.
