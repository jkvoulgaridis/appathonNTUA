      A single-center and open-labeled Phase I study, designed to evaluate the safety by observing
      the occurrence of adverse events and change of hematology, liver and renal function after
      vaccination of a meningococcal group A, C, Y, and W135 conjugate vaccine in healthy
      population aged 2 months to 55 years old.
