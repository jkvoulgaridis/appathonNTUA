      Compassionate use access to fostemsavir (GSK3684934, formerly BMS-663068) for the treatment
      of HIV infection in individuals with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection who are experiencing
      virologic failure and are unable to comprise a suppressive regimen with currently available
      antiretrovirals.

    <textblock>
      Fostemsavir (FTR) is the prodrug of temsavir (TMR), which is a novel, first-in-class
      attachment inhibitor being developed as a potential treatment of HIV-1 infection.
      Investigational FTR is being made available on a compassionate use named patient basis for
      the treatment of HIV infection in individuals with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection who
      are experiencing virologic failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 c/mL) and are unable to
      comprise a suppressive regimen with currently available antiretrovirals. Such patients, who
      are often heavily treatment experienced (HTE), represent a small and highly vulnerable
      subgroup within the overall HIV patient population. The care of HTE patients is difficult and
      often complicated by the presence of complex comorbidities, extensive concomitant medication
      profiles, and advanced HIV disease.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has given consent for treatment

          2. Patient is male or non-pregnant female, age 18 years and older. NOTE: there may be
             allowance for a lower minimum age if dictated by local regulatory and/or legal
             requirements.

          3. Patient has chronic HIV-1 infection and is heavily treatment experienced

          4. Patient is experiencing virologic failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 c/mL) on a
             current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and:

               1. is unable to comprise a suppressive regimen without fostemsavir due to documented
                  multi-drug resistance test results and/or intolerance and/or contraindication AND

               2. has no more than 2 fully active ART agents (0, 1, or 2 ART agents) which can be
                  paired with fostemsavir as part of a viable combination ART regimen

          5. Patient meets the following reproductive status criteria:

               1. Women must not be breastfeeding

               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of fostemsavir and must agree
                  to periodic pregnancy testing (as per local standard of care) for the duration of
                  treatment with fostemsavir.

               3. WOCBP must agree to use at least 1 method of effective contraception for the
                  duration of treatment with fostemsavir and 60 hours after fostemsavir drug
                  exposure. Males must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of the
                  contraceptive requirements of the NPP to which they too are expected to adhere.

               4. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must use condoms for the duration of
                  treatment with fostemsavir and 60 hours after last dose. In addition, males must
                  be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time.

               5. WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from
                  contraceptive requirements but must comply with the pregnancy testing schedule as
                  outlined in inclusion criterion 5b.

        Physicians shall counsel WOCBP and males who are sexually active with WOCBP on the
        importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy. At a
        minimum, contraceptive counselling should be provided at the time of consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will not be eligible for fostemsavir compassionate use if any of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Patient is eligible to access commercial fostemsavir or investigational fostemsavir by
             means other than the named patient program.

          2. Patient is taking one or more prohibited medications including:

               1. strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, phenytoin
                  (anticonvulsants), mitotane (antineoplastic), enzalutamide (androgen receptor
                  inhibitor), rifampicin (antimycobacterial) and St John's wort (Hypericum
                  perforatum, herbal supplement),

               2. elbasvir/grazoprevir (hepatitis C direct acting antiviral)

          3. Patient has a prior history of poor adherence with multiple failed attempts of oral
             ART
