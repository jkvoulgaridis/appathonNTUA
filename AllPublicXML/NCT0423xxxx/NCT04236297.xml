      Bite block is a single-use medical device used to keep the mouth open during invasive imaging
      procedures and prevent the patient from biting the imaging probe.

      The purpose of this study is to compare a modified bite block with standard bite block during
      transesophageal echocardiography exam procedures in patients who are either sedated or under
      general anesthesia.

      The commercially available bite blocks are almost exclusively made of hard plastic that does
      not conform well to the patient's mouth with additional protrusions used to secure the bite
      block in place that have the potential to cause patient injury. Hard plastic is used to
      prevent patient from biting down on the imaging probe while side protrusions are used to
      strap the bite block down to prevent dislodgment.

      Modified bite block is made of softer material with improved mouth fit and no need for
      strapping the bite block to keep it in place. Softer material is more comfortable while the
      designs mimics mouth guard used in dentistry to protect patient's teeth and keep the bite
      block in place while sleeping.

      The specific aims of this project include:

        -  assessment of patient comfort during invasive imaging procedure

        -  assessment of provider satisfaction with the bite block

        -  assessment of patient lip/gum/teeth injury after bite block use

        -  assessment of imaging probe damage after procedure

        -  assessment of bite block's ability to stay in place during procedure
