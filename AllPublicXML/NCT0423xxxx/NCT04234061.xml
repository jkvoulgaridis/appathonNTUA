      This is an open label, multi-center, single-arm, phase II study investigating the efficacy
      and safety of the combination of ibrutinib and Tisagenlecleucel in twenty patients with

             patients of childbearing potential and non-sterile male patients (with partners of
             childbearing potential) must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception
             from registration on the study to 30 days after the last dose of ibrutinib and 12
             months after Tisagenlecleucel infusion and until Tisagenlecleucel is no longer present
             by qPCR on two consecutive tests (whichever is later):

               -  Total abstinence from sexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred
                  and usual life style of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
                  acceptable methods of contraception

               -  Female sterilisation (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks
                  prior to registration. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilisation (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient

               -  Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine
                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                  hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have
                  been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before enrolment into this
                  study.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks
        ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
        been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
        potential.

        11. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human
        chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of registration 12.
        Sexually active male patients must use a condom during intercourse and must agree to
        refrain from sperm donation, from registration on the study until 30 days after the last
        dose of ibrutinib or 12 months after Tisagenlecleucel infusion and until Tisagenlecleucel
        is no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests
