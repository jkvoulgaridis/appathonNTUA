  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare periodontal treatment with or without the adjunct of an
      enamel matrix derivative in terms of periodontal healing in diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with periodontitis will be randomly allocated to two groups. In both groups,
      periodontal root instrumentation will be performed. In the test group, an additional flapless
      application of enamel matrix derivatives will be granted for sites with pockets deeper than 5
      mm.

      Metabolic glucose control as measured through blood testing and local parameters of
      periodontal health will be measured at baseline and three months after treatment completion.

    <description>Root Instrumentation + Enamel Matrix Derivative Application
Periodontal treatment is delivered with ultrasonic instrumentation performed with fine tips. The approach chosen is the one- stage full-mouth ultrasonic debridement in which all the treatment of diseased sites is performed within one hour.
In this group, at the end of the instrumentation enamel matrix derivatives is placed in all sites with a periodontal pocket depth deeper than 5mm.</description>
