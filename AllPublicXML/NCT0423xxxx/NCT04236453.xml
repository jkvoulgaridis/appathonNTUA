    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and pivotal
      bioequivalence of 3 compounds Darunavir (DRV), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide
      (TAF) in the presence of cobicistat (COBI) when administered as an fixed dose combination
      (FDC) (Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide [D/C/F/TAF]) compared to the
      co-administration as the separate commercial formulations (DRV and F/TAF and COBI), under fed
      conditions, in healthy participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,
             and electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the
             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or
             deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory test performed at
             screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are
             outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically
             significant.

          -  A woman (of childbearing potential) must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test, 4 days or less before
             dosing of the first treatment period

          -  Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participant participating in clinical
             studies

          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction during the study and for at least 90 days after receiving the last dose
             of study drug

          -  During the study and for a minimum of at least 90 days after receiving the last dose
             of study drug, a male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity
             that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person (male subject should also be
             advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of
             contraception as condom may break or leak); must agree not to donate sperm for the
             purpose of reproduction.

          -  Must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in
             the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has history or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease (including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease), diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency (for example, estimated
             creatinine clearance below less than [&lt;] 90 milliliter per minute [mL/min] at
             screening), gastrointestinal disease (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or
             constipation that in the investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or
             bioavailability), thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or
             any other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant or
             that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  Had one or more of the laboratory abnormalities at screening as outlined in the
             protocol by the Division of Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (DAIDS) Table for
             Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events and in accordance with the
             normal ranges of the clinical laboratory

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities during physical examination, vital signs, or 12
             lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or at admission to the study center as
             deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  With any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not limited to,
             dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria

          -  Has a history of drug or alcohol abuse according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-V) criteria within 1 year before screening or
             positive test result(s) for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse (such as hallucinogens,
             barbiturates, opiates, opioids, cocaine, cannabinoids, amphetamines, methadone,
             benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, tetrahydrocannabinol, phencyclidine, and tricyclic
             antidepressants) either at screening or on Day 1 of each treatment period
