  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is characterized by the presence of
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Choroidal neovascularization consists of abnormal blood
      vessels originating from the choroid and can lead to hemorrhage, fluid exudation, and
      fibrosis, resulting in photoreceptor damage and vision loss.

      The safety and efficacy of brolucizumab has been demonstrated in 2 randomized, multicenter,
      double-masked, active controlled Phase 3 studies in nAMD patients (RTH258-C001 and
      RTH258-C002). Anatomical changes were evaluated in these studies using spectral domain
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which relied on indirect parameters for the diagnosis
      of active CNV. The OCT-angiography (OCT A) that directly visualize retinal circulation and
      image CNV and vascular diseases of the retina was not included in previous brolcuizumab
      studies.

      This single-arm, open-label, multicenter study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg in patients with nAMD.

      OCT-A will be used in this study to assess the morphological response of patients to
      brolucizumab in terms of percentage change in CNV lesion area in the short term (i.e. at Week
      12) and in the long term (i.e. at Week 48), as well as changes in other OCT-A features up to
      Week 48.

      Approximately 428 adult patients will be screened and included in approximately 75 centers in
      France.

      The maximum study duration for 1 patient is 48 weeks.

      Patients will be required to attend 6 mandatory study visits: Screening/Baseline Visit (Day
      1), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 48 visits. The timing of the interim visits
      between Week 16 and Week 48 will depend on the patient's injection regimen, i.e. every 8
      weeks or every 12 weeks according to disease activity assessed by the investigator.

         24. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a

             post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
             (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks

             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.
