  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of chronic knee pain remains a challenge to the treating physician. A
      radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves is a not yet established but promising
      technique. This procedure is minimal invasive and has few adverse events. For these reasons
      it can be advantageous and fulfilling the unmet needs of these chronic knee pain patients
      warranting further research of its efficacy.

      To investigate this efficacy, all patients treated with radiofrequency ablation in the
      multidisciplinary chronic pain center between 1 September 2017 and 31 December 2019 with
      exclusion of patients with chronic widespread pain, will be retrospectively analyzed in a
      single-center cohort.

      This project has as primary objective the evaluation of treatment success of a conventional
      radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves in patients diagnosed with chronic knee pain
      due to osteoarthritis of the knee or PPSP at six weeks post treatment. Secondary objectives
      are evaluation of treatment effect at a third time point at the end of the inclusion period,
      subgroup analysis of treatment success based on indication to treatment, evaluation of
      subjective functional improvement and change in analgesics, estimation of the duration of
      effect of the treatment and adverse events.

      This study includes all patients treated with radiofrequency ablation in the
      multidisciplinary chronic pain center in Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Campus Sint-Barbara between
      1 September 2017 and 31 December 2019 with exclusion of patients with chronic widespread
      pain.

      The main study outcome is the proportion of patients with a global perceived effect of at
      least 50% at 6 weeks post intervention. Secondary outcomes include reduction in pain
      intensity, measured by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at six weeks and at a third time point,
      global perceived effect at a third time point, subjective change in physical functioning,
      duration effect of the treatment, use of strong opioids, and adverse events.
