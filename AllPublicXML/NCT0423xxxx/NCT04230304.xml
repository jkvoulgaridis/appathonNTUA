  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab and ibrutinib work in treating patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous
      treatment (refractory). Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody which works with the body's
      immune system to destroy cancer cells. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving daratumumab and ibrutinib may
      work better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to ibrutinib
      alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate after 6 cycles of treatment with daratumumab in
      combination with ibrutinib in patients who are on /or are previously treated with ibrutinib.
      (Cohort 1) II. Determine the overall response rate after 6 cycles of treatment with
      daratumumab in combination with ibrutinib in patients who are naive to ibrutinib treatment.
      (Cohort 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the best overall response rate to treatment with daratumumab plus ibrutinib at
      any time during the course of the therapy. (Cohort 1) II. The overall incidence of MRD
      (minimal residual disease) negative state and the time to achieving MRD negativity at any
      time during this therapy. (Cohort 1) III. Progression free survival (as determined by the
      International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [IWCLL] criteria) among all patients.
      (Cohort 1) IV. The overall toxicity profile of daratumumab/ibrutinib treatment in this group
      of patients. (Cohort 1) V. Determine the best overall response rate to treatment with
      daratumumab plus ibrutinib at any time during the course of the therapy. (Cohort 2) VI. The
      overall incidence of MRD (minimal residual disease) negative state and the time to achieving
      MRD negativity at any time during this therapy. (Cohort 2) VII. The overall toxicity profile
      of daratumumab/ibrutinib treatment in this group of patients. (Cohort 2)

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct correlative studies for further understanding of the biological relevance of
      CD38 as a therapeutic target and its impact on response to treatment with daratumumab.

      II. To determine the incidence of ibrutinib induced lymphocytosis and if pre-treatment with
      daratumumab prevent the development of this flare reaction.

      III. Determine the number of patients who show clinical evidence of anti-chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) response after 4 weeks of treatment of Daratumumab alone and correlation with
      their baseline CD38 MFI determined by flow cytometry.

      IV. Durability of the MRD negative (-) state (determined from the time of first documentation
      of MRD- until the first documentation of MRD positive (+) (or last date shown to be MRD- for
      a censor).

      V. Establish the progression free survival (PFS) for patients who have achieved MRD (minimal
      residual disease) negative state in comparison to those who did not achieve MRD negativity
      post cycle 12.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2, on
      days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and then on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Beginning in cycle 2,
      patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study registration, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5
      years.
