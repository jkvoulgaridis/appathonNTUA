      A prospective, open, one-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of jinyouli
      in the first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with albumin paclitaxel combined
      with S-1.Chemotherapy regimen: (1) chemotherapy: albumin paclitaxel, 120mg / m2, intravenous
      infusion for 30 minutes, D1. S-1, taken orally after meal, D1 - 14. (2) patients who met the
      input / discharge criteria were given jinyouli injections 24 hours after the end of
      intravenous infusion of albumin paclitaxel during the treatment period.
