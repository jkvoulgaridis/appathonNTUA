      Primary objective:

      To demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) equivalence of Gan &amp; Lee Insulin
      Lispro Injection with both EU - approved Humalog® and US - licensed Humalog® (Reference
      Products) in healthy male subjects

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare the PK and PD parameters of the three insulin lispro preparations

      To evaluate the single dose safety and local tolerability of the three insulin lispro
      preparations

             consuming more than 24 grams alcohol/day (on average)

         18. A positive result in the alcohol and/or urine drug screen at the screening visit

         19. Smoking more than 5 cigarettes or the equivalent per day

         20. Inability or unwillingness to refrain from smoking and use of nicotine substitute
             products one day before and during the inpatient period

         21. Positive test for Hepatitis Bs antigen

         22. Positive test for Hepatitis C antibodies. (Presence of Hepatitis C antibodies will not
             lead to exclusion if liver function tests are normal and a hepatitis C polymerase
             chain reaction is negative)

         23. Positive result to the test for HIV-1/2 antibodies or HIV-1 antigen

         24. Any medication (prescription and non-prescription drugs) within 7 days before IMP
             administration and/or anticoagulant therapy

         25. Blood donation or blood loss of more than 500mL within the last 3 months

        occasional use to treat acute pain, as judged by the Investigator.
