  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over-expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) on cells occurs in all aggressive
      cancers of epithelial origin. Existing tests for monitoring EGFR expression are invasive and
      not reliable. There needs to be a better way to measure EGFR expression in cancerous tumors
      to better tailor cancer treatments.

      This clinical trial aims to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging cancers that express EGFR
      using 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography
      (CT). By non-invasively imaging the status of EGFR, 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab could be used to
      assist in the identification of patients who are likely to respond to anti-EGFR treatments,
      including nimotuzumab. The hypothesis is that 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab will accumulate to tumors
      over-expressing EGFR making them visible when imaged with PET/CT. This hypothesis will be
      tested in this study, along with the optimal imaging time and diagnostic ability.
