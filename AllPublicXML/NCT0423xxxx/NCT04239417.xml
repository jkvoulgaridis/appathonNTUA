  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to investigate the effect of preoperative graduated abdominal
      strengthening exercises and Russian stimulation on the abdominal muscles strength after
      ventral hernioplasty by using isokinetic dynamometer and Ultrasonography as methods of
      measurement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      this study was designed due to the lack of the primary related researches about the role of
      preoperative graduated abdominal strengthening exercises and Russian stimulation on abdominal
      muscle strength after ventral hernioplasty. As The recurrence rate after standard repair of
      ventral hernias may be as high as 12-52%, and the wide surgical dissection required often
      results in wound complications. Umbilical hernia has gained little attention from surgeons in
      comparison with other types of abdominal wall hernias (inguinal, postoperative); however, the
      primary suture for umbilical hernia is associated with a recurrence rate of 19-54%. Hernia
      recurrence constitutes the most common complication after hernia repair, usually occurring
      2-3 years after surgery. The prevalence of hernia recurrence varies with the type of repair:
      It may be seen in up to 30% of cases after open surgery without mesh placement, up to 10%
      after open surgery with mesh placement, and up to 7.5% after laparoscopic surgery. A small
      proportion of recurrent hernias occur 5 or more years after surgery, usually related to the
      aging of tissues and the weakening of muscles. Physical conditioning including overall
      fitness and obesity are associated with ventral hernias. Obese patients are at increased risk
      of hernia formation as well as hernia incarceration. In addition, obese patients are at
      increased risk for all adverse events following ventral hernia repair including wound
      complications, surgical site infections, and hernia recurrence. While preoperative physical
      conditioning and weight loss programs have been shown to be effective in achieving weight
      loss, studies have demonstrated variable results on the impact on outcomes. In addition,
      these studies have largely been performed in bariatric surgery, cardiac surgery, and
      orthopedic surgery and no studies have evaluated this in patients with ventral hernias. It is
      unclear if the effectiveness of these programs to improve weight loss and physical
      conditioning can be translated to ventral hernia repair.

For group (A) (study group); they received graduated abdominal strengthening exercises for 30 min., 3 times per week for 6 weeks preoperatively. For group (B) (study group); they received Russian stimulation on abdominal muscles for 30 min., 3 times per week for 6 weeks preoperatively. For group (c) (study group); they received combination between graduated abdominal strengthening exercises and Russian stimulation on abdominal muscles for 30 min., 3 times per week for 6 weeks preoperatively. For group (D) (control group); they were instructed to presume in normal activities of daily living preoperatively, without abdominal exercises or Russian stimulation</intervention_model_description>
