      A phase III study, multicenter, randomized, parallel, open, two-period, comparative
      non-inferiority of Eurofarma versus Alenia® in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent
      asthma with and without obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first study period (Period 1), patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma
      according to GINA criteria, with or without COPD, will be randomized at a 1: 1 ratio to
      receive formoterol 12mcg / budesonide 400mcg Eurofarma or Alenia® 12mcg / 400mcg during 12
      weeks Participants who maintain asthma control at the end of this treatment period (no more
      than one exacerbation during this period) will be included in Period 2, in which the dose of
      each investigational product will be reduced (step-down), and the patients will receive
      formoterol 6mcg / budesonide 200mcg Eurofarma or Alenia® 6mcg / 200mcg, respectively, for an
      additional 12 weeks. The primary non-inferiority assessment will be performed at the end of
      24 weeks of treatment, with intermediate assessment at the end of week 12.

      The study will be conducted in an open label since the devices for inhalation of products
      have different aspects, making it impossible to blind the treatments of the study. The
      primary efficacy variable (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) minimizes the
      potential bias arising from the open label of the study.
