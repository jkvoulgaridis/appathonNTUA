  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an anesthesia technique called serratus anterior plane
      block may provide additional pain relief for the chest wall after lung surgery. The study
      will evaluate the effect the serratus anterior plane block technique has on the need for
      opioids after surgery,the level of pain during recovery, and other aspects of recovery, like
      whether the patient has nausea and their ability to breathe deeply. The effects of the
      serratus anterior plane block will be compared to the effects of an inactive (sham) block.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a two-arm randomized study of chest wall nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia after elective minimally invasive lung resection. The two study groups are: (1) usual care plus serratus anterior plane block (treatment arm), and (2) usual care plus sham serratus anterior plane block (control arm).</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients â‰¥ 18 years of age who are capable of giving consent. English language
             proficiency is required.

          -  Undergoing elective minimally invasive (VATS or RATS) anatomic lung resection
             (segmentectomy or lobectomy) without an epidural.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (Patients must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days of the
             operation)

          -  History of documented anaphylaxis or contraindication to local anesthetics

          -  History of ipsilateral thoracic surgery. Ipsilateral thoracic surgery indicates any
             previous thoracoscopic or open (i.e. via thoracotomy) pleural biopsy, lung resection,
             esophageal surgery, chest wall resection, or other thoracic surgery within the chest
             cavity. This does not include image-guided lung biopsy. Note: Mediport placement and
             other procedures performed by a surgeon/proceduralist NOT within the chest cavity are
             not excluded. Likewise, patients with a history of ipsilateral breast surgery are also
             not excluded. The purpose is to exclude patients who may have had injury to the
             intercostal nerves from previous surgery or who have surgically altered anatomy of the
             hemithorax.

          -  Patients undergoing bilateral procedures

          -  Weight &lt; 50 kg

          -  Chronic sustained-release opioid use for &gt; 2 weeks duration (in the 30 days prior to
             surgery)

          -  Significant cognitive impairment or documented psychological impairment

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status &gt; 3

          -  Patients may also be excluded from the study if the block is deemed not technically
             feasible (this may be determined intraoperatively).
