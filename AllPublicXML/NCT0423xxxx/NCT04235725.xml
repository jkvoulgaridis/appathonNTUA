  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to demonstrate feasibility and value of collecting
      harmonized outcomes measures for major depressive disorder (MDD) in two registries and
      combining the data to support patient-centered outcomes research.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a longitudinal, multi-center observational feasibility study that will include
      data on eligible patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Retrospective
      data on previous disease status and patient characteristics will be collected and combined
      with longitudinal data from these data sources on outcomes during the study timeframe. All
      data will be collected from institution electronic medical records (EMRs), PRO portals, and
      other existing data sources, as needed.

      Two registries (PsychPRO and the PRIME Registry) will participate in this feasibility study.
      A total of 20 sites participating in the registries (10 from each registry) will be recruited
      to participate in this study. To participate, sites must see adult patients with major
      depression or dysthymia and be willing to collect the PHQ-9 on a regular basis. Sites will
      have the option of using the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings
      (FIBSER) scale to capture information on adverse events, but use of the FIBSER is not
      required.
