      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, phase I study to determine
      the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia. The study will have the following sequential phases: Screening,
      Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp; Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and
      Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 2 years from CNCT19
