    <textblock>
      SYD985.004 is a two-part phase I study with the antibody-drug conjugate SYD985 in combination
      with niraparib aimed at evaluating safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with
      HER2-expressing locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study in which patients with HER2-expressing locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumours will be treated with both an anti-body drug conjugate
      SYD985 and a Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib. SYD985 is an
      antibody-drug conjugate and consists of two parts. The antibody part binds to a protein that
      exists on different types of cancer cells (HER2 protein). When SYD985 binds to this protein,
      it will be taken up by the cancer cell. The second part of the drug, a toxin, will be cleaved
      in the cell and subsequently kills the cancer cell. Niraparib blocks the action of enzymes
      PARP-1 and PARP-2, which help to repair damaged DNA in cells when the cells divide to make
      new cells. By blocking PARP enzymes, the damaged DNA in cancer cells cannot be repaired, and,
      as a result, the cancer cells die.

      Part 1 includes patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing solid tumours of
      any origin that showed progression on standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy
      exists. Patients will receive SYD985 infusions every three weeks in combination with
      niraparib until progression of the cancer or unacceptable toxicity develops. In this first
      part of the study, different doses of niraparib will be given for either 1, 2 or 3 weeks.

      Part 2 includes patients with advanced or metastatic breast, ovarian or endometrial cancer
      that showed progression on standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. Patients
      will receive SYD985 infusions every three weeks in combination with niraparib until
      progression of the cancer or unacceptable toxicity develops.
