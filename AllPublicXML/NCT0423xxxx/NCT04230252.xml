        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are abnormalities,
             they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel including liver enzymes, other specific tests,
             hematology, urinalysis or breathing alcohol test are outside the normal reference
             ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is sitting for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140
             millimeters of Mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg
             diastolic

          -  Have no history of psychiatric disorder within the 5 years prior to the screening

          -  Have no history of gastrointestinal resection that may affect drug absorption

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below
             60 milliliter per minute [mL/min]), thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric
             disease, infection, or any other illness that the investigator considers should
             exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the study
             results

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or 12 lead ECG at
             screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to acetaminophen or its excipients

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy,
             which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  Taken any disallowed therapies as noted in local prescribing information, concomitant
             therapy before the planned first dose of study drug
