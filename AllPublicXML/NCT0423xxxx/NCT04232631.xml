  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected with 3 vascular imaging devices (IntraOx Vioptix, Newark, CA;
      Hyperview, HyperMed Imaging, Memphis, TN; Snapshot NIH, Kent Imaging, Calgary, Alberta,
      Canada). The wound will be imaged with the 3 devices at index research encounter (this will
      count as the initial pre-operative imaging if the patient requires surgery), before surgery
      for interval or additional surgeries, during surgery, and during clinic follow-up (one set of
      imaging approximately every 3-5 weeks) visits for a maximum follow up time of 12 months or
      until the wound is documented as healed, whichever occurs first. The investigators will
      collect data from the medial and lateral angiosomes on the dorsum and plantar aspects of the
      foot and the anterior and posterior leg. Subject data will be obtained from the patient by
      oral history and physical exam and the medical records of patients of the investigators:
      vascular data, demographic medical history, wound characteristics and measurements, frequency
      of debridement and off-loading. Collection of lab data will be obtained such as cultures
      glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin and hematocrit, ESR, CRP and eGFR obtained per standard
      of care. Imaging with the three devices is research-only and is not standard of care.

      This is a prospective, observational study. All medical and surgical care provided to the
      patient will be standard of care.

      Once a patient is identified as having a lower extremity ulceration (includes lower extremity
      wound of any cause, a surgical incision, a flap or graft) and consent to participation, their
      lower extremity will be imaged. They will be imaged before, during, and on post-op day 1 if
      they require surgery and for each surgery related to the ulceration. They will also be imaged
      once a month in follow up for up to a total of 12 months or healing of the wound, whichever
      comes first.

      The 3 instruments do not touch the patient and are being evaluated on their ability to
      predict wound healing. They are research only and not standard of care, and are not being
      used to determine care.
