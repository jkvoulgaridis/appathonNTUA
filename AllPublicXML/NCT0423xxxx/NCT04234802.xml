  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project's primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-level heat prevention
      approach in reducing adverse heat health effects in outdoor agricultural workers

      The secondary aims are to:

        -  Test the effectiveness of an individual-level training component designed to reduce
           adverse heat health effects in outdoor agricultural workers

        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace supervisor-level heat awareness application
           intended to support supervisor decisions to reduce the risk of workers experiencing
           adverse heat health effects

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a parallel, comparison, group intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-level Heat Education and Awareness Tools (HEAT) intervention, consisting of worker training and a supervisor heat awareness application, on reducing adverse heat health effects in agricultural workers across a growing season.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>HEAT training will be delivered to agricultural workers by research staff in this study in the spring. HEAT training uses interactive approaches to engage participants and posters with visuals. Training covers types of heat-related illness and treatments, risk factors, appropriate clothing and hydration, and keeping cool in the home and community. The HEAT awareness application was developed in collaboration with Washington State University's AgWeatherNet Program to notify supervisors signed up for the service about hot weather conditions that might increase the risk for adverse health effects for workers. The HEAT awareness application is designed to allow subscribers to select weather stations of interest and view current heat indices as well as maximum daily heat indices forecasted over the following week. This information is coupled with information about health effects and prevention of adverse heat health effects. Materials are provided in English and Spanish.</description>
