  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the safety and tolerability of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) co-administered
      with dmLT will be assessed, as well as whether co-administration of dmLT with IPV enhances
      mucosal responses compared to those with IPV alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major component of the strategy aimed at worldwide eradication of polio advanced by the WHO
      is based on the replacement of OPV with IPV; however, IPV is not efficient in preventing
      person-to-person poliovirus transmission, particularly in settings of poor hygiene, due to
      limited impact on intestinal mucosal immunity compared to OPV. The addition of an adjuvant,
      in particular one that may direct the response towards mucosal homing may offset that
      deficiency.

      In this study, the safety and tolerability of IPV co-administered with dmLT will be assessed,
      as well as whether co-administration of dmLT with IPV enhances mucosal responses compared to
      those with IPV alone.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will receive a single dose of licensed trivalent IPV, administered IM, with or without dmLT, or bOPV, administered orally (PO). IPV or IPV + dmLT will be administered to groups of 30 subjects each. Both subjects and clinical staff will be blinded to group assignment (IPV alone vs IPV + dmLT). A positive unblinded control group will be included, composed of 20 subjects receiving bOPV. One month (28 days) after receiving study vaccine, all subjects will receive a standard oral dose of bOPV (0.1 mL) to assess relative impact of study vaccine on shedding of that challenge virus. For this study, study vaccine is described as dmLT+IPV.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study vaccine for Groups 1 and 2 (IPV alone and IPV + dmLT) will be administered IM in a blinded fashion. An unblinded positive control group (Group 3) will be administered bOPV.
The unblinded Research Pharmacist will perform all preparations of the study product for Groups 1 and 2. Preparation of the study product and administration to the subjects will occur in separate locations to preserve the blinding of staff except for Research Pharmacist. The study subjects, the study personnel who perform study assessments after administration of study product, data entry personnel at the site, and laboratory personnel performing immunologic assays will be blinded to the treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>LT(R192G/L211A), or dmLT, is a derivative of wild-type ETEC heat-labile enterotoxin that has been genetically modified by replacing the arginine at amino acid position 192 with glycine and the leucine at amino acid position 211 with alanine. These two amino acid substitutions take place in proteolytic cleavage sites which are critical for activation of the secreted toxin molecules. The protein has been designated LT(R192G/L211A) and has been extensively evaluated in pre-clinical animal studies for its ability to induce anti-dmLT antibody responses, as well as adjuvant the immune responses for co-administered antigens.</description>
