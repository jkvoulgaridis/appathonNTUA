  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are two mental
      health conditions that often occur together (i.e., PTSD-BPD), with comorbidity rates as high
      as 58%. PTSD-BPD is associated with even greater functional impairment and higher healthcare
      burden than either disorder alone. There are surprisingly few treatments available for this
      clinical profile, despite its association with major negative health outcomes, cost, and
      morbidity. There is a pressing need to innovate treatments that can effectively and
      efficiently treat PTSD-BPD. The existing treatments used for PTSD-BPD are lengthy, laborious,
      resource-intensive, and require that participants cease all suicidal behaviours prior to
      treatment. Furthermore, no integrated treatment has been innovated to address the specific
      mechanisms underpinning this comorbidity. We propose to examine an adapted version of a
      first-line PTSD intervention, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) plus Suicide Risk Management
      (SRM), as a briefer (12 sessions) and more efficient treatment alternative that strategically
      targets shared mechanisms underpinning PTSD and BPD. The purpose of this uncontrolled study
      is to collect initial safety and efficacy data on this adapted treatment. Knowledge gleaned
      from this study will have significant direct clinical implications. Potential risks of the
      study include individual distress, suicide risk, and residual PTSD and BPD symptoms
      post-treatment. To minimize risk, study therapists will closely monitor participants using
      the suicide risk assessment and management protocol. Using this protocol, if participants
      remain distressed after a therapy session or psychological interview they will be encouraged
      to discuss their distress with their study assessor or therapist and coached to implement
      strategies to reduce their distress. If they express self-harming or suicidal urges the study
      assessor or therapist will implement a standardized protocol to monitor and address any
      escalations in risk. Potential benefits of this study include reductions in participants'
      PTSD, BPD and other mental health symptoms. Additionally, the study may benefit others by
      improving the treatment repertoire for PTSD-BPD with a more succinct treatment that can also
      be utilized for individuals with suicidal behaviours.

    <description>CPT is an evidence-based treatment for PTSD. This first-line treatment for PTSD will be adapted and combined with SRM into 12 60-90min sessions targeting both PTSD and BPD. Individuals assigned to this intervention will attend treatment sessions, and be asked to do treatment homework at home. The primary outcomes are PTSD and BPD severity.</description>
