  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective motor control (SMC) impairment in children with cerebral palsy (CP) includes
      movement patterns dominated by flexor or extensor synergy affecting functional movements. The
      research was designed to investigate the validity and the reliability of the Turkish version
      of the Test of Arm Selective Control (TASC) (which is improved to evaluate SMC in children
      with spastic CP) and in order to provide more understanding of the relationship between SMC
      and upper extremity and gross motor functions. The study included 21 hemiplegic, 11 diplegic
      and 4 quadriplegic children with CP whose ages are 4 to 18 years and Gross Motor Function
      Classification System (GMFCS) level changes from 1 to 4, and their parents. In order to
      evaluate the gross motor function of children, GMFCS and the ability to hold objects with
      their hands in daily activities were evaluated with Manual Ability Classification System
      (MACS). ABILHAND-Kids scale was applied to evaluate upper extremity performance. TASC scale
      was used to evaluate the upper extremity SMC of children.
