  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of ALLN-346 in healthy volunteers, in
      this first in human, single ascending dose study. ALLN-346 is an enzyme that degrades urate
      in the gastrointestinal tract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose study
      of orally administered ALLN-346. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability,
      inflammation and immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ALLN-346 in healthy
      volunteers. The study consists of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period of 3 days, which
      includes 1 single day of dosing and 3 days of in-house observation, and a safety Follow-up
      Period through Day 28 following dosing.
