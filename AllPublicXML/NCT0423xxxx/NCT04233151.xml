      The purpose of this study is to determine the treatment effect of QL1203 in combination with
      mFOLFOX6 compared to Placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6 as first line therapy for
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase III study. It
      is planned to enroll 590 patients with previously untreated wild-type RAS metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Subjects are randomized into the QL1203 combined with
      Oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil/ Leucovorin or Placebo combined with Oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil/
      Leucovorin treatment group by a ratio of 2:1.
