      In this study, a single-center, controlled, open-label design was used for a dose escalation
      study.To observe the clinical safety of intrauterine injection of human embryonic stem cell
      derived mesenchymal cells in the treatment of moderate and severe intrauterine adhesion, and
      to preliminarily explore its clinical effectiveness in promoting endometrial regeneration and
      repair.
