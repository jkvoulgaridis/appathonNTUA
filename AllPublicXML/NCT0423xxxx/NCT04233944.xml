  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UBC was a USAID-funded longitudinal prospective cohort study of pregnant women (n= 5030)
      aged 15-49 years from rural North and South-Western regions of Uganda, conducted between 2014
      and 2016. The aim of the UBC study was to observationally follow pregnant women and their
      newborns until 2 years of age and compare changes over time in communities that were part of
      an ongoing USAID project called the Community Connector (CC) compared to those communities
      that were not included in the Community Connector project.

      This study aimed to assess the role of livelihoods, agriculture and nutrition in improving
      maternal and child nutrition and health in rural Uganda in communities that were a part of an
      ongoing program that was un-related to the study. The overall aim of this study was to
      understand the effect of participating in an ongoing program that provided support on
      nutrition, agriculture, water, hygiene and sanitation and the change over time in the
      nutritional status of mothers and children under two years of age. The specific objectives of
      this observational study were as follows:

        1. To compare health and nutrition status of pregnant women in communities participating in
           the Community Connector project to those that were not participating in the program

        2. To assess the aflatoxin levels in pregnancy and test its association with birth outcomes
           and early life growth as measured by weight and length

        3. To assess environmental enteropathy in pregnancy and test its association with birth
           outcomes and early life growth

        4. To assess access to coverage and adherence to information/messages and engagement in
           Community Connector project's activities

        5. To determine heterogeneity in program exposure and variability in household and
           agro-ecological characteristics and its relationship with maternal and infant health and
           nutrition status
