  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of extensive deep burn residual wounds is a common problem in burn plastic surgery.
      Due to bacterial invasion, excessive maturation of granulation tissue, poor abrasion
      resistance of new epithelium, and coexistence of wound healing and dissolution can lead to
      delayed wound healing. Residual wounds rarely heal spontaneously and are prone to recurrence.
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) boost tissue repair through paracrine. Many biological
      effectors, including IGF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-Î²1 have been found
      in MSC conditioned media (MSC-CM), and play a role in promoting tissue repair and
      regeneration.Our previous animal experiments have confirmed the role of MSC-CM in regulating
      wound inflammation, repairing damaged repair cells and promoting wound regeneration. In here,
      we will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell conditioned
      medium-derived pleiotropic factor in treating residual burn wound.
