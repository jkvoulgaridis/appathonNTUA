  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) has been shown to facilitate emotional connection and
      long-term child developmental progress in the NICU population. It has been theorized that FNI
      also promotes autonomic co-regulation and physiological synchrony between the mother-child
      dyad. The goal of the pilot study is to assess how a short one-time FNI session between
      at-risk mother and child dyads in the Well Baby Nursery (WBN) influences physiological
      synchrony, emotional connection, and developmental changes both short and long-term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this work is to improve cognitive, emotional, and social
      developmental trajectories in at-risk children. Specially, this pilot study will assess the
      feasibility of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) in the neonatal period during the infants'
      stay in the Well Baby Nursery (WBN) in improving developmental trajectories.

      FNI is a family-based intervention that facilitates and strengthens the mother-infant
      emotional connection through a structured guided interaction by a trained provider.
      Mother-infant emotional connection is known to affect various developmental processes and
      improve overall health. FNI was previously shown to be efficacious in improving several
      long-term health outcomes in preterm infants.

      In this study, the goal is to extend of the findings of FNI to another population of at risk
      infants - infants born to mothers suffering from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). These
      infants are generally healthy but at higher risk than controls in developing mild cognitive
      and motor impairments.

      In this pilot phase, infants exposed to GDM and case-matched control infants will both
      receive FNI: (GDM+FNI and Control+FNI). These two groups will be compared to an already
      existing protocol and pool of participants who did not receive FNI: (GDM+no FNI and
      Control+no FNI). This allows the study to evaluate both GDM versus control infants as well as
      the presence of FNI versus no FNI.

      The goal is to pilot the potential role of a short, one-time session of FNI in promoting
      neurodevelopment among an at-risk wellbaby nursery population. This will be achieved by
      comparing developmental milestones, such as cognitive and motor development, memory,
      attention, and emotion regulation at 6 and 15 months, between participants who received the
      FNI and those who did not. Another goal is to elucidate the role FNI has on autonomic
      co-regulation and mother-infant synchrony through physiological recordings during the FNI
      session in the WBN.

    <measure>Change in Welch Emotional Connection Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15-months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The Welch Emotional Connection Screen (WECS) is a validated scale for quantitative assessment of the emotional connection between infant and mother by scoring the interaction of the dyad in four domains: attraction, vocal communication, facial communication and sensitivity/reciprocity. Each domain is scored on a scale from 1.0 to 3.0 in 0.25 point increments, with higher scores indicating stronger emotional connection. The WECS will be measured at baseline for the FNI groups during the intervention, and at 15 months for both FNI and non-FNI groups by a researcher observing the dyadic interaction during a 3 minute period of face-to-face time. Changes in score from baseline to 15 months will be evaluated for FNI groups. Differences in emotional connection will be evaluated in FNI versus non-FNI groups by comparing WECS scores at 15-months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in heart rhythm synchrony</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rhythms will be collected through non-invasive EKG monitoring of mother and infant during FNI in order to test the hypothesis that FNI improves emotional connection through autonomic synchrony. To test this, peaks will be extracted from the EKG traces of mother and infant and cross-correlation functions will be used to assess if physiological synchrony between mother-infant heart beats increases throughout the FNI session. Synchrony at the end of the session will also be used to ascertain if autonomic synchrony can be used as a predictor of WECS score or other outcomes at the follow-up sessions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>BITSEA is a short 42-item parent-report screening tool used to identify social-emotional/behavioral problems and delays in competence in 12 to 36 month olds. It takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete. The measure yields two scores: a Problem Total Score and Competence Total Score. It also includes a two separate parental &quot;worry&quot; item for parents to rate their concern about the child's behavior and language on a 5-point scale from 1 being not at all worried to 5 being extremely worried. Change in score will be calculated by comparing BITSEA scores of FNI and non-FNI participants.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parenting Stress Index (PSI-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (over the phone) and 15 months (in person)</time_frame>
    <description>PSI-4 is a 120 item inventory designed to assess the level of stress in the parent-child relationship. It takes 5 minutes to complete. It focuses on three major domains of stress: child characteristics, parent characteristics, and situation/demographic life stress. Change in score will be calculated by comparing PSI-4 scores of mothers in FNI versus non-FNI groups. The child domain, the parent domain, and life stress domains will be compared. Child domain is separated into six subscales: distractibility, hyperactivity, adaptability, reinforces parent, demandingness, mood, and acceptability. Parent domain is separated into seven subscales: competence, isolation, attachment, health, role restriction, depression, and spouse/parenting partner relationship. Life stress provides information about factors outside the parent-child relationship.</description>

    <measure>Change in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>EPDS is a 10 question form to identify patients at risk for postnatal depression and has been proven to be an effective screening tool. Mothers who score above 13 are likely to be suffering from a depressive illness. The maximum score is 30. Those who score 10 or greater have possible depression and careful clinical assessment is suggested. The scale indicates how the mother has felt during the previous week. It takes 2 minutes to complete. Change in score will be calculated by comparing EPDS scores of mothers in FNI versus non-FNI groups.</description>

    <measure>Change in Bayley-III Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bayley-III scale is a comprehensive tool to identify developmental delays during early childhood. It can be used between 1 and 42 months. It takes 30-45 minutes to complete. Five areas of development are assessed: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior. The cognitive scales comprises of 91 items to assess sensorimotor development, exploration and manipulation, object relatedness, concept formation, and memory. The language area looks at 49 items to assess receptive and 48 items to assess expressive communication. The motor domain assessed 66 items in fine motor and 71 items in gross motor. Social-emotional contains 35 items. Adaptive behavior contains 241 items. Scores for all skill areas combine to form the General Adaptive Composite (GAC) for an overall measure of development. Change in score will be calculated by comparing Bayley-III scores of FNI and non-FNI participants.</description>

    <measure>Change in M/CHAT R/F score</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised, with Follow-Up (M/CHAT R/F) is a 2-stage parent-report screening tool to evaluate for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in toddlers between 16 to 30 months of age. The tool maximizes sensitivity and aims to detect as many cases of ASD as possible, and thus has high false positives. It takes 5 minutes to complete. A total score of 0-2 is low risk, 3-7 is medium, and 8-20 is high. An interview via flowchart format is also administered asking questions until a PASS or FAIL is scored. The interview is considered to screen positive if the child fails any two items on the follow-up.Change in score will be calculated by comparing M/CHAT R/F scores of FNI and non-FNI participants</description>

    <description>FNI is a family based intervention that facilitates and strengthens the mother-infant emotional connection through a structured guided interaction by a physician.
The mother is asked to sit with her baby in her arms so that they are face-to-face, and when the baby becomes restless, the physician will coach the mom to bring the baby back to a calm state. The mother will also be encouraged to verbalize her feelings to her baby. Mother-infant emotional connection is known to affect various developmental processes and improve overall health. FNI was previously shown to be efficacious in improving several long-term health outcomes in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</description>
