  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators plan to evaluate healing in two cohorts of patients with diabetic foot
      wounds (n=20) that receive optimal treatment including serial wound debridement and
      off-loading with a boot or postop shoe and AmnioEXCEL+. In one cohort, AmnioEXCEL+ will be
      applied weekly at study visits and in the second cohort, AmnioEXCEL+ will be applied maximum
      every 2 weeks (PRN, in the case that the wound requires debridement at a visit not intended
      for AE+ application, the wound will be treated as SOC). In addition, the Investigators will
      collect data on other potential confounding factors that could affect healing such as
      antibiotic, anti-fungal and anti-infective medications, tobacco, comorbidities, diabetes
      control, infection, perfusion, and activity. Wound healing, including wound size and adverse
      events will be evaluated.

      Study Procedures:

      Collection of Demographic data, medical/social history Collection of medications1 Ankle
      Brachial Index2 Wound debridement3 (standard of care procedure) Imaging with eKare4
      Hyperspectral Imaging Application of study product

        1. Only collect antibiotics, anti-fungal and anti-infective medications.

        2. ABI (with toe pressure) can be done at screening or baseline.

        3. Once wound is healed, wound debridement will not be done at weekly visits.

        4. Once wound is healed, eKare will not be done at weekly visits.

        5. EOS will occur on the date the subject is healed. *Screening and Visit 1 may be done on
           the same day.

      Screening and Enrollment*:

        -  Review and sign the Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization

        -  Review the inclusion and exclusion criteria
