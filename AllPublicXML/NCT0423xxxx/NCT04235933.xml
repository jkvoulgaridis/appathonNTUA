             half-lives, whichever is longer;

          8. History of Bleeding or donated more than 400ml blood 3 months before screening period,
             or plan to denote blood within 1 month after the trial;

          9. Consume more tobacco or alcohol (≥14 units of alcohol per week: one standard unit
             contains 14g of alcohol, equals to 360ml of beer, 45ml of 40% liquor or 150ml of wine;
             smokers with more than 5 cigarettes per day.);

         10. Consume excessive caffeine-containing beverages, foods that may affect drug metabolism
             within four weeks before signing informed consent: coffee (≥1100 mL per day), tea
             (≥2200 mL per day), cola (≥2200 mL per day), energy drinks (≥1100 mL per day),
