    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of implementing best practices into current
      stroke rehabilitation physical therapy on walking outcomes. Participants will also be
      provided an activity monitor to help them track and target their walking practice to
      determine if this can improve walking ability.

      This 12 site study will have each site start in usual care with participants consented to
      collecting outcome measures. Each site will randomly switch over to Enhanced Usual Care (best
      practice implementation) where all physical therapists at the site will be educated on
      delivery of best practice for locomotor retraining. The specific therapy activities are at
      the discretion of the physical therapist; however, physical therapists must work towards
      thirty minutes of weight-bearing/stepping activity at greater than forty percent heart rate
      reserve. Participants will continue to be consented to collecting outcome measures.
      Additionally, participants will be given and trained to use activity watches to monitor their
      own progress.

    <intervention_model_description>This clinical trial uses a stepped-wedge design. Unlike typical studies where participants are randomized to two different interventions, this design has all sites start in the Usual Care period, and then switch-over to Enhanced Care at predetermined times, which will then be the new Usual Care (termed &quot;Enhanced Usual Care&quot;).</intervention_model_description>
