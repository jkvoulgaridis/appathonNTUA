    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, prospective, phase II clinical study. The main purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in the treatment of steroid
      dependent/refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be diagnosed as hematopoiesis disorders and receiving hematopoietic
             stem cells transplantation.

          2. Steroid dependent or refractory classic chronic GVHD disease defined as modified
             National Institutes of Health criteria(2014) below at any time post-hematopoietic cell
             transplant(post-HCT)

               1. Dependent disease, defined as, when glucocorticoid (prednisolone doses greater
                  than or equal to(&lt;=) 0.25mg/kg/day or &lt;=0.5mg/kg every other day(prednisolone
                  doses) due to recurrence or progression of cGVHD manifestations, it is considered
                  as steroid-dependent disease if the lowest tapering dose of the second occasion
                  is equal or higher than the lowest tapering dose of the first occasion

               2. Refractory disease, defined as, when cGVHD manifestations progress despite the
                  use of a regime containing glucocorticoid (prednisolone at &gt;=1mg/kg/day for at
                  least 1 week) or persist without improvement despite continued treatment with
                  glucocorticoid (prednisolone at &gt;=0.5mg/kg/day or 1mg/kg every other day) for at
                  least 4 weeks.

          3. Participants must be receiving baseline systemic glucocorticoid therpy for cGVHD at
             study entry. The dose of steroids must be stable for 14 days prior to starting
             anlotinib.

          4. At the time of trial enrollment, participants may be receiving other immunosuppressive
             therapies in addition to glucocorticoids. Immunosuppressant doses must be stable for
             14 days prior to starting anlotinib.

          5. Neutrophil≥1.5×109/L，platelet≥50×109/L

          6. Karnofsky or Lansky performance status&gt;=60

          7. Participants should sign the agreement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected active acute GVHD.

          2. Current treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, purin analogs or other cancer
             chemotherapy in the 4weeks prior to starting study drug.

          3. Concomitant use of warfarin or other Vitamin K antogonists.

          4. Known bleeding disorders or hemophilia.

          5. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus or active with hepatitis C. virus or
             hepatitis B virus.

          6. Uncontrolled infections not responsive to antibiotics, antiviral medicines, or
             antifungal medicine or recent infection requiring systemic treatment .
