  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of fetal heart monitoring (prenatal and during childbirth), the SurFAO project
      offers an alternative to current clinical routines. The challenge is to extract, from
      non-invasive sensors on the maternal abdomen, a fetal electrocardiogram (ECGf) of great
      quality allowing a clinical diagnosis (follow-up of the FHR (Fetal Heart Rate)) and
      extraction of ECG waveforms).

      The approach proposes a technological breakthrough shared by a consortium of researchers and
      clinicians. The originality is driven by innovative methodological choices: the use of a
      multimodal system (ECG coupling with PCG (phonocardiography)) for the signal acquisition in
      order to increase the robustness of information extraction, by taking into account clinical
      uses and the need to support the monitoring process, and by setting up a multimodal database.

      The objective is to feed a database that will be used in the future to develop ECGf
      extraction methods.

      To monitor the well-being of a fetus or for clinical diagnosis, the challenge is to extract a
      high-quality fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) signal from non-invasive sensors on the maternal
      abdomen.

      As early as the 20th week of amenorrhea, heart rhythm disorders (tachycardia, bradycardia)
      can be detected in the fetus, most often by fortuitous circumstance, during routine
      obstetrical ultrasound examinations. It is then necessary to analyze these rhythmic
      anomalies, understand their origin and, if necessary, initiate pharmacotherapy. The
      effectiveness of the treatments is then monitored by ultrasound in the high-risk pregnancy
      department.

      The analysis of a fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) provides information that allows to
      determine the nature of the rhythm disorder, its origin and therefore its potential severity.

      The innovative methodological approach considered for the extraction of non-invasive ECGf is
      to combine 2 complementary modalities of the same cardiac phenomenon. This is achieved by
      combining the use of ECG sensors with sound sensors giving access to phonocardiographic
      signals (PCG).

    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a validated tool for assessing the subjective usability of a system, in this case, the SurFAO System. It contains 10 questions that are rated on a scale from 1 to 5. &quot;The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100.&quot; Jeff Sauro established the average score of SUS is 68.
The score can go from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <description>The ECG - PCG signals are acquired over a 20-minute monitoring phase with passive non invasive sensors (abdominal and thoracic). The volunteer's abdomen is photographed when the electrodes and sensors are installed. An ultrasonography is also performed for 10 minutes.
The session is filmed for 5 volunteers accepting the video. Any distinctive elements will be removed from photos and videos to prevent the identification of participants.</description>
