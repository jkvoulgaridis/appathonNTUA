  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the wrist is damaged, for traumatic or degenerative reasons, the cartilage is worn out
      and the bones rub together: this is osteoarthritis. In order to stop this pain, it may be
      necessary to block these bones from each other, sacrificing mobility to achieve indolence.

      Multiple techniques are described according to the type of osteoarthritis and for each type
      of osteoarthritis itself, but the principle remains the same. The methods currently commonly
      proposed are the staple and the screwed plate.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the surgical practice of the Orthopaedics and
      Traumatology department of the University Hospital of Rennes, and its long-term results, as
      this type of surgery is intended to be definitive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgery performed in the Orthopaedics and Traumatology department of the University
      Hospital of Rennes, has 2 notable points: its technique and its equipment.

        -  The procedure is based on the staples 4Fusion1 (Stryker/Memometal), which is still
           poorly assessed in the literature.

        -  The surgical procedure has several technical specificities: intra osseous cartilage
           freshening and preservation of the lunotriquetral ligament if intact.
