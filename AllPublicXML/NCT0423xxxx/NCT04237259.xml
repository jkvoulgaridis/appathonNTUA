      Objectives: To preliminarily assess the effects and feasibility of parent-delivered TCM
      pediatric massage for ADHD symptoms in preschool children.

      Hypothesis: The parent-delivered TCM pediatric massage group would have greater improvement
      in children's hyperactivity, anxiety, and sleep disturbance symptoms when compared to the
      parent-child interaction group.

      Design and subjects: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 60 pair of children with
      pre-specified ADHD symptoms and their parent will be recruited and randomized to
      parent-administered TCM pediatric massage comparison group, and parent-child interaction
      group at a 1: 1 ratio.

      Interventions: Parents of subjects in the parent-administered TCM massage group (n=30) will
      attend 2 training sessions (5 hours in total) to learn and practice the parent-administered
      TCM massage for ADHD before treatment starts. The parents will be told to practice the TCM
      massage on their child every 2 days for 2 months. Parents in the parent-child interaction
      group (comparison group, n=30) will attend a 3-hour training course on line and spend extra
      time on interacting with their child at home.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Parent
      Scale (SNAP-IV-P). Other outcomes include Preschool Anxiety Scale (PAS), Children's Sleep
      Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Parental Stress Scale (PSS) for parental stress, and the
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI).

      Data Analysis: Differences in the scale scores and test parameters between groups will be
      examined using a linear mixed-effects model.

      Expected results: Subjects in the parent-administered TCM massage group will have greater
      improvements in the ADHD symptoms compared to those in the parent-child interaction group at
      week 4 and week 8.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>It has 26 items that include 18 ADHD symptoms (nine inattentive, nine hyperactive or impulsive) and as specified in the DSM-5. Items are rated for frequency by the parent or teacher on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all to 3 = very much) and average ratings per item are then calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PAS-SC is a 34-item parent-rated scale, which assesses anxiety symptoms in young children across six subscales: panic attack and agoraphobia, separation anxiety, physical injury fears, social phobia, obsessive compulsive, generalized anxiety disorder/overanxious disorder.</description>

    <measure>Parental Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>PSS is a measure of &quot;individual differences in the level of stress associated with raising children'', which consists of 18 items on the perception of parental stress and uses a Likert style rating scale.</description>

    <intervention_name>Parent-administered TCM pediatric massage training</intervention_name>
    <description>Massage therapy is a kind of complementary and alternative therapy, which involves a number of techniques such as friction, pressing, rubbing, grasping, pinching, and kneading. TCM pediatric massage, also called pediatric tuina and pediatric anmo, is a special part of TCM massage system that usually use lines or surfaces rather than points as acupoints and the manipulations are different from those of TCM adult massage. From TCM perspective, the pathogenesis of ADHD is the abnormal exuberance of yang, which can be relieved by specific approaches of massage.
Participants in this group will receive two TCM pediatric massage training sessions (5 hours in total, one is 3 hours, and the other is 2 hours). The protocol will be tested for feasibility at the first feasibility stage (the first 8 subjects).</description>

    <description>The principle of progressive muscle relaxation exercise is to achieve a relaxation state through relaxing our muscles. With training, we become more familiarized with the sense of relaxation so that we can voluntarily induce this sensation in the face of a stressor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for the children are:

          1. children between 3-7 years old by the time of the start of the assessment;

          2. having a score equal to or higher than the borderline cutoff of the Strengths and
             Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviors Rating Scale (SWAN), indicating the
             children had moderate ADHD symptoms.

        The children with ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity, anxiety, or inattention will be recruited
        in this study. The rationale for not restricting the study to children with formal
        diagnosis is that many children are first assessed by professionals after 7 years old, and
        therefore many children with severe hyperactivity, anxiety, and sleep disturbance symptoms
        have not yet received a diagnosis. For these children, they together with their parents
        should be considered according to the inclusion criteria.

        Inclusion criteria for parents are:

          1. able to communicate using Mandarin;

          2. willing to learn the knowledge and manipulations of TCM pediatric massage for treating
             ADHD;

          3. available to take their child to hospital for treatment and conduct manipulations at
             home according to the study process;

          4. agree to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for children are:

          1. currently receiving other massage therapy;

          2. having other developmental disability such as autism spectrum disorders or
             intellectual disability;

          3. having acute infection diseases (such as scarlet fever, chickenpox), hemorrhagic
             diseases (like bleeding, local places of various kinds of malignant tumor), or
             dermatological problems (e.g. scald, severe skin lesion, or skin infections);

          4. having any severe illness or medical condition that the investigator deems not
             appropriate to receive TCM massage (e.g. bone fractures and paraplegia).

        Exclusion criteria for parents are:

          1. having any severe psychiatric disorder, such as major depressive disorder;

          2. having difficulties to conduct massage therapy due to physical problems;

          3. having a score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) less than 22, indicating
             cognitive impairment (Appendix 1: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) - Chinese
             Version)
