    <textblock>
      This work is designed to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of HHHFNC in comparison with nCPAP in preterm neonates.

        2. Investigate hemodynamic changes associated with HHHFNC in comparison to nCPAP in preterm
           neonates during periods of non-invasive respiratory support and after being off support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a preference of using noninvasive modes of ventilation for management of respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants and of weaning of ventilated neonates as soon as
      possible to non-invasive modes.

      Yet, little is known about which non-invasive mode is better and the hemodynamic changes that
      occur to the infants secondary to these modes. The study provides an evaluation of the
      efficacy of heated, humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) in comparison to nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in preterm infants. Secondary aim is to assess
      echographic, cerebral blood flow and mesenteric blood flow changes during HHHFNC versus
      nCPAP.
