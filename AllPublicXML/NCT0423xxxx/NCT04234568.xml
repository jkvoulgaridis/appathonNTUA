  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of triapine when given together
      with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Triapine may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Radioactive drugs, such as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, may carry radiation directly to tumor
      cells and not harm normal cells. Giving triapine and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate together may be
      a good way in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lutetium Lu
      177 dotatate in combination with triapine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months
      post therapy.

      III. To measure duration of response (DOR) associated with the combination. IV. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS), 24-month PFS, and overall survival (OS).

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure baseline 68 gallium-dotatate biodistribution. II. Evaluate oral triapine plasma
      pharmacokinetics and corresponding methemoglobin level by venous blood gas proportion.

      III. Evaluate NETest at baseline and disease progression to correlate result with clinical
      outcome.

      IV. Describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing (WES), as well as
      ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) by the National Clinical Laboratory Network (NCLN)
      Genomics Lab, and correlate it with treatment outcome.

      V. Collect plasma for circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) assessment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of triapine.

      Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day 1 and
      triapine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks (56 days)
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 24 months.

             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated

             this trial

          -  Pregnancy precaution: Men and women should avoid pregnancy for seven months after the
             date of their last treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. It is noteworthy that
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may be secreted by a small percentage of
             neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), such that, in addition to being a pregnancy marker, it
             also is a tumor marker. Consequently, NET female patients with positive beta-HCG at
             baseline can be eligible to enter the study and receive treatment if pregnancy can be
             excluded by lack of expected doubling of beta-HCG and negative pelvic ultrasound.
             Normally, in pregnant subjects beta-HCG doubles every 2 days during the first 4 weeks
             of pregnancy and every 3.5 days by weeks 6 to 7. Women of childbearing potential
             include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             ovariectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive months,
             and for women on hormone replacement therapy, only with a documented plasma
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH)] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using oral,
             implanted, or injected contraceptive hormones, an intrauterine device (IUD), or
             barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicidal) to prevent pregnancy, are practicing
             abstinence or where the partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to
             be of childbearing potential. Postmenopausal women who have fertilized eggs implanted
             are also considered to be of childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of
             contraception may include total abstinence at the discretion of the Investigator in
             cases where the age, career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures
             compliance. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
             Reliable contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             should be maintained throughout the study and for 7 months after study treatment
             discontinuation. All women of childbearing potential and male partners must use a
             double-barrier method of birth control or practice continuous abstinence from
             heterosexual contact throughout the study and for seven months after the end of the
             last treatment

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had major surgical procedures in the prior 6 weeks

          -  Patients with an inability to swallow oral medications or gastrointestinal disease
             limiting absorption of oral agents

          -  Patients who have received prior external beam radiotherapy to more than 50% of bone
             marrow, as determined by a radiation medicine physicist who will calculate the volume
             of bone marrow exposure in prior radiotherapy portals divided by the volume of total
             bone marrow harboring tissues. This ratio must be less than 50 percent

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III, IV)

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to triapine or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection; symptomatic decompensated congestive heart failure; unstable
             angina pectoris; cardiac arrhythmia; and known inadequately controlled hypertension

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because triapine is a ribonucleotide
             reductase (RNR) inhibitor and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a peptide receptor
             radionuclide therapy with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with triapine and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with triapine and
             lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and for 2.5 months following the last treatment

          -  Discontinue long-acting somatostatin analogs (e.g., long-acting octreotide) for at
             least 4 weeks prior to initiating lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Long-acting somatostatin
             analog will be allowed to continue if patient has history of carcinoid syndrome and
             requires long-acting somatostatin analog for control of his/her functional syndrome
