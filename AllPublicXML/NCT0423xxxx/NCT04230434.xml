  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Safety Plan Intervention (SPI) has demonstrated to reduce suicide reattempts and to
      increase the ambulatory follow-up in american war veterans. This study evaluates the
      implementability and effectiveness in a significantly different population in a real world
      setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a Effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Design (Curran et al. 2012) to study
      firstly the feasibility of implementing the SPI in our clinical setting and secondly its
      effectiveness. The experimental arm will consist in a group of patients who visit the ED for
      a suicide-related concern in which the SPI is performed. This will be in the Emergency
      Department , unless for clinical reasons, the ED psychiatrist decide to postpone it to the
      first psychiatric appointment (which will be before one week of the ED visit as part of the
      treatment as usual).

      Right after the SPI is performed, both the patient and the clinician will complete
      questionnaire with satisfaction and acceptability measures. Subjects will be followed for 6
      months. At this time medical records will be consulted to obtain suicide reattempts rates and
      follow-up adherence.

      At all times, the anonymity of the participants will be preserved and will require heading of
      informed consent, as well as other ethical aspects indicated by the Ethics Committee.

    <description>The SPI has 6 key steps: (1) identify personalized warning signs for an impending suicide crisis; (2) determine internal coping strategies that distract from suicidal thoughts and urges; (3) identify family and friends who are able to distract from suicidal thoughts and urges and social places that provide the opportunity for interaction; (4) identify individuals who can help provide support during a suicidal crisis; (5) list mental health professionals and urgent care services to contact during a suicidal crisis; and (6) lethal means counseling for making the environment safer (Stanley &amp; Brown, 2012)</description>
