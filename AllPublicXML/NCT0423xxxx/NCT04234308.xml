  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A suture is a biomedical device that is made of natural or synthetic materials. Sutures are
      used to close tissue surfaces until wounds heal and regain their ability to withstand normal
      stresses. Although different suture materials are available for various dental procedures,
      clinicians commonly neglect to select sutures based on their mechanical properties and
      capabilities. Instead, clinicians rely on their clinical experience to determine which suture
      material will suffice for wound closure and healing. To our knowledge, there have been no
      published studies detailing the results of mechanical testing on sutures after clinical
      application. The aim of this study is to clinically, histologically, and mechanically assess
      the four common sutures used in periodontal and dental surgery, with the hopes of providing
      clinicians with a guide that will allow them to choose sutures based on the clinical,
      histological, mechanical properties that best fit the stress and strain applied to the wound.
