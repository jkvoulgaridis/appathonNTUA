  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the increased number of HLA-mismatched haploidentical transplantation with
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide performed each year and the high risk of infectious
      complications associated with this type of transplant, the investigators suggest that GM-CSF
      administration post-infusion of T-replete haploidentical stem cells and post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide can yield similar count recovery rates to G-CSF with a potential of lowering
      risk of infectious complications.

    <description>The aim of the study is to establish equivalent effectiveness of Sargramostim to a matched control cohort of G-CSF treated patients in time to achieve neutrophil (ANC &gt;500 x3 days) post infusion of HLA-mismatched peripheral blood haploidentical stem cells with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Patients will be followed for 3 months following the initiation of treatment to see engraftment numbers at 20 days after initial treatment.</description>
