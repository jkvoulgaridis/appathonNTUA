    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Polatuzumab Vedotin in combination with BR
      (Bendamustine and Rituximab) compared with BR alone in Chinese participants with R/R DLBCL.
      Approximately 42 Chinese participants will be randomised to treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio.
      Randomisation will be conducted with the aid of an interactive web-based response system
      (IxRS).
