  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, open-label study to evaluate the effect of a single
      dose of fedratinib on the PK, safety, and tolerability of single doses of digoxin,
      rosuvastatin, and metformin in healthy subjects. The subjects will participate as follows:

        -  Screening phase

        -  Treatment phase (includes baseline)

        -  Follow-up telephone call Subjects will be screened for eligibility during the screening
           phase. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will
           return to the clinical site on Day -1 for protocol-specified assessments, and will be
           domiciled at the clinical site from Day -1 through the morning of Day 22.

      During the study, blood samples will be collected at prespecified times for PK and PD. Urine
      samples will be collected at prespecified times for urinary PK evaluation of metformin.
      Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study.

             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or postmenopausal (defined
             as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a follicle-stimulating
             hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal range according to the laboratory used at
             Screening).

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP1) must:

               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the investigator at Screening and
                  Baseline (prior to starting study treatment). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy
                  testing during the course of the study, as applicable, and after end of study
                  treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from
                  heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to
                  use, and be able to comply with, any one of the following highly effective
                  contraception methods without interruption, beginning at least 14 days prior to
                  starting investigational product (IP), during the study treatment, and for at

             a. Practice true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a
             monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to use a barrier method

             recommended]) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while receiving
             study treatment, and for at least 30 days after the last dose of IP, even if he has
             undergone a successful vasectomy.

          8. Must be healthy, as determined by the Investigator on the basis of medical history,
             physical examination (PE), clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening and check-in (Day -1), as applicable:

             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT, and total bilirubin must be at or below the
             upper limit of the reference range on or before check-in (Day -1). Other clinical
             laboratory results must be either within normal range or deemed not clinically
             significant by the Investigator. Any out of range lab tests may be repeated up to 1
             time during Screening and up to 1 time at check-in per Investigator discretion to
             confirm eligibility.

          9. Must be afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.3°F).

             (inclusive), supine diastolic BP must be in the range of 50 to 90 mmHg (inclusive),

             and females must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec. An ECG may be repeated up to 2 times,
             and the average of the QTcF values will be used to determine subject eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. History (within 3 years prior to Screening) of any clinically significant
             neurological, GI, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine,
             hematological, dermatological, psychological, or other major disorders as determined
             by the Investigator.

          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study or
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study (congenital nonhemolytic
             hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is not acceptable).

          3. Subject has prior history of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE).

          4. Subject has signs or symptoms of WE (eg, ataxia, ocular paralysis, or cerebellar
             signs) without documented exclusion of WE by thiamine level and brain magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI).

          5. Subject has thiamine deficiency, defined as thiamine levels in whole blood below
             normal range according to institutional standard.

          6. Subject has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2 based
             on the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

          7. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication, including vaccines, within 30
             days of the first dose administration (with the exception of any palonosetron
             administered for purposes of this study).

          8. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral
             supplements and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration
             (with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 grams/day for no more than 3 consecutive
             days to treat minor illness or headache [per Investigator judgment]).

          9. Use of any metabolic enzyme or relevant transporter inhibitors or inducers that would
             affect the relevant drugs within 30 days of the first dose administration unless
             determined by the Investigator that there will be no impact on the study integrity or
             subject safety.

             The Indiana University &quot;P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be used to determine
             inhibitors and/or inducers of metabolic enzymes
             (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table/aspx). The Sponsor should be contacted

             necessary.

         10. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the
             first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known
             (whichever is longer).

         11. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion (eg, bariatric procedure, cholecystectomy).

             Appendectomy is acceptable.

         12. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration.

         13. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and

         14. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2 years
             before dosing or positive alcohol screen.

         15. Known to have serum hepatitis; known to be a carrier of the hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), or hepatitis C antibody (HCV
             Ab); have a positive result to the test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus at
             screening or have a positive result to the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             antibodies at screening. Subjects whose results are compatible with prior immunization
             (including natural and vaccination) against hepatitis B may be included at the
             discretion of the Investigator.

         16. Subject smokes &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or equivalent in other tobacco products, more
             frequently than 8 weeks prior to Screening (self-reported).

             Note: Subjects having a history of intolerability or hypersensitivity to selective
             serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, or
             serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that are suggestive of serotonin syndrome
             or related AE are not eligible for study participation.

         20. Female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding.
