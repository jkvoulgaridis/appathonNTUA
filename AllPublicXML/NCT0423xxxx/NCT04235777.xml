  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Genitourinary cancers are some of the most common types of cancer. They are lethal when they
      spread. The drug M7824 blocks the paths that cancer cells use to stop the immune system from
      fighting cancer. The drug M9241 triggers the immune system to fight cancer. Researchers want
      to learn if these drugs can help fight these cancers when given with and without Stereotactic
      Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) radiation.

      Objective:

      To learn if M7824 and M9241, with or without SBRT, can help the immune system to fight cancer
      better.

      Eligibility:

      People 18 and older with cancer that started in the bladder, kidneys, or other genitourinary
      organs (but not the prostate) and has spread to other parts of the body.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      medical history

      physical exam

      ability to do their normal activities

      blood tests

      urine tests

      electrocardiogram

      body scans.

      Participants will give a tumor sample or have a tumor biopsy.

      Screening tests will be repeated during the study.

      Participants will get M9241. It is injected under the skin every 4 weeks. They will also get
      M7824 through an intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks. For this, a small plastic tube is
      put into a vein in the arm. They will get these drugs in 28-day cycles until they leave the
      study. They may have SBRT.

      Participants will give tissue and saliva samples.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will get
      phone calls or emails every 12 weeks indefinitely.

      Background:

        -  Urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and other non-prostate genitourinary cancers
           are lethal in the metastatic state.

        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have greatly changed
           clinical management of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma (mRCC).

        -  Several PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are FDA-approved for non-prostate genitourinary cancers
           including five agents for second-line mUC, two agents for first-line
           cisplatin-ineligible mUC and one approval for second-line mRCC. However, response rates
           are modest (approximately 15-21% in mUC and 25% in mRCC).

        -  Therefore, novel combination strategies are needed to extend benefit of immunotherapy to
           the remaining approximate 75% of non-responders.

        -  Bintrafusp alfa (M7824) is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed
           of a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 fused to the extracellular domain of human
           TGF-beta receptor II (TGF beta RII), which effectively functions to sequester or trap
           all three TGF- beta isoforms. A phase I study of M7824 (NCT02517398) demonstrated a
           manageable safety profile and clinical efficacy among patients with heavily pre-treated
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  NHS-IL12 (M9241) is an immunocytokine composed of two IL-12 heterodimers, each fused to
           the H-chain of the NHS76 antibody. The NHS76 IgG1 antibody has affinity for both single-
           and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) allowing for targeted delivery of proinflammatory
           cytokine, IL-12, to necrotic portions of tumor at sites of DNA exposure to promote local
           immunomodulation. M9241has demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity (including
           durable responses) as well as an encouraging safety and anti-tumor activity in an
           ongoing phase Ib clinical trial in combination with an anti-PD-L1 agent (NCT02994953).

        -  Currently, no clinical data exists for the combination of M7824 plus M9241. Preclinical
           data suggest synergy between these agents and the available clinical data suggest that
           the combination of M7824 plus M9421 is likely to be well-tolerated.

        -  There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that stereotactic body radiation therapy
           (SBRT), which delivers highly conformal high-dose radiation, can promote anti-tumor
           immune responses both locally and systemically as well as synergize with immune
           checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy.

        -  SBRT-induced dsDNA breaks are tumoricidal and may promote immunogenicity. SBRT also
           upregulates PD-L1 expression and leads to activation of TGF-beta. SBRT may enhance
           intratumoral binding of DNA-damage localizing agent, M9241. Preclinical models have
           demonstrated impressive synergy with radiation plus M7824 and radiation plus M9241.

        -  We hypothesize that an immune-intensification approach involving M7824 plus M9241
           combined with SBRT will enhance therapeutic efficacy and clinical benefit in patients
           with metastatic non-prostate genitourinary cancers with an acceptable safety profile.

        -  The combination of M7824 with M9241 with or without administration of SBRT (sequential
           or concurrent) will aid evaluation of safety signals contributed by each agent and will
           provide insight into a currently unanswered question regarding the optimal timing and
           sequencing of SBRT and immunotherapy.

      Objective:

      -Determine the safety and tolerated doses of M9241 and M7824 alone or in combination with
      SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) administered sequentially or concurrently in
      patients with metastatic non-prostate genitourinary cancers

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic non-prostate
           genitourinary cancer.

        -  Patients must have metastatic disease defined as new or progressive lesions on
           cross-sectional imaging.

        -  Patients must have at least:

             -  One site of disease that is amenable to irradiation (a maximum of four sites may be
                irradiated) (in arm 2 and 3 only)

             -  One measurable site of disease (according to RECIST criteria) that will not be
                irradiated.

        -  Men and women 18 years of age or older

             antivirals [eg, entecavir, tenofovir, or lamivudine; (adefovir or interferon are not
             allowed)] at study entry and with planned monitoring and management according to
             appropriate labeling guidance.

          -  HCV positive patients are eligible if participants are on active HCV therapy at study
             entry and must be on a stable dose without documented clinically significant impaired
             liver function test or hematologic abnormalities and with planned monitoring and
             management according to appropriate labeling guidance.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to M7824 and/or M9241 investigational agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
             Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or recent clinically significant
             bleeding events considered by the Investigator as high risk for investigational drug
             treatment are also excluded with the exception of hematuria.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M7824 and/or M9241 are agents with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with M7824 and/or M9241, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with these agents.

          -  Patients with any active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune disease
             or recent history of a syndrome that required treatment with either systemic
             corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or immunosuppressive medications.
             Inhaled steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses up to 10 mg daily prednisone
             equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients with any active or recent history of inflammatory bowel disease, active lupus
             or scleroderma or other medical conditions (i.e pneumonits with planned SBRT to lung
             lesion) or genetic radiosensitivity syndromes will be excluded from the study unless
             deemed eligible by Principal Investigator because these diseases make the subject
             unsafe or ineligible for radiation therapy with SBRT.

          -  Patients with prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally
             curable cancers that have been apparently cured such as basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast or low
             risk Gleason 6 prostate cancer.

          -  Patients having tumor lesion(s) in the liver or chest which are 10 cm or larger.
