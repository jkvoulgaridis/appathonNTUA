  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity should be the essence of treatment in patients with cardiovascular
      risk factors. Unfortunately, these interventions are usually insufficiently promoted and
      therefore have only limited efficacy. The aim of the study was to determine the benefits of
      nurse led intervention to promote physical activity in sedentary older adults with
      cardio-vascular risk factors in the outpatient setting. Eligible patients are randomized in a
      1:1 fashion to receive nurse led tutorial on life-style modification including pedometer
      hand-out with a daily goal of at least 7000 steps and supporting phone calls (study group) or
      without a goal or calls (control group). The primary end-point of the study is change in body
      weight. Secondary end-points include changes in resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure, total cholesterol and fasting glucose and clinical outcomes at 3 months
      follow-up.
