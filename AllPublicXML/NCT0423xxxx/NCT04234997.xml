  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of suvorexant on established measures of
      smoking relapse risk (craving,withdrawal, stress reactivity, latency to self-administration)
      and to validate the somnolent effect of suvorexant on sleep metrics in a sample of
      individuals with tobacco use disorder
