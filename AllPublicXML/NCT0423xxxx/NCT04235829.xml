  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to explore the relationship between early weight loss in the 4 weeks following
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and outcomes, in terms of weight loss and comorbidity
      improvement, 7 years following the surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in the 6 month period between
      01/04/2012 and 01/10/2019 were identified. For those meeting the inclusion criteria,
      demographic and medical data was extracted from hospital notes. This included initial BMI and
      the presence of, or treatment for, diabetes or hypertension.

      Using the contact details available in the medical records, a scripted telephone interview
      was performed. The current weight of the patient as well as a current medical and drug
      history were elicited. This data was compared with data attained during initial patient
      interaction with the service.

      Early weight loss, defined as weight lost in the 4 weeks following surgery, was subsequently
      correlated with outcomes in terms of weight loss and improvement/resolution of either
      hypertension or diabetes at a 7 year follow up interval.
