      Background:

      The immune system is the body s defense against bacteria and other harmful invaders. In
      people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the immune system becomes overactive and
      attacks healthy cells by mistake. Many people use glucocorticoids (GCs) to treat their SLE.
      GCs can calm down an overactive immune system by changing how the body reads genes. But GCs
      have side effects that can increase over time. Researchers want to learn more about how GCs
      work. This may help to develop new and better drugs for treating SLE without the side effects
      GCs have.

      Objective:

      To better understand how GCs affect the immune system in people with SLE.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18-80 with SLE.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam. They will have a health and medical
      history. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have an electrocardiogram to measure
      heart activity. For this, sticky pads are put on their chest, arms, and legs.

      Participants will have a methylprednisolone infusion for about 30 minutes. It will be given
      through a needle in a vein.

      Blood will be collected immediately before, 2 hours after, and 4 hours after the start of the
      infusion. Blood pressure and heart activity will be monitored. Participants will repeat some
      of the screening tests.

      Participants will be contacted twice in the week after the infusion visit. They will discuss
      any health problems they are having.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune syndrome that causes pervasive
      immune dysregulation in all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Most patients
      with SLE require glucocorticoid treatment at some point of the disease course, but the
      specific effects of glucocorticoids that lead to therapeutic benefit in this condition are
      not well understood. In addition, the glucocorticoid dosing regimens that are administered to
      patients with SLE in clinical practice are arbitrary and not based on detailed knowledge of
      the effects of glucocorticoids at different doses on cells of the immune system. This study
      aims to improve our understanding of the effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system of
      patients with SLE, and to test for possible differences in these effects at a range of
      clinically relevant doses.

      A consistent outcome of glucocorticoid exposure is a significant reprogramming of a cell s
      transcriptional state. The exact changes, however, vary substantially across cell types.
      Studies of specific cell populations, therefore, are necessary to gain a realistic view of
      the transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids. Given that cell composition and molecular
      behavior are known to differ among pathological states, the study of patients with SLE is
      necessary to identify the effects of glucocorticoids that are most likely to be responsible
      for their clinically beneficial effects in this condition.

      In this study, participants with SLE, ages 18-80 years, will be randomized to receive a
      single intravenous infusion of 1 of 2 doses of the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg
      or 250 mg). Blood will be collected at baseline (within 45 days before infusion), immediately
      before the infusion, and again at 2 and 4 hours after the start of the infusion. Blood
      samples will be processed for isolation of hematopoietic cell subsets, including neutrophils,
      B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and plasmacytoid
      dendritic cells. Laboratory studies will be performed on the purified cells, with the goal of
      understanding the human response to glucocorticoids in vivo at the level of RNA (eg, RNA
      sequencing [RNA-seq], small-RNA-seq, real-time polymerase chain reaction), DNA (eg, chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing, methylation analysis, DNA sequencing, genotyping), and
      protein (eg, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry). At each time point, serum methylprednisolone
      levels will be measured and flow cytometry for standard cell-lineage markers will be
      performed.
