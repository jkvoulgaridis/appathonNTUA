  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that
      has previously been to shown to have therapeutic potential in traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      patients. In this study, the study team will use a brain activity monitor
      (electroencephalogram, EEG) and a computer-based task to observe the effects of different
      forms of tES, like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial pulsed
      current stimulation (tPCS), on impulse control and sustained attention in people with TBI.
      Additionally, the study team will measure how much tDCS and tPCS affect the brain activity of
      a specific area of the brain associated with impulse control and attention. Problems with
      response inhibition have been shown to make rehabilitation more difficult for people with
      TBI. It also reduces social functioning and can also negatively affect job performance, which
      ultimately lead to a decreased quality of life. A better understanding of the effects of tES
      in TBI patients could be informative in finding out what its therapeutic potential is for
      this population.
