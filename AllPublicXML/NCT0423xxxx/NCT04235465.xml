    <textblock>
      Dyslexia is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and
      writing, despite adequate intelligence and conventional education, motivation or social level
      and it is often accompanied by sensory and motor deficits. It has been demonstrated that
      children with dyslexia present poor postural control compared to their age-matched peers.
      However, less attempt was made to demonstrate validity and reliability of balance impairment
      tools in children with dyslexia.

      The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a balance assessment tool that is used to evaluate the
      quality of dynamic balance during walking and an individual's ability to modify walking in
      different kinds of situations and dual tasks. It takes ten minutes and is a practical
      clinical assessment tool. Therefore, the DGI can be considered as a promising assessment tool
      to assess dynamic balance.

      There is a need for valid and reliable assessment tools to evaluate balance in children with
      dyslexia. In this study, the investigators aim to translate the DGI into the Turkish language
      and investigate validity and reliability in children with dyslexia.

    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index measures functionality and dynamic balance in walking and stair climbing. The DGI consists of 8 items including normal gait on flat ground, gait with speed changes, gait with horizontal head movements, gait with vertical head movements, gait and pivot turn, gait and step over obstacle, gait around obstacles and steps up and down stairs. The performance on each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (severe disorder) to 3 (independent walking). The total score is 24.</description>

    <measure>Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Reach Test (FRT) is a static balance test. Measurement is carried out by a tape measure attached to the wall parallel to the floor. The individual was standing parallel to a wall with the feet shoulder wide apart and the shoulders extended at 90 degrees flexion; in this position the third metacarpal head was recorded as the initial position. Then, the patient was asked to reach as forward as (s)he can, without taking a step. Again, the evaluator determined the position of the third metacarpal. The difference in centimeters between the first and second marks determined the FRT value. The FRT was performed three times and average value was taken.</description>
