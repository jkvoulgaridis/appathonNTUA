  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25%
      of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline,
      delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of
      stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a
      positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less
      delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital
      readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older
      hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to
      increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy
      issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to
      evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among
      patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of
      motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and
      prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute
      Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is
      provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity
      during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model,
      social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle. It involves a four-step
      approach that includes: (1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2) Education; (3)
      Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff, Patients and Families.
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT within 12 hospitals in
      Maryland and Pennsylvania randomized to FFC-AC-EIT or Function Focused Care Education Only
      (EO) with 50 patients recruited per hospital (total sample 600 patients). Aim 1 will focus on
      efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity, function, and
      participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use
      of tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers)
      along with emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1,
      6 and 12 months post discharge; and at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of
      FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate function and physical activity at 6,
      12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-EIT will be compared
      with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will evaluate the
      feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost
      and cost savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO. Findings will address several prioritized areas of
      research: a focus on ADRD; improving physical function; and training of hospital staff and
      will demonstrate efficacy of an approach to care for patients with ADRD that can be
      disseminated and implemented across all acute care facilities.

      After hospitals are recruited they will be randomized to cohort and randomly assigned to
      treatment so that the hospital will receive either FFC-AC-EIT or EO. FFC-AC-EIT is
      implemented by a Research Nurse Facilitator working with the stakeholder team and unit
      champions for 10 hours weekly during months one and two and then for four hours weekly
      starting in month three for a total of 12 months. Timing of the intervention activities will
      be flexible based on the needs of the unit. The first meeting with the stakeholder team will
      be 1-2 hours and the remaining meetings will be approximately 30 minutes monthly to update
      the stakeholders on progress and any challenges associated with implementation of FFC-AC-EIT.
      The majority of the time on the unit by the Research Nurse Facilitator will be spent with the
      champions helping and assuring that they are engaging staff in function focused care
      activities via the four steps of FFC-AC-EIT. Once hospitals are randomized we will set up a
      time to meet with the identified contact to determine the stakeholder team members and
      champions and organize the first stakeholder team meeting. The first meeting will provide an
      overview of the implementation of Steps 1 to 4 [(1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2)
      Education; (3) Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff,
      Patients and Families] and will address the unit challenges to implementing function focused
      care using a Brainstorming approach. In the first two months the Research Nurse Facilitator
      completes the environment and policy assessments with the champions and implements
      appropriate changes on the units and plans and provides staff education and makes available
      information for patients and families/ caregivers. The education reviews function focused
      care. Ongoing work between the champions and the Research Nurse Facilitator focuses on
      motivating staff and patients to work toward achievement of patient goals and established
      unit goals. The stakeholder team will continue to meet with the Research Nurse Facilitator
      monthly (approximately 30 minutes) over the 12-month intervention period to review progress
      and to help champions overcome any identified multilevel challenges. In addition to monthly
      visits, weekly emails containing motivational Tidbits will be sent to all stakeholder team
      members within the cohort. The Tidbits include such things as updates about benefits of
      engaging patients with ADRD in physical activity while hospitalized. To further facilitate
      implementation we will give each treatment site: 1) a 100 dollar gift certificate from Nasco
      (Nasco.com) to buy supplies for the unit to engage patients with ADRD in physical activities
      (e.g., age-appropriate weights; soft horseshoe toss game); 2) 1000 dollars at the end of the
      study for each champion to attend a conference and submit an abstract focused on optimizing
      function and physical activity of hospitalized older adults with ADRD. Education Only (EO)
      Control Intervention: Hospitals randomized to EO will be provided with an in-service for
      nursing staff on function focused care in patients with ADRD by an EO Research Nurse
      Facilitator using our developed PowerPoint presentations in 30-minute sessions as is
      currently done in usual practice.
