      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of ponatinib in patients
      with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) or blast
      phase (BP) or with Ph positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who either are
      resistant or intolerant to either dasatinib or nilotinib, or have the T315I mutation.
