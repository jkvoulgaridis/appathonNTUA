  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the aim of work is to compare the early postoperative and late term wound complication rates
      between the scalpel and electrosurgery in patients with benign gynecological conditions
      undergoing abdominal incisions.

      â€¢ Study Hypothesis: - Using electrosurgery decrease incision blood loss, decrease
      postoperative pain, decrease wound time incision, decrease analgesia requirements, doesn't
      increase wound sepsis.

      Type of study: - Randomized controlled trial study (parallel group study with 1:1
      randomization) will be conducted at gynecology department of Alzhraa University Hospital of
      faculty of Medicine for girls - Cairo within 1 year according to sample size. A computer
      randomization will be generated and held with one of the experimenter, and (n) of black and
      red card will be used for allocation concealment.

      Participants at morning of the operation will be given information about the study aims and
      written consent will be taken.
