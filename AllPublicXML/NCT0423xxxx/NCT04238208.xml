  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of using lidocaine 5% patch to
      8% capsaicin patch in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Assessment of analgesic
      effectiveness was assessed by observing any change in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)
      score, average daily pain Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for painful diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (BPI-DPN Q4) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Assessment of
      capsaicin and lidocaine safety and identifying treatment adverse effects were secondary
      endpoints in this study

The codes 11 were used for the capsaicin patch, 12 for the control patch and 33 for the lidocaine patch.
