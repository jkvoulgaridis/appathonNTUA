  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research group will investigate the diagnostic effect of early introduction of ultrasound
      guided pleural biopsy in the work-up of patients with one-sided pleural effusion, suspected
      of malignant pleural effusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unilateral pleural effusion with high protein content (exudative pleural
      effusion) are likely to have malignant pleural effusion. In the Danish guidelines, patient
      undergo two thoracentesis before more invasive procedures, due to the relatively low incidens
      of pleural TB and mesothelioma. The aim of the research group is to investigate the effect of
      early introduction of ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy taken at the optimal sport for
      thoracentesis. The research group will randomise half of our patients with unilateral pleural
      exudate to up-front ultrasound-guided biopsy and the other half usual care eg. a second
      thoracentesis, to see if there is a benefit of early pleural biopsy in the work-up of
      patients with unilateral pleural effusion, suspected of malignant pleural effusion.

    <description>Our primary endpoint includes both patients who will receive palliative care and patients who will receive active treatment. For patients receiving palliative care, the presence of malignant cells is sufficient. However, for patients receiving active treatment, the primary endpoint is defined as a definite and treatment-guiding pathological result (immunohistochemistry, mutations, oncodrivers, culture and biochemistry) as decided by a multidisciplinary team conference.</description>

    <description>Using ultrasound the optimal point of entry for thoracentesis is located. Local anesthesia is obtained with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine with adrenalin injected in cutis, subcutis, muscle and pleura. Before removing the syringe, aspiration of pleural fluid confirms the relevance of the chosen site . Again, the area is wiped with disinfectant and a millimeter small skin incision is made with a pointed scalpel. Six US-guided biopsies of 1.2 millimetres using closed needle biopsies (Quick-core Biopsy Needle 18G, COOK Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA or Bard Max Core needle 18G, Temple, Arizona, USA). ) are taken from the parietal pleura. Thoracentesis is performed as described above using the same incision as the pleural biopsy.</description>

    <description>The optimal point of entry (the largest distance between parietal and visceral pleura) is identified using ultrasound. This is usually on the lower, dorsal side of the chest. Local anesthesia is obtained with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine with adrenalin injected in cutis, subcutis, muscle and pleura. Before removing the syringe, aspiration of pleural fluid confirms the relevance of the chosen site. The area is wiped with disinfectant and a millimeter skin incision is made with a pointed scalpel. A 7 French (or up to 16 French, to the choice of the clinician) pigtail catheter is inserted and connected to sealed bag. Fluid is aspirated via a 3-way valve, and transferred to relevant bottles for culture, analysis of albumin and LDH, protein, and for cytology.</description>
