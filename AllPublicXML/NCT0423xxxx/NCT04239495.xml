  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and function with age. It has been recognised as an
      important health problem because it is common in older adults and associated with decline in
      physical function as well as a reduced quality of life. Sarcopenia can also lead to serious
      health consequences in terms of increased disability and the need for increased health and
      social care.

      There is considerable interest in understanding what causes sarcopenia in order to develop
      new approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment. To gain a detailed understanding of
      sarcopenia across a range of ages, we have designed the Muscle Ageing Sarcopenia Study
      (MASS_Lifecourse) in collaboration with members of the public and patients.

      We aim to recruit 160 participants from Newcastle upon Tyne across an age range of 45-85
      years from primary care, secondary care and the NIHR (National Institute for Health Research)
      Bioresource. Participants will receive a home visit from a researcher to complete a detailed
      health profile. Participants will then be invited to attend a clinical visit at Newcastle's
      Campus for Ageing and Vitality for imaging and muscle biopsy. A subsequent clinical visit
      will involve a fasting blood test, follow-up of the biopsy site and gather participants'
      views about taking part in the study.

      The aims of the study:

        1. To determine if it is acceptable and feasible to recruit adults across a range of ages
           to undergo detailed studies of skeletal muscle including biopsy

        2. To understand how lifestyle is related to the characteristics of muscle

        3. To use advances in technology (an omics approach) to identify mechanisms of sarcopenia
           and biomarkers for early diagnosis

        4. To use findings from 2 and 3 to develop new approaches to treatment and also to invite
           participants to relevant trials

        5. To secure funding for maintaining and expanding the cohort

        The study will aim to recruit 160 participants (approximately 80 women and 80 men) aged 45
        to 85 years of age to participate in this study, divided into four ten-year age groups of
        equal size (45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75-85 years old, with 20 men and 20 women in each age
        group).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Primary care source:

        - Registered patient with one of the GP (General Practice) surgeries identified as PIC
        (Participant Identification Centre) via North East and North Cumbria Clinical Research
        Network.

        Secondary care source:

        - Attending a NuTH (Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) clinical area.

        NIHR Bioresource:

        - Participants identified by the NIHR Bioresource Centre Newcastle as being eligible for
        the study and who have not previously expressed a wish to no longer be contacted about
        further studies.

        For all recruitment sources:

          -  Has capacity to consent.

          -  Within the study age range (45-85 years).

          -  Not taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications (see below under exclusion
             criteria), with the exception of aspirin being taken for primary prevention (i.e.
             where there is no diagnosis of cardiovascular disease).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Inability to give informed consent.

        - As the study involves biopsy of skeletal muscle, individuals who are taking medications
        that increase bleeding risk are excluded, specifically: i. anti-coagulant medication:
        warfarin, injected low-molecular weight heparins such as dalteparin, and direct oral
        anticoagulant drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban.

        ii. anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel or prasugrel. This also includes aspirin
        where an individual has a known history of cardiovascular disease. Aspirin being taken
        where there is no history of cardiovascular disease is acceptable, as we would consider
        there to be minimal risk of stopping the aspirin for 14 days prior to biopsies.

          -  Individuals known to have diabetes mellitus, due to the increased risk of infection at
             the biopsy sites.

          -  Individuals currently taking medication that suppresses the immune system (such as
             prednisolone or methotrexate), due to the increased risk of infection or poor healing
             of the biopsy sites.

          -  Pregnancy, due to the exposure to small amount of ionising radiation during the DXA
             scan.

          -  Individuals who use a wheelchair or who are unable to walk without assistance, as we
             would anticipate that the muscle biopsy procedure would not be feasible in these
             groups.

          -  An individual who the NuTH clinician / GP feels it is inappropriate for the
             researchers to approach - the NuTH clinician / GP may consider an individual
             unsuitable for approach for reasons such as end stage terminal disease or safety risk.
