      to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of single ultrasound guided Platelet Rich Plasma
      injection of the carpal tunnel Vs. surgical procedures and medical treatment and hand support
      in patients with mild-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome regarding pain relief and function
      improvement during a follow up period of 6 months.

    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for approximately 90% of peripheral entrapment
      neuropathy cases. Existing evidence based treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome, splinting,
      corticosteroid injection and surgery, are not 100% effective and alternative treatments are
      worth exploring .Surgery indicated in Patients with persistent numbness and pain, motor
      dysfunction with diminished grip or pinch grasping, or thenar eminence flattening. Empirical
      evidence indicates that many patients with CTS have self-limiting symptoms and respond to
      splinting and anti-inflammatory medications. Recently major attention has been drawn to
      platelet-rich plasma for its possible effects on axon regeneration and neurological recovery.
