  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mirror therapy has recently attracted increasing attention; however, most patients have the
      difficulties to perform mirror therapy due to limited imaginary ability. A mirror robotic
      hand system was developed, which consisted with a wearable exoskeletal hand, sensor glove,
      and a control box. The patient's unaffected hand wears the sensor glove, the affected hand
      wears the wearable exoskeleton hand, and the unaffected hand does the certain transitive and
      intransitive tasks as the mirror group, and then makes the affected hand do the same
      movements driven by the exoskeleton robotic hand. The investigators hypothesize that
      combining both approaches might facilitate the sensorimotor cortex that controls movement and
      might augment somatosensory input and further treatment efficacy. This study is aimed at
      investigating the effects of Mirror therapy and robotic mirror therapy on motor cortical
      activations in healthy adults using electroencephalography. Participants, age 20-50 years,
      right handed, with normal upper extremity and cognition functions will be recruited. The
      investigators will exclude patients who had wrist weakness or deformity, skin problem and
      musculoskeletal injury of upper extremities. All participants will perform the conditions of
      resting, moving right hand with or without robotic hand as the baseline data, then they will
      do mirror therapy using the right hand as active hand, or wearing robotic hand doing mirror
      therapy in random sequence. Electroencephalography (EEG) assessment will be done to assess
      the neurophysiologic effects of the different interventions. The investigators will use a
      questionnaire to assess the subjective opinion about the different interventions.

      combined with execution (video AOE). The investigators will use the pair-t test to assess the
      within subjects differences in EEG and the questionnaire results.

      This study will be done during 2020/02/01 - 2020/03/31.
