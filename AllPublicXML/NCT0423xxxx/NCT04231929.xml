  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to confirm safety and efficacy of BioPearl™
      microspheres loaded with doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, multi-centre, post-market study to further assess safety
      and efficacy in 20 unresectable HCC patients treated with Doxorubicin loaded BioPearl™
      microspheres.

      After the treatment procedure, all patients will undergo clinical follow-up until disease
      progression and/or next treatment option (including transplantation) after which patients
      will be followed for survival.

    <description>First, an angiography of the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and hepatic artery will be obtained by using a peripheral arterial approach.
Arterial embolization will be performed through catheterization of intrahepatic arteries, as selectively as possible (tumor feeders, subsegmental, segmental). The size of the microcatheter must be consistent with the size of BioPearl™ microspheres used. Microspheres of 200 µm will be be used. They will be loaded with the appropriate dose of doxorubicin injectable solution, mixed with the contrast media and distributed according to the location of the HCC lesions. The endpoint of the procedure will be achieved end when stasis of the feeders is achieved.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is at least 18 years old.

          2. Patient with HCC confirmed by histology or according to the latest applicable version
             of the EASL-EORTC criteria.

          3. BCLC B patient or BCLC A patient not a candidate for curative treatment (resection,
             ablation) or who has failed/recurred after resection/ablation. Patient on a transplant
             list can be included.

          4. Normal liver or compensated cirrhosis with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh Class
             A).

          5. Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl.

          6. Patient with no ascites or with medically controlled ascites.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient previously treated with any systemic therapy for HCC.

          2. Patient previously treated with a loco-regional therapy for HCC. Prior
             resection/ablation is allowed as per inclusion criteria 3.

             listed for transplantation).

          4. Advanced liver disease: Child-Pugh's B-C class or active gastrointestinal bleeding,
             encephalopathy.

          5. Advanced tumoral disease: BCLC class C or D (vascular invasion - even segmental,
             extra-hepatic spread or cancer-related symptoms performance status ≥1).

          6. Patient with another primary tumor.

          7. Patient with history of biliary tree disease or biliary dilatation.

          8. Portal vein thrombosis, porto-systemic shunt, hepatofugal blood flow or absent portal
             blood flow in the liver area to be treated.

          9. Contraindication to multiphasic CT and MRI (e.g. allergy to contrast media).

         10. Any other contraindication for embolization procedure or doxorubicin treatment.

         11. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints.

             Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but
             have become commercially available since then, are not considered investigational
             trials.

         12. In the Investigator's opinion patient has (a) co-morbid condition(s) that could limit
             the patient's ability to participate in the study, compliance with follow-up
             requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study.

         13. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
