      Patients allergic to seafood and/or sensitized to Tropomyosin of SPT or crustacean origin
      will may be also be sensitized to edible insects. Aim of the study is to evaluate whether
      patients allergic to seafood and/or sensitized to Tropomyosin of SPT or crustacean origin may
      be more often be sensitized to edible insects used as food source.

    <textblock>
      House dust mite allergy is a common problem in Europe. In addition to inhalant allergies
      sensitization to mites can be related to food allergy namely seafood. Insects are also
      widespread food sources in many regions of the world.

      In this study skin testing and laboratory tests are planned in patients with known house dust
      mite allergy to evaluate a possible sensitization to insects. Patients must also complete a
      questionnaire. A drug therapy or other intervention is not planned.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate whether patients allergic to seafood and/or sensitized to
      Tropomyosin of SPT or crustacean origin may be more often be sensitized to edible insects
      used as food source.
