      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using Chinese Medicine Angong Niuhuang Wan in stroke
      patients, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score will be used as primary outcome, the National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score and
      the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores will be used as secondary outcome measures.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which is used to further
      determine the effectiveness of Angong Niuhuang Wan in treating stroke patients on top of the
      standard conventional treatment, also to evaluate the improvement level on quality of life of
      post-stroke after using Angong Niuhuang Wan. The effect of Angong Niuhuang Wan on liver and
      kidney function will be focused and using NMR techniques to analysis metabolomics to further
      study the safety and effectiveness of Angong Niuhuang Wan on the prevention and treatment of
      stroke.

      It is a 24-week trial, Double-blind treatment for 1 week, follow up visit for 23 weeks. All
      participant will have study blood taking for renal and liver function test and questionnaires
      assessment during study visits. Informed consent will be obtained before study enrollment.
