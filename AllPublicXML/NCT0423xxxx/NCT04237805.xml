      The study comprises two phases: phase I dose escalation (including PK run-in period and
      treatment period) and phase II study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label dose-finding phase I/II study to determine the
      MTD and RP2D of oral foritinib succinate monotherapy in patients with advanced ALK-positive
      malignant solid tumor, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK characteristics of
      SAF-189s in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. ALK was required to be detected in
      tumor tissue by Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC); if the patient has been previously tested
      in a local laboratory with positive ALK result by Ventana IHC test prior to enrollment, the
      patient can be recruited, however, the patient still need to provide archived tumor tissue
      for central laboratory testing.
