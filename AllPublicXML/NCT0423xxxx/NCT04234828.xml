  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a common pathology affecting between 4 and 8% of the general
      population. It aggravates morbidity and cardio-metabolic mortality and is responsible for
      accidents related to vigilance disorders. It is estimated that 80% of SAS cases are not
      diagnosed and therefore not treated. It is however impracticable to propose a diagnostic test
      of polygraphy (PG) or polysomnography (PSG) to every patient because of the cost and
      insufficient availability of these exams. It would therefore be useful to carry out a
      screening test before directing the patient to a complete test.

      Several simplified polygraph systems with 2 or 3 channels have been proposed (nasal cannula,
      oximetry, heart rate) but they generally record only one night and remain intrusive enough to
      perturb the sleep.

      The Withings Sleep is a non-contact device, along with an airbag placed under the mattress,
      which allows screening of SAS from four signals: movement, breathing, heart rate and snoring.
      The objective of the present study is to validate the diagnostic performance of the Withings
      Sleep for the detection of SAS compared to PSG.
