  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HDR brachytherapy in conjunction with pelvic SABR in high tier intermediate and high risk
      prostate cancer patients can provide a safe and effective means of radiotherapy dose
      escalation.

      Utilizing multiparametric MRI to focally boost the dominant intraprostatic lesion during HDR
      brachytherapy is safe and feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HDR brachytherapy:

      Under general anesthetic, prostate will be implanted transperineally using up to 18
      catheters. Three gold seed fudicials will also be implanted transperineally at base, midgland
      and apex forSABR treatment. Prostate will be contoured as Clinical Target Volume (CTV) on the
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) based ONCENTRA planning system. Rectum and urethra will be
      contoured as organs at risk. 15Gy will be prescribed to CTV as the MPD (minimal Peripheral
      Dose).

      Treatment Delivery-SABR There will be a 2 week interval between HDR and SABR component to
      allow for normal tissue recovery and radiotherapy planning time. Daily image guidance will be
      performed using the implanted fiducials to calculate patient shifts to ensure proper
      positioning. Post-treatment images will be taken to estimate intrafraction motion.

      Androgen Deprivation Therapy Twelve to 18 months of luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone
      agonists (LHRHa) will be used. Anti-androgen and neoadjuvant LHRHa can be used according to
      physician discretion

      Follow-Up and Toxicity Assessment Time zero will be the start of radiotherapy. Baseline
      rectal and urinary function will be recorded using common toxicity criteria adverse effect
      (CTCAE v3.0) and Expanded prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). CTCAE v3.0 and EPIC
      assessments will be done at weeks 3, 5 and 12 weeks. Bloodwork (PSA and testosterone),
      quality of life (EPIC) and late GI and GU toxicity evaluation (using the RTOG/EORTC Late
      Radiation Morbidity Scheme) will be performed every 6 months for the first 5 years.
