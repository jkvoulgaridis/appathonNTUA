  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cancer control clinical research study is to evaluate whether nutritional
      therapy with Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) might reduce mucositis
      (a condition caused by cancer treatment involving mouth sores, pain and/or bleeding that may
      cause difficulty eating), improve nutritional status and lessen the symptoms associated with
      chemo-radiation therapy which may result in quality of life (QOL) improvements during the
      prescribed treatment for cancer therapy.

             described in 4.0 Staging Criteria

          5. Not experiencing diarrhea during the 5 days preceding enrollment, as defined by having
