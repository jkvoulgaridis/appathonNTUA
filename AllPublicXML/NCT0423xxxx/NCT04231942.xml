      Hypothesis. Regular using of Class 1 below-knee graduated compression stockings (RAL GZ 387
      standard) compared to the absence of elastic compression will reduce the risk of clinically
      significant varicose veins recurrence at 12 months after endovenous thermal ablation of the
      great saphenous vein and elimination of varicose tributaries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of new varicose veins (VVs) appearance at 3 years after any invasive treatment
      is about 20%, and the progression rate of chronic venous disease (CVD) at 2 years after the
      endovenous thermal ablation (ETA) reaches 40%. When comparing open surgery and endovenous
      laser ablation (EVLA), the frequency of VVs recurrence at 12 months after intervention does
      not significantly differ and amounts to 10%. A previous study examining the effect of elastic
      compression on the risk of VVs recurrence after surgery showed a 92% reduction in relative
      risk. However, it was limited to the low number of followed patients and the absence of the
      compliance measurement. Thus, there is still no evidence, if long term using of graduated
      compression stockings (GSV) after modern modalities of VVs treatment (ETA with mini/micro
      phlebectomy or sclerotherapy) provides any benefits in the reduction of VVs recurrence. Also,
      there is no information on what regimen for GCS using is effective to reduce the risk of VVs
      recurrence: continuous use at every day or intermittent using only during specific
      activities.

      Our hypothesis is that regular using of Class 1 below-knee graduated compression stockings
      (RAL GZ 387 standard) compared to the absence of elastic compression will reduce the risk of
      clinically significant varicose veins recurrence at 12 months after endovenous thermal
      ablation of the great saphenous vein and elimination of varicose tributaries.

      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of regular using of below-knee graduated
      compression stockings (GCS) of Class 1 (RAL-GZ 387 standard: 18-21 mm Hg at the ankle level)
      on the risk of varicose veins clinical recurrence after endovenous thermal obliteration of
      the great saphenous vein and eliminating varicose tributaries in patients without residual
      varicose veins and / or venous symptoms.
