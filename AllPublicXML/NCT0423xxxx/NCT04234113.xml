      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of SO-C101 administered as monotherapy and
      in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab) in patients with selected
      relapsed/refractory advanced/metastatic solid tumors (renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell
      lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, Merkel-cell carcinoma, skin
      squamous-cell carcinoma, microsatellite instability high solid tumors, triple-negative breast
      cancer, mesothelioma, thyroid cancer, thymic cancer, cervical cancer, biliary track cancer,
