  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale. Currently there are well-established guidelines for the management of stable COPD.
      However, recommendations on the treatment of COPD exacerbations (E-COPD) are based on
      observational studies and low-quality clinical trials. In addition, there are some
      controversial aspects, such as treatment with systemic steroids. On the other hand, the
      available information on the adherence to the recommendations of the clinical practice
      guidelines (CPG) and its impact on the outcome of patients is scarce.

      Main objectives. (1) To examine the appropriateness of two clinical guidelines (GOLD and
      GesEPOC) of the current management of hospitalized exacerbations of COPD; (2) To determine in
      real-life clinical practice the impact of adherence to CPG recommendations for management of
      COPD exacerbations as an outcome of the disease (stay, in-hospital mortality, and 90-days
      post-discharge readmissions and mortality); (3) To examine the appropriateness of two
      clinical guidelines (GOLD and GesEPOC) of the treatment of stable COPD at admission and after
      discharge in patients hospitalized with exacerbated COPD; (4) To determinate in real-life
      clinical practice the impact of the suitability to CPG recommendations for treatment of
      stable COPD on 90-day post-discharge mortality and readmission of COPD.

      Method. National, multicenter, observational and longitudinal study of the first consecutive
      20 patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD between December 10 and 23, 2019 in the
      Internal Medicine Services of the participating Centers. Patients will be followed 90 days
      after discharge. A total of 400 patients will be recruited in 20 Spanish hospitals (20 per
      center). Independent variables: age, sex, admission service, body mass index, dyspnea (mMRC),
      obstruction (FEV¬₁), exacerbations in the previous year, comorbidities, bronchodilator
      treatment prior to admission, criteria of adequacy to the CPG in the clinical evaluation and
      treatment, hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours of admission, treatment of hyperglycemia
      and bronchodilator treatment at discharge. Outcomes: in-hospital mortality, mortality at 90
      days, re-admission at 90 days. Statistical analysis: Parametric and non-parametric tests,
      Kaplan-Meier and ROC curves and multiple logistic regression.
