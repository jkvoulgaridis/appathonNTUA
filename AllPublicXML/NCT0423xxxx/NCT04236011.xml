  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center prospective study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of GC012F CAR-T cells in patients diagnosed with BCMA+ refractory/relapsed multiple
      myeloma (r/r MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of GC012F in r/r MM. GC012F
      is an autologous dual chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell
      maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD19. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (less than or
      equal to [&lt;=] 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by Apheresis (will occur upon enrollment);
      Treatment Phase including a conditioning regimen followed by infusion of GC012F and
      post-infusion assessments from Day 1 to Day 84; and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 85 and up to
      end of the study). Efficacy will be explored to assessed and safety will be closely monitored
      during the study.
