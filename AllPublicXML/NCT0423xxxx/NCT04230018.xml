      The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in China's cancer disease spectrum is on the
      rise, and it is a common malignant tumor that harms the health of Chinese residents.In
      patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer, RAS status is highly consistent in
      primary focus and metastasis, so NCCN guidelines recommend RAS testing of primary or
      metastatic tissue is feasible .However, there are also some reports that the difference of
      RAS status between primary and metastatic lesions was up to 22%.In additiont,there are few
      studies on whether the gene profile of the metastatic lesion is the same as that of the
      primary lesion in patients with postoperative heterogeneous metastasis in patients with stage
      III colorectal cancer.

      The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in China's cancer disease spectrum is on the
      rise, and it is a common malignant tumor that harms the health of Chinese residents. Now NCCN
      guidelines recommend targeted drugs for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer mainly
      including cetuximab and panizumab whic targeting EGFR , as well as the bevacizumab and arber
      regofini, etc which targeing anti-angiogenic.Cetuximab and panizumab are only effective in
      patients with RAS wild type.

      Previous studies have shown that In patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer,
      RAS status is highly consistent in primary focus and metastasis, so NCCN guidelines recommend
      RAS testing of primary or metastatic tissue is feasible .However, there are also some reports
      that the difference of RAS status between primary and metastatic lesions was up to 22%.In
      additiont,there are few studies on whether the gene profile of the metastatic lesion is the
      same as that of the primary lesion in patients with postoperative heterogeneous metastasis in
      patients with stage III colorectal cancer.

      Therefore, it has important clinical significance to compare the difference of gene profile
      between metastatic lesion and primary lesion in patients with postoperative metastasis of
      stage III colorectal cancer.

        metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma and metastases could be punctured by interventional
        evaluation.In addittion,patients' blood ctDNA and tissues can be used to detect genetic
