  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) vary on a wide range of characteristics, which
      may impact the reinforcement value of the products compared to more harmful combustible
      products. A new type of low-powered ENDS device has surged in popularityâ€”the pod system. Pods
      use nicotine salt e-liquids, rather than free-base nicotine solutions that have been used in
      other ENDS device types. Manufacturers claim that these formulations reduce the harshness of
      nicotine delivery, while still delivering sufficiently high levels of nicotine. However, the
      role of nicotine salts in the popularity and use of pod systems remains unclear because no
      studies have directly manipulated and examined the role of nicotine formulation (salt vs.
      free base) in reinforcement value and use. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to
      assess the impact of nicotine formulation (nicotine salt vs. free-base) in reinforcement
      value and tobacco use. Current smokers (n=30) will complete a one-week baseline period where
      they smoke as normal before attending an in-person lab visit during which they will sample a
      traditional cigarette and two ENDS products (nicotine salt ENDS, free base ENDS). All aspects
      of the device will be held constant other than the nicotine formulation (including nicotine
      concentration, flavor options, device brand). Participants will answer questionnaires about
      each product they sample and then complete a preference assessment in which they choose
      between the products they sampled and their own cigarette. Finally, participants will be
      assigned to take one of the products they sampled home to use ad libitum (1-week sampling).
      During the at-home baseline and sampling weeks, participants will complete electronic daily
      diaries cataloging their tobacco use. Biomarkers (i.e., expired carbon monoxide, cotinine)
      will corroborate self-reported indices of use.
