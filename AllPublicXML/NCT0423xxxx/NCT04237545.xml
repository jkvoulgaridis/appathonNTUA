      This clinical study will evaluate the safety and performance of the T3 short dental implant
      when placed in the posterior maxilla and mandible.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized-controlled, multicenter study in which patients in need of
      dental implants in the posterior maxilla and mandible will be treated with either the T3
      short implant (test device) or the T3 standard length implant (control device). Qualified
      patients will have one or more edentulous areas in the posterior region to be restored using
      a single crown. All implants will be placed using a single-stage surgical protocol. A
      provisional or definitive (final) prosthesis will be placed (cemented or screw-retained)
      within 8 weeks of implant placement. All prosthetic work must be completed no later than 6
      months following implant placement surgery.

      Each site will be selected to place implants (both test and control) in either the DCD or the
      non-DCD configuration (a total of 30 implants per site). Among all study sites, a total of
      120 implants (60 test, 60 control) will be enrolled in this study (any geographic region).
      The patient will be randomized to receive either the T3 short (test device) or the T3
      standard length, ≥10mm, (control device) implant. Only patients meeting the inclusion /
      exclusion criteria and providing informed consent form will be enrolled into study. The
      duration of the study will be approximately 4 years from initiation to completion of data
      analysis and reporting.

They have integrated platform switching (medialized implant/abutment junction). For study both configurations, T3 without nano-scale Discrete Crystalline Deposition (non DCD- surface treatment) and T3 with nano-scale Discrete Crystalline Deposition (with DCD- surface treatment), will be used.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of either sex and at least 18 years of age

          2. Patients for whom a decision has already been made to use a dental implant for the
             restoration of existing partial edentulism in the posterior mandible or maxilla.

          3. Prior extracted sites (at least 4 months after extraction) preferred; immediate
             extractions allowed

          4. Splinting to a natural tooth is allowed for the short length (test) implants

          5. Intact buccal table as verified by CBCT or during surgery. If absent, patient should
             be excluded from enrollment in the study.

          6. Presence of opposing dentition (antagonist) that will allow for functional occlusion.

          7. The site intended for implant placement should have a minimum amount of keratinized
             gingiva of 2mm and a sufficient vertical bone height (8 - 10 mm in the maxilla; 10mm
             in the mandible); a short implant (as determined by randomization) will be placed
             without the need for augmentation except for minor dehiscence, which can be augmented
             with autogenous bone chips to improve soft tissue attachment. If site was randomized
             to long length implant (control) (with a minimum of 8mm vertical bone height in the
             maxilla or less than 10 mm in the mandible) it will have simultaneous augmentation
             procedure (sinus elevation in the maxilla; vertical ridge augmentation in the
             mandible).

          8. The site intended for implant placement should have approximately 1.5mm buccal-lingual
             distance on each side in order to allow for wide platform implant (5 and 6mm
             diameter).

          9. Patients must be physically able to tolerate conventional surgical and restorative
             procedures.

         10. Patients who provide a signed informed consent

         11. Patients who agree to be evaluated for each study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known systemic diseases such as uncontrolled diabetes, endocrine
             disease, heart disease, immuno-compromised, or mental disorders.

          2. Patients with current use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates or
             corticosteroid treatments.

          3. Patients with active infection or severe inflammation in the areas intended for
             treatment.

          4. Patients with a &gt; 10 cigarette per day smoking habit.

          5. Patients with a history of therapeutic radiation to the head or jaw.

          6. Patients receiving other dental treatment(s) during the study that could have a
             negative impact on the healing phase of the study treatment sites.

          7. Patients who are known to be pregnant at the screening visit or planning to become
             pregnant within 6 months of study enrollment.

          8. Patients with evidence of severe parafunctional habits such as bruxing or clenching.

          9. Patients who have previously failed dental implants at the site intended for study
             implant placement

         10. Patients with HIV or Hepatitis infection

         11. Patients with a history of generalized severe chronic periodontal disease
