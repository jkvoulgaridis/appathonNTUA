    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective cohort study to assess the efficacy of minimally-invasive
      non-surgical periodontal therapy (MINST) for the treatment of teeth with unfavourable
      periodontal prognosis. 20 patients who have teeth with unfavourable periodontal prognosis
      (due to bone loss to the apex or furcation involvement grade II C) will receive
      minimally-invasive non-surgical treatment (MINST) and will be reassessed up to 12 months
      after treatment.

    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with advanced periodontitis who have teeth with unfavourable periodontal
      prognosis (due to bone loss to the apex or furcation involvement grade II C) will be entered
      in this study, conducted at Guy's Hospital in London, UK. The study has a prospective cohort
      design, so following baseline assessment, all patients will receive minimally-invasive
      non-surgical treatment (MINST). A total of 10 visits are planned over a 12-13 months period
      including initial treatment (MINST) and follow-up appointments.

      The primary outcomes are radiographic defect depth (for teeth with bone loss to the apex,
      n=10) and furcation involvement (for teeth with furcation involvement degree II C, n=10).
      Paired t-test will be used to detect significant changes between baseline and 12 months for
      the primary outcomes using the patient as unit of analysis. Additional outcomes will be
      probing pocket depths (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), levels of inflammatory markers
      and growth factors in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva and bacterial detection in
      periodontal pockets
