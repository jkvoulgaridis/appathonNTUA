  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactate is a compound produced as a by-product of glycolysis. The increase in lactate
      concentration can result from a variety of causes, such as during anaerobic metabolism in
      exercise or haemodynamic shock in conditions such as sepsis.

      The study will aim to validate a novel microneedle-based minimally invasive device for the
      continuous measurement of lactate during exercise.

    <textblock>
      Lactate is a compound produced as a by-product of glycolysis. The increase in lactate
      concentration can result from a variety of causes, such as during anaerobic metabolism in
      exercise. The measurement of blood lactate during exercise has been routinely used to
      determine individual anaerobic thresholds, and optimise training in athletes.

      The measurement of the lactate trend requires multiple blood tests, and this can be
      uncomfortable. The need for repeated procedures may therefore restrict the full utility of
      the biomarker. Although point-of-care lactate measurements are possible, the barriers to
      initiating testing may also limit its role in clinical decision-making.

      The aim of the study is the validation of the microneedle-based lactate biosensor for
      real-time continuous lactate measurement in healthy volunteers during exercise as
      proof-of-concept.
