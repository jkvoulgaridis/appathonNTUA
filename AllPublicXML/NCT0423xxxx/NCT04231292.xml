      to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and the PK/PD characteristics of different doses,

    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter randomized, single blind, active comparator controlled phase 2
      study. The study is divided into two stages. The first stage lasts for 18 weeks, and is
      divided into fixed dose period (day 1~ 6th week ) and dose adjustment period (7th ~ 18th
      week). The second stage lasts for 28 weeks, and is also divided into dose adjustment period
      (19th ~ 38th week) and evaluation period (39th ~ 46th week).

      Patients are randomly assigned to seven study groups in the first stage. Of all these seven
      groups, six groups are: Group A (0.8μg/kg RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection,
      for 18 weeks)、Group B (1.2μg/kg RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, for 18
      weeks)、Group C (1.6μg/kg RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, for 18 weeks)、
      Group D (0.8ug/kg RD01, once every two weeks, intravenous injection, for 18 weeks)、Group E (
      150 IU/kg rHuEPO, once a week, subcutaneous injection, for 18 weeks )、Group F (8μl /kg
      placebo, once every two weeks, for 6 weeks; then 150 IU/kg rHuEPO, once a week, subcutaneous
      injection, 7th ~ 18th week ).

      At the beginning of the second stage, some patients in these six goups need to be be
      randomized again. Of which patients in Group A、B、C are randomly assigned to Group a ( RD01,
      once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week )、Group b (RD01, once every
      four weeks, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week)、Group c (RD01, once every six weeks,
      subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week); Patients in Group D enter directly to Group d
      (RD01, once every four weeks, intravenous injection, 19th ~ 46th week); Patients in Group E
      and F are randomly assigned to Group e (rHuEPO once a week, intravenous injection, 19th ~
      46th week ) and Group f (rHuEPO once a week, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week). The
      starting dose of the second stage for individual patient in all groups refers to the weekly
      dose at the end of the first stage .

      During the whole study period, all patients in six groups are not allowed to adjust dosage in
      the first 6 weeks, while in the remaining trial period dosage adjustment was allowed once
      every two weeks if necessary.

      There is a special Group G (1.6μg/kg RD01, once every four weeks, subcutaneous injection, Day
      1 ~ 28th week), all patients are allowed to adjust dosage during the whole 28 weeks.

      This phase 2 study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and the PK/PD characteristics of
      different doses, frequencies and routes of pegerythropoietin Injection (RD01) as maintenance
      therapy in the treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure patients with hemodialysis
