  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microgreens are an emerging horticultural food crop with potential to improve human health.
      Previous research suggests they have broad consumer acceptance and that the micronutrient and
      bioactive compound levels are higher than that of their mature counterparts. To date, no
      studies have explored the feasibility of microgreen consumption, gastrointestinal tolerance
      of microgreen consumption, or their potential health impacts in humans. Therefore, the
      overall goal of this study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of daily
      microgreen consumption, gastrointestinal tolerability, and potential health impacts of red
      cabbage and red beet microgreens in healthy middle-aged/older men and postmenopausal women -
      a population inherently at risk for chronic disease, e.g. cardiovascular disease.
