  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BodyBabe studies aims to evaluate the perceptions that young mothers with anorexia
      nervosa (active or in remission) have of their own body and of the body of their child. The
      evaluations are carried out with self-assessment questionnaires and silhouette scales at
      three time points: D0 (during the stay at the maternity hospital), D15 (15 days after
      delivery) and M9 (9 months after delivery).

      The output expected from this study is to validate a questionnaire to help healthcare
      providers to adapt their care of women with anorexia nervosa during the pregnancy and the
      post-partum period.

      During the stay at maternity hospital, healthcare providers will identify potential
      candidates for the study on a daily basis according to the following criteria :

        -  BMI at the beginning of the pregnancy lower than 18,5 kg/m2 And/or

        -  History of anorexia nervosa

      Tools and methods

      The questionnaires used for the self-assessments are the following :

        -  Two questionnaires that evaluate the body satisfaction

             -  The Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ)

             -  A questionnaire assessing the satisfaction of the mother regarding her baby's body
                shape (BodyBabe questionnaire).

        -  Two silhouette scales

             -  Stunkard scale also called Figure Rating Scale (FRS)5

             -  Infant Body Figure Drawings

        -  A questionnaire evaluating the severity of the eating disorders : Eating Attitude Test
           (EAT)

        -  A questionnaire detecting depression symptoms during post-partum : Edinburgh Post-natal
           Depression Scale (EPDS)

    <description>the internal validity of the questionnaire will be assessed with a factorial analysis. The internal consistency between sub-scales will be evaluated with the Cronbach α coefficient. The Spearman coefficient will be used to evaluate the item-subscale and inter-subscale correlation. The external validity will be estimated with Spearman correlation coefficient between different subscales. The reproducibility will be assessed by &quot;test-request&quot; at an interval of 15 days. Intra-class coefficients will be calculated for each subscale</description>
