  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In particular, pentraxine 3 (PTX3) molecule was assumed to have a prognostic value in acute
      myocardial infarction.In patients affected by acute myocardial infarction, early plasma
      elevation of PTX3 appears to predict a worse outcome in these patients in the longer term.

      The inflammatory basis of preeclampsia resembles an atherogenic process.It is planned to
      investigate the role of these two molecules in endothelial dysfunction typical of
      preeclampsia.

      The level of circulating PTX3 and Lp-PLA2 in preeclamptic patients and their serum levels
      according to the severity of preeclampsia and presence of IUGR, and comparison with the
      control group without preeclampsia and It is planned to investigate the cut-off values and
      sensitivity and specificity of both molecules together and separately in preeclampsia.

    <description>preeclampsia in pregnant women; in the study group; serum Pentraxin 3 &amp; Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A levels
It will be investigated whether these parameters observed in pregnant women with preeclampsia vary. Thus, it will be tried to be shown that these new markers may have a place in predicting the risk of preeclampsia</description>

    <intervention_name>Pentraxin 3 ; new biomarker</intervention_name>
    <description>Pentraxin (PTX3) is an inflammatory molecule that belongs to a recently identified, well-known C-reactive protein (CRP) family.
PTX3 plasma levels increase in vascular disorders including myocardial infarction and correlate with small vessel vasculitis and outcome or disease activity.
These biological and clinical features of PTX3 have led us to investigate this molecule in preeclampsia, a syndrome characterized by a prominent vascular component.</description>
