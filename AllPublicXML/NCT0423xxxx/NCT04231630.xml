  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single patient observational trial to evaluate growth velocity and clinical outcomes of an
      infant status post cardiac surgery who has failed to grow well and demonstrated intolerance
      to cow milk-based and elemental formulas and fortifiers on a 100% human milk diet including a
      human milk based human milk fortifier formulated for term infants fluid restricted due to
      surgically correctable congenital conditions.

      A single patient observational study to evaluate growth velocity and clinical outcomes of an
      infant status post cardiac surgery who has failed to grow well and demonstrated intolerance
      to cow milk-based and elemental formulas and fortifiers on a 100% human milk diet. Human milk
      is defined as expressed human milk or donor milk and its derivatives, human milk-based
      fortifier and human milk caloric fortifier.

      The study hypothesis is that this infant if fed an exclusive human milk diet will have
      improved growth in part due to data greater tolerability of the diet.

      It is estimated that the study will require 90 days to complete. Growth in safety
      observations will be collected only during the time the patient is receiving the diet.

      The primary objective is to evaluate growth velocity (weight velocity [g/kg/day] of a single
      infant receiving a 100% human milk diet including a human milk based human milk fortifier
      formulated for term infants who are fluid restricted due to surgically correctable congenital
      conditions. This will be compared to the infant's growth velocity prior to the initiation of
      said diet.
