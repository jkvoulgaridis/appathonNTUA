  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a 5-day treatment with orally administered
      prednisone provides patient-relevant benefits by improving the cough-related QoL of patients
      with post-infectious cough triggered by an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) and
      seeking care in adult primary care practices. The study aims to describe an efficacy and
      safety profile for a 5-day prednisone treatment compared to a 5-day course of placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients seeing a GP for a dry or productive post-infectious cough (3 to 8 weeks)
             after Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)

          -  Patients able and willing to give informed consent by themselves and to fill in the
             LCQ on day 0 with the GP and to answer phone calls from the research staff/study nurse
             at day 7, 14, and 28, and at 3 months for outcome assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known or suspected diagnoses associated with cough, such as: pneumonia
             or suggestive symptoms and signs (abnormal vital signs, i.e. heart rate &gt;100/min,
             respiratory rate &gt;25/min, fever), allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchial asthma,
             chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), or gastroesophageal reflux disease,

          -  Patients with other chronic disease such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, cancer,
             tuberculosis, heart failure.

          -  Use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids within the last four weeks

          -  Immunodeficiency/immunocompromised state (e.g. cancer chemotherapy, HIV infection,
             administration of immune-suppressive agents)

          -  Pregnancy/ breastfeeding

          -  Regular treatment known to be associated with cough (e.g. angiotensin converting
             enzyme inhibitors)

          -  Patients with pharmacotherapy for glaucoma or osteoporosis

          -  Experienced fractures due to osteoporosis

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes (as deemed by GPs who appraise whether the
             potential side effects of short-time corticosteroids on glucose levels exceed the
             hypothesised benefit on cough)
