      Prospective, sham controlled, interventional study to evaluate the extent to which PulseHaler
      improves the functional status of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) II-IV Chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.

      PulseHaler™ is a pulsating positive expiratory pressure ventilation device for treatment of
      COPD . PulseHaler™ is pre-programmed to deliver airflow at pre-defined frequencies and for
      pre-defined lengths of time.

      The study is intended to evaluate the extent to which PulseHaler improves the functional
      status of GOLD II-IV COPD patients after 4 weeks of treatment 3x / day.

      And To evaluate the extent to which improvements are maintained over a subsequent 2 weeks
      when treatments are tapered to 1x daily.
