      This study aims to explore the clinical and immunological efficacy of low-dose Interleukin-2
      (IL-2) and cyclosporin a (CSA) on idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a radomized control study. Adults with active IIM will be
      enrolled. IIM is defined as Dermatomyositis (DM) or Polymyositis (PM), meeting the Bohan &amp;
      Peter (1975) diagnostic criteria for definite or probable DM or PM. Patients will be randomly
      divided into 2 groups arranged by registration order. One million units of Recombinant Human
      Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was administered subcutaneously every other day for 3 months. All
      patients were followed up for 3 months after withdraw of IL-2.

    <description>The primary outcome will be to compare the proportion of subjects meeting the definition of improvement (DOI) at visits 2 through 7 during the 6-month treatment period between the treatment and placebo arms.

    <description>The CDASI is a clinician-scored single page instrument that separately measures activity and damage in the skin of DM patients for use in clinical practice or clinical/therapeutic studies. Disease involvement in 15 different anatomical locations is rated using three activity (erythema, scale, erosion/ulceration) and two damage (poikiloderma, calcinosis) measures. The presence and severity of Gottron's papules, periungual changes and alopecia are also captured. Disease activity is scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater disease severity.</description>
