    <textblock>
      The convenience sample to be included in the present study will consist of all individuals
      who had implants installed at the Dentistry Clinic of the University Santo Amaro, between the
      years 2004 and 2010. The following criteria will be evaluated: age; sex; presence of systemic
      disease; area in which the implant was installed; implant diameter and height; type of
      prosthesis installed; presence of bone resorption and annual maintenance.

      The control of biofilm around implants is fundamental to the success of implant therapy, and
      it is the duty of the dentist to inform, guide and maintain patients in order to avoid
      pathological processes that may lead to the loss of the implanted component. The objective of
      the present study will be to evaluate by clinical and radiographic parameters the condition
      of oral implants placed for more than five years. The convenience sample to be included in
      this study will be composed of all individuals who had implants installed at the Dental
      Clinic of the University Santo Amaro, between 2004 and 2010. The following criteria will be
      evaluated: age; sex; presence of systemic disease; area in which the implant was installed;
      implant diameter and height; type of prosthesis installed; presence of bone resorption and
      annual maintenance. The success and survival rate of implants through the following
      parameters: pain; mobility; card index (IP); bleeding rate (IS); probing depth (PS); probing
      bleeding (SS) that will be measured on four faces by implant: mesial, buccal, distal and
      lingual / palatine. For the evaluation of bone loss, a conventional periapical radiograph
      will be performed at the moment of patient recall. Radiographs will be scanned and analyzed
      using Image Tool software to verify and determine the resulting linear distance between the
      implant shoulder and the bone crest. Factors such as smoking, annual maintenance appointments
      will be related to the presence of peri-implantitis.

    <description>The individuals will be submitted to a complete periodontal examination, with measurements obtained at four points per tooth and dental implant (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual / palatal), in all teeth / implants present, except for the third molars, the parameters evaluated will be: Probing Depth, Clinical Insertion Level, Plaque Index, Teeth Bleeding Index. The implants will be evaluated according to the parameters: presence of suppuration, probing depth, bleeding to probing and presence of biofilm around the implants. To perform the clinical examinations, the following instruments will be required: Willians millimeter probe, exploratory probe and clinical mirror.
In all participants, complete periapical radiographic examinations with 14 radiographs will be performed to verify the bone cortical height level and to assist in the periodontal diagnosis.</description>
