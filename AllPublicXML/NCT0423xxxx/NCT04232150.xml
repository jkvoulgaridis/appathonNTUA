    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is one of the commonest choices of anesthesia for infraumbilical
      surgeries.The use of sedation has markedly increased patients' comfort and acceptance towards
      spinal anesthesia. The aim of this study is to investigate visual, recall, auditory recall,
      and sedation scores among patients receiving Midazolam for sedation during spinal anesthesia
      in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries.

      Spinal anesthesia is one of the commonest choices of anesthesia for infraumbilical
      surgeries.The use of sedation has markedly increased patients' comfort and acceptance towards
      spinal anesthesia. The main goals of sedation for surgeries under spinal anesthesia are
      patient comfort, preservation of protective airway reflexes, and the help in the maintenance
      of hemodynamic stability during the surgical procedure. The aim of this study is to
      investigate visual, recall, auditory recall, and sedation scores among patients receiving
      Midazolam for sedation during spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries.
