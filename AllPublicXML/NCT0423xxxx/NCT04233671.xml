      The proposed research effort will:

      The purpose of this study is as follows:

        1. Test the feasibility and acceptability of a twelve- week mindfulness based relapse
           prevention protocol in combination with peer mentoring in individuals with opioid use
           disorder who are on medication assisted treatment.

        2. Determine whether participation in a combination of mindfulness based relapse prevention
           and peer mentoring in comparison with an attentional control group: a) improves
           adherence to MAT b) decreases relapse and cravings c) improves psychosocial outcomes
           such as depression, anxiety, stress and social support

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although medication assisted therapy (MAT) for opioid use disorders (OUD) is safe and
      effective and is currently considered the gold standard for treating OUD, adherence to MAT
      regimens remains a challenge. The goal of the proposed study is to determine the
      effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention that also utilizes peer mentors in addition
      to professional substance abuse therapists (the Minds and Mentors program [MiMP]) in
      improving adherence to MAT for OUD and reducing relapse rates in a sample of individuals with
      OUD who are also on MAT versus a twelve-step facilitation (TSF) program. The MiMP is a
      twelve-week intervention that uses group therapy and meets once a week for about two hours
      for eight weeks with a professional substance abuse therapist; after the completion of eight
      therapist led sessions, participants will attend four weeks of group therapy sessions
      conducted by a peer mentor. The peer mentor will also attend the initial eight sessions with
      the therapist to establish rapport with participants. The control group will attend twelve
      weeks of a standard twelve-step facilitation program. This study will utilize an individually
      randomized group treatment design with ten participants in both the intervention and control
      groups. Data collection will occur at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12- month
      follow-up.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable is adherence to MAT, quantified as the number of days MAT was received as indicated during the last 4 weeks of the intervention period. We expect that this can be treated as a continuous variable in regression models. However, prior to modeling we will examine its distribution, to determine if this is appropriate. If, for example, we observe large ceiling effects (many participants report very high or perfect adherence) then we may model nonadherence as the number of days when MAT was not received. In this case we expect it would have something similar to a Poisson distribution, possibly with over-dispersion which would suggest the use of negative binomial regression.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with the intervention program</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the intervention program will be assessed with the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The total score will be computed by adding the 8 items and then multiplying by 3.125 to obtain a distribution from 25 to 100. We will consider the MiMP program to be acceptable if 50% of participants score the program at ≥ 50.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse rate as determined by Urine Drug Screen</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse will be measured during the last 4 weeks of the intervention period as determined by Urine Drug Screen (UDS). UDS is a test conducted weekly using a urine dipstick for substance use/misuse and the urine cup has a multi-drug 12 panel test directly on the cup's surface, which allows detection of several substances including opiates, and uses concentrations levels established by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA). This first dichotomous outcome will require logistic regression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse rate as measured via self-report</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse will be measured via self-report utilizing the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) In the TLFB, a clinician-administers a structured interview that uses calendar-based anchors to assess for weekly drug use. The total number of self-reported days of use during the last four weeks of the intervention period will determine relapse. At baseline, a Timeline Followback (TLFB) for the 30 days before admission will be obtained (with opioid use separated from other drug use) and a urine drug screen collected. For follow-up assessments, the TLFB for the previous 60 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 Months will be obtained.
This approach will depend on the observed distribution and may be treated as either negative binomial or continuous.</description>

    <measure>Opioid Cravings as measured by the Opioid Craving Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cravings as measured by the Opioid Craving Scale (OCS), a modification of the Cocaine Craving Scale will be utilized to assess opioid craving. The OCS consists of three items rated on a visual analogue scale from 0-10: (1) How much do you currently crave opiates? (rated from not at all to extremely), (2) In the past week, please rate how strong your desire to use opiates has been when something in the environment has reminded you of opiates (rated from no desire to extremely strong), and (3) Please imagine yourself in the environment in which you previously used opiates. If you were in this environment today and if it were the time of day that you typically used opiates, what is the likelihood that you would use opiates today? (rated from not at all to I'm sure I would use opiates). The total score is calculated by averaging the three items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Support as measured by the Community Assessment Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social Support as measured by the Community Assessment Inventory (CAI) to assess perceived support. The original CAI contains 37 items covering support within four areas i.e., family living with and outside, friends, and communities, with items in each area summed to create the corresponding subscales. Lower scores indicating less support and higher scores indicating greater support. For the current study we will only evaluate community support (contains 13 items).</description>

    <measure>Depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a 9-item self-report that measures depressive symptoms. The participant's score may range from 1- 27. The interpretation of the total score is as follows: 1-4, Minimal depression; 5-9, mild depression; 10-14, Moderate depression; 15-19, Moderately severe depression; 20-27, Severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item self-report of perceived stress. Scores may range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14 to 26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), a 7-item self-report of anxiety. The score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores of 5-9 represent mild anxiety, 10- 14 represent Moderate anxiety, and scores greater than 15 represent severe anxiety.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline and Follow-up Cortisol and cortisol reactivity to drug cues as measured by non-invasive salivary cortisol levels</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Non-invasive salivary cortisol levels will be assessed as a measure of stress reactivity to cues at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up time points. Three samples will be acquired at each assessment session to represent resting baseline cortisol levels, stress induced cortisol levels to drug-related cues, and return to rest levels. To minimize diurnal cycle effects, assessment will take place in the afternoon when cortisol is lower, and reactivity can be detected. After 20 minutes at rest, five mL of saliva will be collected via the passive drool. Next, participants will watch a 20-minute video depicting drug cues. A second sample will then be collected to assess cortisol reactivity to drug cues. Participants will be asked to rate the extent of high, craving, and withdrawal feelings using a 10-point scale. A third sample will be collected 20 minutes later, reflecting a return to baseline.</description>

    <description>Importantly, the treatment will utilize a group format. Group process can serve as a vital agent in breaking down client denial about drug abuse problems. Groups have also been shown to be suitable for treating problems commonly associated with substance abuse, including depression, isolation, and shame.
Additionally, groups intrinsically have many rewarding benefits, including reducing isolation and enabling members to witness the recovery of others. The eight-week group therapy intervention is co-led by a licensed counselor and a peer mentor for eight weeks, then followed by group sessions led by peer mentors for an additional four weeks.</description>
