  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence on the primary pharmacokinetic
      (PK) parameters of tadalafil administered as an fixed dose combination (FDC) (test) of
      macitentan/tadalafil (10 milligram [mg]/40 mg) and coadministered as a free combination
      (reference) of 10 mg macitentan (Opsumit) and 40 mg Canada-sourced tadalafil (Adcirca) in
      fasted conditions in healthy adult participants (Group 1) and to evaluate the effect of food
      on the primary PK parameters of macitentan and tadalafil administered as an FDC of
      macitentan/tadalafil (10 mg/40 mg) in healthy adult participants (Group 2).
