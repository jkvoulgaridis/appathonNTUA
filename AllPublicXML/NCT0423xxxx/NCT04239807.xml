  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate Long-term effects of whole Body Vibration (wbv) in patients with HFpEF
      patients will get a training device to use at home for 3 months. Patients in the Intervention
      group will be introduced in the training program on the wbv-device in the study center 3-4
      times and baseline parameters will be collected before start of the home based training.
      Patients randomized into the placebo arm be introduced into the training program according to
      the interventional arm but not performing the exercises on the wbv-device but on the floor.
