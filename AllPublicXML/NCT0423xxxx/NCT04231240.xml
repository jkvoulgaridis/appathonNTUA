  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery needs the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. During this time, it is necessary to
      prevent thrombosis with high level of heparin and to control the good efficiency with a point
      of care test. Investigators want to test if two different devices, Hemochron and Istat, are
      giving similar results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) for cardiac surgery requires massive
      anticoagulation of the circuit by heparinization at 300 IU / kg of unfractionated heparin
      (HNF). To ensure an adequate level of safety, it is necessary to monitor the effectiveness of
      this dose of NHF. Several point of care monitors measuring activated coagulation time (ACT)
      are available on the market. Among these are the Hemochron (currently used routinely in the
      institution) and the IStat. These two monitors have been compared in adult cardiac surgery
      without deep hypothermia, but there is no comparative study in pediatric cardiac surgery.

      The result of the ACT being dependent, in addition to heparinization, the platelet count, the
      fibrinogen level and the body temperature, it is therefore necessary to test the approval and
      the interchangeability between the monitors in different clinical situations .

      The objective of this study is to reproduce the results published in adults and to compare
      these two monitors in pediatrics.
