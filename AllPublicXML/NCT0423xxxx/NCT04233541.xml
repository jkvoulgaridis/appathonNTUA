  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that the use of anticholinergic medications may precipitate falls differently
      by frailty status in older adults. Community-dwelling older subjects admitted to the
      Geriatrics Outpatient Clinic prospectively enter into the study. Frailty status is defined
      according to the Physical Frailty Phenotype. The drugs are categorized according to the ACB
      scale

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have found that the use of drugs with anticholinergic properties relate to
      increased prevalence of falls in older women and men. Frailty is associated with serious
      health outcomes including falls, hip fractures, and death. Frailty can be a relevant target
      to investigate its association with the risk of falls among the users of drugs with
      anticholinergic properties. A recent evidence suggests that the interaction between being
      frail and adverse outcomes in older adults receiving polypharmacy or centrally acting drugs
      is complex and not straightforward across all frailty phenotypes.

      We classify the participants frail if they met at least three of five criteria, while those
      having one or two criteria were pre-frail, and others were non-frail. We determine the
      anticholinergic burden by using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) Scale developed by
      Boustani et al.
