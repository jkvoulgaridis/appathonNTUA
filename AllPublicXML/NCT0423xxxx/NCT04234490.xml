    <textblock>
      Patients with type 3 intestinal failure are completely reliant on artificial feeding and
      often manage this at home; home parenteral nutrition (HPN). HPN therapy is life saving for
      these patients.

      The Parenteral Nutrition Impact Questionnaire (PNIQ) is a proven tool for measuring quality
      of life when receiving HPN.

      This study will recruit HPN patients across the United Kingdom (UK) and ask them to complete
      the PNIQ survey at several different time points. This will assess the impact of HPN over
      time. Family members involved in the participants HPN care will also be asked to complete a
      carer burden survey (at one time point) to assess the impact of HPN on carers.

      Providing a person with food through a vein is known as parenteral nutrition (PN) or
      artificial tube feeding. This process is used when nutrients from food can't be taken in by
      the intestine (intestinal failure). Patients with type 3 intestinal failure are completely
      reliant on artificial feeding and often manage this at home; home parenteral nutrition (HPN).
      HPN therapy is life saving for these patients.

      It is important to assess patients quality of life and their own reported effects of the HPN.
      The Parenteral Nutrition Impact Questionnaire (PNIQ) is a proven tool for measuring quality
      of life when receiving HPN.

      A recent study involving the use of the PNIQ in multiple hospitals in the UK, showed that
      those on fewer nights of HPN had better quality of life than those on more nights of HPN.
      Whilst this was useful for looking at quality of life at one time point, it is now important
      to assess change in quality life over time and any impact on family members quality of life.

      This study will recruit HPN patients across the UK and ask them to complete the PNIQ survey
      at several different time points. This will assess the impact of HPN over time. Family
      members involved in the participants HPN care will also be asked to complete a carer burden
      survey (at one time point) to assess the impact of HPN on carers.

      The study is being funded by Shire Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

        Approximately 1400 eligible participants from at least 15 NHS sites who are receiving HPN
        will be invited to participate. Close family relatives or friends who are carers for the
        eligible participants will also be invited to participate.
