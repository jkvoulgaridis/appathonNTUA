  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      intravenous infusions of E2814 in healthy adult participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 4 cohorts: in each cohort 8 participants (4 Caucasian and 4
      Japanese) will be randomized 3:1 to receive either E2814 or E2814-matched placebo. The
      randomization will be done in a manner that 1 Caucasian and 1 Japanese participant will be
      randomized to receive E2814-matched placebo within each cohort.

             of Japan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant illness that requires medical treatment within 8 weeks or a
             clinically significant infection that requires medical treatment within 4 weeks of
             dosing

          2. Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline.

          3. Females of childbearing potential who did not use a highly effective method of
             contraception within 28 days before study entry, and do not agree to continue to use
             contraception throughout the entire study period and for at least 28 days after study
             drug discontinuation

          4. Males that have female partners that are of childbearing potential that refuse to use
             a highly effective method of contraception during the study, except for those who have
             had a successful vasectomy.

          5. Evidence of disease that may influence the outcome of the study within 4 weeks before
             dosing; example, psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract,

             neurological system, or cardiovascular system, or participants who have a congenital
             abnormality in metabolism

          6. Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history, physical
             examinations, vital signs, ECG finding, or laboratory test results that requires
             medical treatment at Screening or Baseline

          7. A prolonged QT (that is, corrected QT interval [QTc] Fridericia interval greater than
             [&gt;] 450 milliseconds) demonstrated on ECG at Screening or Baseline. A history of risk

             for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, or
             significant autoimmune disease or disorder. Participants with hypersensitivity
             reactions to foreign protein with clinical features limited to nasal or conjunctival
             symptoms such as in allergic rhinitis do not need to be excluded.

         19. Engagement in strenuous exercise within 2 weeks before check-in (example, marathon
             runners, weight lifters, etc.)

         20. Any contraindication to continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling via indwelling
             lumbar catheter or via lumbar puncture (LP)

             adequate control, including a platelet count less than (&lt;) 50,000, international
             normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.3, or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; upper limit of
             normal (ULN) at Screening or Baseline. Participants receiving anticoagulation therapy
             or identified at risk for hemorrhage

         22. Any lifetime suicidal behavior or psychiatric disease. Whenever possible, medical
             records should be reviewed to confirm absence of history of psychiatric disease or use
