    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 weeks relative to randomisation until progression，up to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was a lung-cancer-specific module comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and site-specific pain); treatment related side-effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia); and pain medication. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items. Higher scores on the global health status/QoL and functioning scales indicated better health status/QoL and function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden. The analysis was performed using a Mixed-effects model for repeated measures analysis on the change from baseline in PRO symptom score at each visit, including participants, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as explanatory variables, the baseline PRO score as a covariate along with the baseline PRO score by visit interaction, using an unstructured covariance structure.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 cancer-specific questionnaire consisted of 30 questions, combined to produce 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, 6 individual items, and a global measure of health status/QoL. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, the functional scales, and the global health status/QoL scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30. Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicated better health status/function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden.
