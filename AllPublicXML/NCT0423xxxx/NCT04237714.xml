  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-Based Interventions are increasingly relevant as an alternative for reducing the gap
      in treatment of metal disorders such as depression, especially in resource-limited regions.

      In this study the investigators will try to evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-Based
      Intervention culturally adapted to the Ecuadorian population for treatment of depression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our participants will be randomized to one of the following three conditions: 1)
      Internet-Based intervention (IBI) with automated support (e.g. e-mails or text messages), 2)
      IBI plus human support by phone calls (automated + human support), 3) Waiting list control
      group .

      The corresponding evaluations of the outcomes will be carried out at different moments of the
      process: baseline, three, six and twelve months.

      This study will use the Smile is Fun program for the treatment of depression previously
      adapted to the Ecuadorian context.
