  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoids are polyphenolic compound mainly found in fruits and vegetables with numerous
      beneficial health effects as protection against cardiovascular diseases by an
      antihypertensive effect. The intestinal microbiota plays a key role in the metabolization of
      these compounds, so that differences in the composition and activity of the microbiota
      between individuals can generate different metabotypes. Flavonoids are found mainly in their
      conjugated form linked to the monosaccharide rhamnose and need to be metabolized by the
      intestinal bacteria, releasing the rhamnose, to be absorbed and, thus, bioactive. The
      bacterial enzyme responsible of rhamnose hydrolysis is α-L-rhamnosidase, whose activity can
      vary considerably depending on the composition of the microbiota. In fact, a great
      interindividual variability has been observed in the ability to absorb flavonoids, which
      allows to classify individuals according to the corresponding metabotype. In a previous
      project, the investigators confirmed the interindividual differences in the bioavailability
      of hesperidin and narirutin, two flavonoids naturally present in orange juice. However, the
      role of the intestinal microbiota in the metabolism of hesperidin and narirutin needs to be
      elucidated.

      On this basis, the following hypothesis is presented: individuals with arterial hypertension
      can be classified into 3 different metabotypes that are the result of the ability to absorb
      hesperidin and narirutin, determined by the urinary excretion of their respective
      metabolites, and these metabotypes are associated with different microbiota enterotypes and
      with different fecal α-L-rhamnosidase activity.

From the profile of metabolites detected in urine, the percentage of absorption of hesperidin and narirutin with respect to the amount ingested will be quantified to determine the metabotypes, based on the urinary excretion corresponding to each volunteer:</description>
