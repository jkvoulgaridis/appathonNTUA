  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent fluid surrounding the lungs is associated with poor quality of life, the main
      symptom being dyspnea. These patients are in need of recurrent removal of the fluid using
      drainage. The mechanism causing dyspnea is not fully understood.

      By using ultrasound to evaluate the movement of the diaphragm before and after removal of
      fluid and the patients symptoms before removal of fluid and until next removal the research
      group aims to clarify the temporal development in symptoms and the role of the diaphragm.

      The researchers will also evaluate the ability of the pulmonologist and patient to predict
      when the patient will need the next removal of fluid in patients with recurrent unilateral
      pleural effusion.

      Recurrent pleural effusion (PE) is associated with impaired quality of life, the main symptom
      being dyspnea. The mechanisms causing dyspnea in PE is not fully understood. These patients
      are in need of recurrent therapeutic thoracentesis.

      By evaluating the movement of diaphragma before and after thoracentesis and measure the
      patients symptoms before thoracentesis and until the next thoracentesis the researchers aim
      to clarify the temporal development in symptoms and the role of the diaphragm.

      The researchers will also evaluate the ability of the pulmonologist and patient to predict
      when the patient will need the next therapeutic thoracentesis in patients with recurrent
      unilateral pleural effusion.
