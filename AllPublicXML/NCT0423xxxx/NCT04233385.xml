  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 25-50% of women who undergo breast cancer surgery develop persistent chest wall pain
      and shoulder mobility limitations following surgery. The pain and mobility limitations
      adversely affect quality of life, sleep, and body image. Unfortunately, current treatments
      for pain and mobility limitations have variable efficacy. Based on a review of relevant pre-,
      intra-, and post-operative factors, investigators reasoned that myofascial massage may
      address contributors to pain and mobility limitations following breast cancer surgery.
      Investigators propose a randomized controlled trial looking at myofascial massage compared to
      a light touch group to look at the effects on pain and immobility following breast cancer
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial massage is a deep tissue massage that focuses on muscles as well as the connective
      tissue that surrounds muscles, bones, and ligaments. The study team subsequently conducted a
      pilot randomized controlled trial involving 21 women with persistent pain and mobility
      limitations many months after surgery. They found that women who received myofascial massage
      to the affected breast/chest/shoulder had marked reductions in pain and mobility limitations
      and significant improvements in quality of life compared to a control group who received
      relaxation massage. They also established a practice-based research network of over 50
      northeast Ohio massage therapists to guide future work.

      The study team now proposes a full scale randomized controlled trial involving 202 women with
      persistent pain and mobility limitations at 2 participating sites. To help differentiate
      between the specific effects of myofascial massage and non-specific effects due to prolonged
      touch and attention from a massage therapist, the study will include an active control group
      that will receive light touch. Participants in each group will receive 30 minutes of
      treatment twice weekly for 2 months. Primary analyses will determine the impact of myofascial
      massage on pain and mobility limitations. Secondary analyses will examine the impact of
      myofascial massage on a number of secondary outcomes, including range of motion, quality of
      life, sleep, and body image.

      Innovative features of the proposed project include a rigorous randomized controlled trial
      design, inclusion of an active control group, direct targeting of the affected
      breast/chest/shoulder, assessment of multiple mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes, and
      involvement of a massage practice-based research network. Investigators anticipate that the
      project will lead to a new and effective approach for addressing a major source of morbidity
      for women with breast cancer. Furthermore, the project may serve as a model for future trials
      of manual therapy among individuals with chronic medical conditions.

    <description>The myofascial protocol outlines techniques, areas of the body, as well as time to be spent for each technique for a total of 25 minutes. The remaining 5 minutes of the massage are for the massage therapist to tailor myofascial massage to the needs and circumstances of each participant. In order to provide some level of customization, the therapist will determine the impact of massage on the participant's pre-existing pain and/or mobility limitations. Second, the therapist will assess the soft tissues around the affected breast, chest, and shoulder to determine the locations of pain, tissue firmness, and restricted mobility. Third, the therapist will use effleurage and petrissage techniques to gently massage the identified locations to soften and release the tissues. Techniques used will include deep friction of muscles, sustained compression, and fascial stretch.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will receive 30 minutes of light touch to their affected breast, chest, and shoulder areas twice a week for 2 months. Therapists will follow a detailed light touch protocol for each of the 16 sessions. In addition, the therapist will inquire about the participant's response to the previous light touch treatment. Second, the therapist will assess the soft tissues around the affected breast, chest, and shoulder to determine the locations of pain, tissue firmness, and restricted mobility. Third, the therapist will place both hands on the participant for 3 minutes at each identified location. Pressure will be very light and consistent, with no side-to-side movement.</description>
