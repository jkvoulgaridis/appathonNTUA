  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dietary shift from animal to plant protein sources is one of the key aspects of the
      nutritional transition towards more sustainable food system and diets. However the metabolic
      implication of this shift in protein sources are still poorly understood.

      This project aims to characterize and understand the metabolic orientations specifically
      induced by animal and vegetable dietary proteins, in order to better analyze the metabolic
      reorientations that would result from the expected increase in the share of plant proteins in
      different dietary contexts, especially those of the Western type, often associated with the
      development of metabolic deregulations (obesity and cardiometabolic risk).

      The main objectives of this project are:

        -  Characterize the metabolic adaptations induced by animal or plant protein diets and
           their repercussions in terms of physiology and health.

        -  Characterize the medium-term metabolomic signatures induced by this shift in dietary
           protein sources

        -  Validate, in a human population, biomarkers of dietary animal or plant proteins,
           previously identified in pre-clinical studies.

      This clinical trial is open, monocentric, controlled, randomized, with a cross experimental
      design.

      20 men will follow for 4 weeks a controlled diet with a protein fraction constituted mainly
      from animal or vegetal sources. After a 2-week washout period, they will follow another 4
      week of controlled diet with predominantly animal or plant protein depending on 1st
      intervention period diet.

      At the end of each intervention period, a post-prandial exploration will be conducted with
      the administration of a high-fat, high-sugar meal and subsequent blood and urine sampling.

      The order in which participants will received the two diets will be randomized.
