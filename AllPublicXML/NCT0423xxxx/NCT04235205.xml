      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral doses of 10 mg
      elobixibat in combination with 9g cholestyramine powder (cholestyramine 4g) in patients with
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

      This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, comparative study,
      when patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
