  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study want to learn how drug BAY2586116 works in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a sleep disorder marked by breathing pauses during
      sleep due to repetitive obstructions of the upper airway. BAY2586116 is a new drug under
      development for the treatment of OSA. It blocks protein channels expressed on the surface of
      the upper airways in small mechanoreceptors (a type of molecule that sense and pass stimulus
      outside a cell on to the inside of the cell through mechanical gate on the surface of the
      cell). Thus the negative pressure reflex alerting the brain of inspiration is triggered more
      easily leading to a stronger activation of throat muscles. This prevents narrowing or
      collapse of the upper airways during sleep which is one of the pathological key factors in
      OSA.

      Researchers also want to find out if participants experience any medical problems during the
      study. And they study the effects of different routes of administration (drops in nose or
      spray in nose or throat) and different doses of the test drug. Patients participating this
      study will undergo two study parts: in Part A, participants will receive both the test drug
      and placebo (a placebo looks like the test drug but does not have any medicine in it); in
      Part B, participants will receive the test drug twice via different routes of administration
      (drops in nose or spray in nose or throat). Sleeps of the participants will be monitored by
      medical equipment. Participants will be asked to visit the clinic 7 times in 12 weeks in
      total.

    <description>Part A: Participants will receive a single dose administration of BAY2586116 (A1) in treatment period 1, and a single dose administration of placebo (A2) in treatment period 2.
Part B: After successfully completing Part A, participants will proceed to Part B of the study.
Participants will receive a single dose administration of BAY2586116 (B1) in treatment period 3.
Based on the result of the interim analysis there are two possible scenarios regarding mode of application and doses of BAY2586116 to be administered in treatment period 4: 1) a single dose administration of BAY2586116 (B2) Or 2) a single dose administration of BAY2586116 (B3).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be 18 years of age or above at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

             at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Participants do not need to be on CPAP therapy at the time of the study. However, if
             they are on therapy, participants must commit to keep their treatment schedule
             constant during the study period, especially the night before each administration of
             study intervention. For participants on CPAP, this will be monitored objectively using
             the compliance chip within the CPAP devices.

          -  Female of non-child bearing potential or male.

          -  Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

               1. Female participants:

                  -- i. Participants of non-childbearing potential, i.e. post-menopausal (no menses
                  for at least 1 year) or surgically sterile (documented history of tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy).

               2. Male participants:

                    -  i. Male participants of reproductive potential must agree to utilize two
                       reliable and acceptable methods of contraception simultaneously when
                       sexually active. This applies for the time period between admission to the
                       study site until 12 weeks after the last administration of the study
                       intervention.

        Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not limited to, (i) condoms (male or
        female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii) diaphragm or cervical cap with
        spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv) hormone-based contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this

             congestion during upper airway infection).

          -  Subject with known allergies or hypersensitivities to the study drugs (active
             substances or excipients of the preparations).

          -  Any other condition which at the discretion of the investigator would make the
             participant unsuitable for participation in the study and will not allow participation
             for the full planned study period (e.g. active malignancy or other condition limiting
             life expectancy to less than 12 months).

          -  Use of any topical medication containing local anesthetics for nose and throat within
             2 days before each administration of study intervention.

          -  Heavy smoking, i.e. more than 20 cigarettes per day.

          -  Light smokers who are unable to cease smoking for the duration of the inhouse phases
