  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researchers want to gather more information about safety and
      survival in patients suffering from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which has
      spread to the bone and were treated with radium-223 in routine clinical practice in Taiwan.
      Radium-223 (Ra-223) is an alpha particle-emitting radioactive agent approved for the
      treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the safety profile of radium-223 dichloride
      in patients having castration-resistent prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases and
      who are treated in routine clinical practice in Taiwan.

      The secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of radium-223 dichloride in these
      patients.
