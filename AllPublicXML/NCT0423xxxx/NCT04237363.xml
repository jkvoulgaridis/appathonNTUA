  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We documented the impact of 1 year of underwater treadmill training and supplemental
      overground walk training in five adults with chronic motor-complete SCI (cSCI) who had not
      undergone programmed epidural spinal cord stimulation (eSCS).

    <textblock>
      Regular exposure to self-initiated treadmill walking in water, a unique sensorimotor exercise
      setting that makes stepping movements easier to perform, may capitalize on the adaptability
      of the neuromuscular system and enhance locomotor function in persons with cSCI who have not
      undergone eSCS. In our study, a combined aquatics- and land-based approach to gait training
      was employed over a 12-month period that featured underwater treadmill training and
      supplemental overground walk training.
