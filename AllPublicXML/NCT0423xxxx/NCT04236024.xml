    <textblock>
      Background: Maintaining patient safety is one of the primary tasks of a professional nurse.
      Correct identification of medicine, understanding of pharmacological mechanisms and side
      effects are the basic academic knowledge that each nurse must possess. Therefore, it is an
      important duty for nursing teachers to teach students the knowledge of drugs and use them
      correctly in clinical practice. In this way, the safety of patients can be guaranteed and the
      quality of care can be improved. Board games have been used for study in different subjects,
      and they all have visible effects. Their competitive and entertaining qualities make learning
      more interesting and allow students to learn in a pleasant atmosphere. Therefore, the purpose
      of this study is to examine the effectiveness of using board games to teach medication
      knowledge to nursing students.

      Methodology: This is a randomized controlled trial study. Convenience sampling will be
      applied in one university in Northern Taiwan.It is expected that 60-100 participants will be
      recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group and comparison group by computer.
      The experimental group will use board game to learn medication, while the comparison group
      will be taught in a traditional way. The questionnaires will be conducted before the
      intervention, after the intervention, and one month later. The time for completing
      questionnaire is about 5~15 minutes. The questionnaires include demographic information,
      medication knowledge questionnaire, and learning satisfaction questionnaire. This study will
      use SPSS 22.0 software for data analysis, including frequency, percentage, mean, standard
      deviation, t-test, chi-square, and generalized estimation equation (GEE).

      Expected results: This study will be able to understand the effects of board games in
      learning medication among nursing students.

    <description>This self-developed questionnaire which was validated by 5 experts will be used to understand students' medication knowledge level. The questionnaire includes 20 questions, 1 point for correct answers, 0 points for incorrect answers or not knowing, the total score is between 0 and 20 points, the higher the score represent the higher understanding of medical knowledge.</description>
