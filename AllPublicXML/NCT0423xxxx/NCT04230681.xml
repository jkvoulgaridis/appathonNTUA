      A RCT to compare hydromorphone versus fentanyl for pain control following tonsillectomy or
      adenotonsillectomy surgery.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial with masked assessment, comparing recovery indices for
      patients receiving intermediate acting versus short acting opioid analgesia using
      hydromorphone or fentanyl as intraoperative analgesics. An otherwise standardized anesthetic
      and analgesic regimen will be utilized, consistent with routine care at SLCH. Patients will
      be randomized 1:1 in block sizes of 5 per group. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either hydromorphone or fentanyl throughout the perioperative period by opening a sealed
      protocol envelope.

    <time_frame>up to 12 hours prior to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver of the participant is asked questions regarding the child's anxiety level prior to surgery. The questions asked: 1) I am worried about the anesthetic, 2) The anesthetic is on my mind continually, 3) I would like to know as much as possible about the anesthetic, 4) I am worried about the procedure, 5) The procedure is on my mind continually, 6) I would like to know as much as possible about the procedure
The measure of agreement with these statements should be graded on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;extremely.&quot; A score of ≥11 identify anxious patients in clinical practice.</description>

It contains 22 items in 5 categories: activity, emotional expressivity, state of arousal, vocalization, and use of parents.
