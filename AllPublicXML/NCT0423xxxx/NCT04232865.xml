      Biop system's safety and performance in increased detection of high-grade lesions of the
      cervical epithelium in women scheduled for colposcopy.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, open label, non-randomized study to train the Biop
      System's algorithm and evaluate the safety and performance of the Biop system in women
      undergoing cervical colposcopy.

    <description>Stage 1 - Training:
Up to 320 women in whom a complete procedure with the Biop System will be performed. Biopsies will be taken solely based on colposcopy examination. Enrolled participants will include at least 80 participants Histopathology identified with a high-grade lesion and at least 80 participants Histopathology identified as normal or with a low-grade lesion.
Stage 2 - Validation:
Up to 330 HIV negative women in whom a complete procedure with the Biop System will be performed.
Validation stage will also include up to 165 HIV positive participants. All participants will be enrolled in up to 3 sites in South Africa.</description>
