    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody TB31F
      administered intravenously at escalating dose levels in healthy, malaria naïve, adults. This
      study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TB31F and the functional activity of mAb
      TB31F in the standard membrane feeding assay.

      This phase 1 study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody (mAb)
      TB31F administered intravenously in healthy, malaria naïve, adults at the Radboud University
      Medical Center (Radboudumc). Four groups will receive a single dose of mAb TB31F. Group 1
      (n=5) will receive 0.1 mg/kg TB31F, Group 2 (n=5) will receive 1 mg/kg TB31F, group 3 (n=5)
      will receive 3 mg/kg TB31F, and group 4 (n=5) will receive 10 mg/kg mAb TB31F. Twenty (n=20)
      subjects will be enrolled, as well as 1 reserve subject per group. Safety follow-up will be
      done at following times: 0 hours, end of infusion (EOI), 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours after product
      administration, and on days 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 56 and 84 after product administration. All
      subjects will be followed for 84 days after mAb TB31F administration.

    <intervention_model_description>Four groups will receive a single dose of mAb TB31F administered by intravenous infusion. Group 1 (n=5) will receive 0.1 mg/kg TB31F, Group 2 (n=5) will receive 1 mg/kg TB31F, group 3 (n=5) will receive 3 mg/kg TB31F, and group 4 (n=5) will receive 10 mg/kg mAb TB31F. Twenty (n=20) subjects will be enrolled.
TB31F administration within each group will be staggered such that the first subject in each group will be administered mAb TB31F and observed for the occurrence of any adverse events. The second subject in each dose group will not receive their dose of TB31F sooner than 2 days after the first subject has received TB31F. For group 1, there will be a minimum of 48 hours between TB31F administration to each subsequent volunteer. For groups 2-4, the remaining three subjects in each dosage group will receive their TB31F dose no sooner than 2 days after the second subject has been administered TB31F, with at least a one hour interval in administration of TB31F between each subject.</intervention_model_description>
