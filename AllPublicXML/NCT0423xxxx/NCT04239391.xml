      The main purpose is to determine the safety of Triferic iron administered via dialysate and
      intravenously in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis
      (CKD-5HD). It is a global, multi- center, open-label study.

    <textblock>
      This is a global, multi- center, multi dose, open-label study assessing the safety of
      Triferic iron administered via dialysate and intravenously to pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years
      of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD).

      Total participation in the study is approximately 44 weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, baseline, open label treatment, and a follow-up visit.

      Upon completion of the respective Baseline observational periods, all patients will
      transition to the interventional period where they will receive Triferic. The Triferic will
      be administered via the liquid bicarbonate or via IV. Once patients enter the interventional
      period, IV iron will only be administered if ferritin &lt;100 µg/L and Hgb decreases by ≥0.5g/dL
      from the last value obtained in the observational Baseline period. Patients will remain in
      the interventional period for either 36 or 28 weeks (depending on randomization assignment),
      at which time a final study visit will take place.

    <description>Upon completion of the Baseline observational periods, all enrolled patients will transition to the interventional period where they will then receive Triferic. The Triferic will be administered via the liquid bicarbonate concentrate at a dialysate concentration of 2 uM or via IV at a dose of 0.1 mg Fe/kg, if the patient does not receive dialysis using liquid bicarbonate, for up to an additional 36 weeks (depending on duration of observational Baseline period). Hgb and CHr will continue to be measured bi-weekly and iron profiles will be obtained at 4 week intervals. In the Triferic phase of the study,changes in ESA dose will be allowed according to the study site existing protocol. IV iron will only be administered if ferritin meets the criteria for iron deficiency. Patients will remain in the interventional period for either 36 or 28 weeks (depending on randomization assignment), at which time a final study visit will take place</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be eligible for inclusion in the study only if all of the following criteria
        are met:

          1. Parents/legal guardians of the patient have the ability to understand the requirements
             of the study and have demonstrated a willingness to have their child comply with all
             study procedures by signing an institutional review board-approved informed consent
             form. Where applicable, assent of the patient has also been obtained for all study
             procedures prior to any study-related activities.

          2. Patient is between 6 months and &lt;18 years of age at screening.

          3. Patient has chronic kidney disease receiving in-center hemodialysis at least twice
             weekly for at least 3 months prior to screening.

          4. Patient is receiving adequate hemodialysis as assessed by the investigator and based
             on a single pool Kt/V measurement &gt;1.2.

          5. Patient has a vascular access (tunneled catheter, AV fistula or AV graft) suitable to
             support blood flows for hemodialysis treatment.

          6. Patient has a body mass of ≥11 lbs (5 kg).

          7. Patient is iron-replete as measured by a TSAT ≥ 20% and a ferritin &gt;100 µg/L at

             test during screening. It is the investigator's responsibility to determine whether
             the patient has adequate birth control for study participation.

         10. Patients who have experienced a previous adverse event with IV iron products are
             eligible to participate in this study if the agent that caused the event is not
             administered during the Baseline period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in the study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Patient is positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B by history.

          2. Patient is receiving intravenous or oral antibiotics or antifungals for any infectious
             process. (Prophylactic antibiotics administered on a regular basis are allowed.
             Patients may enter the study once the infection has cleared.)

          3. Patient has evidence of an ongoing active inflammatory process (e.g., systemic lupus
             erythematosus, acute or chronic active hepatitis, etc.) requiring treatment.

          4. Patient has been dosed in an investigational drug study within the 30 days prior to
             Baseline.

          5. Administration of iron containing phosphate binder ferric citrate (Auryxia) or
             sucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro) within 2 weeks prior to Baseline. (Patient is only
             eligible if iron based binders are stopped at least 2 weeks prior to Baseline).
