    <textblock>
      This thesis aims to evaluate the ability of preoperative plethysmographic variability index
      to predict post-induction hypotension in comparison with ultrasound measurements of inferior
      vena cava (IVC) diameter.

      Prospective cohort study that will be conducted in Orthopedic theaters of Kasr Al-Ainy
      hospital, Cairo University.

      Upon arrival to the operating room, routine monitors (ECG, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive
      blood pressure monitor) will be applied, intravenous line will be secured and routine
      premedications (ranitidine 50 mg and ondansteron 4mg) will be administrated.

      Then inferior vena cava ultrasonography will be performed. Maximum and minimum IVC diameters
      over a single respiratory cycle will be measured using built-in software. The CI will be
      calculated as: CI = (dIVCmax - dIVCmin)/dIVCmax , it will be expressed as a percentage.

      Plethysmographic variability index and a perfusion index readings will be taken (preinduction
      three readings on one-minute interval- 1-minute postinduction reading - 2-minute
      postinduction reading - preintubation reading - one-minute postintubation reading until skin
      incision).

      Induction of anaesthesia will be achieved using propofol (2 mg/Kg) and atracurium (0.5
      mg/Kg). Endotracheal tube will be inserted after 3 minutes of mask ventilation. Patients who
      will experience prolonged airway instrumentation due to a difficult intubation will be
      excluded from further data analysis because of excessive stimulation.

      Anaesthesia will be maintained by isoflurane (1-1.5%) and atracurium 10 mg increments every
      20 minutes. Ringer lactate solution will be infused at a rate of 2 mL/Kg/hour.

      Any episode of hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure &lt; 80% of the baseline reading)
      will be managed by 5mcg norepinephrine.

    <description>Ultrasound measurements will be performed using a curved transducer set to abdominal mode (1-5 MHz; Acuson x300; Siemens Healthcare, Seoul, Korea). IVC variation will be assessed using ultrasound in the long-axis (sagittal) view. IVC diameter will be measured 1 cm distal to its junction with hepatic vein either by 2-D or M modes via a subcostal approach according to the methodology described by the American Society of Echocardiography . A two-dimensional image of the IVC as it enters the right atrium will be first obtained.</description>

    <description>The PVI and PI will be recorded in the supine position by an anaesthesiologist who was not involved in the further intraoperative monitoring of the patient using Masimo SET (&quot;MightySat 9900, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA).
PVI (%) is a measure of the dynamic change in PI that occurs during one or more complete respiratory cycles, calculated as:
