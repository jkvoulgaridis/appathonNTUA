    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of genius toothbrushes on periodontal status of patients
      during fixed orthodontic treatment.Half of the patients received manual orthodontic
      toothbrushes (Oral B Ortho, Procter &amp; Gamble, USA) with V-shaped bristles and rounded ends.
      The others received genius orthodontic toothbrush (Oral B Genius 8900, Procter &amp; Gamble, USA)
      with Oral-B CrossAction brush head, Procter &amp; Gamble, USA).

      Powered (genius) toothbrush with position detection technology provides patient to clean all
      areas of the mouth during the required time. By connecting phone to the Oral-B App, the
      genius toothbrush uses facial recognition technology to guide patient's brushing, zone to
      zone. Pressure control and personalization are another characteristics of these toothbrushes.
      Pressure sensor alerts patient if the brushing is too hard and helps her/him not to put too
      much pressure by reducing the speed of brush head. Due to the Bluetooth technology,
      toothbrushing can be performed more efficiently among orthodontic adolescent patients. In
      addition, the position detection and timer can be used to control which area is brushed in
      the mouth and how much total brushing time is continued. The application allows patient to
      see all the days brushing activity and real-time feedback on brushing habits can be received
      by this way.

    <measure>Modified Silness and Löe plaque index measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The buccal surface of each tooth is divided into four zones (mesial, distal, gingival and incisal) to the bracket. Each of the four sites of the buccal tooth surface is given a score from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates the absence of plaque; 1 indicates no plaque visible, but an accumulation of soft deposit on a probe when used to clean the surface; 2 indicates a moderate accumulation of soft deposit on the tooth which can be seen with the naked eye; and 3 indicates an abundance of soft matter on the tooth. For the analysis, values are summed to obtain a total score per participant.</description>

    <measure>Bleeding on probing scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>A periodontal probe runs along the marginal gingiva at an angle of approximately 60° to the longitudinal axis of the tooth to determine whether probing elicited marginal bleeding (score 1) or not (score 0). The inflammation was recorded as bleeding scores if bleeding occurred within 30 seconds of probing. Bleeding on probing was estimated as a percentage.</description>
