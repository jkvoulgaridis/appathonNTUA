  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Besides coping with the diagnosis, people with multiple sclerosis have to make complex
      decisions such as deciding about immunotherapies. They search not only for factual
      information, but also for reports of patient experiences (PEx). The investigators aim to
      evaluate in a randomised controlled pilot trial whether a website presenting PEx as an
      adjunct to factual information may help people with multiple sclerosis in their immunotherapy
      decision-making processes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of management options (e.g. immunotherapies, lifestyle interventions, and
      rehabilitation) are available for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Besides
      coping with the diagnosis, people with multiple sclerosis have to make complex decisions such
      as deciding about immunotherapies. In addition to factual information, reports of patient
      experiences (PEx) may support patients in decision-making. The added value of PEx in
      decision-making is not clear and controlled studies are rare. Therefore, systematic methods
      are necessary in order to develop and analyse PEx. As there are no evaluated PEx for multiple
      sclerosis in Germany, the investigators are currently creating a website presenting PEx
      structured according to topics and illustrated by video, audio and text files.

      The investigators aim to evaluate whether PEx may help people with multiple sclerosis in
      their immunotherapy decision-making processes.

      This project will follow the Medical Research Council framework for development and
      evaluation of complex interventions. After the development of a website with PEx, a
      randomised controlled pilot trial will be conducted in 2-3 multiple sclerosis centres,
      clinics or rehabilitation centres including 55 people with relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis and accompanied by a process evaluation.

      Participants will be randomly assigned either to i) an intervention group with a four weeks
      access to an evidence-based patient information resource and the PExMS-website as an adjunct
      or to ii) the control group with access to evidence information alone.

      A 6-members advisory panel involving representatives of people with multiple sclerosis,
      researchers, and neurologists, who accompany the whole project will mentor this pilot RCT.
      The ethical committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians approved the study protocol.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Decision Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES) measures self-confidence in decision-making on a five-point-Likert scale. It ranges between 0 (not at all confident) and 4 (very confident). For the total score, items are summed, divided by 11 and multiplied by 25. A total score of 0 means 'extremely low self-efficacy' and a score of 100 means 'extremely high self-efficacy'.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preparation for Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess how useful a decision support intervention is in preparing patients with multiple sclerosis to communicate at a consultation visit and making a decision concerning a therapy, the 10-item Preparation for Decision Making (PrepDM) scale will be used. It has a five-point-Likert scale format and is designed to be administered after the consultation visit to discuss treatment options. Higher scores show a higher perceived level of preparation for decision-making.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Risk Knowledge in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>A short version of the 19-item Risk Knowledge in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis 2.0 (RIKNO) will be used to measure multiple sclerosis risk knowledge. Item difficulty is high ranging from 0.07 to 0.79. Higher scores mean a better risk knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Informed choice</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>Informed choice will be assessed by the Multidimensional Measure of Informed Choice (MMIC). It comprises three dichotomous dimensions: knowledge (good, poor), attitude towards or against immunotherapy or change of immunotherapy (positive, negative) and choice (uptake or non-uptake of immunotherapy under consideration) leading to eight types of choices. Two of these choices indicate informed choice: either an informed patient's values are in favor of the intervention which is subsequently applied, or an informed patient's values are against the intervention which is subsequently rejected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item yes/no response &quot;Sure of myself, Understand information, Risk-benefit ratio, Encouragement&quot; (SURE) screening test addresses decisional conflict in patients. This screening instrument was developed to help health professionals assess patients' perception of uncertainty about decision-making for a therapy. The SURE screening test has dichotomous questions, where &quot;yes&quot; equals 1 point and &quot;no&quot; equals 0 point. If the total score is less than 4, it indicates the probability that the patient experiences clinically significant decisional conflict.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Control Preferences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item Control Preferences Scale (CPS) assess patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decisions. It consists of five ''cards'' on a board, each illustrating a different role in decision-making by means of a cartoon and short descriptive statement. The examiner asks the respondent to choose the preferred card, which is then covered up and cannot be chosen again. Afterwards, the examiner asks the respondent to choose the preferred card from the remaining four cards. The procedure continues until one card is left. If the second preference is incongruent with the first, the test is immediately re-administered. Six scores are possible based on the subject's two most preferred roles: active-active, active-collaborative, collaborative-active, collaborative-passive, passive-collaborative and passive-passive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Patient Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>The 13-item Patient Activation Measure 13 (PAM13-D) measures patients' confidence in active participation and management in medical care. It is a reliable and valid measure on a four-point-Likert scale of patient activation. The PAM measures patients on a 0-100 scale and matches patients into one of four activation levels: level 1) disengaged and overwhelmed; level 2) becoming aware, but still struggling; level 3) taking action; level 4) maintaining behaviours and pushing further.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported impact of eHealth on its users</measure>
    <time_frame>eHIQ-Part-1 at baseline and the eHIQ-Part-2 up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>The eHealth Impact Questionnaire (eHIQ) measures users' attitudes towards a website which they recently viewed. It is divided into the 11-item eHIQ-Part 1, asking for general attitudes towards using the internet to access health information and the 26-item eHIQ-Part 2, which is related to the effects of using a specific health-related website on three subscales: 1) confidence and identification, 2) information and presentation and 3) understanding and motivation. Both answering formats range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Moreover, identifying with others who show their experiences on a website, knowing that other pwMS are handling similar problems and learning how they manage difficult issues can reduce the feeling of isolation and improve the sense of social support. Reformulated items from the subscale &quot;confidence and identification&quot; of the eHIQ will be used to assess social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Affective Forecasting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>No evaluated questionnaire exists for 'affective forecasting', but it is hypothesized that PEx could have an impact on patient's perceived ability to make predictions of future feelings about difficult health procedures or disabling health conditions. Therefore, a preliminary scale with 5 to 10 items will be developed through a review of relevant literature. Afterwards, we will conduct cognitive interviewing using the think-aloud methodology after showing approximately five patients clips from the PExMS website and the preliminary scale. The clips will show how other patients have coped with emotions during a certain situation as well as the intensity and duration of an emotional state, which the patients experienced. Pilot testing of the revised scale will be conducted applying again cognitive interviewing for face and content validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 14 days after usage of intervention or comparator website(s)</time_frame>
    <description>As a control parameter, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be administered. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the HADS is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person with multiple sclerosis can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. A score of 0-7 means 'Normal', 8-10 means 'Borderline abnormal' and 11-21 means 'Abnormal'.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) measures patient-reported disability of persons with multiple sclerosis. The PDDS has nine ordinal levels ranging between 0 (normal) and 8 (bedridden).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Stage of Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 'Stage of Decision Making' questionnaire asks for the patient's readiness to engage in decision-making, progress in decision-making and susceptibility to considering or re-considering options. It may be useful in screening out persons with multiple sclerosis who may not benefit from decision aids interventions.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of an information provision on immunotherapies as a combination of factual and experiential information. PExMS is a multimedia website providing patient experiences with MS in everyday life and with therapies illustrated by video, audio and text files of 48 persons with multiple sclerosis. The development of the intervention followed largely recommendation for standardised qualitative research provided by international DIPEx (Database of Individual Patients' Experience of illness) association, which use standardised qualitative research methods to provide 'balanced' information from original interview data. Data for the website was generated in a qualitative interview study with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients across Germany. DECIMS (Decision coaching in MS)-Wiki (www.wiki2.kkn-ms.de) is an evidence-based patient information website focusing multiple sclerosis immunotherapies.</description>
