  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the change of the common carotid artery blood flow according
      to patient's position and penumoperitoneum.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 20 patients undergoing gynecological surgery. The common carotid
      artery blood flow will be measured using Doppler US during the following conditions; supine
      position before induction of anesthesia, supine position immediately after induction of
      anesthesia, supine position with penumoperitoneum, head-down position with or without
      pneumoperitoneum.
