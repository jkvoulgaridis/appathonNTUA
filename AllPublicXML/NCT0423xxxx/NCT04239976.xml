  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well scrambler therapy works in reducing chemotherapy-induced
      neuropathic pain in patients with cancer. Scrambler therapy is a type of treatment that uses
      electrodes placed on the skin. Electricity is carried from the electrodes through the skin
      and blocks the pain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of MC5-A scrambler therapy (scrambler therapy [ST]) in reducing
      chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy (CIPPN).

      II. Evaluate the change in pain score before and after 2 weeks (Monday-Friday) of the final
      ST treatment.

      III. Assess for changes in other symptom burden (i.e insomnia, feeling of well-being,
      depression and anxiety) after 2 weeks (Monday-Friday) ST treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the following with the treatment of ST:

      Ia. Assess for changes in therapy induced neuropathy assessment scale (TNAS). Ib. Assess for
      changes in using pain medications. Ic. Assess for changes in daily physical
      activities/functional status. Id. Assess for changes in quality of life using European
      Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)
      (chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy) chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN) 20
      questionnaire.

      Ie. Assess overall satisfaction with the ST treatment using Global Impression of Change
      questionnaire.

      TERTIARY (EXPLORATORY) OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the change in sensation after 2 weeks (Monday-Friday) of the final ST treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo scrambler therapy over 30-45 minutes once daily (QD) Monday-Friday for 2
      weeks. Patients also undergo a quantitative sensory test and a gait assessment test using a
      FitBit before receiving scrambler therapy, at the end of the first and second weeks of
      scrambler therapy, and 1 month after the last day of scrambler therapy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up weekly for 3 weeks and at 4 weeks after
      the last day of scrambler therapy treatment.
