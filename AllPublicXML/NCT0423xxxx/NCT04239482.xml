  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease and early intervention and
      prevention strategies are therefore very important. An important early hallmark in the
      development of T2DM is insulin resistance. Since the majority of postprandial glucose
      disposal occurs in skeletal muscle, improving muscle insulin sensitivity will thus have a
      major impact on disease prevention. Abdominally obese men and women have an increased risk to
      develop T2DM, and are also characterized by an impaired vascular function. This may hamper
      proper delivery of insulin, glucose and oxygen to muscles, thereby contributing to - and
      possibly causing - muscle insulin resistance. Earlier it has been shown that supplementation
      with L- arginine improves vascular function by improving nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability.
      These NO- mediated beneficial effects on vascular function may improve delivery of insulin,
      glucose and oxygen to the muscle tissue, thereby improving muscle insulin sensitivity and
      mitochondrial function. However, the doses needed of this amino acid cannot be provided by
      regular diets or supplements, also due to the bitter taste of L-arginine. Alternatively,
      smaller amounts of L- arginine with a specific combination of other nutritional components
      (i.e. nitrate and nitrite), which are already part of the regular diet and support
      alternative pathways to improve NO- mediated vascular function, may also induce beneficial
      effects. The investigators now hypothesize that in abdominally obese adults with impaired
      fasting glucose concentrations L-arginine combined with nitrate/nitrite increases muscle
      insulin sensitivity.
