  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors in the oral region occur more frequently in men over 40, but can affect people of both
      gender and all ages, even children. The prevention of oral cancer acquires relevance in
      public health, particularly if the investigators consider that the preventive approach is
      compatible with the nature of this disease, as the mouth favors easy visual access. The
      objective of this study is evaluation the prevalence of oral and perioral injuries in workers
      who were exposed to the sun on the beaches, investigating possible associations of a
      sociodemographic, occupational and general health nature.

      Tumors in the oral region occur more frequently in men over 40, but can affect people of both
      sexes and all ages, even children. The prevention of oral cancer acquires relevance in public
      health, particularly if the investigators consider that the preventive approach is compatible
      with the nature of this disease, as the mouth favors easy visual access. The objective of
      this study is evaluation the prevalence of oral and perioral injuries in workers who were
      exposed to the sun on the beaches, investigating possible associations of a sociodemographic,
      occupational and general health nature. Firstly, information about the care, symptoms and
      forms of prevention will be explained for each worker approached, if the individual agrees to
      an oral examination, it can be performed by evaluating lips and peri-oral mucosa and within
      the needs of oral treatment, it can be referred for treatment at the clinic of the Dentistry
      Especialist Center of Santos/SP The street vendors who underwent the first assessment will be
      visited 2 more times according to the schedule, after the carnival of 2020 being the last
      assessment and thus being able to have data on the effectiveness of the information and past
      care during the visits made. As expected results, a greater awareness of the dangers of sun
      exposure, greater protection care and the ability to carry out self-examination at home being
      an information disseminator.

    <description>Workers must undergo clinical examinations of the upper and lower lips, performed by previously calibrated researchers, through semi-technical inspection and palpation maneuvers, in order to identify injuries. Photo cameras can be used to improve the visibility of the lips using the image enhancement feature, to confirm the diagnosis. The clinical examination will include: dryness, atrophy, scaly lesions, lip swelling, erythema, ulcerations, cloudy demarcations between the vermilion of the lip and skin, demarcated folds along the lip, white spots or plaques, crusts, stained or pale areas.
They should be evaluated with the application of a previously validated questionnaire containing information related to personal data, information on occupation and health was completed according to the responses of the volunteers. The OHIP-14 quality of life questionnaire will be applied together</description>

        The sample will consist of adult individuals of both sexes exposed to the sun directly and
        indirectly. The independent variables analyzed were: sex, age, income (in reais), years of
        study, type of work, frequency of weekly sun exposure, time of daily sun exposure,
        cumulative time of sun exposure and photoprotection measures at the occupational level.
        Health data will be collected on habits (alcoholism and smoking) and skin type, according
        to the Fitzpatrick classification

    <ipd_description>The collected data will be imported into the Stata 10.0 software platform. Descriptive analysis of all data related to dependent and independent variables, chi-square statistical tests and calculation of prevalence ratios and the respective confidence intervals. The multiple analysis will be performed using the robust Poisson regression by the hybrid method parameter to estimate the prevalence rates of lip lesions adjusted for sex, age, type of work, photo-protection measures, use of lip protector, use of cap / hat, skin type, any habit (smoking or drinking). The significance level of 5% will be adopted for all tests.</ipd_description>
