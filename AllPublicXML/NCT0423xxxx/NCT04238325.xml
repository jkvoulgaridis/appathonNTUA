    <textblock>
      This is an observational study aimed at validating the Frustration Discomfort Scale
      (Harrington, 2005). A back-translation process was followed to obtain a translated version of
      the scale, which was refined after a discussion with several clinicians.

      In the study, the Spanish adaptation of the Frustration Discomfort Scale will be disseminated
      with an online questionnaire using the Qualtrics platform. Additional questionnaires to
      explore the validity of the adapted scale will also be administered. Participants who
      complete the questionnaires and provide a valid ID number will enter a participate in a
      raffle to win an Amazon coupon of 40 euros. Ten coupons will be offered in total amongst
      participants.
