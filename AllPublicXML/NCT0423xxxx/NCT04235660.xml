  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single site, prospective, randomized pilot study to assess the
      feasibility of recruitment of patients into a trial evaluating the efficacy and tolerability
      of selective transarterial Y90 radioembolization (radiation segmentectomy) versus
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for solitary early stage (≤ 3cm) hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC).

    <description>This therapy arm involves two separate steps, a planning/mapping arteriogram and a therapy delivery. The planning arteriogram will be performed to confirm arterial anatomy is acceptable for RS (≤2 segment delivery) and that lung shunting is not too high to preclude treatment with RS. Once confirmed, patients will return for RS (within 45 days of mapping). Dose will be calculated based off the desired treatment volume using pre-treatment cross-sectional imaging. The desired segmental dose will be calculated to be ≥ 200Gy. RS will be performed by one of three separate interventional radiologists with experience in radioembolization. Actual administered activity and location of dose administration will be recorded.</description>

    <description>SBRT will be delivered with linear accelerator-based photon beams with either fixed angle non- coplanar fields or dynamic arcs. An internal target volume (ITV) will be generated to account for tumor movement during breathing cycle. Finally, a planning target volume (PTV) will be an expansion of 3- 5mm from the ITV. For Child Pugh A patients, prescription dose will either be 5000cGy in 5 fractions delivered every other day or 4800cGy in 3 fractions delivered twice weekly. For Child Pugh B patients, prescription dose of 4000cGy in 5 fractions delivered every other day. Inverse planning will be used. 95% of the PTV or more will receive at least 100% of the prescription dose. Normal tissue dose constraints for each dose level will be respected with acceptable deviations permitted as outlined in appendix VII. Patients will be seen at least once per week by a clinician to grade toxicities, with on- treatment labs (CBC, CMP, INR) each week.</description>
