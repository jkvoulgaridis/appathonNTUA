  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research clinical trial is studying the creation and administration of GVAX, an
      irradiated GM-CSF secreting, autologous neuroblastoma cell vaccine (GVAX) in combination with
      nivolumab and ipilimumab as a possible treatment for neuroblastoma.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  GVAX Vaccine, an immunotherapy developed from surgically removed tumor tissue

        -  Nivolumab

        -  Ipilimumab
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the GVAX vaccine as a treatment
      for any disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab or ipilimumab for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      This phase 1 study will be conducted in 2 parts

        -  In the first part, participants will, as part of standard of care procedure to remove
           cancerous tissue, undergo neuroblastoma cell collection from a portion of resected
           tumor.

        -  Those cells will then be used to create the vaccine which will be stored for potential
           use during the second part of this research study.

        -  In the second part, participants who did not respond to standard therapy will receive
           the GVAX vaccine along with nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      The study treatment will continue for up to 24 months and participants will be followed for 2
      years after last study treatment (if received at least one vaccination).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  No systemic corticosteroid therapy, other than replacement therapy for adrenal
             insufficiency or transfusion premedication. Participants who are receiving or have
             received lympholytic steroid (&gt;=40mg/m2 prednisone equivalent) therapy within 4 weeks
             of first anticipated vaccine administration are excluded, because high-dose steroid
             therapy is expected to significantly limit the ability of the immune system to respond
             to GVAX vaccination.

          -  Participants with known parenchymal brain metastases.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to GM-CSF or DMSO.

          -  Participants with any form of primary immunodeficiency.

          -  Females who are pregnant are excluded from this study because GVAX is an
             investigational biologic with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with GVAX, breastfeeding should be discontinued
             if the mother is treated with GVAX

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or serious uncontrolled medical disorder including,
             but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia and/or pronounced disturbances of the
             electrical conduction system of the heart or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Known HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the effect of GVAX vaccination on the disease course is unknown and because
             the underlying disease is expected to limit the ability of the immune system to
             respond to GVAX vaccination.

          -  Clinically relevant known active infection including active hepatitis B or C or any
             other concurrent disease which in the judgment of the Investigator would make the
             subject inappropriate for enrollment on this study

          -  History of a malignancy other than neuroblastoma with exception of the following
             circumstances:

               -  Patients with a history of malignancy who have been adequately treated and have
                  been disease-free for at least 2 years are not excluded.

               -  Patients with adequately treated active non-invasive cancers (such as
                  non-melanomatous skin cancer or in-situ bladder, cervical and breast cancers) are
                  not excluded.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti PD L2 or anti-CTLA4
             agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell
             receptor (e.g. OX 40, CD137).

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 12
             months, or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy are exceptions. Intermittent use of bronchodilators or
             local steroid injections are not excluded. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Autoimmune
             diagnoses not listed must be approved by the protocol chair.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.
