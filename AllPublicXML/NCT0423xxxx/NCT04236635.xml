         12. Has a known systemic allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of study drug.

         13. Has received any collagenase treatment at any time prior to treatment in this study.

         14. Any other condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the subject
             to be unsuitable for the study.
