  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An individual senses the world and reflects feedbacks via independent behaviors. Such precise
      collaboration of the sensory and behavioral systems is fundamental to survival and evolution.
      When a sensory modality is altered, the behavioral system has the potential to fit in a
      substitute modality. However, the specific dynamics of human behaviors in response to sensory
      loss remain largely unknown due to the paucities of representative situations and large-scale
      samples.

      Here, the investigators focused on thousands of human infants who suffered varying degrees of
      visual stimuli deficiency in early stages, while their behavioral systems remained sensitive
      and thus retained high behavioral plasticity. Having access to this unique population
      provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the effect of diverse visual conditions
      on the behavioral system and develop a domestic apparatus for screening visual impariment of
      infants.

    <description>Normal or abnormal behavioral dynamics of infants are recorded by mobile phones. Five experienced ophthalmologists identify the occurence of abnormal behaviors independently, and 2 professors with over 10 years of experience in pediatric ophthalmology department are consulted in cases of disagreement.</description>

    <description>The &quot;visual impairment&quot; group is defined as a VA out of the 95% reference range in at least 1 eye or worse with structural abnormalities.</description>

    <description>For the &quot;likely healthy&quot; group, the visual acuity of both eyes is in the 95% referenced range with no structural abnormalities.
The referenced range could be found in the following publication:
Mayer, DL., et al. Monocular acuity norms for the Teller Acuity Cards between ages one month and four years. Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science. 36(3):671 (1995)</description>

    <description>A domenstic apparatus, scenario, and procedure is applied to record all the behavioral phenotypes.
For each standardized procedure, the guardian sits in the chair, holding the infant facing the mobile phone screen. Each infant is given a few minutes to adapt to the surroundings and to be calm before recording. No hints or simulations are permitted during the entire process. The recording process lasted for about 3 minutes to ensure that behavioral phenotypes could be completely recorded.</description>
