    <textblock>
      Hypofractionation: 48 Gy in 25 fractions to pelvic lymph nodes while the prostate receives 68
      Gy in 25 fractions concomitantly.

      Standard Fractionation: pelvic lymph nodes and prostate will initially be treated to 46 Gy in
      23 fractions, followed by a subsequent boost to the prostate to a total dose of 78 Gy over 39
      fractions.

      Half the participants will receive using a one phase IMRT plan, the pelvic lymph nodes will
      be treated to a dose of 48 Gy in 25 fractions, while the prostate will be treated to a dose
      of 68 Gy in 25 fractions concomitantly (simulataneous integrated boost).

      The other half of the participants will receive Standard fractionation using 2 sequential
      IMRT plans, the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate will initially be treated to 46 Gy in 23
      fractions, followed by a subsequent boost to the prostate to a total dose of 78 Gy.
