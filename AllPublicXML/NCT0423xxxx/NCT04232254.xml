  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adopting a healthy eating pattern is important for meeting dietary recommendations and weight
      management. Although less clear, it seems reasonable to assume that the eating patterns we
      typically follow can also affect our psychological wellbeing. As such, healthy eating
      patterns are often adapted to suit one's personal preference. For example, many people choose
      to follow a vegetarian-style eating pattern whereby meat, poultry, and seafood are excluded
      from the diet. However, current research suggests that vegetarian eating patterns may result
      in decreased synthesis of new muscle proteins when compared to the typical meat-based
      US-style diet. This ultimately leads to reduced muscle quality and mass which increases the
      risk of dependence and mobility limitations later in life.

      Another important factor to consider when adapting a healthy eating pattern is the frequency
      and distribution of meals throughout the day. In the US, protein intake is typically skewed
      throughout the day such that people consume more protein at dinner when compared to
      breakfast. This skewed distribution combined with a low meal frequency (3 meals per day) can
      also sacrifice the rate of muscle protein synthesis. As such, it is important to investigate
      the interaction between food choices, meal frequency, and protein distribution to promote
      muscle health and prevent development of disease and disability. In addition, it is also
      important to understand how these eating patterns affect enjoyment and pleasure following
      meals. This work will help to determine healthy eating patterns that promote muscle health
      and psychological wellbeing.
