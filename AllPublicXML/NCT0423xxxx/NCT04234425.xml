  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the prevalence of suicide and mental health issues in rural Montana, this project is
      intended to help mitigate stressors that may contribute to poor behavioral and mental health
      in high school-aged children. The immediate goal is to determine viability of a partnership
      with a rural southwestern Montana school and test the feasibility of a piloted implementation
      of a trauma-informed yoga intervention to address behavioral health outcomes and positive
      youth development.

    <measure>Salivary Cortisol Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Students will provide a saliva sample in which cortisol levels will be analyzed through salivary assay kits (through Salimetrics.com). Samples will be collected on the first day of the intervention, halfway through the intervention, and on the last day of the intervention to determine if the intervention has improved stress levels (as indicated by a reduction in cortisol levels). A biostatistician will provide analysis and conclusion of these samples at the conclusion of the study.</description>
