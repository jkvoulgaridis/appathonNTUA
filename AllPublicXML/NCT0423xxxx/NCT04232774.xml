      The study is to assess the safety and feasibility of ethanol denervation of renal, hepatic,
      splenic, left gastric and/or celiac arteries for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and
      its comorbidities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is among the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting 435 million persons
      as of 2015 with an annual death toll of 1.5 million, and the overwhelming majority of these
      have Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hypertension is a common comorbidity of diabetes and
      present in more than 50% of diabetic patients. The risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
      four-fold higher in patients with both DM and hypertension as compared to the normotensive
      non-diabetic controls. Obesity, with a prevalence of over 500 million, is another common
      comorbidity of diabetes. These are chronic diseases associated with increased risks of
      cardiovascular disease, stroke, and decreased quality of life.

      Neurotronic developed a novel balloon catheter with needles for denervation procedure.
      Ethanol is delivered locally through the needles into the adventitial space and ablates the
      sympathetic nerve and nerve endings in the adventitial space of renal, hepatic, splenic, left
      gastric and/or celiac arteries.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of ethanol denervation of
      renal, hepatic, splenic, left gastric and/or celiac arteries for the treatment of Type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) and its comorbidities.
