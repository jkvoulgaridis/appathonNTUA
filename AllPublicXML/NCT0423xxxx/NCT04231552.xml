  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, single-arm study to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      consolidative chemotherapy with camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug following short
      course radiotherapy and subsequent surgical therapy in patients with locally advanced
      resectable rectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-4a with or N+) are assigned to receive
      preoperative 5 × 5 Gy irradiation over 5 days with consolidation chemotherapy consisting two
      cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy and camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug for two cycles.
      Subsequent surgical therapy is performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy.
