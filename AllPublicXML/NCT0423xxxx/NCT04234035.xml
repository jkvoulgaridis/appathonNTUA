  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a CT scan is required for some Emergency Department patients with signs and symptoms
      of a kidney stone, recent evidence has shown that routine scanning is unnecessary and may
      expose young patients to significant cumulative radiation, increasing their risk of future
      cancers. Shared Decision-Making may facilitate diagnostic imaging decisions that are more
      inline with patients' values and preferences. By comparing a shared approach to diagnostic
      decision-making to a traditional, physician-directed approach, this study lays the foundation
      for a future randomized trial that will reduce radiation exposure, improve engagement, and
      improve the quality and patient-centeredness of Emergency Department care.

    <measure>Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is this study feasible? We will collect number of patients screened, number approached, number consented, number randomized and whether follow-up was completed (was patient contacted). An enrollment of at least three patients per month will indicate feasibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Does the DA do what we think it is doing? Fidelity will be examined after 50 patients are enrolled: conversations between patients and clinicians will be scored for whether shared decision-making occurred. If SDM is NOT occurring in the intervention group (&gt;75% of interactions) or IS occurring in the usual care group (&gt;50% of interactions), fidelity will not be considered met.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured at the end of the index visit. (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that the intervention group will have increased knowledge regarding radiation exposure and diagnostic options. This will be tested with a 10 question Knowledge Test developed by stakeholders for this study and delivered at the end of the index visit. The scores for this test range from 0-10 with 10 indicating higher knowledge (more correct answers)</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 60 (Day 60 evaluation will include all days from 0-60)</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that SDM will lead to a change in exposure to radiation. We will record radiation exposure for each CT done between day 0 and day 60, as indicated by DLP on CT reports.</description>

    <description>&quot;As involved&quot; question: &quot;Were you as involved in today's decisions as you would have liked to be?&quot; With three response options: Yes, No, and &quot;There were no decisions for me to be involved in&quot; Greater proportion of patients choosing &quot;yes&quot; indicates more SDM.</description>

    <description>Clinician's perceptions of the conversation/intervention. We will ask about whether the clinician found the decision aid helpful, whether they would recommend it to another clinician, and whether they would use it again (likert scale 1-7 for each, with higher number indicating more acceptance/helpfulness)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative evaluation</measure>

    <description>The intervention is a decision aid, which both encourages and facilitates a shared decision-making conversation between the clinician and the patient. The decision aid educates patients regarding evidence-based approaches to the management of suspected kidney stones in the ED. Clinicians will receive training specific to this decision aid, though the decision aid is designed to be used with no additional training.</description>

    <description>The control arm will receive Usual Care and a standardized educational intervention (pamphlet). This intervention (pamphlet) contains information about kidney stones. Usual care for this clinical scenario generally involves the clinician choosing the management plan. Clinicians of subjects assigned to the usual care group will be asked to practice usual, evidence-based medical care, without shared decision-making.</description>
