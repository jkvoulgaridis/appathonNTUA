  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were referred to cutaneous surgery and needed full thickness or split skin
      grafting and using antitrombotic or non-antitrombotic therapies were observed. Data on
      patient characteristics, diagnosis, location of surgery and surgery performed, antithrombotic
      medication and complications in skin grafts were collected. Skin grafts were traced on a
      transparent film and areas of unhealed skin graft were marked

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of anticoagulants is common and practice regarding continuation or discontinuation of the
      medication peri-operatively for cutaneous surgery lacks evidence-based consensus. Therefore,
      patients who were referred to cutaneous surgery and needed full thickness or split skin
      grafting and using antitrombotic or non-antitrombotic therapies were observed. Data on
      patient characteristics, diagnosis, location of surgery and surgery performed, antithrombotic
      medication and complications in skin grafts were collected. Skin grafts were traced on a
      transparent film and areas of unhealed skin graft were marked

        A total of 172 patients (92 males and 80 females) having 187 skin grafts were included.
        Avarage size of the skin grafts were 1278 mm2 ranging from 52mm2 to 14283mm2. Skin grafts
        where the patients received no or paused antithrombotic treatment were 90 while 97 skin
        grafts belonged to patients in antithrombotic treatment
