    <intervention_model_description>Twenty subjects with self-reporting sleep disturbance will use the Chilipad cooling mattress for 5 weeks. The subjects will be given a Diary to complete tracking sleep quality during the 5 weeks. Subjects will also be given questionnaires before and after the sleep study part of the study to measure changes</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>PROMIS Sleep Related Impairment Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>5-week prior intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS sleep related impairment short form is a questionnaire with 8-item 5-point Likert rating scale survey reflecting DSM-5 for sleep disturbance. The raw score on 8 items is determined, summed for a raw score, then a T-score table is utilized to compare with the subject's individual score. The result, rounded to the nearest whole number determines the score. The survey T-scores are interpreted as: &lt; 55 = none to slight; 55.0 - 59.9 = mild; 60.0 - 69.9 = moderate; and &gt; 70 = severe</description>

    <measure>OURA ring total sleep metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The total sleep metric will show hours of sleep each night.</description>

    <measure>OURA ring REM metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The total REM metric will show the total amount of REM sleep each night.</description>

    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The DEEP sleep metric will show the number of hours of deep sleep each night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OURA ring Efficiency metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. Efficiency means the percentage of time spent sleeping while in bed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OURA ring latency metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. Latency is the amount of time it takes a study participant to fall to sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OURA ring timing metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The timing records individual circadian rhythms.</description>

    <measure>OURA ring sleep score metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The sleep score metric will be determined by total sleep, efficiency, disturbances, REM sleep, deep sleep, sleep latency, sleep timing and light sleep.The sleep score ranges from 0-100. Higher scores denotes better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OURA ring resting heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The resting heart rate will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>OURA ring respiration rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The respiration rate will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OURA ring readiness score</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly for 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OURA is a ring that is worn on a finger and collects information about the quality and duration of sleep. The readiness score is calculated taking in account sleep balance, previous day activity, activity balance, body temperature, resting heart rate (rhr), recovery index . Score will be between 0 and 100. A lower score indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
