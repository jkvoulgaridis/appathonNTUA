  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the objective response rate (ORR) of E7090 by
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 based on independent imaging review
      (IIR) in participants with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 gene fusion who failed
      gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy.

    <description>The ORR will be assessed by IIR based on RECIST version 1.1. ORR is defined as a percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR: disappearance of all lesions. PR: For PR, longest diameter will be used for non-lymph target lesions but short axis is measured for lymph lesions. PR: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline, associated to non-progressive disease (non-PD) response for non-target (NT) lesions.</description>

The BOR of SD has to be observed greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 weeks from the date of first study dose. CR: disappearance of all lesions. PR: For PR, longest diameter will be used for non-lymph target lesions but short axis is measured for lymph lesions.
