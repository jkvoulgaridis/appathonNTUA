  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will explore the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) on executive function deficits in high function autism spectrum disorder.
      Half of the participants will be chosen by chance to receive continuous theta burst
      stimulation (cTBS) while the other half will be chosen by chance to receive sham stimulation.
      And finally the sham group individuals also receive cTBS. Based on results from a recent
      unpublished pilot data, the investigators propose that cTBS treatment will induce a
      significant improvement in executive function performance compared to sham treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, sham controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of cTBS as a
      treatment for executive function deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder
      between 6 and 16 years of age. The study duration is approximately 1 months, with the cTBS
      sessions lasting for 4 weeks, 5 times a week, for about 20min each. Several scales will be
      used to assess for symptom severity and adaptive functioning. The executive function will be
      evaluated by Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) questionnaire.
      Cognition will be assessed using functional near - infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).

      This study also involves a type of brain imaging known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
      the beginning and at the end of the 4 weeks daily cTBS to better understand the effects of
      cTBS on brain structure and function. Investigators will measure the size and connections of
      different parts of the brain to assess brain structure and blood flow.

    <description>Active cTBS treatment will be delivered at an intensity that is 70% of the resting motor threshold (RMT). cTBS consist of bursts of 3 magnetic pulses at 30 Hz repeating every 200 ms for 300 pulses. cTBS repeat twice with 15 min interval. Treatment will be applied in central suleus.</description>

    <description>Sham rTMS will be delivered using the same stimulation parameters and at the site of active treatment, but with only the side-edge resting on the scalp. The coil will be angled 45 degrees way from the skull in a single-wing tilt position. This method produces sound and some somatic sensation (e.g. contraction of scalp muscles) similar to those of active stimulation, but with minimal direct brain effects.</description>
