  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is very common, as most people will experience herpetic
      infection during their lifetime. The most common manifestation of HSV infection is sores
      which may appear at any age. No specific antiviral therapy is available to totally cure
      herpetic infections and today, there is no treatment that allows the definitive eradication
      of the virus.

      The 2LHERP® has been available for more than 20 years, and has received a marketing
      authorization in Belgium by the FAMHP. It is used as an immune regulator in the treatment of
      herpetic infections. Since 2LHERP® has been made available, clinical observational data
      collected on treated patients have shown the beneficial effect on the disappearance of
      herpetic recurrences.

      The purpose of this placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of 2LHERP® on the
      treatment of herpetic infections in adults.

      The study duration will be maximum 24 months with 12 months of inclusion and 12 months of
      follow-up. Patients aged between 18 and 80 years who present recurrent genital herpes
      infections (4 or more episodes within the 12-months' period prior to their study entry). The
      total number of patients to include will be 100 with 50 patients per group.

      Primary objective:

      Evaluation of the efficacy of 2LHERP® on the reduction of the number of recurrent genital
      herpes infections at 12 months compare to placebo.

      Secondary objectives:

      Comparison of the efficacy of 2LHERP® vs placebo, according to the following aspects:

        -  number of episodes at 6 months,

        -  remaining herpes infection recurrence free 6 and 12 months after the treatment
           initiation,

        -  time to first episode during the treatment,

        -  duration of episodes,

        -  symptomatology during the entire relapse time,

        -  use of Rescue Medication (RM),

        -  evaluation of impact on the quality of life,

        -  safety issues.

      Treatment phase:

      Group n°1 = 2LHERP® (6 months of treatment) Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)
      Post-treatment follow-up phase: 6 months. Treatment will be considered successful if the
      number of herpetic episodes is reduced.
