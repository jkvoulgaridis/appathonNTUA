  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a prevalent pathogen, the epidemiology of which has mostly been
      studied in the uterine cervix and the vagina.

      The KCE Report 238Cs (2015) recommends &quot; HR-HPV-positive women should not be offered
      colposcopy immediately. Triage should be done using cytology for this purpose. If cytological
      abnormalities (ASCUS+) are found, immediate referral should follow for diagnosis and, where
      appropriate, treatment. If no abnormalities are observed in triage, the subject should be
      offered follow-up testing (cytology) at six months. &quot;.

      There is no treatment that is recommended during this lap time. The 2LPAPI® has been
      available for more than 20 years, and has received a marketing authorization in Belgium by
      the FAMHP. It is used as an immune regulator in the treatment of HR-HPV infections. Since
      2LPAPI® has been made available, clinical observational data collected on treated patients
      have shown the beneficial effect on the clearance of HPV.

      The purpose of this placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of 2LPAPI® on the
      clearance of genital HR-HPV infections.

    <textblock>
      The study duration will be 24 months with 12 months of inclusion and 12 months of follow-up.
      Patients aged between 25 and 45 years who present cervical abnormalities during the routine
      screening visit for cervical cancer prevention.

      The total number of patients to include will be 284 with 142 patients per group.

      Primary objective:

      Comparison of the efficacy of 2LPAPI® versus placebo on the clearance of genital HR-HPV
      infections after 12 months of follow-up.

      Secondary objectives:

      Comparison of 2LPAPI® versus placebo on:

        -  HR-HPV infection clearance rate at 6-month visits,

        -  HR-HPV infection clearance rate by HPV type at 6-month and 12-month visits,

        -  Normal cytology,

        -  Safety.

      Treatment phase:

      Group n°1 = 2LPAPI® (6 months of treatment) Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)
      Post-treatment follow-up phase: 6 months. Treatment will be considered successful if the
      clearance of HR-HPV is done and the cytology is normal.
