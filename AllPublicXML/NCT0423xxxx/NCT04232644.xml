  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover study to
      evaluate the PK, user experience and abuse liability of manipulated ADAIR compared to a
      manipulated commercially-available d-amphetamine sulfate IR formulation administered
      intranasally in non-dependent recreational stimulant users. The study is comprised of 4
      phases: Screening, Qualification, Treatment, and Follow-up/Early Termination.

    <textblock>
      VAL-103 is a phase 1, pilot, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 2-treatment
      crossover study. The study objectives include assessing the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of manipulated ADAIR 30 mg compared to crushed d-amphetamine
      sulfate IR 30 mg (DEX) administered IN in non-dependent recreational stimulant users. The
      primary PD endpoint is mean maximum drug liking (Emax) on a bipolar 100mm visual analog
      scale.

      A total of 16 qualified subjects demonstrating a confirmed positive response to stimulants
      will enter the treatment phase. Safety will be assessed via adverse events, vital signs,
      ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
