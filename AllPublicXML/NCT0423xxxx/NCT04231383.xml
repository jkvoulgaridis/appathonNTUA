  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Untreated dental caries are very common in preschool children. Pain and inflammation due to
      dental caries have been reported to affect eating and sleeping disorders, affecting growth
      and development. The aim of this study was to compare the changes in serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3
      levels, height and weight gain before and after treatment in patients with dental
      caries-related inflammation and pain in preschool children and to compare these children with
      children without dental caries. Thirty children aged between 3-6 years with dental caries
      with pulp were identified using ICDAS II and dmft index as the study group.30 children dental
      caries including pulp, will be included using the same indices as the control group. In the
      study group, serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels and anthropometric measurements will be
      determined before and at the 6th month after treatment. In the control group, serum IGF-1 and
      IGFBP-3 levels and anthropometric measurements will be determined at the 6th month following
      the first dental examination. IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and anthropometric measurements will be compared
      between first dental examination and 6th month values in the study and control groups, and
      between first dental examination and 6th month time points between the groups.

      In addition to growth parameters, the Children's Sleeping Habits Questionnaire and the Early
      Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale will be compared before the 6th month of dental treatment
      and compared
