      In this one-arm study, histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, uterine
      malignancies, and soft tissue sarcoma will be enrolled to investigate the efficacy and safety
      of PD-1 monoclonal antibody SHR-1210 and apatinib, at the same time, peripheral circulating
      blood tumor cells (CTC) detection and CTC-based PD-L1 antibody immunofluorescence detection
      will be performed.

      Primary outcome:

        1. Analysis of baseline levels of CTC and CTC PD-L1 and prognosis efficacy of patients:
           Objective remission rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS);

        2. Dynamic monitoring of CTC and CTC PD-L1 at baseline before treatment, after two cycles
           of treatment, and as the disease progresses.

        3. Consistency analysis of PD-L1 and CTC PD-L1 expression in tissue specimens.

      Secondary outcome:
