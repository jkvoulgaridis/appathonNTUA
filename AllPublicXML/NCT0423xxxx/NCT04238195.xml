      This is a randomized, double-blind (with respect to Tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide
      [TBPM-PI-HBr]/placebo only), placebo- and active-control, single-dose, 4-way crossover study
      that will enroll 24 healthy adult male and female subjects. There will be a washout period of
      at least 7 days between dosing in each period and each subject will receive all 4 treatments
      over 4 periods in a crossover study design.

      This is a randomized, double-blind (with respect to TBPM-PI-HBr / placebo only), placebo- and
      active-control, single-dose, 4-way crossover study. Twenty-four (24) healthy, adult, male and
      female subjects will be enrolled. Screening of subjects will occur within 28 days prior to
      the first dosing.

      All subjects will receive a single dose of 4 different study treatments over 4 separate
      treatment periods, each separated by a 7-day washout period.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 12 treatment sequences. Sentinel
      group: In Period 1 only, 4 subjects will be dosed 24 hours prior to the remaining 20
      subjects. Each of the 4 subjects from the sentinel group will receive a different treatment.

      On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single oral therapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr
      (Treatment A), supratherapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment B), placebo (Treatment C), or
      moxifloxacin (Treatment D) according to the randomization scheme.

      In each period, cardiodynamic ECGs and PK blood samples will be collected pre-dose and for 24
      hours post-dose. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and
      laboratory evaluations.

      Discontinued subjects who have received study drug will not be replaced.

    <masking_description>A computerized randomization scheme will be created by a CRO-statistician and it shall be considered blinded (as per the following).
The randomization is available only to the pharmacy staff that is preparing the drug who will not be involved in any other aspect of the study including administration of the drug. The randomization will also be available to the bioanalytical laboratory as sample analyses will be treatment-dependent. It will not be made available to the Sponsor, subjects, or members of the staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments.
On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single oral therapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment A), supratherapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment B), placebo (Treatment C), or moxifloxacin (Treatment D) according to the randomization scheme.</masking_description>
