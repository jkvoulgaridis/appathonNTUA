  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of UCLA Health's commitment to developing a premier integrated health system built on
      a foundation of physician-led, team-based primary care, the Department of Medicine (DOM)
      recently implemented a new performance based incentive plan called the Primary Care Clinical
      Excellence (PCCE) Incentive Plan. This incentive plan was developed to motivate providers to
      improve health maintenance screening rates.

      The UCLA Health DOM Quality team is leading the implementation and evaluation of this new
      incentive plan across our primary care network. In addition, the DOM Quality team has
      partnered with the UCLA Anderson School of Management to study the most efficacious ways to
      frame and communicate performance based incentives.

      Understanding the factors that motivate physicians to deliver the highest quality primary
      care will provide pivotal insights into the successful implementation of performance based
      programs nationwide. The investigators believe that physicians who receive communication
      built on behavioral principles will demonstrate more motivation towards and success at
      meeting national primary care screening guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, UCLA Health has 42 primary care clinics staffed with approximately 205 PCP's
      serving more than 300,000 patients. In order to improve health maintenance screening rates
      associated with the performance based program, the investigators will use a communication
      strategy that leverages behavioral principles to motivate providers to improve health
      maintenance screening rates.

      The investigators will implement a three-arm experimental communication campaign that
      includes monthly messages. The communication strategy will utilize behavioral change theory
      (particularly social comparison and recognition) to improve physician performance in health
      maintenance quality metrics.

      This study will measure:

      - The measures within the five quality domains of the PCCE incentive program—Clinical
      Quality, Patient Satisfaction, Professional Participation, Office Function, and Risk
      Coding—and how these domains are influenced by the respective communication. Further
      covariates of interest include, but are not limited to, physician demographics, email read
      rates, dashboard utilization, self-reported measures of physician autonomy, competence,
      relatedness, perceived resource availability, the financial incentive, self-efficacy,
      physician burnout, job satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation.

      The investigators will measure the effects of our interventions using quality data (used to
      determine if the performance based criteria are met) and an original survey (consisting of
      validated questions). The investigators will first evaluate whether the combination of arms 2
      and 3 differs from arm 1 in terms of these endpoints. If this comparison is statistically
      significant, the investigators will also compare arms 1 vs 2, as well as arm 2 vs 3. These
      comparisons of treatment arms will be performed at the patient level using a mixed effects
      regression model, including random physician and clinic effects to account for clustering of
      patients, and controlling for physician baseline completion rate as well as demographic and
      clinical characteristics (age, race, ethnicity). The main analysis will be complemented by a
      robustness check using marginal regression, with inferences based on clinic-level
      cluster-robust standard errors. P-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.

Social comparison: In addition to the information given in Arm 1 email messaging, physicians in this arm will receive a list of the names of the top 25 performers from the prior month, and a high performer benchmark. Each physician in this group will receive a personalized message and subject line based on where in the performance distribution they fall (categories: top 25 performers, high performers, nearly high performers, and low performers).

Quality improvement leadership training: Physician leads and clinic managers within clinics randomized to Group 3 will receive an in-person quality improvement and primary care clinic performance training, using the principles of quality improvement, self-determination theory and social comparison. Clinic leaders will be trained on how to guide these conversations, formulate their own performance/quality improvement goals, design effective strategies to reach these goals, and track their clinic's progress. Check-in emails and calls will be provided on a monthly basis to follow up on clinic-based quality improvement efforts and share key take-aways from the new Primary Care Clinical Excellence Recognition Program. This program aims to support a positive and collaborative culture of clinical excellence by recognizing and sharing best practices from high performing physicians and clinical teams.</description>
