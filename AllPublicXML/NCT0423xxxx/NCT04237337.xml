  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though the therapeutic panel for multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment has improved in the
      last 20 years, safety data especially for the second-line and innovative treatments are
      lacking. The association between MS and cancer has long been investigated but has led to
      conflicting results. No studies have reported an increased risk of cancer after long-term
      exposure to immuno-modulators. The present study will assess whether drugs for the treatment
      of MS are associated with an increased risk of cancer by analyzing the disproportionality of
      reports in the World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database.

      A case non-case study using Vigibase®, the World Health Organization Global Individual Case
      Safety Reports (ICSRs) database which includesreports forwarded to the WHO Uppsala Monitoring
      Center by national pharmacovigilance systems from over 130 countries around the world since
      1967. Information on the adverse effects reported include patient demographics and medical
      relevant history, drugs recorded according to the WHO Drug dictionary and adverse drug
      reactions coded with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms will be
      perform.
