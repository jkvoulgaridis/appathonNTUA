  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Within recent years, new methods for detailed assessment of gastrointestinal (GI)
      motility have been developed. Hence, the electromagnetic 3D-Transit system is a safe,
      non-invasive method for detailed description of GI motility. The system tracks the exact
      position of an ingested electromagnetic capsule through the entire GI tract and provides
      detailed information on both regional transit- and contraction patterns. High Resolution
      Colonic Manometry (HRCM) allows extremely detailed description of contraction patterns in the
      colon. The HRCM is however an invasive method, as the catheter is placed during colonoscopy.
      Before widespread use of capsule-based techniques (3D-Transit or others), the system needs to
      be validated by another method.

      Study Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate weather pressure changes
      measured by HRCM correlate with passage patterns recorded by 3D-Transit. This has been
      assumed so far, but has never been further investigated.

      Hypothesis: Movement of the electromagnetic 3D-Transit capsule within the colon correspond
      well with pressure changes determined with HRCM.

      Materials and methods: HRCM and 3D-transit will be performed simultaneously in 20 healthy
      participants. A colonoscopy is performed to install the HRCM catheter and place two
      3D-Transit capsules within the colon. For 24 hours, the participants lie in a bed in the
      research lab while pressure changes from the HRCM catheter are recorded and the 3D-Transit
      capsules are followed through the gastrointestinal system.

      Perspectives: If data from the 3D-Transit technique correlate well with HRCM, the method
      provide a non-invasive alternative allowing detailed assessment of colonic motility.
