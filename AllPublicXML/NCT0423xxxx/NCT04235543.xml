Traumatic childhood events are associated with a wide range of negative physical, psychological and adaptive outcomes over the life course and may lead to psychiatric illness. Autism is charactarized by repetitive, restricted behaviors and self-injury which make them vulnerable to traumatic dental injury unlike children without Autism.
Management of Traumatic dental injuries in autistic children poses a major challenge because these children aren't have the ability to cooperate during dental care. Therefore, prevention of TDIs in ASD children is of a great importance.</description>
