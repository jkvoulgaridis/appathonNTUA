  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional and questionnaire survey study. The investigators try to find
      out patient's willingness and expectation for post-operative treatments for hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), as well as patients' willingness to participate in clinical trials using a
      questionnaire. The ultimate goal is to assist physicians in clinical treatment decision,
      clinical research, and government health and economic decision-making, as well as to help
      investigators understand how to increase public awareness of the HCC and the treatment course
      and efficacy of HCC, and the awareness of clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no world widely accepted adjuvant therapy for HCC and the guidelines from AASLD or
      EASL did not recommend any adjuvant therapy to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence of HCC.
      The goal of an adjuvant therapy is to meet the requirements of patients, which are influenced
      by many factors such as the strength of doctors' recommendation, economic affordability,
      tolerance of adverse reactions to treatment, and expectation of efficacy. Therefore,
      understanding patients' expectations for an adjuvant therapy after surgery will help doctors
      give more reasonable treatment. Participating in clinical trials is a new process of
      understanding and acceptance for each patient, so investigators try to understand the
      willingness and ideas of patients to participate in clinical trials, so as to provide more
      information for designing clinical trials and recruiting subjects for clinical trials.

      The research was conducted through face-to-face interview, WeChat and telephone interview.
      For face-to-face interview and WeChat to participants, an informed consent should be signed.
