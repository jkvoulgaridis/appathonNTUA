    <textblock>
      This research study is studying to see if Sacituzumab govitecan is effective and safe for
      individuals with localized triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study is:

      - Sacituzumab govitecan

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease.&quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      This research study involves an experimental study treatment. The names of the study drugs
      involved in this study is:

      - Sacituzumab govitecan

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  Eligible participants will receive Sacituzumab govitecan for up to 12 weeks.

        -  This can be followed by standard chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating
           physician.

        -  It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Sacituzumab govitecan as a
      treatment for any disease.

      Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an antibody
      attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made the immune system.
      Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work by binding the antibody portion of the drug in the
      tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion works to prevent ancer cells from
      growing/spreading.
