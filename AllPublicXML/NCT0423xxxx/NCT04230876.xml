  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hearing aids are the most common treatment for hearing loss, and have the potential
      to help seniors stay active and productive, almost 50% of them who receive hearing aids
      rarely if ever use them, a state of affairs sometimes referred to as &quot;the hearing aid in the
      drawer&quot; syndrome. clEAR's customized auditory brain training has been shown to be effective
      in improving adults' abilities to recognize speech, in reducing their perceptual effort
      associated with listening with a hearing loss, and in increasing their confidence to engage
      in everyday conversations. In the proposed research, we will determine whether older adults
      who receive hearing aids for the first time report higher satisfaction with their new hearing
      aids and have longer daily use time as a result of having completed clEAR's auditory brain
      training program for new hearing aid users.

      Auditory training as the potential to dramatically affect older persons' adjustment to a new
      hearing aid and to maximize the benefits they receive from wearing one. In turn, by wearing
      hearing aids, they experience easier and more successful communication patterns. They enhance
      their ability to engage in everyday conversations and will be able to become more socially
      involved with their family and friends. In this study we will try to determine the extent to
      which web-based clEAR auditory brain training, with concomitant support from a clEAR in-house
      audiologist, affects satisfaction with new hearing aids and increases daily use time. The
      study will include thirty adults over the age of 60 years who have received hearing aids for
      the first time. After an adjustment period, half will complete clEAR's auditory brain
      training program right away and the other half will complete it after a delay period, and
      both will complete a control condition. To establish the level of feasibility and clinical
      utility. We will measure hearing aid satisfaction, benefit ratings, and hearing aid use time.

    <description>Hearing aid satisfaction questionnaires include standard questionnaires used in hearing clinics to determine how well people have adapted to the new device. The three scales to be used include:
The Client Orientated Scale of Improvement (COSI), a subjective measure of improvement on self-defined goals. The scale is relative to a start value, but positive chance values between one and three indicate improvement.
The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) is a series of seven Questions on a five point scale. Improvement is indicated if relative improvement is seen on any of the questions over time (0-5 points possible points of improvement).
Satisfaction with Amplification In Daily Life (SADL) is a series of 15 questions on a seven point scale. Improvement is indicated if relative improvement is seen on any of the questions over time (0-7 points possible points of improvement).</description>
