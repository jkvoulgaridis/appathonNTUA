      Background: postoperative recurrence after liver transplantation is a global problem, and
      there is no standard treatment model for postoperative recurrence. Objective: to select
      patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation and unable
      to receive local treatment, and to give sorafenib combined with realgar-indigo naturalis
      formula until the disease progression or the patient die or is lost to follow-up. To analyze
      the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic characteristics of sorafenib combined with compound
      huangdai tablets in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver
      transplantation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  aged 18-75 (inclusive), male or female;

          -  recurrence of HCC after liver transplantation;

          -  grade C according to the Barcelona liver cancer classification criteria (BCLC) or
             grade B not suitable for local treatment/progression of local treatment

          -  according to RECIST1.1, there was at least one target lesion that could be stably
             evaluated, defined as: longest diameter of non-lymph node lesion ≥10mm, or shortest
             diameter of lymph node lesion ≥15mm; The intrahepatic lesions required enhanced
             arterial development

          -  expected survival more than 12 weeks;

          -  child-pugh score ≤7;

          -  ECOG score 0-1;

          -  if the subject is HBsAg positive or HBcAb positive, hbv-dna &lt; 200 IU/ml should be
             satisfied. HBsAg positive subjects must receive antiviral therapy in accordance with
             the 2015 guidelines for the prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

          -  subject should meet the following test results before screening and pretreatment (at
             baseline). If abnormal laboratory tests do not meet the following criteria, the
             subjects are allowed to re-examine within one week. If they still do not meet the
             criteria, the screening will be considered a failure: A. Blood routine (no blood
             transfusion, platelet transfusion, cell growth factor (except recombinant
             erythropoietin) and other supportive treatments should be performed within 7 days
             before the test) : WBC ≥ 2.5×109/L; Platelet count (PLT) ≥60×109/L; Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥

             weeks of the first treatment.

          -  pregnant or breastfeeding women;

          -  positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, treponema pallidum antibody
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV-RNA) antibody;

          -  any uncontrolled active infection, including but not limited to subjects with active
             tuberculosis;

          -  previous or present hepatic encephalopathy;

          -  the presence of clinically significant ascites is defined as the ascites that are
             positive on physical examination or that need to be controlled by intervention therapy
             (for example, puncture or drug therapy, etc.).

          -  imaging results: the proportion of liver replaced by tumor was ≥50%, and the main
             portal vein tumor thrombus or tumor thrombus invaded mesenteric vein/inferior vena
             cava;

          -  adverse reactions caused by previous treatment did not return to the standard term for
             adverse events (CTCAE) ≤1, except hair loss and other tolerable events judged by
             researchers;

          -  subjects who currently have unstable or active ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, or
             intolerance to proton pump inhibitors;
