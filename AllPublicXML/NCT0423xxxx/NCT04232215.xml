  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are assessing the ease of use and accuracy of the HeraBEAT™ device, a new device
      used with a smartphone to monitor fetal heart rate during pregnancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HeraBEAT™ is a wireless Smart Fetal Ultrasound Doppler measuring device designed to be
      self-administered by the expectant mother throughout the different stages of pregnancy. The
      HeraBEAT™ device safety and performance claims allow continuous and accurate measurement of
      fetal heart rate (FHR) and maternal heart rate (MHR) throughout the pregnancy starting at 12
      weeks gestation.

      Technologically, HeraBEAT™ is similar to other FHR devices currently on the market in terms
      of device usage but differ by design in its interface. The HeraBEAT™ device uses a
      smartphone-based interface, with real time instructions for expectant mothers for determining
      both MHR and FHR.

      This study will recruit low risk expectant mothers from the Obstetrics and Gynecology
      Department at Mayo Clinic Rochester. This is a mixed method; single center randomized
      controlled trial comparing HeraBEAT™ to a standard home fetal Doppler monitor, in the
      outpatient setting at a single academic institution, in the mid-west United States. The
      overall study will be guided by an assessment of device functionality and user acceptability,
      as well as an evaluation of the impact of the device on expectant mother's perception of
      fetal well-being, as measured by standardized surveys.
