  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive performance is negatively related to an impaired glucose metabolism, possibly due
      to impairments in brain vascular function. Supported by the statement from the American Heart
      and Stroke Association that a healthy lifestyle is one of the most effective strategies to
      protect against cognitive decline, the investigators now hypothesise that healthy lifestyle
      intervention-induced changes in glucose metabolism cause beneficial effects on brain vascular
      function thereby improving cognitive performance. The primary objective of this intervention
      study is thus to evaluate in sedentary older men and women the effect of a 16-week
      aerobic-based exercise program on cerebral blood flow, as quantified by the non-invasive gold
      standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion method Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL).
      Cerebral blood flow is a robust and sensitive physiological marker of brain vascular
      function. Secondary objectives are to examine effects on glucose metabolism using the
      homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-ir) and cognitive performance as
      assessed with a neurophysiological test battery.

    <description>The physical activity guidelines for older consist of 150 minutes per week moderate-to-high intensity exercise, two times per week muscle and bone strengthening exercises, which are combined with balance exercises. Additional health benefits can be achieved with a longer exercise duration, frequency and/or intensity. Furthermore, the amount of time sitting should be minimised. The dietary guidelines are described in detail in the so-called &quot;The Wheel of Five&quot;. In brief, the circle is divided into four food groups and one beverage group. More than half of the circle is covered by fruits, vegetables, whole grain (containing) breads, cereals and potatoes. A much smaller part is compromised by animal source foods, spreads and cooking fats. Water, tea and coffee without sugar complete the circle.</description>
