  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Colorectal surgery includes surgery for colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel
      disease and other benign diseases such as diverticulitis. In Canada, approximately 21,000
      colorectal surgeries are performed each year. Patients undergoing colorectal surgery face
      high rates of unplanned hospital visits including readmission to hospital and Emergency Room
      (ER) visits. These unplanned hospital visits lead to significant distress and anxiety for
      patients and increased health care costs.

      Research Aims: The goal is to evaluate the use of an integrated discharge monitoring system
      with a mobile application (app) to support colorectal surgery patients at home following
      discharge from hospital.

      Methods: The study will include 3 hospitals across Canada. Patients will be assigned to
      either a control group or intervention group. Control group patients will receive standard
      follow up care after going home following surgery. Intervention group patients will be
      enrolled in an integrated discharge monitoring system using an app to monitor their progress
      at home following discharge after surgery. The main outcomes are to measure the number of
      patients with unplanned hospital visits within 30 days of discharge following surgery, the
      quality of patient recovery and confidence managing one's own health care. Patients are
      eligible if they are being discharge home after having elective colorectal surgery, are 18
      years or older and speak and understand English or French. At the end of the study, the
      outcomes between the control group and intervention group will be compared to look for
      important differences.

      Expected Outcomes: It is expected that the results of this study will show that the
      integrated discharge monitoring system will lead to a significant improvement in the quality
      of patient recovery and self-confidence with one's own health care, as well as significantly
      reduce the number of unplanned hospital visits for patients undergoing colorectal surgery in
      Canada.

    <textblock>
      Background: Patients undergoing colorectal surgery are vulnerable during their transition
      from hospital to home and face high rates of unplanned hospital visits including readmission
      to hospital and ER visits. Not only does this lead to significant distress for patients but
      also translates into significant health care costs. At a patient engagement meeting with
      patients from across Canada led by our group, one of the main themes that emerged was the
      patients' sense of abandonment upon discharge from hospital following surgery. Based on this
      feedback, our investigative team developed and pilot tested an integrated discharge
      monitoring system using a mobile application (app) to support patients following discharge
      from hospital after colorectal surgery. The results of this pilot work provided compelling
      data to suggest that this integrated discharge monitoring system was feasible, highly rated
      by patients and may lead to a considerable decrease in 30-day unplanned hospital visits.

      Research Aims: Therefore, the aim of this study is to conduct a 3 year, randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated discharge monitoring system to
      support colorectal surgery patients at home following discharge.

      Methods: A RCT will be implemented at 3 high volume colorectal surgery centres across Canada.
      The intervention is an integrated discharge monitoring system using an app that has been
      developed and pilot tested in partnership with SeamlessMD. The inclusion criteria for the
      study are: any patient being discharged home following elective colorectal surgery, 18 years
      or older and able to speak and understand English or French. The primary outcome for the
      study is 30-day unplanned hospital visits and the secondary outcomes include patient quality
      of recovery and self-efficacy with one's own health care. A sample size of 670 patients is
      planned and will provide an 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in 30-day unplanned hospital
      visits, assuming a baseline 30-day unplanned hospital visit rate of 27%, 0.05 Type 1 error
      rate and an 80% power.

      Expected Outcomes: It is expected that the results of this trial will show that the
      integrated discharge monitoring system leads to a significant improvement in patient
      satisfaction in terms of quality of recovery and self-efficacy as well as a significant
      reduction in 30-day unplanned hospital visits and health care costs.

    <description>The app will be provided to patients in hospital on post-operative day 3. On the day of discharge, the patient will be emailed a &quot;Daily Health Check&quot; and receive subsequent &quot;Daily Health Check&quot; emails on Day 1-14, 21 and 30 days following discharge. The &quot;Daily Health Check&quot; is a tailored questionnaire to elicit their symptoms and status of post-operative recovery. After the patient has completed the &quot;Daily Health Check&quot;, a &quot;Daily Health Check Summary&quot; is emailed to the patient that summarizes their responses and provides appropriate action recommendations based on their responses ranging from: (i) suggestions for educational modules, (ii) expect a call from your health care team in the next 24 hours, (iii) call your surgeon's office today or (iv) go to the nearest emergency room. The patient's &quot;Daily Health Check&quot; responses are displayed in real time on a secure website that automatically &quot;red flags&quot; extreme responses to alert the health care team to contact the patient by telephone.</description>
