  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate the initial safety, tolerability, and PK profile of
      inhaled LTI-03 in healthy volunteers. In order to minimize exposure, the study will first
      test single ascending doses (SAD) of LTI-03 followed by multiple ascending dose (MAD)
      cohorts.

      Findings from this study will direct the clinical development of LTI-03 for the treatment of
      IPF

      The study subject population will include normal healthy male and female volunteers between
      18 and 55 years of age (inclusive).

      Consistent with other trials involving inhaled medication, subjects must have normal
      pulmonary function at Screening and will be excluded if they have a history of active or
      recurring allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic sinus
      drainage, chronic or acute cough or other respiratory condition deemed exclusionary by the
      Investigator. History of liver dysfunction or elevated bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values at Screening will also be grounds for
      exclusion.

    <intervention_model_description>The first part of the study will follow a Single Ascending Dose design. Subjects receive a single dose of double-blind study medication (investigational medicinal product LTI-03 or placebo) on Day 1.
For each dose level cohort, two eligible sentinel subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive active:placebo study medication.
If no tolerability issues are observed by the Investigator within 48 hours post-dose, dosing will commence for the remaining six subjects in the cohort, who will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio to receive active:placebo study medication.
The second part of the study will follow a Multiple Ascending Dose design. Subjects receive double-blind study medication (LTI-03 or placebo) once-daily from Day 1 to Day 14.
For each dose level cohort, eight eligible subjects will be randomized in a 6:2 ratio to receive active:placebo study medication.</intervention_model_description>
