  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of intradermal injection of stromal vascular fraction into
      suture line on wound healing and scarring.

      Patients undergoing primary or secondary Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap
      breast reconstruction will be included in this monocentric, randomised, controlled,
      double-blinded study.

      After bilateral flank liposuction, the fat will be processed by a special protocol with
      enzymatic digestion. Stromal vascular fraction will be isolated and injected intradermally
      just after wound closure into one site of surgical wound (most lateral 5 cm) at the DIEP flap
      donor site. The other site of DIEP flap donor site (most lateral 5 cm) will serve as a
      control. Part of stromal vascular fraction will be analysed by flow cytometry for the
      viability and cell specification. Ten months after DIEP flap surgery the scars at both sites
      (control and injected site) will be excised and analysed histologically. At that time
      photographs will be taken and scars will be analysed by Patient and Observer Assesment Scale
      (POSAS).

    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scar will be evaluated by the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. The POSAS consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically and make up a 'Total Score' of the Patient and Observer Scale. The sum altogether will give the 'Total Score' of the POSAS. Besides the 10-step scale, category boxes are available to score nominal parameters (e.g. type of colour). Moreover, the patient and observer also score their 'Overall Opinion'.</description>
