  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well infigratinib works in treating solid tumors that have
      spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) in patients with FGFR gene
      mutations such as FGFR1-3 gene fusions or other FGFR genetic alterations. Mutations are any
      changes in the genetic material (DNA) of a cell. FGFR proteins are involved in cell division,
      cell maturation, formation of new blood vessels, wound healing, and bone growth, development,
      and maintenance. FGFR mutations can cause the FGFR protein to become over-active in diseases
      such as cancer. Infigratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking FGFR proteins in
      these tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of single agent infigratinib in patients with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors of any histologic classification with FGFR1-3 gene
      fusions/translocations or other FGFR genetic alterations (with and without prior therapy with
      different FGFR inhibitor).

      II. To understand response rate and potential for infigratinib to benefit patients who have
      FGFR alterations including point mutations, insertions/deletions and amplifications in
      different solid tumor types.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further evaluate the efficacy of single agent infigratinib. II. To characterize the
      safety and tolerability of single agent infigratinib. II. To evaluate benefit of infigratinib
      in patients who have received one prior FGFR inhibitor.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To detect biomarkers of resistance to infigratinib treatment through tumor sequencing.

      II. To develop a circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) or liquid biopsy assay
      optimized for monitoring response to infigratinib and detecting emerging resistance mutations
      to infigratinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive infigratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who complete study treatment for any reason other than disease progression are
      followed for 30 days, every 8 weeks until disease progression, and then every 4 months for 1
      year. All other patients are followed for 30 days, and then every 4 months for 1 year.

             and for 3 months after the last dose of the study drug and should not father a child
             in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as
             during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via
             seminal fluid
