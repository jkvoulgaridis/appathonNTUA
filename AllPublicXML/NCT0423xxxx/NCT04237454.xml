  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a child less than 2 years old attends the Emergency Department (ED) with an injury,
      carers should offer an explanation. When there is no explanation or if the explanation is
      inconsistent &amp; because the child cannot say what happened, the doctor will need to consider
      all possible causes including child abuse. To help exclude abuse, the doctor will request
      x-rays of all the child's bones to make sure there are no other unexplained fractures. This
      requires up to 20 x-rays, which are called a skeletal survey. Even if there are no fractures,
      some or all of the x-rays will be repeated in the following 7-21 days, because by that time
      any fractures will have started to heal and so are easier to see than on the first skeletal
      survey. It means that if a doctor is worried about abuse, the child may need to have up to 40
      x-rays, which amounts to a significant radiation dose (more than 6 months of natural UK
      background radiation) &amp; increases the child's lifetime risk of getting cancer. 79 to 97 out
      of 100 skeletal surveys performed are normal. While it is of paramount importance to identify
      if a child is being abused, it is also important to minimise radiation dose. A camera which
      detects light and heat given off by the body has shown promise in some areas of medical
      practice. We plan to compare the results from the camera to those of the skeletal survey in
      40 children below 2 years of age attending our hospital over a 6-month period. We hope to
      demonstrate that this technology can be used to further select children who should have a
      skeletal survey, reducing radiation dose in children without missing those who are being
      abused and sending them home to be abused again.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children between 1 month and 2 years of age having initial/follow-up skeletal survey
             for investigation of suspected abuse

          -  Healthy Control children

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Informed consent withheld by main carer/guardian for the skeletal survey (court
             order would then be issues) 2. Informed consent for participation in the research
             study withheld 2. Situations where informed consent cannot be obtained (e.g. inability
             of carer/guardian to understand written English) 3. Postmortem cases (inclusion of the
             demised would unduly complicate the consent process for this small pilot study)
