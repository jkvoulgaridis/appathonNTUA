  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effect of buprenorphine on suicidal ideation in individuals
      with opioid use disorder, and to investigate the functional brain activity related to its
      potential anti-suicidal effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current opioid epidemic is an urgent public health problem, contributing significantly to
      the climbing U.S. suicide rates over the past two decades.

      Although initially rewarding, chronic opioid use leads to tolerance and escalating negative
      affective states. This may promote suicidal ideation and may further impair decision-making
      functions leading to suicidal behavior.

      Buprenorphine, a treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), has promise in reducing suicidal
      ideation. However, the neural mechanism of its anti-suicidal properties remains unknown.
      Blocking kappa opioid receptors is one mechanism of buprenorphine hypothesized to reverse the
      negative emotional sensitivity in OUD and thus may underlie its anti-suicidal effects.

      In this morphine-controlled study, we will examine the effect of buprenorphine on the
      functional activity of brain regions involved in negative emotional reactivity and
      investigate whether this effect is associated with its anti-suicidal properties.

      Buprenorphine has a different mechanism of action than currently available antidepressants
      and anti-suicidal medications. Understanding this mechanism can help refine its use in this
      context. Success will guide a future larger study to elucidate molecular mechanisms
      underlying anti-suicidal properties of buprenorphine.
