  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to improve the cultural adaptation and Turkish version of the The
      Physical Activity Scale for Individuals With Physical Disabilities (PASIPD) and to
      investigate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of PASIPD in individuals with
      spinal cord injury. PASIPD, which consists of 13 questions, will be adapted to Turkish by
      translation and back translation method. The study included 47 wheelchair-dependent patients
      over the age of 18 who were able to read and write Turkish (26 females, 21 males). In order
      to determine the reliability and internal consistency of PASIPD, item-total correlation, if
      item deleted cronbach alpha coefficient and cronbach alpha coefficient of the whole scale
      will be calculated. Test-retest method will be used for the stability of the scale. In the
      test-retest method, the scale will be re-applied to the same people with 7-day intervals.
      Pearson correlation analysis will be performed between the first test and the second test
      total and sub-parameters after 1 week. Test-retest reliability will be determined using the
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In the validity test of PASIPD; construct validity
      and criterion validity will be used. Test of construct validity; factor analysis and
      convergent and discriminant validity methods. The Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living
      and Functional Independence Measure (FIM); World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale
      Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and Craig Handicap
      Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART-SF) will be used to convergent and discriminant
      validity. Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests will be used to demonstrate criterion validity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence Measure evaluates the daily living activities. It comprises 18 items; 13 motor items (self-care and locomotion) and five cognitive items (communication and cognition), each of which is scored on a seven-point scale. The motor and cognitive scores have been separated, and each score now has a range of 0-100. The total score ranges from 13 to 126. A lower score indicates a worse functional level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index evaluates the activities of daily living. The total Barthel Index score ranges from 0-100. 0 represents full dependency, 100 represents full independence. A score above 60 indicates independence in daily living activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>20 meters push test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is the one of the Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests. Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests to evaluate participants' ability to use manual wheelchairs. Patients ride their wheelchairs as fast as they can on a 20-meter course. At this time, the evaluator records how many seconds the 20-meter course is completed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>slalom test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is the one of the Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests. Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests to evaluate participants' ability to use manual wheelchairs. An 18-meter course; 3 cones at 3 meter intervals, 2 cones at 2 meter intervals, 2 cones at 1 meter intervals. Patients progress by making slalom between cones and come back by making slalom from the last cone. At this time, an evaluator records the number of seconds the track has been completed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Push Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is the one of the Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests. Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Tests to evaluate participants' ability to use manual wheelchairs. An eight-course track of 25 meters in length; in the middle and on both sides of the cones. Patients start in the middle of the course. It then moves quickly to the cone on the right or left edge and returns to the center of the track. At the next stage, it moves to the cone on the other side of the course and proceeds for 6 minutes. At this time, an evaluator will record the number of meters traveled in 6 minutes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the quality of life. The questionnaire consists of 38 items and evaluates six dimensions related to health status. Questions are answered as yes or no. Each section is scored between 0-100. 0 indicates the best health status, 100 indicates the worst health status.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF) evaluates the quality of life. It consists of 4 sections: physical health (seven items), psychological health (six items), social relations (three items), environment (eight items), and two additional items that score the perception of health and quality of life. The total scores in each of the four areas range from 0 to 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) evaluates the quality of life. The scale consists of 5 parts: physical independence, mobility, roles and activities, social integration, economic self-sufficiency. Each parameter is scored between 0-100. The higher the participation, the higher the score, the lower the disability. The maximum score of 100 represents the level of participation of the non-disabled person.</description>
