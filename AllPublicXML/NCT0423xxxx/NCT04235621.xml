  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study with 2 parts. Part 1 comprises a visit to collect biological samples
      necessary for the molecular characterization of chronic kidney disease. Part 2 comprises an
      observational period of 5 visits over a period up to 8 weeks. During Part 2, baseline tests
      will be conducted, and urine will be collected approximately every 2 weeks for 8 weeks.
      Patients may participate in Part 1, Part 2, or both, and will be followed for up to 1 year
      consisting of data collection from the patient's medical records and home collection of urine
      samples every 4 months.
