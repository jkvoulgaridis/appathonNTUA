      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the Ticon Aspherical Daily Disposable Soft
      Contact Lens could retard myopia progress in youth

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blinded, controlled,
      paired-eye comparison study. At least 60 evaluable subjects with myopia progression ≧ 0.75 D
      in the past 12 months will be recruited from 2 study sites. The experimental soft contact
      lens with aspherical design (Ticon Aspherical) will be randomly assigned to either the right
      eye or the left eye of the subject , then the fellow eye will be assigned a control lens with
      a single vision distance (SVD) soft contact lens (Ticon). Both lenses will be worn at least 8
      hours a day, 5 days a week for 1 year. All lenses will be replaced every day. Brief
      assessment of the clinical findings will be followed up for one year at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3,
      6, 9, 12 months upon allocation. The primary efficacy outcome is change in spherical
      equivalent refraction (SER) measured by cycloplegic autorefraction over 12 months. The
      secondary outcome is change in axial eye length (AXL) measured over 12 months. The secondary
      outcome measure is used to corroborate any changes in SER
