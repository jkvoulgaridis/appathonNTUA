  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre phase I study to assess the Drug-Drug Interaction potential of
      MLC1501 with a cocktail of drugs acting as sensitive clinical probe substrates of Cytochrome
      P450 isoenzymes and Transporters in healthy subjects .

      The study will have 2 cohorts, one for the CYP study and the other for the Transporters
      study. Eligible subjects (n=24) will be assigned to one of the 2 cohorts in a 1:1 ratio.
