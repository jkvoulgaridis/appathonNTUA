  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, gastrointestinal tract disease, respiratory problems (such as obstructive sleep
      apnea), joint and muscle problems, reproductive disorders, depression and cancer.

      However, recently a new classification has emerged about obesity, the metabolically healthy
      obesity (MHO). According to the definition of the term, MHO represents obesity that occurs
      segregated from the metabolic syndrome criteria defined by the International Diabetes
      Federation (IDF). However, as there is still disagreement about the definition of MHO, the
      cardiovascular risk of these individuals is also uncertain. This phenotype may present as an
      intermediate risk between metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals and metabolically
      unhealthy obese individuals (MUO) or as a transition stage of the disease; when evolving to
      MUO, represents a higher risk of developing CVDs.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that obese individuals classified as metabolically
      healthy have worse vascular endothelial function when compared to non-obese individuals,
      demonstrating increased cardiovascular risk even in this subgroup considered &quot;low risk&quot;. The
      detection of endothelial dysfunction in metabolically healthy obese may help in the
      prevention, treatment and follow-up of these individuals, aiming to reduce the development
      and morbidity and mortality of CVD.

      In the present study, the investigators will use a laser-based method for evaluating
      non-invasive, operator-independent systemic microvascular function that detects microvascular
      flow in the skin for the evaluation of systemic vascular endothelial function.

Microvascular reactivity will be evaluated using a non-invasive and operator -independent methodology, named laser speckle contrast imaging, coupled with skin iontophoresis of vasodilator agents. Cutaneous microvascular flow will be measured in arbitrary perfusion units, divided by mean arterial pressure, to yield cutaneous vascular conductance.</description>
