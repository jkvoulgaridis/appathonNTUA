      This is a randomized controlled trial to investigate efficacy of a internet-delivered CBT for
      anxiety related to asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases and is often associated with anxiety. In a
      two prior studies (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03158194; NCT03486756) a protocol for
      exposure-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety related to asthma was developed,
      and standardised to an internet-delivered format and tested for feasibility and acceptability
      as an internet-CBT. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      exposure-based Internet-CBT for anxiety related to asthma compared to Treatment as Usual
      (TAU). The plan is to include 90 participants consecutively during 2020.
