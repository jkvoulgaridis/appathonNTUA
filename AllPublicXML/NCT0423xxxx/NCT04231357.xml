  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Great trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a difficult problem to manage and result in
      significant patient morbidity. This study is a single-center, randomised double-blind
      controlled trial. Eighty patients will be allocated to have ultrasound (US)-guided injection
      of pure platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or needle tenotomy. Outcome data will be collected before
      the intervention, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after intervention. Main outome measure: percent
      of patients that experience a reduction of 25% in hip outcome score (HOS) (responders) at 6
      months after intervention. Secondary outcome measures include percent of responders at three
      and twelve months, pain reduction (VAS) at 3, 6 and 12 months. Adverse reactions or events
      will be recorded.

    <masking_description>blocks of four, using EPIDAT3.1, and created aluminium paper blinded envelopes with the numbered treatment allocation. The numbered envelopes will be opened on the treatment day by the researcher who is in charge of the PRP preparation. All physicians (including orthopaedists involved in clinical outcome assessments and radiologists involved in ultrasound assessments), except one radiologist who performed the procedures, will be unaware of treatment allocation. All patients will be blinded to the treatment. Peripheral blood will be drawn from all patients, the syringe containing the treatment will be wrapped with gauze hindering treatment visualization.</masking_description>
