  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical trials and data on the triplet regimen combined with bevacizumab for
      first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer were from European and American
      populations. The triplet regimens recommended by the NCCN and ESMO guidelines using
      irinotecan and 5-FU at a higher dose intensity cause a high incidence of adverse events in
      Asian population, and there was no high-quality data on efficacy in Chinese population, both
      of which have limited the clinical applications of the regimens in China. This study intends
      to conduct an improved triplet regimen (mFOLFOXIRI) combined with bevacizumab versus mFOLFOX6
      combined with bevacizumab as a first-line multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III
      clinical trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS),
      observable response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), surgical
      resection rate, and safety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed in the
      two groups of subjects.
