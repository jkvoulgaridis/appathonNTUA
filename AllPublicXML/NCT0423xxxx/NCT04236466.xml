      Aim of the study: to compare the effect of Hyrax appliance and the Haas appliance improving
      the transverse skeletal and dental dimensions in cleft lip and palate patients during mixed
      dentition.

      â€¢Steps in short Full records pre-treatment. Bands selection for upper first molars then
      construction of expansion appliances(Haas or Hyrax) . Delivery of appliances and instructions
      to the patients and their parents about their activation regimen 2 quarter turns in the
      morning and 2 in the evening.The posterior crossbite will be measured as the distance from
      the palatal cusp tips of upper first molars to central fossae of lower first molars then the
      needed time for expansion will be calculated .When the time calculated for correction ends,
      we will stop activation, we will take impressions for digital models to see if real expansion
      occurred or not and so testing the efficiency of the two appliances.

      Afterthat, if correction was not yet achieved, activation of the appliances will continue
      till overcorrection at the molar region with the palatal cusp tip of the maxillary posterior
      teeth contacting the buccal cusp tip of the mandibular posterior teeth. We will then leave
      the appliance insitu for retention.

      After 6 months from the first CBCT we will take a second CBCT to see any bony changes .
