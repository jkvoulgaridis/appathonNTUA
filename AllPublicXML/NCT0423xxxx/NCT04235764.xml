      Background:

      Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States. The way that doctors
      remove tumors in bladder surgeries may leave some cancer . Also, many people have their
      tumors return or progress after surgery. Researchers want to test a modified device. It might
      tell doctors more about bladder tumors.

      Objective:

      To see if using a modified standard device with bladder surgery can provide better
      information about tumors in bladder specimens.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who need to have their bladder removed at the NIH.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical and prior surgical history

      Review of existing MRI, x-ray, or CT scans

      Review of existing specimens and reports

      Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age

      CT or MRI: Participants will lie in a machine. The machine will take pictures of their body.

      Participants will have bladder surgery. This will occur in the same way as if they did not
      take part in this study. A member of the research team will cut the removed bladder using the
      modified device. This will most likely be done on a separate back table in the operating
      room. The bladder and samples after cutting will be sent out for review. The will occur just
      as it would if the participants were not in this study. The only difference is the way that
      the specimen is prepared for review.

      Participants follow-up care will occur per standard of care. Or it will occur as part of any
      other study in which they might also be enrolled.

      Background:

        -  Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, disproportionately
           affecting more men than women.

        -  The gold standard for the surgical treatment and diagnosis of non-muscle invasive
           bladder cancer is transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT).

        -  TURBT requires the fragmentation of bladder tumors and piecemeal removal of these
           tumors.

        -  TURBT leads to loss of histopathologic information - including tumor orientation, size,
           and margin status - which may compromise outcomes and risk tumor seeding within the
           bladder.

        -  Given these multiple problems with TURBT we are testing some modifications to the
           current resectoscope device and the effect of these modifications on the quality of
           TURBT specimens produced.

        -  The redesigned resectoscope device will be tested ex-vivo on cystectomy specimens to
           avoid risks to patient safety.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if resectoscope device modification can
      provide improved pathologic standards for the TURBT procedure. An improvement in any of the
      parameters outlined below will constitute a device improvement in the current resectoscope:

        -  Presence of three tissue layers within the tumor specimens containing bladder mucosa,
           lamina propria, and portions of the muscularis.

        -  Information regarding tumor margin, assessed as the ability to ascertain if tumor is
           present at the margin of the resection.

      Eligibility:

        -  Medical condition requiring surgical removal of the bladder

        -  Men and women, age &gt;= 18 years

      Design:

        -  Preclinical tissue acquisition trial, ex vivo, proof-of-concept.

        -  Following cystectomy, a modified resectoscope/redesigned resectoscope will be used to
           resect areas of tumor from the cystectomy specimens. These resected tumors will be sent
           with the cystectomy specimen for histopathology to assess the size of resection, depth
           of resection, and ability to ascertain tumor orientation.

        -  The remainder of the cystectomy specimens will undergo traditional histopathology.
           Histopathologic information from both specimens will be included in the final
           histopathologic diagnosis to ensure accurate oncology staging.

        -  This study will allow for about 2 years of accrual and the accrual ceiling will be set
           at 25 subjects.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients requiring surgical removal of the bladder at the NIH Clinical Center.

        NOTE: Reasons for need for surgical removal of bladder include cancer or benign condition
        for which a surgeon determined surgical removal of the bladder is recommended. Patient's
        with invasive bladder cancer requiring cystectomy are eligible for enrollment. Bladder
        cancer remains the most common reason for cystectomy. Patients with clinical advanced
        disease and having other treatments/or participating in other trials remain eligible for
        enrollment in this study.

          -  Men and women

          -  Age greater than or less than 18 years

          -  Deemed clinically appropriate for the planned surgical procedure.

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

          -  Subjects will be asked to co-enroll in 15-C-0087, &quot;Care of the Urothelial Cancer
             Patient and Prospective Collection of Biospecimens from Healthy Volunteers and
             Urothelial Cancer Patients.&quot; NOTE: Most participants are expected to already be
             enrolled in 15-C-0087 prior to entry in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        - Cystectomy during pregnancy would subject the fetus to significant risk of miscarriage or
        premature labor. For this reason, pregnant women are ineligible for this study.
