  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of Ibrutinib
      and Rituximab as primary treatment of chronic GVHD. We plan to enroll 35 patients on this
      study. Patients will be formally monitored monthly for 12 months to evaluate for outcome and
      safety endpoints. All other assessments will be done at the physician's discretion or
      institutional standards. All patients, responders and treatment failures, will be followed
      for a period of one year from the time of initiation of therapy. The primary endpoint will be
      the proportion of patients that are alive and off all systemic IST at 12 months following
      initiation of treatment.

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of rituximab and ibrutinib versus the historical experience with rituximab alone in the upfront treatment of cGVHD. Patients will be followed for 12 months following the initiation of treatment to see if they remain off immunosuppressive therapy for at least 8 weeks.</description>
