  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double blind, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of the combination of methotrexate plus UVB TL01 in vitiligo.

      Treatment Strategy: Multicentric, parallel double blind randomized phase 2 prospective study
      comparing MTX taken orally once a week + narrowband UVB TL01 versus placebo + narrowband UVB
      TL01 Follow-up of the study: patients included in this study will start MTX 2 months before
      starting narrowband UVB TL01. Phototherapy will be performed twice a week during 6 months.
      Follow-up visit will be done at month 2, 4 and month 8. Phone calls to the patient will be
      done at month 6

    <masking_description>The study was performed double blind. MTX will be repackaged in capsules and will look the same as placebo capsules. These capsules are packaged in vials whose labeling allows the maintenance of the blind.
The flasks are numbered in a corresponding list established by biostatistician study which specifies processing to be put in each bottle according to the number.
At each visit (inclusion and monitoring), the patient will be assigned as many lots of numbers needed to reach the next visit (2 or 4).
Only Methods Center (USMR) and Pharmacy of Bordeaux University Hospital have the correspondence between the number of treatment and nature. At no time during the study, the investigator (s) and patients will not have access to this list.</masking_description>

    <description>The VASI Score is used to assess the severity and extent of Vitilgo. VASI is calculated using a formula that includes contributions from all body regions (possible range, 0-100). The body is divided into 6 separate and mutually exclusive sites (head/neck, hands, upper extremities [excluding hands], trunk, lower extremities [excluding feet], and feet), with percentage of vitiligo involvement estimated in hand units by the same investigator throughout the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 8</time_frame>
    <description>AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related, that occurs after a subject provides informed consent. Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy, or require changes in the study drug.</description>
