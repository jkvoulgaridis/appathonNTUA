      A comparative study on the improvement of quality of life of colostomized patients using the
      new Be1 device with capsule system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate improvement of quality of life (difference of at
      least 5 points in the StomaQoL questionnaire) among descending colostomy patients,
      establishing the following comparisons:

        1. Patients with recent surgery who after one month using a current two-piece mechanical
           device switch to the new Be1 device with capsule system versus patients who after one
           month continue to use the same current two-piece mechanical device during four months.

        2. Patients who have been using a current two-piece mechanical device during more than 6
           months after an ostomy and agree to switch to the new Be1 device with capsule system
           during four months.

      The following secondary objectives have been defined:

        -  Assessment of patient satisfaction with the new Be1 device with capsule system versus a
           current two-piece mechanical device.

        -  Demonstration that the new Be1 device with capsule system improves the microbiota of the
           colostomized patient.

        The study will involve descending colostomy patients. There are three study groups. Two of
        them will comprise new patients (recently subjected to surgery), while the third will
        consist of patients with an ostomy for at least 6 months (pre-existing patients).

        The sample size will comprise 240 patients (85 patients in the mentioned two groups and 70
        in the third).
