      with local anesthetic on the frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes in the first 6-month
      post cancer breast surgeries with axillary dissection.

      In this study Eighty Female patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, underwent breast
      surgery with axillary dissection at National Cancer Institute, Cairo University were included
      in this study. Patients will be randomized into two equal comparable groups of patients.

      (Group A the study group) was received pre-operative ultrasound guided stellate ganglion
      block one hour before surgery and multimodal analgesia and (Group B the control group) was
      received multimodal analgesia only.

      The present study showed in regards to the acute pain management of the stellate ganglion
      block: intraoperative hemodynamics, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (MABP, HR)
      were statistically significant less in group A (Stellate Group) than group B (Control Group)
      and this leads to significant less opioid consumption in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group
      B (Control group). In the 1st 24h postoperative opioid consumption measured by number of
      rescue dose of morphine 5mg IV were administered when visual analogue score was more than 4
      and total requirement per 24 hours was recorded. The results show statistically significant
      less opioid consumption in Group A (Stellate Group) with average visual analogue score 3.5 in
      1st 24h than Group B (Control group) with average visual analogue score 5.5 in 1st 24h.

      The present study showed in regards to the chronic pain management of the stellate ganglion
      block that, the 6-month relative frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes, using the grading
      system for neuropathic pain (GSNP) shows statistically significance lower frequency of
      neuropathic pain syndromes in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).

      Assessment of patient daily activity and functional capacity using Eastern cooperative
      oncology group (ECOG) scoring showed statistically significance higher performance status
      (lower numbers in the score) in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).

      Number of patients discharged on tramadol &amp; or Lyrica whom developed Post Mastectomy Pain
      syndrome (PMPs) is statically significant lower in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B
      (Control group).

    <description>relative frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes post breast surgeries with axillary dissection after preoperative ultrasound stellate ganglion block. This is accomplished using the grading system for neuropathic pain (GSNP),0: No Pain,1: Pain, 2: Possible neuropathic: Pain with (A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease AND Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible, 3: Pain Probable neuropathic: Positive sensory signs (allodynia, hyperalgesia, electric, burning, numbness, itching, maybe motor or autonomic changes) on the distribution of the injured nerves or beyond, 4: Pain Definitive neuropathic: diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system OR a surgeon's clear verification of an intraoperative nerve lesion (intercostobrachial in MRM with Axillary Evacuation in Breast Surgery)</description>

    <description>Using US with a linear array transduce, subfascial-C6- Stellate Ganglion Block. Patients will be supine with the neck slightly hyper- extended. After aseptic preparation of the skin, the transducer is placed on the neck to enable cross sectional visualization of anatomical structures at the level of C6. The carotid artery, internal jugular vein, thyroid gland, trachea, longus colli covered with the prevertebral fascia, root of C6, and transverse process of C6 are all visualized. The transducer will then gently be pressed between the carotid artery and trachea to retract the carotid artery laterally and to position the transducer close to the longus colli.
A 1.0-inch, 25-gauge long-bevel needle were paratracheal inserted toward the middle of the longus colli. The endpoint for injection were the ultrasound image demonstrating the tip of needle penetrating the prevertebral fascia in the longus colli. After negative aspiration, 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected</description>
