    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      andexanet in patients who require urgent surgery who have received 1 of the following FXa
      inhibitors: apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or enoxaparin. The start of surgery must be
      within 15 hours following the last dose of FXa inhibitor. The primary efficacy outcome will
      be adjudicated by an independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee.

             activity is necessary.

          -  Received 1 of the following FXa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or
             enoxaparin (dose of enoxaparin ≥ 1 mg/kg/d) within 15 hours prior to start of surgery.

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test documented prior to enrollment (for women of
             childbearing potential).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        If a patient meets any of the following criteria, he or she is not eligible to participate:

             bleeding is low.

          -  Acute life-threatening bleeding (ISTH criteria) at the time of Screening.

          -  Non-surgical interventional procedure or any surgical procedure requiring
             cardiopulmonary bypass, an intra-aortic catheter, or the intraoperative use of
             systemic, intravascular, unfractionated heparin.

          -  Recent history (within 30 days prior to Screening) of venous thromboembolism (VTE),

             traumatic coagulopathy; cerebrovascular accident; transient ischemic attack; unstable
             angina pectoris hospitalization; or severe peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, severe sepsis, septic shock, or
             hemorrhagic shock at the time of Screening.

          -  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 80,000/uL at the time of Screening.

          -  Inherited coagulopathy (e.g., anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, protein C/S
             deficiency, Factor V Leiden).

          -  Last dose of apixaban &lt; 2.5 mg, rivaroxaban &lt; 10 mg, edoxaban &lt; 30 mg, enoxaparin &lt; 40
