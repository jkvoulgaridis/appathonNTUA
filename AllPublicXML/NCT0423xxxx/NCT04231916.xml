  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brittle bone disease also known as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is characterised by a defect
      in the bone tissue that leads to recurrent fractures and significant bone deformities in
      children. These fractures include vertebral (spinal) fractures. As a result, child with OI
      require regular clinic surveillance that includes repeated xrays of the spine. in our pilot
      study the investigators plan to use a thermal imaging camera that can pick up changes in
      temperature to 0.03 degrees to determine whether the investigators can accurately identify
      vertebral fractures without the need for radiation. in the first part of the study the
      investigators will compare the thermal images from the camera with the xrays to see if the
      investigators can pick up the vertebral fractures seen on the xray picture. If this is
      possible, then the investigators will move on to phase 2 of the study which will investigate
      the ability of the thermal camera to pick up vertebral fractures without prior knowledge of
      where the fractures are located. If this approach is successful this will help us to develop
      a nonradiation, lowcost painless way of identifying vertebral fractures in children with OI.
