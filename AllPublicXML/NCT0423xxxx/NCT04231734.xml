  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm feasibility study to evaluate adherence to a ketogenic diet in patients
      with low tumor burden, treatment-naïve mantle cell lymphoma.

      Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility and baseline assessments prior to initiating the
      ketogenic diet during the screening period and/or prior to initiating the ketogenic diet on
      Day 1. Eligible subjects will receive study treatment which will consist of a daily ketogenic
      diet for up to 12 weeks (Day 1 through Day 84). Subjects will be monitored with weekly
      assessments of adherence to diet and effects on serum metabolic markers, tumor specimens, and
      body composition.

      After discontinuing the ketogenic diet, subjects will be followed for 28 days.
