  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perfusion strategies and aortic clamping techniques for right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve
      (MV) surgery have evolved over time and remarkable short- and long-term results have been
      re-ported. However, some concerns have emerged about the adequacy of myocardial protection
      dur-ing the minimally invasive approach and about the role of aortic clamping strategies in
      this contest.

      Aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, in terms of myocardial protection, of the
      en-do-aortic clamp (EAC) versus the trans-thoracic aortic clamp (TTC) in patients undergoing
      right mini-thoracotomy MV repair.

      A single center, prospective observational study was performed between June 2014 to June 2018
      on patients undergoing right mini-thoracotomy MV repair with retrograde arterial perfusion
      and EAC or TTC. The selection of one setting in respect to the other was patient orientated.
      Myocardial protection was assessed through creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and
      cardiac Troponin T (cTn-T) blood levels immediately after the surgical procedure and at 6,
      12, and 24 hours and compared between the two groups.
