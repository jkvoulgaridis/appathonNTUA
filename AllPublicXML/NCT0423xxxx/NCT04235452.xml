  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted on a series of patients with myoclonus to identify the
      electrophysiological characteristics and the anatomical classification of myoclonus of
      different causes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study included 50 patients with different types of myoclonus in comparison to 30
      control subjects. Electrophysiological study was done for all patients by Somatosensory
      Evoked Potential (SSEP) and Electroencephalography (EEG) while the control group underwent
      SSEP. SSEP was studied in the patients and control group by stimulation of right and left
      median nerves.

    <description>Stimulation of the right and left median nerves for each subject were carried out with electrical square wave pulses of 0.2 ms duration applied at a rate of 5 HZ. with cathode proximally. The intensity of the stimulus was adjusted to produce minimal twitches of the thumb (1-2 cm thumb movement). Five hundred (500) stimuli were delivered. The recording electrode picked up the responses. They were then summated and averaged.
The final evoked potential was then displayed on the screen. When two reproducible SEPs responses were obtained the data was accepted for analysis. The graph was printed out on paper, for the purpose of simplification only one response was printed out.</description>
