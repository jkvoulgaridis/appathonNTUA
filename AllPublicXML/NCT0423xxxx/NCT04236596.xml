  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to map the pudendal nerve. In this study the researchers will examine subjects
      who are already receiving an implanted stimulator at their pudendal nerve as part of their
      normal clinical care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pudendal nerve goes to the urethra, anus, and other areas of the pelvic floor. Electrical
      stimulation of this nerve can help with bladder problems and pelvic pain. Researchers do not
      understand how the nerve anatomy is different between people. Successfully mapping the
      pudendal nerve may help improve the medical care for future patients with bladder problems,
      pelvic pain, bowel problems, and sexual problems.

    <time_frame>Visit 2: Stage-1 (approximately 3 weeks after consent)</time_frame>
    <description>Selectivity Index (SI) will be calculated for each sensor recording from distal pudendal nerve branches. This includes sensors in the proximal urethra (proximal perineal branch - PPB), distal urethra (distal perineal branch - DPB), and anal electromyography (EMG) (ischeal rectal nerve - IRN).
The SI calculation may be modified in some patients, as necessary, for factors such as the presence of a short urethra that only allows for a single intraurethral pressure measure (female urethras &lt; male urethras) and/or the placement of EMG in the perineal floor between yields one or more additional sensors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically referred as having bladder problems that have not responded to conservative
             treatment. Normal clinical care includes referral to implant of Medtronic Interstim
             neurostimulator at the pudendal nerve. Fully eligible to receive an Interstim implant.

          -  Adult (18 or older), capable of providing own informed consent and communicating
             clearly with research team

          -  Capable of speaking, reading, and understanding English, as all study questionnaires
             are standardized assessments only available in English

          -  Capable of attending all experimental sessions (Visit 1: pre-stage-1 imaging, Visit 2:
             stage-1 surgery, Visit 3: CT after stage-2 surgery, Visit 3: cystometrogram test)

        Exclusion

          -  Implanted materials that prohibit magnetic imaging

          -  Any medical problems that prevent an individual from laying flat in an MRI or CT
             scanner, are are claustrophobic.

          -  Areflexive or atonic bladder

          -  Pregnant or planning to become pregnant. If a woman of child-bearing potential wishes
             to participate in this study, they will be pre-screened with a test to detect
             pregnancy.

          -  Diagnosed neurogenic bladder, pudendal nerve damage, lower motor dysfunction, or other
             conditions that would affect the neural circuits involved in micturition.

          -  Unwilling to allow de-identified data to be stored for future use or shared with other
             researchers.
