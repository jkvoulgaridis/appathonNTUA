  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of a range of doses of VE303 in
      healthy adult volunteers. The study also evaluated pharmacokinetics of intestinal
      colonization by the VE303 strains and pharmacodynamics of recovery of the gut microbiota
      after administration of antibiotics followed by a course of VE303.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VE303 is a rationally-defined bacterial consortium candidate being developed for the
      prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection. VE303 consists of 8 types of clonal human
      commensal bacteria strains selected for their ability to provide colonization resistance to
      C. difficile and manufactured under GMP conditions.

    <intervention_model_description>This Phase 1a/1b, first-in-human, open-label, single-center, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety and microbiota changes induced by ingestion of VE303 following administration of oral vancomycin and VE303 administered without vancomycin pre-treatment in healthy adult subjects. Approximately 48 subjects are anticipated for enrollment, unless intermediate cohorts are required, in which case, up to an additional 18 subjects (for a total of approximately 66 subjects) may be enrolled.</intervention_model_description>
