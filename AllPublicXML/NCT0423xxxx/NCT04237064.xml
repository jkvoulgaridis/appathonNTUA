    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Stenotic carotid arteries can lead
      to stroke if the cause of the stenosis is a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Recent studies
      reveal that if a patient has a plaque in the carotid artery it is highly probable that he/she
      will develop plaques in other superficial arteries like the femoral artery. Currently, duplex
      ultrasound is used to determine the grade of stenosis and is the main criterion for
      intervention (endarterectomy) planning. However, the stability, or instability of the plaque
      cannot be determined non-invasively. Photoacoustics is a novel, non-invasive imaging modality
      that uses pulsed laser light to generate laser induced ultrasound in the absorbing region of
      the tissue. Photoacoustic imaging provides optical contrast of biological tissue chromophores
      with an acoustic resolution and imaging depth, which is promising for visualization of plaque
      composition. The advantage of photoacoustics is the use of multiple wavelengths, since
      different tissues respond differently to different wavelengths. Hence, non-invasive, in vivo,
      morphology assessment is a future application of this new modality that would improve
      diagnosis and clinical decision making. The drawback is the limited penetration depth of the
      laser light and the signals generated by surrounding tissue.

      A new, integrated photoacoustic device has been developed that meets all safety requirements
      and has an improved penetration depth, suitable for imaging of carotid arteries with the aim
      to distinguish between plaques with different morphology.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of atherosclerotic plaque
      imaging using multispectral photoacoustic imaging.

      Study design: This is a pilot study where 60 patients with a plaque in one of the carotids,
      scheduled for an endarterectomy procedure, will be included. Each subject will get a
      multi-wavelength photoacoustic examination of the carotid plaque. In one group (N = 30),
      photoacoustic imaging will be performed noninvasively at the TU/e laser lab, which is
      compliant with laser safety standards, to verify non-invasive, multi-angle, multi-wavelength
      photoacoustic imaging (Study A). In the second group (N = 30), photoacoustic imaging will be
      performed pre- and per-operatively (Study B) prior to plaque removal. Here, to ensure a 100%
      (laser) safe environment, all acquisitions will be performed in the operating theatre. The
      latter group will be subjected to additional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for validation. After
      carotid endarterectomie the plaque sample of each patient (Study A and B) will be transported
      to TU/e for in vitro PA scanning and histology analysis.

      Study population: A total of 60 patients with carotid artery disease scheduled for
      endarterectomy (stenosis grade of &gt; 70% and &lt; 99%).

      Intervention (if applicable): endarterectomy (following normal procedure), with an additional
      photoacoustic image acquisition after incision, before removal of the plaque.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The acoustic (i.e., echographic) and photoacoustic images
      will be analyzed to determine the ability of distinguishing between different plaque
      components (intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid pool, vessel wall), examine penetration depth,
      resolution, and contrast.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must be an adult that is
        fully competent to give informed consent that has been under surveillance for a plaque in
        one of the carotid arteries with a stenosis grade between 70 and 99% (based on prior Duplex
        US examination in the vascular lab) In case of study A, the subject should physically be
        able to be seated in a chair without moving for 10 to 20 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Minors or incapacitated adults will not be included in the study. Subjects that do not want
        to participate will also not be included. -
