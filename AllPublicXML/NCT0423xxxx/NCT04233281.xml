    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions with
      a minimum of 1 week between visits. During each visit, participants will receive a
      carbohydrate rich test-meal with Kori-tofu (protein) or whey protein. The two meals will be
      given in randomized order and blood will be collected via a catheter before and up to 3 hours
      after consumption of the test-meal. Study participants will also wear continuous glucose
      meters during the trial. They will receive a standardized evening meal prior to each study
      day and are asked not to drink alcohol or perform heavy exercise the day before. After each
      test day participants are offered a meal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several types of tofu, an example of a specific type of tofu is called Kori-tofu.
      Kori-tofu literally means frozen tofu. The production process of Kori-tofu leads to the
      formation of a higher high molecular weight fraction (HMF) content of the soy proteins.
      Several clinical studies describe the effects of Kofi-tofu on health. In this study, the aim
      is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial blood glucose concentrations
      in participants with an impaired glucose tolerance.

      The primary objective is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial blood
      glucose concentrations, when administered as a part of an ordinary high carbohydrate meal.
      The secondary objective is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial
      insulin concentrations.

      The study is a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions.
      Subjects will receive two different carbohydrate-rich meals, either with added Kori-tofu or
      whey protein, with a washout period of one week. Blood will be collected via a catheter
      before and up-to 3 hours after consumption of the test-meal.
