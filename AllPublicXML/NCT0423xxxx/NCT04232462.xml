      Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment play an important role in the discovery and treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases.With the rapid increase in the number of endoscopies, the workload
      of endoscopists increases further.The high workload reduces the quality of endoscopy, leading
      to incomplete coverage and incomplete detection of lesions.With the rapid increase in the
      number of endoscopies, the workload of endoscopists increases further.The high workload
      reduces the quality of endoscopy, leading to incomplete coverage and incomplete detection of
      lesions.Therefore, carrying out deep learning and other artificial intelligence methods has
      good academic research and practical value for improving the quality of endoscopic diagnosis
      and treatment.The research and development, testing and functional evaluation of artificial
      intelligence devices need to use a large number of endoscopic images, and at the same time,
      the effectiveness and safety of artificial intelligence devices need to be verified in
      different hospitals and environments.Based on this, our research group intends to collect
      endoscopic image data from different hospitals for training and validation of the model.

    <description>Calculate the sensitivity of AI's judgment on images and videos. Sensitivity is : in the sample that is positive actually, the proportion that judges to be positive (for example, in the person that is really sick, be judged to be the proportion that is sick by the hospital), computation way is the ratio that true positive divides true positive add false negative (be positive actually, but judge is negative).</description>

    <description>Calculate the specificity of AI's judgment on images and videos. Specificity is : in the samples that are actually negative, the proportion of those that are judged negative (for example, the proportion of those who are not actually ill, who are judged by the hospital to be not ill) is calculated as the ratio of true negative divided by true negative + false positive (actually negative, but judged positive).</description>

    <description>Definition 1:The subject's operating characteristic curve is a coordinate graph composed of false positive rate as the horizontal axis and true positive rate as the vertical axis, and the curve drawn by the subject under specific stimulus conditions due to the different judgment criteria.
Definition 2:ROC curves were created by plotting the proportion of true positive cases (sensitivity) against the proportion of false positive cases (1-specificity), by varying the predictive probability threshold.</description>
