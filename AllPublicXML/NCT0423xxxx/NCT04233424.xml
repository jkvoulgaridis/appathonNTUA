      Phase III, Prospective, Multinational, Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Two-arm, Double
      Blind Study to assess Efficacy and Safety of D-PLEX Administered Concomitantly with the
      Standard of Care (SoC), compared to a SoC treated control arm, in prevention of post
      abdominal surgery incisional infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      D-PLEX is a new formulation of extended controlled release of Doxycycline in the applied area
      for about 30 days. This study is aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of D-PLEX in
      prevention of post abdominal surgery incisional infection.

      The study population includes male and female, 18 years old and above at screening,
      undergoing an elective colorectal surgery involving resection, with or without a stoma, that
      includes at least 1 incision that is &gt; 10 cm (target incision). Eligible and willing subjects
      will be randomly allocated into 2 blinded study arms D-PLEX with SOC or SOC alone.

      D-PLEX will be applied during the surgery at the final stage of incision closure. All
      patients will be followed up for additional 5 visits over 2 months, for safety and incisional
      wound assessment. This will include blood tests for hematology and chemistry well as
      physicians assessment of the incisional wound.

    <masking_description>This is a double-blind clinical trial. The sponsor, the subjects, outcomes assessor and all staff involved in the collection and recording of the clinical and laboratory data, based on which the independent adjudication committee will perform their assessment, will be blind to treatment assignment. In addition, all aspects of data management and clean-up will be done in blinded datasets.
The study site personnel, who perform the index surgery (Operation room staff), will be trained not to disclose the treatment arm to the blinded Investigator, to the subject, his/her family, to other health care providers not present during the surgery or to the study Sponsor representatives. Wound assessment throughout the study follow-up visits will be done by a blinded Investigator, that will not be involved in the surgery. An emergency card containing the Study Name, NIH number, Center Name/number, PI's name and contact details will be provided to the subjects. S</masking_description>

    <description>D-PLEX is a new formulation of extended release of Doxycycline. Each 5g D-PLEX vial contains 54.6mg Doxycycline free base (1.09%), which is equivalent to 63mg Doxycycline hyclate (1.26%). D-PLEX is supplied as a sterile powder to be reconstituted to paste in the operating room, using standard aseptic techniques and is intended for single administration. The non-active components of the extended release antibiotic formulation are Î² Tri-Calcium polymer and a lipid matrix. All formulation components are biodegradable.</description>
