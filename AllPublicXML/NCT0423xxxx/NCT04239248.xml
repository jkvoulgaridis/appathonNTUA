  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of multiple novel medications, many patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      fail to achieve mucosal healing (MH). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been shown to
      induce clinical remission accompanied by MH in many of CD patients. The aim of this proposal
      is to explore the effectiveness of the &quot;Tasty&amp;Healthy&quot; dietary approach based on avoiding
      &quot;pro-inflammatory&quot; and processed ingredients, for inducing and maintaining remission and MH
      in children and young adults. This approach is based on the previously published charity
      cook-book &quot;Tasty&amp;Healthy&quot; and might be more feasible than currently available nutritional
      treatments in CD. It does not offer a rigid diet with specific nutrients and does not require
      concurrent use of a formula feed.

      The investigators hypothesize that a flexible dietary intervention of excluding processed and
      pro-inflammatory ingredients will improve the rate of clinical remission and MH without the
      need for liquid formula or structured rigid diet which are more difficult to adhere to. The
      investigators also hypothesize that home kits of FC, can personalize the diet thereby
      increasing feasibility for maintenance therapy in some patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a set of three studies: Two randomized controlled trials
      both including the Tasty&amp;Healthy dietary intervention for 8 weeks in CD patients aged 6-24
      years vs. 1) EEN in mild-moderate CD, and the other RCT vs. 2) a control group continuing
      their habitual diet in those with mucosal inflammation despite stable medical treatment, but
      who are in clinical remission or have only minimal symptoms not requiring immediate
      treatment.

      As a third study, responders from both trials will be offered to participate in an open label
      extension personalized-diet study of further 16 weeks (total 24 weeks), in which gluten and
      dairy will be gradually re-introduced based on repeated monthly home assays of fecal
      calprotectin (FC) while otherwise following the Tasty&amp;Healthy dietary intervention in a
      treat-to-target management approach.

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline, week 4 and week 8 with additional weekly phone visits
      to ensure adherence with the diets and address questions.

      The extension study will include two clinic visits at weeks 16 and 24 and a monthly call to
      ensure adherence.

      The investigators hope to establish a dietary-approach which is simpler to implement than
      current nutritional alternatives. It will enable high flexibility in the allowed foods and
      does not require liquid formula. In turn, this could position Tasty&amp;Healthy, not merely for
      inducing remission, but also as a feasible maintenance strategy in selected patients.

Intolerance: cessation of dietary therapy because of patient's refusal to continue diet (based on reporting and the 24 hour recall);
Poor adherence based on the modified Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) questionnaire; The modified MARS questionnaire rates How closely patients adhere to the diet. This is a self-report measure of adherence. It can be used to determine patients' willingness and ability to comply with the diet daily. A score of 1-5 indicates that the patient is not adherent; a score of 6-9 indicates that the patient is adherent.
Poor adherence based on direct questioning (any answer other than &quot;adheres to diet very often/always&quot; will be considered poor compliant).</description>
