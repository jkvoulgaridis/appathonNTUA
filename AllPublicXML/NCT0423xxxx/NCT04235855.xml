      In this study, we aim to evaluate the tissue adequacy of EUS guided liver biopsy for
      parenchymal liver disease and to evaluate if diagnostic yield of left lobe is non-inferior to
      right lobe biopsies and to assess if combination biopsies have better yield than single lobe
      biopsies. Safety of the procedure and technical success would be noted.

      The data would be analysed using SPSS software and needful variables and tests would be used
      as per statistical requirement.
