  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition, which is generally more pronounced for
      solid tumours (upper digestive tract, Ear Nose and Throat (ENT), bronchial tubes). This
      undernutrition leads to major weight loss and cachexia, and may represent the first sign of a
      call for a diagnosis of cancer. Cancer-related undernutrition is multi-factorial origins and
      has multiple consequences.

      Chemotherapy treatments can induce various adverse effects in patients, including sensory
      disturbances at the beginning of treatment in addition to disturbances that may already be
      present before any treatment. The alteration of taste and odour, observed in 86% of patients,
      can induce a change in food preferences, promote the development of aversions, and therefore,
      lead to a significant reduction in the pleasure of eating. Loss of appetite, decreased food
      intake and the development of aversions to certain foods are situations experienced by a
      large proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy.

      The assessment of taste disorders in patients treated with chemotherapy is established
      through the use of questionnaires, interviews and taste tests.

      Changes in the perception and identification of salty, sweet, bitter and sour flavours are
      common in patients treated with chemotherapy.

      As regards food products, patients report developing olfactory hypersensitivity mainly for
      food of animal origin, in particular for odours of fish, frying, cheese and eggs.

      The CANUT project aims to study the effect of pathology and chemotherapy on gustatory and
      olfactory mechanisms, and in particular on interindividual differences in the perception and
      appreciation of food.

      In order to monitor the evolution of patients' eating habits over time, the diet-related
      quality of life questionnaire (CANUT-QVA) was constructed from items selected from the
      Well-being related to Food questionnaire (WELLBFQ) after eliminating questions that were too
      general or expressed in terms of importance to use perception-related responses as a
      priority.

      After this part, an evaluation of the 9 dimensions of the CANUT-QVA questionnaire will be
      performed.

    <description>Evaluation of the contribution of a new questionnaire by patients with solid or hematological cancer according to 9 dimensions:
Making food
Place where the meals are eaten
Eating and drinking: Nutrition
Eating and drinking: The pleasure of tasting, chewing
Eating and drinking: Satiated, well being
Food preparation: Supply, choice, presentation
Eating and drinking: Feelings
After eating: heaviness, discomfort, hunger
Taste/Odour Problems to confirm the number and structure of factors obtained at the end of the pre-study and to remove redundant questions.</description>
