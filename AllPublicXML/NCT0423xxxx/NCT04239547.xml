  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe the effect of respiratory recruitment maneuver on
      intraoperative ventilatory parameters and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients
      over 18 years scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients over 18 years who are scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy volunteering to
      participate in our study will receive anesthesia induction with one of our standard general
      anesthesia protocols. After intubation recruitment maneuver will be applied to the study
      group. General anesthesia and mechanical ventilation will be continued and completed
      according to our standard practice without any further intervention. Throughout the
      intraoperative period respiratory and haemodynamic parameters including compliance, airway
      resistance, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oxymetry, blood gas analysis, the
      applied inhalational anesthetic agent, minimum alveolar concentration, expiratory agent
      concentration and total agent consumption will be recorded. At the end of the operation
      anesthesia will be terminated and patients will be transferred to postanesthesia care unit
      (recovery unit after recovery and further discharged from to the ward when their Aldrete
      score is &gt;8. The patients will be examined for respiratory complications on postoperative day
      1, and will be followed up by telephone on day 5.
