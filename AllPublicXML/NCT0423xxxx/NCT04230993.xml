  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the effect of nasal washing on nasal discharge and nasal
      congestion during treatment after 3 days of use.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main endpoint is a symptom score derived from the Jackson scale: sum of 2 items relating
      to runny nose and nasal congestion (stuffy nose), with ratings of 0 to 3 for each (0: absent
      ; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe).
