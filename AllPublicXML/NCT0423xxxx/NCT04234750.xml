    <textblock>
      Skin grafting is a standard treatment for deep wounds, but care of the donor site after
      transplantation is very important. The means of accelerating wound healing can increase
      overall patient satisfaction. In recent years, cytokine therapy has been an important
      strategy to promote tissue repair.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been considered the star
      cells that promote tissue repair. It works mainly through paracrine. Many biological
      effectors, including IGF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-β1, and hepatocyte
      growth factor (HGF), have been found and reported in various MSC conditioned media (MSC-CM),
      And play a role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration. In here, we aim to explore the
      MSC-CM-derived pleiotropic factor in treating donor sites and further evaluate its safety and
      effectiveness

    <description>After the patient is enrolled, when the patient's condition is stable, he is ready to undergo skin transplantation. For the donor site, an electric dermatome was used to remove the skin. The two donor areas of the same patient were divided into a pleiotropic factor group and a blank group randomly. After placing a coarse mesh vaseline oil gauze, then cover a certain thickness of sterile gauze and pressure bandage.</description>
