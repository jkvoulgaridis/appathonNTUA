  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D), hypoglycemia limits the ability to manage diabetes
      and adopt optimal health behaviours. Possibly because of low level of confidence and low
      access to continuing medical education, there are evidences that some healthcare teams are
      not proposing new therapeutic and technology options that have the potential to reduce
      hypoglycemia for PWT1D. In practice, patients report receiving education related to insulin
      pumps usage mainly on key functions (how the device works) at initiation and not enough about
      proactive adjustments (how to optimally use the device) especially on the long-term. We
      observed that patients are reactive (e.g., correction insulin bolus or temporary basal
      suspension) to their data, rather than proactive (e.g., basal and bolus adjustments). In
      brief, short-term education is technical and product-specific, rather than being based on
      patients' needs.There is a need to test the efficacy of different program that may be more
      suited to patients' needs and desires while offering the opportunity to reduce costs (e.g.
      web based). Since there is a lack of expertise related to optimal use of new technologies and
      therapies for PWT1D, we propose to design an test a web-based training (e.g. courses
      including videos and quizzes) and support (e.g. forum) platform focusing on the reduction of
      hypoglycemia. This will be tested through a registry-based controlled trial. We hypothesize
      that our training and support program targeting optimization of new technologies and
      therapeutic options will reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia by 25% or the self-reported
      level of fear of hypoglycemia by 15% after 6 months compared to the baseline.

    <intervention_name>SUPPORT online platform for people with type 1 diabetes</intervention_name>
    <description>This bilingual (English, French) training platform is accessible with an internet connection. Participants' learning is individualized depending on the way they take their insulin (injection or pump) and the way they measure their blood sugar (finger prick or continuous glucose monitoring).
The training program starts with mandatory module on hypoglycemia. Once completed, participants will unlock all level 1 modules from the 6 categories (medication, blood sugar monitoring, nutrition, physical activity, hypo- and hyperglycemia, health and other situations). There are 3 levels of complexity. The platform contains functionalities such as reminder emails, discussion forum, quizzes, videos, downloadable forms, etc.
Questionnaires will be sent by email (baseline, 6 months and 12 months) to collect information on hypoglycemia fear and frequency, diabetes knowledge, health literacy and platform evaluation and to include questions that are not included in the registry.</description>
