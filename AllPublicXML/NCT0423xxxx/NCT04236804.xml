    <textblock>
      The program, called TMC-CP01, will use a combination of virtual reality, biofeedback, and
      psychological exercises to manage pain associated with Chronic Low Back Pain. Chronic pain
      affects an estimated 100 million Americans, around one-third of the U.S. population. One of
      the most prevalent conditions under chronic pain is Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP). About 27%
      of chronic pain patients experience CLBP. It is the leading cause of disability in the world
      and 31 million Americans suffer from CLBP. The most common analgesic tool for pain patients,
      especially for LBP patients, is opioids. However, opioid users are subject to drug tolerance
      and physical dependence, which decreases efficacy and increases risk of complication.
      Long-term users often require doses up to ten times their original dose to achieve equivalent
      analgesia and, after months of exposure, patients' risk of addiction increases.

      This project aims to introduce a digital intervention to standard CLBP management with a
      virtual reality-enabled pain management system that will increase pain management and
      decrease daily dosages of opioids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMC-CP01 is a treatment based on the VANISH (Virtual Autonomic Neuromodulation Induced
      Systemic Healing) system and method, which combines existing technologies and therapies into
      Virtual Reality (VR) to help people learn to auto-regulate the way their body feels. TMC-CP01
      is designed specifically for pain management and is tailored for low back pain. The treatment
      utilizes virtual reality and biofeedback to train patients to auto-regulate themselves and
      improve their pain over time. By providing patients an accessible and effective alternative
      pain management tool, patients can avoid opioid use, dependency, and resulting complications
      due to opioids. TMC-CP01 uses virtual reality as a platform to enable and optimize
      biofeedback training and psychological exercises.

      Virtual Reality, alone is a proven method for pain management both through distraction and
      through active pain control mechanisms. Due to its stimulating nature, VR has the power to
      claim the majority of a user's attention and distract them from other stimuli such as pain.
      Because it is so visually engaging, VR is a powerful tool for visualization, which can be
      used to optimize and enhance visualization of biofeedback. VR can also affect users' emotions
      and perception by providing a sense of presence and psychological engagement. With recent
      developments in portable head mounted display (HMD) technology, VR has become accessible to
      people on a much broader and more affordable scale and it represents an ideal platform to
      develop a non-invasive pain management tool for chronic pain. Biofeedback is at the heart of
      TMC-CP01 and is the main mechanism by which patients learn to control their physiology. By
      allowing patients to visualize their physiological processes, patients gain a greater
      mind-body awareness and can learn to auto-regulate physiological functions that previously
      seemed out of their control.

    <measure>Flowly (TMC-CP01) virtual reality intervention feasibility via Change From Baseline in Heart Rate Variability at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility outcomes of the Flowly (TMC-CP01) virtual reality treatment intervention will be measured by conforming respiration and heart rate to optimal breathing patterns. The games are designed to guide subjects' physiology to a more optimal state for pain reduction using biofeedback. Resonant breathing is breathing that activates the coordinated function of oscillating body systems. This breathing increases your Heart Rate Variability. Greater Heart Rate Variability (a higher HRV score) at rest indicates better outcomes. Outcomes will be measured over the span of the study and compared between the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Depression level before vs after intervention via Flowly app</measure>
    <time_frame>daily, up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will rate their current depression level on the Flowly app on a 0-10 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with 0 being the least depression and 10 being the worst depression before vs after each VR treatment. Lower scores after intervention compared to before intervention indicate better outcomes. Outcomes will be measured over the span of the study and compared between the two groups.</description>
