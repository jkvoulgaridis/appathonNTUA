  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate patient adherence and completeness of intake and voiding
      diaries. The secondary goal is to compare the satisfaction and understanding of patients of
      the intake and voiding trial diaries directions.

      This is a randomized prospective study. All women who need to complete an intake and voiding
      diary at the Yale Urogynecology outpatient facilities will be invited to participate. After
      completion of the consent process, they will be randomized to one of two groups. Both groups
      will have their voiding diaries analyzed by three blinded experts and will be graded on
      completeness of the information filled out. The mean grade obtained from this process and the
      return rate of the voiding diaries will be the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes will
      include a brief patient questionnaire on their satisfaction of the instructions with the
      voiding diary. The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated between the groups to
      determine the effectiveness of the video intervention.

    <description>Voiding diaries will be evaluated by 3 blinded experts for completeness. The average of these 3 grades will be used to evaluate the intervention compared to the usual care group. Data entries can either be a void, leak, or fluid intake. Each data entry will be identified as either a leak, void, or fluid intake and then given a score based on completeness. Then these scores will be averaged with all the same type of entries per day and totaled, for a maximum total per day of 9. The maximum score is 9. A higher score means that the diary is determined to be more complete. The lowest score is 0, meaning the voiding diary was not complete. Each of the three days will then be averaged giving a final quality score for the returned voiding diary.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction: questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>A qualitative measure developed for the study will be used to assess the patient satisfaction. It consists of 4 questions, 1 Likert and 3 Yes/No questions. Each of these questions will be compared between the 2 groups. The questions are:
I was satisfied with the instructions given to me about how to complete a bladder diary (likert).
I understood the instructions about how to complete a bladder diary Yes/No
I referred back to my written instructions after I left the office Yes/No.
I referred to my video instructions after I left the office yes/ no</description>
