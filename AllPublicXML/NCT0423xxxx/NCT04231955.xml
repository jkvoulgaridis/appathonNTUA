  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic teeth who applied endodontic clinic between April 2019 and December
      2019 for root canal treatment were enrolled in this study. All patients were asked to fill
      four different rating scales: numerical rating scale, visual analogue scale, color analogue
      scale and faces rating scale for their relevant tooth which is symptomatic and need of root
      canal treatment. The four scales were then compared statistically.

      50 patients who applied endodontic clinic between April 2019 and December 2019 and had
      symptomatic teeth which were in need of root canal treatment were enrolled for this study.
      Study detail were explained to all patients and they were then kindly asked to signed a
      consent form. All patients diagnose, age, gender, tooth number were recorded. Patients were
      then asked to fill four different pain rating scale in an electronic pain rating scale
      program. Numerical rating scale (NRS) was a scale between &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot;, with &quot;0&quot; indicating
      no pain while &quot;10&quot; indicating worst pain possible. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was a straight
      line of 10 cm with one end of the line indicated no pain whilst the other end indicated worst
      pain possible. Color analogue scale (CAS) was the same length of straight line as in VAS with
      a color change towards to worst pain possible end. Faces rating scale (FRS) consisted of six
      different faces indicating the level of pain with the first face indicated no pain while the
      last face indicated worst pain possible. After the patients marked their pain intensity
      levels in all four scales the results were statistically analyzed to compared the accuracy of
      four scales with VAS being the golden standard.
