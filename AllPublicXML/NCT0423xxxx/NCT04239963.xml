  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a subanesthetic dose
      of ketamine 24-hour post-injection on resting state functional connectivity, cognitive
      control, and reward learning.

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) will
      be recruited from McLean's Ketamine clinic. Suitability for Ketamine treatment will be
      determined as typically done by the service - through evaluation by the clinicians on the
      staff of the Ketamine Service who perform psychiatric consultations and assessments for
      Ketamine suitability. Potential subjects will be informed about the study only after they
      have received a positive consultation at the clinic and have already agreed to receive the
      treatment.

      This study consists of a set of questionnaires, urine drug screen, and electroencephalogram
      (EEG) recordings.

        We plan to recruit 30 TRD individuals with current MDD without psychotic features and 30
        demographically matched healthy controls. All participants will be ketamine-naïve.
