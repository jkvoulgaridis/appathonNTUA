    <textblock>
      This study is randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study aimed to assess the
      safety and efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of oral AZD4831
      in healthy Japanese and Chinese volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose
      sequential-group study, in healthy Japanese and Chinese subjects (males) aged 18-50 years and
      will be conducted at a single study center. Four cohorts are planned, but one additional
      cohort may be enrolled based on Safety Review Committee (SRC) decision.

      The 5 multiple dose levels are planned as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: Dose 1 (starting dose).

        -  Cohort 2: Dose 2 (provisional dose).

        -  Cohort 3: Dose 3 (provisional dose).

        -  Cohort 4: Dose 4 (provisional dose)

        -  Cohort 5 (optional): Dose 5 (provisional dose)

      A randomization ratio of 3:1 (AZD4831 versus placebo) will be used.

      For each cohort the study will comprise:

        -  Screening Period of a maximum of 28 days.

        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects are resident in the study center from the day
           before first dosing with the Investigational Medicinal Product (Day -1) until at least
           48 hours after last dosing on Day 10; subjects will be discharged on Day 12.

        -  Three Follow-up Visits on Day 14, Day 16 (±1 day) and Day 20 (±1 day).

        -  A Final Follow-up Visit on Day 24 (±2 days).

      Each subject will be involved in the study for 8 to 9 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose sequential-group study, in healthy Japanese and Chinese subjects (males), conducted at a single study center. Up to 40 healthy male subjects aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive) are planned to be investigated in 4 cohorts, but up to 5 cohorts may be included if the Safety Review Committee (SRC) considers it necessary to repeat a dose level or if additional dose levels are required.
Up to 8 subjects will participate in each cohort. Within each cohort 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive AZD4831 and 2 subjects to receive placebo. AZD4831 or placebo will be administered once daily for a period of 10 days. It is anticipated this will be sufficient to achieve and maintain steady state pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for several days, permitting evaluation of the safety and tolerability of multiple dose. The subjects will stay at the study center during the whole dosing period and until 48 hours.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study is single-blind with regards to treatment (AZD4831 or placebo) at each dose level. AZD4831 and placebo will be matched for appearance and amount.

          -  Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks
             prior to the first administration of IMP.

          -  Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication including antacids, analgesics
             (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, mega-dose vitamins (intake of
             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to
             the first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long half-life.

          -  Plasma donation within 1 month of Screening or any blood donation/blood loss &gt; 500 mL
             during the 3 months before Screening.

          -  Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of IMP in this
             study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after
             the last visit whichever is the longest.Subjects consented and screened, but not
             randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not excluded.

          -  Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.

          -  Involvement of any Astra Zeneca, Parexel or study site employee or their close
             relatives.

          -  Judgement by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the Screening Period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

          -  Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions, or any other dietary
             restrictions.

          -  Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator.
