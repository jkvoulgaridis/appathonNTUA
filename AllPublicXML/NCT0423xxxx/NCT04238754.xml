  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the safety of the cannabinoid cannabidiol (Epidiolex) in a
      human laboratory model of clinically relevant withdrawal. The study will be a residential
      within-subject comparison; all participants will receive placebo dosing and active
      cannabidiol. Results may be used to support an R01 grant application to more closely examine
      this hypothesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on preclinical research and emerging human research, cannabidiol (CBD; a major
      constituent of the cannabis plant) is a promising pharmacotherapy for the treatment of opioid
      withdrawal. Most recently, CBD decreased cue-induced craving and anxiety (two common
      withdrawal symptoms) among abstinent heroin-dependent individuals relative to placebo. As of
      June 2018, Epidiolex, an oral formulation of plant-derived pure CBD, has been approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating severe forms of epilepsy and can be
      prescribed for other off-label indications. Epidiolex has a low side effect and high safety
      profile. Given the recent FDA approval of Epidiolex, and a growing interest to develop
      existing pharmaceuticals to address issues related to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and its
      recovery, the investigators are proposing a pilot study to examine the safety of Epidiolex in
      a human laboratory model of clinically relevant withdrawal. The study will be a residential
      within-subject comparison; methadone-maintained participants will undergo spontaneous
      withdrawal and receive placebo dosing and active cannabidiol. Data collected for this study
      will establish: (1) the safety of administering two dosing regimens of Epidiolex within the
      investigators' withdrawal paradigm and (2) the feasibility of the investigators' withdrawal
      paradigm for demonstrating clinically meaningful increases in withdrawal. Results may be used
      to support an R01 grant application to more closely examine this hypothesis.

    <measure>Feasibility of Spontaneous Withdrawal Model as assessed by change in withdrawal scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 57-hour residential session when Epidiolex is received</time_frame>
    <description>Change in withdrawal scores during laboratory evaluation of spontaneous withdrawal. Withdrawal is measured with the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS). That has a range of 0-64 where a mild score is represented by a score of 1-10, a moderate score is represented by a score of 11-20 and a severe score is considered anything greater than 21.</description>

    <time_frame>57-hour residential session</time_frame>
    <description>Withdrawal symptom suppression during active and placebo conditions. Area Under the Curve (AUC) analyses will be calculated to characterize withdrawal (SOWS) scores across time. SOWS AUC will be compared between the two conditions. AUC will range from 0 to 3072 where 0 represents no withdrawal during study drug administration and 3072 represents the most severe withdrawal during study drug administration.</description>
