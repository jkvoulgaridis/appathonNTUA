    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to evaluate efficacy and safety of silicone cream
      containing Allium Cepa extract in post-cesarean surgical scars treatment. Post-cesarean
      surgical scars were equally seperated into 2 parts (left part and right part). Silicone cream
      containing Allium Cepa extract or commercial scar gel was ramdomly assigned to apply on left
      part or right part of the scar. They will be applied 2 times per day (morning and evening)
      for 3 months. Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) , Vancouver scar scale
      (VSS), melanin index, and erythema index (using cutometer) were used for scar evaluation at
      0, 1,2,and 3 months. Moreover, adverse effects were also observed.
