  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to compare two different levels of cultural adaptation of an Internet- and
      mobile-based intervention for the treatment of depression called Hap-pas-Hapi among
      Albanian-speaking immigrants in Switzerland and Germany. One arm will include the generic
      (minimally adapted) version of Hap-pas Hapi. The other arm will include a version of
      Hap-pas-Hapi that was adapted to the target population's cultural concepts of distress. Both
      versions include five sessions and the same therapeutic techniques.

    <description>For the experimental intervention, Hap-pas-Hapi was adapted to Albanian immigrants' cultural concepts of distress (CCD). An ethnopsychological study was conducted for this purpose, since evidence on CCD in South Eastern Europe is scarce. Based on this study, three deep-structure adaptations were done: i) the symptom narrative provided by the narrator in the app was re-written to reflect Albanian immigrants' CCD; ii) a new explanatory model builder was implemented to address the target group's fatalistic beliefs; and iii) a goal-setting task was programmed to address the target group's socio-centric notion of the self.</description>

    <description>Hap-pas-Hapi is a Smartphone-based intervention for the treatment of psychological distress. It includes five sessions and uses a narrative approach. Behavioural activation is the main active therapeutic agent in the intervention, along with stress management, positive self-talk, mood tracking, social support, and relapse prevention.</description>
