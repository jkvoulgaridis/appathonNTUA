  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to develop and validate a noninvasive approach for quantifying and
      imaging energy metabolism, without contrast agents, on widely available clinical MRI
      scanners. Briefly, this technique allows specific and selective imaging of the energy
      metabolite phosphocreatine (PCr), in vivo and non-invasively. PCr is one of the predominant
      high-energy phosphates present in brain and muscle and one that is altered by common
      diseases. Although energy metabolism and PCr play a vital role in cellular homeostasis, there
      currently are no routine diagnostic tests to noninvasively quantify or map the distribution
      of PCr with clinically acceptable spatial resolution or/and scan time. Here, we demonstrate
      that the exchangeable guanidinium protons of millimolar concentration PCr can be exploited to
      detect it via the water signal in MRI with greatly enhanced sensitivity (molar signal) using
      chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, and its concentration can be quantified
      using an artificial neural network (ANN). This new technique, dubbed ANNCEST, allowed us to
      obtain a high-resolution PCr map on human skeletal muscle within 1.5 min, on a 3T clinical
      MRI scanner equipped with just the standard MRI setup. To put this in a larger perspective,
      energy metabolism is critical for cell viability and is altered by many common acquired and
      inherited diseases. ANNCEST is arguably the first to use widely available MRI scanners to
      noninvasively image tissue energy metabolism of PCr, and thus would have appeal to a broad
      readership of scientists and clinicians interested in neurology, muscular dystrophies and
      myopathies as well as cardiology, to name a few.
