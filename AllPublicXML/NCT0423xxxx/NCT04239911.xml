  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention among home
      health aides caring for adults discharged home after a heart failure hospitalization at
      VNSNY's Partners in Care (home care agency). The study will examine the interventions' effect
      on home health aides' heart failure knowledge and confidence caring for adults with heart
      failure, as well as on the client's overall health (visits to the emergency department and
      hospital readmissions).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's central hypothesis is that an intervention that can optimize and improve
      the experience of home health aides caring for the heart failure patients has the potential
      to improve home health aides' own self-efficacy, heart failure knowledge, and also patient
      outcomes. The intervention for home health aides is comprised of a) classroom education on
      heart failure and b) an electronic tablet containing heart failure educational content and a
      messaging application that connects home health aides and their nurse supervisors. This
      intervention requires feasibility and acceptability testing, as well as preliminary testing
      of its effectiveness among home health aides caring for community-dwelling adults with heart
      failure.

    <intervention_model_description>104 home health aides will be recruited from VNSNY and randomized to either enhanced usual care arm (heart failure training course; n = 52) or the intervention (heart failure training course plus tablet; n =52). Four nurses will also be recruited to the study. The total duration of each home health aides' involvement will be 90 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (0 days) and at follow-up (90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scale, scores range from 0-15; higher scores indicate greater heart failure knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Change in Heart Failure Caregiving Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 days) and at follow-up (90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care in Heart Failure Index, which is a 22-item scale which assesses maintenance, management, and self-efficacy sub-scales separately. Each sub-scale score ranges from 0-100, with greater scores indicating greater contribution to care or self-efficacy. Scores &lt; 70 are considered poor or inadequate.</description>
