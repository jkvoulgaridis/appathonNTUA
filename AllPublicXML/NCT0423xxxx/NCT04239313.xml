    <textblock>
      Single-center, single-dose, placebo-controlled, open-label trials were used to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of low-dose adjuvants and low-dose vaccines in the upper arm
      deltoid muscle intramuscularly in the double negative population. Thirty (PPD-QFT-) healthy
      adult subjects aged 18-45 were selected and divided into placebo group, low-dose adjuvant
      group, and low-dose vaccine group. During the test, each subject must not change groups and
      inoculate drugs. Every two weeks (0-2-4-6-8-10 weeks), alternately inject a dose of placebo
      or left and right upper arm deltoid muscles. Low-dose adjuvant or low-dose vaccine, a total
      of 6 doses.

      Collected adverse events within 14 days after each dose of vaccination, non-recruited adverse
      events within 30 days after the first dose of vaccination, subjects will receive 6 months
      follow-up after the last dose of vaccination, and study throughout Serious adverse events
      were recorded during the period. Immunogenicity will be assessed before the first dose, 24
      hours after the third dose, before the fourth dose, 24 hours after the sixth dose, 1 month,
      and 6 months.
