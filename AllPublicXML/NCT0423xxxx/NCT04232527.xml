    <textblock>
      This research investigates the reliability of tests to assess injury risk. Participants will
      be tested at the beginning of the survey and will be monitored for over 5 months.
      Participants will take 4 types of tests related to dynamic balance, flexibility, and agility.
      Subsequently, the relationship between test results and the incidence of injury in the
      subjects will be analyzed. If the tests prove reliable, they will be included in standard
      tests to assess the risk of injury to football players.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Too often, injuring athlete results in a large amount of money being spent on rehabilitation.
      In a world of sports where the speed of recovery means a lot, ways are sought first and
      foremost to minimize the frequency of non-contact injuries. To prevent certain things, it is
      important to know the initial state, therefore, to see if certain factors at the outset
      indicate to us that there is a certain imbalance that can result in the injury. Since we live
      in a country where sports clubs are unable to spend large amounts of money on rehabilitation,
      it would be of great benefit to find reliable tests that can help to prevent an injury.
      Studies have shown that tests of balance, flexibility, and agility can help to prevent injury
      to football players in other countries. The same tests will be applied to Premier League
      footballers in Bosnia and Herzegovina and their effectiveness in assessing the degree of risk
      of lower limb injuries will be tested. If they prove reliable, they can become a standard in
      the prevention of these injuries, that is, they will help in the development of injury
      prevention programs, which would be of great benefit to both clubs and football players.

      The study aims to determine whether dynamic balance and flexibility tests can be used as
      reliable predictors of lower limb injuries in football players and whether reduced agility
      influences the increased risk of injury.

    <intervention_name>Y Balance Test</intervention_name>
    <description>The footballer will place one foot on the stationary platform of the test set during the test so that the top of the sneaker does not exceed the starting line. The second foot, or the tip of the foot, will push the movable part of the platform down the measuring tube, which is marked by half-inch intervals. Any lifting of the standing leg on the heel, on the toes or loss of balance will be considered a mistake and the attempt will be repeated. Mobility will be tested through 3 trial and 3 valid measurements of the lower limbs in the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions. The arms should rest on the hips.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sit and Reach Test</intervention_name>
    <description>This test involves sitting on the floor with your legs stretched straight forward. Shoes should be removed. The feet themselves are set straight against the box. Both knees must be stretched. With the palms facing down and the palms side-by-side or side-by-side, the subject approaches the measurement line as far as possible. It is important to keep your hands in the same position level, not that one reaches further than the other. Once the subject has reached the maximum distance, hold this position for one to two seconds and record the distance.</description>
