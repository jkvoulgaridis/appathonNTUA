  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to provide a timely update on the role of combining clinical and neuromuscular
      ultrasound assessments in diagnosis and follow-up of various muscle diseases in clinical
      practice over 12 months period, and correlating US findings with functional scales,
      biochemical and electrophysiological studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many muscle diseases share common clinical features that render arriving at appropriate
      diagnoses difficult. The combination of muscle imaging with clinical can limit the
      differential diagnosis and yield the most probable one and can direct genetic testing as the
      only method to arrive at a definite diagnosis.

      In recent years, the use of high-resolution ultrasound had become an important tool in
      diagnosis and in the monitoring of disease progression and treatment of both hereditary and
      acquired myopathies. Additionally, it entails a safe, accessible, low-cost, and no ionizing
      radiation tool which renders the technique extremely suitable for paediatric patients and
      patients who cannot lie still without sedation. therefore, it can be used as a complementary
      tool to electro-diagnosis.

      Ultrasound permits to evaluate echo intensity, muscle perfusion, transverse and longitudinal
      sections of the muscle and its thickness at rest and during maximal voluntary contractions,
      overlying subcutaneous fat, cross-sectional area, and angled fibers of pennate muscles.

      The use of sonographically guided biopsy is an easy, safe, and reliable method for attaining
      tissue for histologic diagnosis in neuromuscular disease.

      In most myopathies, either acute or chronic, muscle tissue undergoes morphological changes
      giving rise to replacement of muscle by connective tissue and/or fat. Pattern recognition on
      muscle imaging might be helpful in distinguishing between different disease entities.

    <description>Quantitative ultrasound measurements will be performed to studied muscles according to a standard protocol; for each muscle three consecutive measurements will be made to minimize variation in echo intensity during analysis .The captured images will be analyzed offline for echo intensity by means of computer-assisted grayscale histogram analysis.The study will be performed using My lab 7 ultrasound system (Esaote company, Italy) that is equipped by 7-19 MHz linear array transducer and color and power Doppler.
Technique: evaluation of studied muscles for echo intensity (ECHO), quantitative assessments of echointensity, muscle perfusion, transverse and longitudinal sections of the muscle and its thickness at rest and during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC), overlying subcutaneous fat, cross-sectional area (CSA), and angled fibers of pennate muscles.</description>
