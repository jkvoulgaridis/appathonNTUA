  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in medical imaging technology have made it possible to detect patients with
      small-sized lung lesions early. Generally, invasive methods such as PCNA were used to
      diagnose peripheral lung nodule. However, Radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography
      (RP-EBUS) is widely used in the histological diagnosis of peripheral lung nodule in recent
      years. In order to carry out RP-EBUS, it is necessary to know the path to the lesion to
      access it. Conventionally, the path to the peripheral lung nodule is identified by the
      drawing, but recently, the path is reviewed by the virtual bronchoscopy navigation (VBN)
      which is reconstructed 3-dimension image using the CT data. Currently, VBN is driven by using
      raw data acquired using standard thin sectioned chest CT protocol, but the problem is that
      additional doses of radiation are exposed to patients who have initially discovered lung
      lesions using low dose CT. Therefore, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to verify the
      suitability of VBN using the raw data acquired by low dose CT.

      The standard thin sectioned protocol CT consists of scout, enhanced and non-enhanced image.
      Therefore, in this study, non-enhanced protocol CT was taken with low dose protocols with
      three different radiation doses to acquire raw data and drive VBN, and compared with the VBN
      result driven with raw data obtained with standard protocol. The primary endpoint of this
      study is to verify the consistency and accuracy of the VBN results driven by the raw data
      obtained with the low dose protocol CT.
