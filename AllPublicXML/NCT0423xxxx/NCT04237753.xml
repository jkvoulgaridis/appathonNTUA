  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about assessing the helpfulness of two treatment delivery methods for bladder
      leakage or urinary incontinence. It is being funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. By
      doing this study, the investigators hope to learn which treatment method is the most helpful
      remote delivery method for treating bladder leakage. The total participation time in this
      research is 6 months. During the first 8 -12 weeks of the study, you will receive standard of
      care from an online educational program (MyHealtheBladder) or a video visit with a provider
      through VA Video Connect. You will be selected by chance to receive MyHealtheBladder or VA
      Video Connect. About half-way through the study, the investigators will ask you about your
      bladder symptoms. If your bladder symptoms are not better, you will be selected by chance to
      continue the previous treatment or receive an initial or booster video session with a
      provider. Throughout the study, you will be asked to answer questions related to your health,
      bladder leakage, costs due to bladder leakage, and track your behavioral training.

      This study represents a unique opportunity to improve access to treatments for urine leakage
      for women Veterans. This research study will examine the effects of two mobile health
      technologies on improving bladder symptoms, as part of a randomized clinical trial. The study
      includes 260 women Veterans recruited from 3 sites: the Birmingham VAMC, the Atlanta VAHCS,
      and the Durham VAMC (86 per site). Women will receive first-line treatments for urine leakage
      through randomization to one of two delivery methods for direct treatment: (1) a web-based
      mobile health application that delivers content daily for 8 weeks compared to (2) a single
      video session delivered by VA Video Connect. At 8-weeks, women who do not have improved
      symptoms will have the ability to continue the treatment or receive an initial or booster
      video session. The investigators will measure bladder symptoms (3 questions by self-report
      over the phone or via survey) at baseline, 8-weeks, 12-weeks, and 6-months. Additionally, the
      investigators will interview 54 women Veterans and 12 providers to learn about their
      experiences with the technologies using 1:1 telephone interviews at 12-weeks. The findings
      from this study will inform the best technology to improve access for bladder leakage among
      women Veterans across a wider array of VHA facilities.

    <ipd_description>For purposes of this study, all data will be stripped of all patient identifiers and each participant will be given a unique identifier for the study. Participant records will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office and will be accessible only to the Principal Investigator, Nurse Practitioner delivering the intervention, Research Coordinator, and Site PI's (Markland, Vaughan, and Goldstein) and co-investigators per site-PI's guidance. Computer-based records will be maintained through the Veteran's Administration Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), a secure network with password protection. A separate tracking database with participant identifiers that provide a link to the unique study IDs will be stored on a secure VA research server at each study site. Only deidentified data will be entered into the Redcap database by study personnel who are credentialed at the Birmingham VAMC through the research office.</ipd_description>
