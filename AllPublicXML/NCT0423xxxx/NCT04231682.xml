  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplant recipients are known to suffer from bone loss and subsequent fractures after
      the transplant operation with the most rapid bone loss occurring within the first 3-12
      months. Guidelines for prevention and treatment of this serious complication are only written
      by individual medical societies interested in each organ (separate kidney from liver or heart
      transplants management) and they are based on studies done with limited medications choices.
      The majority of studies are done with the use of bisphosphonates, and there are very limited,
      or no data, on the effect of other medications used for Osteoporosis, including the use of
      denosumab. This study will focus on the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of denosumab
      60mg use early (within first 3 months) after Liver Transplantation in the management of bone
      loss and prevention of fragility fractures. Different tests will be used to study the effect
      of the medication on the skeleton, including imaging studies as well as specific labwork.
