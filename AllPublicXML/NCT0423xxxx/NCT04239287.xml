  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore lung function and respiratory health in school-aged children who were
      born prematurely at &lt;32 weeks gestation. It will involve full lung function assessment, a
      questionnaire and discussion about respiratory health, and an exercise test using
      optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) to measure breathing patterns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm are born during a critical stage of lung development, and can have abnormalities in
      lung function that persist with age. Previous studies have shown that children with BPD have
      reduced lung function and limited exercise capacity. These studies have used conventional
      lung function testing which requires a tight fitting mask. This is uncomfortable, may alter
      normal breathing patterns and cannot measure changes in total lung volume.

      Optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) indirectly measures lung volumes and breathing patterns
      using cameras to track the position of marker stickers on the chest, back and abdomen. It is
      comfortable, does not require a mask and allows us to track changes in total lung volume.

      This study will use standard lung function testing and OEP to measure lung function and
      breathing patterns at rest and during exercise in school-aged children born prematurely,
      compared to healthy children born at full term. All participants will complete standard lung
      function tests, a questionnaire and structured interview to qualitatively assess respiratory
      health, and an exercise test using OEP to assess how breathing changes with exercise.
