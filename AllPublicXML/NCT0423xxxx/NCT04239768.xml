  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental
      evaluations the aesthetic performance, on the third middle and inferior of the face, of
      &quot;MonoDermà HA Bio-revitalizing gel&quot;, an intradermal filler containing hyaluronic acid,
      combined to a low level laser therapy (LLLT) to obtain a stable photo-cross-linking effect
      inside the dermis.

    <description>Reduction of wrinkles severity corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) clinical score where:
Grade 1 (absent): no visible nasolabial fold; continuous skin line. Grade 2 (mild): shallow but visible nasolabial fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature.
Grade 3 (moderate): moderately deep nasolabial folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched.
Grade 4 (severe): very long and deep nasolabial folds; prominent facial feature; &lt;2mm visible fold when stretched.
Grade 5 (very severe): extremely deep and long nasolabial fold, detrimental to facial appearance; 2-4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched.</description>

    <description>Reduction of face volume loss corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Facial Volume Loss Scale (FVLS) where:
Grade 1: Mild flattening or shadowing of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas). No prominent bony landmarks. No visibility of underlying musculature.
Grade 2: An intermediate point between grade 1 and grade 3. Grade 3: Moderate concavity of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas. Prominence of bony landmarks. May have visibility of underlying musculature.
Grade 4: An intermediate point between grade 3 and grade 5. Grade 5: Severe indentation of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas). Severe prominence of bony landmarks. Clear visibility of underlying musculature.</description>

    <description>&quot;Monodermà HA Bio-revitalizing gel&quot; is a sterile, biodegradable, isotonic intradermal filler produced by Innate S.r.l. (Italy) and distributed by Giuliani S.p.A. (Italy) in non-pyrogenic pre-filled syringe of 2 ml containing 2% (20mg/ml) of medium chain (1.0-1.5 x 106 Dalton) hyaluronic acid (HA), obtained from bacterial fermentation, in a physiologic buffer (see Appendix 1) and used as a filler for the correction of deep skin sagging and roughness.</description>

    <intervention_name>MonoDermà HA gel combined to a low level laser</intervention_name>
    <description>Two intradermal injections of the filler were performed during the basal and after 1 month, on the middle and inferior third of the face (1ml for each face side) using a needle (30G).
Immediately after both injection procedures, LLLT session were performed on the same face area for a total of 8 minutes, using three different wavelengths (450 nm, 650 nm and 1064 nm) simultaneously.</description>
