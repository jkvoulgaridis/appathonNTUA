  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a combined LABA/LAMA treatment with
      olodaterol/tiotropium on small airway function, autonomic nervous system and cardiac function
      in COPD. The main objective is to study the acute effect of dual bronchodilation with
      olodaterol/tiotropium on cardiac function measured by MRI. This work is unique as it assesses
      the effects of Spiolto® Respimat® on the left-ventricular end-diastolic volume and muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity, two endpoints relevant for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore,
      the study concept introduces exhaled particle analysis as a measure for small airway
      function, thus offering the opportunity for a mechanistic link between airway openness,
      hyperinflation, and cardiac function.
