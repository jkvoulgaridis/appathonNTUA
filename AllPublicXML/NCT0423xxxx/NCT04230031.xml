      This study will use the drug daratumumab in patients who did not achieve at least a very good
      partial response (VGPR) and are already planned to have an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
      (ASCT). Daratumumab will be given before the stem cell collection to attempt to get rid of
      any multiple myeloma cells that may be present in the stem cell collection and after the ASCT
      to get rid of any multiple myeloma cells that may be remaining.

      This is a single arm, two-stage, phase II study to evaluate the rate of ≥ Complete Response
      (CR) post-Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in Multiple Myeloma (MM) subjects who failed
      to achieve at least a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) post initial induction therapy for
      newly diagnosed disease, and for whom an ASCT is planned. Subjects will be treated with four
      weekly doses of daratumumab before mobilization for Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC)
      collection, followed by high dose chemotherapy and ASCT and four weekly doses of daratumumab
      after ASCT. A two-stage design will be implemented. Twenty three (23) subjects will be
      enrolled in the first stage, and if at least 12 of the 23 subjects have at least a CR after
      ASCT, an additional 16 subjects will be enrolled in the second stage (a total of 39
      subjects).

          1. Active infection requiring systemic therapy (i.e., involving IV antibiotics)

          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the
             mother is being treated on study, and any female subject must agree not to donate eggs
             during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of daratumumab).

          3. Has a known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive requiring
             treatment; exceptions include basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ
             cervical or bladder cancer, carcinoma of the prostate with a current PSA value of &lt;0.5
             ng/mL or other cancer for which the subject has completed treatment, been disease-free
             for at least five years, and is considered by Sponsor-Investigator to be at &lt;30% risk
             of relapse, or on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate cancer or breast
             cancer, provided that there has been no evidence of disease progression during the
             previous three years.

          4. Non-secretory MM.

          5. Active involvement of the central nervous system by MM.

             New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV [see Appendix C], uncontrolled
             angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months from consent, known or
             suspected amyloidosis, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by the
             investigator, or any other condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that would,
             in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator, place the subject at unacceptable risk if
             he/she were to participate in the study.

         11. Known allergies, hypersensitivity or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human
             proteins, daratumumab or its excipients.

         12. Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg
             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or
             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels.
             Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic
             marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV
             DNA by PCR.

         13. Known to be seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained
             virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of
             antiviral therapy).

         14. Is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.
