  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the amount of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) present on treated skin
      of human volunteers following different application times with a test material bathing
      system. The amount of recovered CHG that resides on the skin following each of the evaluated
      application times will be evaluated via high performance liquid chromatography with
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) and correlated with the MIC values determined separately.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age and can be of either sex and of any race.

          -  Subjects must be able to read and understand English.

          -  Subjects must possess both forearms and have a minimum forearm length (wrist crease to
             elbow crease) of 8.25 inches [21 cm].

          -  Subjects must be in good general health (i.e., no current or recent severe illness)
             and have no medical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse with heart murmur, congenital
             heart disease, an organ transplant, medicated or uncontrolled diabetes, hepatitis B or
             C, an immunocompromised condition such as AIDS (or HIV positive), lupus, fibromyalgia,
             ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, moderate to severe asthma (requiring daily use of
             medication), or medicated multiple sclerosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a clinical study within 7 days of participating in this study or
             current participation in another clinical study.

          -  Presence of tattoos, active skin rashes, dermatoses, or breaks in the skin of the
             forearms or hands. Subjects must also have no inflammatory skin conditions (such as
             atopic dermatitis / eczema, contact dermatitis, or psoriasis) anywhere on the body.

          -  Known allergies or sensitivities to latex (natural rubber), alcohols, sunscreens,
             deodorants, laundry detergents, inks, metals, topically-applied fragrances (e.g.,
             colognes or perfumes), cleansers, soaps, lotions, or to common antibacterial agents
             particularly chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG).

          -  Have experienced hives (raised welts) as a reaction to anything that contacted the
             skin, with the exception of plants known to cause reactions for most humans (e.g.,
             poison oak or poison ivy).

          -  Have a history of anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reaction, or anaphylactoid shock.

          -  Any prosthetic device or joint (e.g., pins, screws, plates, or rods) installed in the
             arms within the last 6 months.

          -  Any type of indwelling port or Peripherally-Inserted Central Catheter (PICC).

          -  Subject is pregnant, plans to become pregnant or impregnate a sexual partner within
             the pre-test and test periods of the study, or is nursing a child.

          -  Any medical condition or use of any medications that, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator or Consulting Physicians, should preclude participation.
