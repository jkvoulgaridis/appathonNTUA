  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnoea is one of the most important determinants of quality of life and often limits the
      activities of daily life, in subjects suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Pharmachological treatment of dyspnoea is affected by several side
      effects and, in long-lasting treatments, a reduction of clinical efficacy may occur. Previous
      studies showed a reduction of perceived dyspnoea after trials of acupuncture or
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation over acupoints (Acu-TENS).

      In this study will be investigated the effect of acupuncture or Acu-TENS on lung function and
      dyspnoea in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (Cronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to verify the effectiveness of treatment with Acupuncture or with
      Acu-TENS to reduce the subjective and objective perception of dyspnoea in patients suffering
      from moderate-to severe COPD. Secondary aims are to investigate the effects of the above
      treatments on quality of life, exercise capacity, pulmonary lung function.

      Forty five consecutive patients, admitted to Auxilium Vitae Rehabilitation Centre for
      intensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme, suffering from moderate-to-severe COPD,
      will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to three groups with different
      treatments (n=15 group 1: experimental subjects - PR+Acupuncture, n=15 group 2: experimental
      subjects - PR+Acu-TENS and n=15 group3: control subjects - PR only) by sequential block
      randomization.

      An intensive inpatient PR programme will be applied to all participants. The programme will
      include the optimisation of drug therapy and daily sessions of:

        1. Supervised incremental exercises on a treadmill, a cycle,and an arm ergometer according
           to the protocol suggested by Maltais et al. until the achievement of 30 min of
           continuous exercise at an intensity that elicited dyspnoea at level 5 on a modified Borg
           scale starting from a workload corresponding to 50% of maximal workload achieved during
           an initial incremental test;

        2. Abdominal, upper- and lower-limb muscle activities involving lifting of progressively
           increasing light weight and shoulder and full-arm circling;

        3. Education;

        4. Nutritional programs and psychosocial counselling, when appropriate. A multidisciplinary
           team of chest physicians, nurses, physical therapists, a dietician, and a psychologist
           offered care.
