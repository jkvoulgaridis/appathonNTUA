  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with dry mouth (a reduction in the production of saliva) suffer from high rates
      of oral diseases. Dry mouth is a common problem among older individuals, because many
      medications to control chronic conditions (such as blood pressure, bladder-control problems
      and depression) reduce the flow of saliva. For these individuals, fluoride is used to
      maintain a good oral health. Usually, higher fluoride concentration products, such as
      prescription toothpastes, are recommended. In this project, the ability to increase fluoride
      retention in the mouth by using calcium before a conventional fluoride rinse will be tested
      in older adults with a range of salivary flow rates. This approach was never tested in
      patients with dry mouth, for whom the treatment with calcium may also be beneficial. A
      clinical study with two experimental phases will be conducted, in which patients with a range
      of saliva flows (from normal to dry mouth) will rinse with a fluoride rinse only (used at
      over the counter concentration), or a fluoride rinse preceded by a calcium rinse. The
      concentration of fluoride and calcium in the saliva and dental plaque residues will be
      determined up to two hours after the rinse(s), to test the effect of the approach to optimize
      fluoride retention in the mouth of patients with dry mouth.
