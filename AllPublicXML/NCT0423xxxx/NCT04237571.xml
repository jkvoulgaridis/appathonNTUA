  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous adult participants of the Tanglewood to Table walking program will be recruited to
      enroll in the CANE Meal Program. This program will encourage participants to pick up a
      healthy meal from the CANE Kitchen each week for five weeks. The meal will consist of at
      least one serving of fruit or vegetables. At each meal, educational materials will be
      distributed, including the recipe for healthy meals and nutrition handouts that are linked to
      the recipes. Additional information about the ways the nutrients in the meal may help protect
      from the negative effects of environmental pollutants will be included. Surveys, blood
      pressure, height, weight, waist circumference and carotenoid status will be assessed before
      and after the program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fruit and vegetable consumption.</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fruit and vegetable consumption will be assessed with a food frequency questionnaire pre- and post-intervention. This questionnaire asks participants to estimate the frequency of consumption on a ten point scale (from never to three times per day) of 45 specific fruits or vegetables. Aggregate scores range from 0-450 with higher scores indicating increased consumption.</description>

    <measure>Change in weight.</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured on a digital scale pre- and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference will be measured with a tape measure pre- and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured pre- and post-intervention using a digital blood pressure machine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in carotenoid status</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Carotenoid status will be measured via carotenoid RS scanner, an objective measure of diet-derived pigments in the skin.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knowledge of nutrition and environmental pollution.</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge of nutrition and environmental pollution will be assessed using a mixed 6-item survey containing 4 &quot;yes&quot; &quot;no&quot; &quot;not sure&quot; questions and two multiple choice knowledge questions. The questionnaire does not have an absolute range, but a higher percent of &quot;not sure&quot; responses indicates less knowledge of nutrition and pollution; while a higher percentage of absolutely correct responses indicates increased knowledge. Data will be reported as the change from pre- to post-intervention.</description>
