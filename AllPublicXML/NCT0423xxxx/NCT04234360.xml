  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare treatment failure rates between a group of
      eosinophilic (eosinophilia &gt; 2% on day 1 of hospitalization) patients hospitalised for a COPD
      exacerbation treated via corticotherapy versus a similar group treated via placebo.

      Secondarily, treatment failure rates will also be compared between a group of
      non-eosinophilic patients hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation treated via corticotherapy
      versus a similar group treated via placebo. Study arms will also be compared for additional
      aspects of efficacy and safety:

        -  speed of recovery during the initial hospitalization;

        -  corticosteroid side effects / induced comorbidities;

        -  changes in symptoms and episodes of exacerbation;

        -  pulmonary function, oxygen use and ventilation;

        -  patient trajectories and resource use (e.g. survival, consults, episodes of
           hospitalization, medications);

        -  drug consumption (especially as relates to COPD management, exacerbations and induced
           comorbidities);

        -  health status, quality of life, activity/disability;

        -  patient safety / adverse events in general.

      Eosinophilia thresholds optimizing the prediction of corticosteroid response and COPD
      outcomes will be re-evaluated. The relationships between corticosteroid response and key
      biomarkers (e.g.

      infectious groups) will be thoroughly explored, including within eosinophil strata. Potential
      gender subgroups differences will also be evaluated.

      Finally, in prevision of further exploratory studies, a biological collection and an imaging
      library will be created in association with this protocol. The biological collection will be
      used to explore the genetic basis and physiology linked with treatment response, gender and
      patient trajectories. The image library will be used as a platform for the exploration of new
      imaging markers developed, for example, via machine learning and affiliated techniques.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomised (1:1), 2-parallel arm, double-blind trial comparing outcomes for a group of eosinophilic COPD patients (n=150) treated via corticotherapy versus a 2nd, similar group (n=150) treated via placebo. Secondarily, the same comparison (2x n=150) will be made for non-eosinophilic patients (totally excluding non-eosinophilic patients would potentially affect biomarker knowledge and subsequent care decisions, leading to bias).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Treatment failure</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure for the primary outcome is defined according to Niewoehner et al. (1999) as death from any cause or need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, readmission due to COPD, or intensification of pharmacologic therapy (defined as the prescription of open-label systemic glucocorticoids, high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids (more than eight puffs per day of triamcinolone acetonide or its equivalent), theophylline, or any combination of these three therapies) at three months. In addition, an investigator meeting determined additional, components of treatment failure that should be added to Niewoehner's definition in order to bring it up-to-date :
Initiation of non-invasive ventilation for &gt;24h after first treatment administration
Transfer to intensive care or indication for a transfer to intensive care Incident limitations-of-care that can affect treatment failure should also be carefully noted.</description>

    <ipd_description>The general goal is to make the study data available to interested researchers as well as to provide proof of transparency for the study. Data (and an accompanying data dictionary) will be de-identified and potentially further cleaned or aggregated as the investigators deem necessary to protect participant anonymity.
Data will be made available to persons who address a reasonable dataset request to the sponsor coordinating team (c/o Dr Carey Suehs, Department of Medical Information, Hôpital La Colombière, 39 avenue Charles Flahault, 34295 Montpellier Cedex 5, France).
In accordance with French law, dataset usage requests must by approved by the French CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés : https://www.cnil.fr/professionnel) prior to access.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>The conditions under which members of the public will be granted access to datasets are:
The data will be used/examined in a not-for-profit manner;
The data will not be used in an attempt to identify a participant or group of participants;
The user does not work for a private insurance company;
The data will not be used in support of any kind of private insurance policy or health penalties;
The data will be used/examined for the advancement of science/teaching while respecting participant/patient privacy and rights;
The user will state why they wish to access the data.
The appropriate CNIL approval has been obtained by the user.</ipd_access_criteria>
