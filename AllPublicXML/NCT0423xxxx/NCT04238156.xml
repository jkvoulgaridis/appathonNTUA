  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of abdominal diastasis is high in postpartum. The abdominal diastasis can
      impair the body posture, the of lumbo-pelvic stability and movement, or breathing. Exercises
      focused on the transversus abdominis muscle have been proposed as a therapeutic approach for
      abdominal diastasis.

      Hypopressive abdominal exercises have been used for postpartum recovery, for specific
      pathologies related to pregnancy (low back pain, pelvic floor dysfunction ...) and even for
      the rehabilitation of spinal pathologies. However, there is a lack of studies that determine
      its effectiveness and clinical utility.

      The aim of the study will be to analyze the effects of Hypopressive abdominal exercises on
      postpartum abdominal diastasis, the tone of the transverse abdominal muscle and the pelvic
      floor musculature.

      A case series design will be applied, with weekly assessment of the outcomes after the
      intervention and two months after the intervention.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Hypopressive abdominal exercises will be performed in basic postures (standing, sitting and supine position). In each posture, three slow cost-diaphragmatic respiration will be performed followed by an expiratory apnea and a rib cage opening, during 2 to 10 seconds, and an exhalation of 10 to 30 seconds. Each exercise will be repeated three times.
There will be 3 stages of application throughout the 12 intervention sessions, supervised by a physical therapist:
First stage: To explain the concept of hypopressive respiration and how to perform it.
Second stage: To explain and apply the hypopressive abdominal exercises: 1. Axial auto-elongation (reducing curvatures in the sagittal plane); 2. Cervical auto-elongation (chin toward the neck); 3. Moving forward of gravity axis; 4. Activation of the shoulder girdle (shoulder joint decoaptation); 5. Slight knee flexion; 6. Dorsal ankle flexion.
Third stage: To review and update all the exercises, increasing their intensity.</description>
