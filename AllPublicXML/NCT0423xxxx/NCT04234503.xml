  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is:

        1. to test a new ethics educational intervention for nurse mangers, Ethics Quarter (EQ) and

        2. to measure the feasibility and the usability of the EQ

      The detailed research questions and hypothesis of this study are as follows:

        1. Is EQ effective in increasing NMs' ethics knowledge?

        2. Is EQ effective in increasing NMs' influencing ethics issues?

        3. Is EQ effective in increasing NMs' ethics research implementing?

        4. Is EQ effective in increasing NMs' ethics problem identifying?

        5. Is EQ effective in increasing NMs' ethics problem solving?

           H 1-5: It is hypothesized that participating into EQ promotes NM's ethics knowledge,
           influencing ethics issues, ethics research implementing, ethics problem identifying and
           ethics problem solving compared to comparisons.

        6. What are NM's perceptions of feasibility and usability of the EQ?

      The ultimate goal is to strengthen nurse managers' ethical activity profile and create a new,
      modern way to promote ethical management of nursing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new educational intervention, EQ, for nurse managers has developed. Intervention
      development has evaluated by using criteria for complex interventions in health care
      (CReDECI)- guideline (MÃ¶hler et al. 2012). EQ intervention is based on distance learning
      method and it consists of 12 educational packages included in the virtual learning
      environment www.etiikanvartti.fi.

      Effectiveness of EQ intervention will be tested by using an individually randomized
      controlled trial with baseline-, post- and follow-up-measurements.The intervention group will
      participate in the educational EQ intervention and the control group will not participate.

      Data will be collected via the membership register of the Union of Health and Social Care
      Professionals in Finland (Tehy) trade union. This union is a national interest group for
      nurses, nurse managers and advanced consultants/specialists in the social and health-care
      sector having a Master's degree (nursing science or related) or registered nurses degree.

      Based on statistical power analysis, the required sample size for the study will be 87 NMs at
      both groups, at 80%, 0.05 significance level.

    <measure>Changes in nurse managers' ethical activity profile level.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6 and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Ethical activity profile consists of five dimensions: 1) Developing of own ethics knowledge, 2) Influencing ethical issues, 3) Conducting/implementing ethics research, 4) Identifying and 5) Solving ethical problems.
Dimensions 1-3 will be measured with Developing, Influencing and implementing ethics -instrument (DIIEI), Dimension 4 will be measured with Ethical Sensitivity Scale Questionnaire (ESSQ) and Dimension 5 will be measured with Nurses' Moral Courage Scale (NMCS) at baseline (before the intervention), week 6 (after the intervention) and week 10.
Results of the all three instruments create one primary outcome measure, ethical activity profile level. All the instruments are 5-point Likert-scales (1=totally disagree; 5=totally agree/1= Does not describe me at all; 5= Describes me very well) and the higher scores indicate higher self-assessed ethical activity profile level.</description>

    <description>In the intervention, nurse managers have two educational packages per week, one taking 15 minutes (one quarter).The structure of the whole intervention is made according to the dimensions of ethical activity profile of nurse managers (Laukkanen et al. a2016; Laukkanen et al b2016) consisting of managers:
Developing of own ethics knowledge,
Influencing ethical issues,
Conducting/implementing ethics research,
Identifying and
Solving ethical problems.
Intervention includes also orientation and summary, in total 12 educational packages.
After every dimension, NMs have to make self-reflection and development plans, in total five times. This provides them the opportunity to link their everyday experience with ethical theory.</description>
