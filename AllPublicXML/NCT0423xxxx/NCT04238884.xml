  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, simple-blind, parallel arm,
      centre-stratified clinical trial. The main objective is to compare efficiency of voriconazole
      preemptive genotyping strategy, compared with routine practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary outcome is serum level of voriconazole on fifth day. Secondary outcome is a combined
      variable of therapeutic failure and adverse events, associated with voriconazole. A total of
      146 patients with risk of undergoing invasive aspergillosis who potentially will receive
      voriconazole will be recruited, and CYP2C19 will be genotyped. If the patient receives
      voriconazole finally, he will be randomized (1:1 experimental/control). In the experimental
      arm patients receive dose according to pharmacogenetic algorithm including CYP2C19 genotype
      and clinical and demographic information. In the control arm patients receive dose according
      to clinical practice guidelines. In addition, a Spain national health system (NHS)
      point-of-view cost-effectiveness evaluation is going to be done. Direct costs calculation of
      each arm will be done.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis, that will potentially receive
             treatment or prophylaxis with voriconazole:

             A. Pediatric population: children who are going to receive a transplant of
             hematopoietic precursors (HSCT) and acute myeloid leukemias, as well as relapses of
             it.

             B. Adult population: patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, and those patients with
             expected prolonged neutropenia, secondary to hematological process and / or after
             specific treatment (aplastic anemia and variants, myelodysplastic syndrome, solid
             organ or bone marrow transplant, etc.), and those whose responsible clinician consider
             individually that they could present a risk of developing a fungal infection.

          2. Those who agree to participate in the study by signing informed consent (patients
             equal or over 18 years old)

          3. Subjects under 18 years old whose representative / legal guardian has voluntarily
             signed the informed consent.

          4. In the case of mature under 18 years subjects (12-17 years of age), in addition to the
             consent signed by the legal guardian, the consent of the subject will be obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who for any reason should not be included in the study according to the
             criteria of the research team.

          2. Subjects who are not capable to understand the information sheet and unable to sign
             the informed consent.
