  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) only versus EUS
      + endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with pancreatic endotherapy reduces
      pain in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic duct obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, pilot, sham-controlled clinical trial of ERCP with pancreatic
      endotherapy for pain secondary to chronic calcific pancreatitis with main pancreatic duct
      obstruction. Potential subjects will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment including
      Quantitative Sensory Testing, to ensure enrollment criteria are met and baseline covariates
      are measured. Eligible subjects will complete a 14-day run-in period. If eligibility criteria
      persist, subjects will be randomized to diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) + sham
      pancreatic endotherapy or diagnostic EUS + ERCP with pancreatic endotherapy as defined in the
      study protocol. Subjects will be followed by a blinded physician for the next 90 days, at
      which time the pilot trial outcomes will be measured. Regardless of outcomes, all subjects
      will be followed longitudinally for 12 months after randomization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average daily pain: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -14 to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily pain from the electronic diaries during the 14-day period preceding the 90-day assessment, compared to the average daily pain reported during the 14-day run-in. Clinical improvement will be defined by the change in the average pain score between these two intervals, and without the need for increased opioids or additional interventions/procedures. We will employ the standardized 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to capture average daily pain with the empirically-supported anchors of 0=No Pain and 10=Worst Pain Imaginable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain severity and functional impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>At 90-days, change from baseline in functional impairment due to pain will be examined.
The instrument used is Brief Pain Inventory (BPI),
Measures pain at its worst, least, average, and at time of evaluation
Measures patient perception of effectiveness of current pain medications
Measures functional impairment due to pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life: Using the PROMIS 29 instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Using the PROMIS 29 instrument, quality of life will be assessed through this questionnaire evaluating anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and a single pain intensity item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Misuse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Using the instrument titled Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM), this will be evaluated by patient self-reported measures of risk for aberrant medication-related behavior in patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument titled Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) used to assess pain catastrophizing will do the following:
Measure of negative cognitive-set brought to bear during painful experiences
Predict functional impairment due to pain and pain-related depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Using Quantitative Sensory Testing, we will assess the mechanical pain threshold using the IITC Life Sciences Digital Anesthesiometer applied to the distal phalange of the digiti minimi of the left hand (increased at rate of 10grams/sec; pressure recorded in grams).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain tolerance: Quantitative Sensory Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Using Quantitative Sensory Testing, we will assess thermal pain tolerance using 5 trials of cutaneous heat stimuli via the thermode of the Medoc TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain wind up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Using Quantitative Sensory Testing we will assess thermal wind-up pain (3 trials) with the thermode delivering 20 brief suprathreshold thermal pulses at the rate of 1 pulse per 1.5 secs thereby selectively stimulating C-fibers (during the 3 trials of 30sec of repeated heat stimulation, subjects will indicate their level of pain severity using a dynamic visual analogue scale).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Using Quantitative Sensory Testing, we will assess conditioned pain modulation (3 trials) using mechanical pain thresholds assessed via the IITC Life Sciences Digital Anesthesiometer applied to the right trapezus (increased at rate of 10grams/sec; pressure recorded in grams) with and without simultaneous stimulation via the ATS thermode.</description>

    <description>All subjects will undergo anesthesia administered sedation and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The endoscopist will assess the pancreas for parenchymal and ductal features of chronic pancreatitis and confirm the absence of exclusion criteria (such as the presence of an occult pancreatobiliary malignancy).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>If randomized to ERCP with pancreatic endotherapy, the endoscopist will proceed with this intervention immediately following the completion of EUS and treatment allocation (during the same anesthesia). Pancreatic endotherapy may include any or all of the following maneuvers: pancreatic endoscopic sphincterotomy, stricture dilation using a bougie or hydrostatic balloon catheter, pancreatic stone extraction with or without mechanical or electrohydraulic lithotripsy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and stent placement. Overall technical success will be defined by the ability to insert at least one pancreatic stent across the dominant main pancreatic duct obstruction. Technical success for pancreatic stone treatment will be defined by the ability to remove all fluoroscopically visible main pancreatic duct stones.</description>
