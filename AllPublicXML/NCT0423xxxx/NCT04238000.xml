      Objective of the study:

      To test the efficacy of theta burst cerebellar stimulation on dual task walking in
      Parkinson's disease using a cross-over design and wearing sensors technology

      Design:

      Twenty Parkinson's disease patients with no dementia will be recruited for a cross-over
      sham-controlled study. Each patient will undergo a sham stimulation or a single session of
      cerebellar theta burst stimulation with a wash out period of at least 14 days.

      Each patient will be evaluated before and after stimulation by a battery of gait and movement
      tests using wearing sensors technology .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no medical effective treatments for dual-task gait in Parkinson's disease. Imaging,
      neurophysiology and pathology studies suggested cerebellum as possible target of brain
      stimulation for dual-task walking for theta Burst repetitive Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation

      Objective of the study:

      To test the efficacy of theta burst cerebellar stimulation on gait in Parkinson's disease
      using a cross-over design and wearing sensors technology

      Design:

      Parkinson's disease patients able to walk and without dementia/behavioral disturbances will
      be recruited for a cross-over sham-controlled study. Each patient will undergo a sham
      stimulation or a single session of cerebellar theta burst stimulation with a wash out period
      of at least 14 days.

      Repetitive cerebellar theta burst stimulation will be performed by Duo-Mag XT100, using a 3
      pulses at 50-Hz repeated at a rate of 5-Hz; 20 trains of 10 bursts given with 8-s intervals
      for a total of 600 pulses. Intensity of rTMS was set at the 80% of Amplitude of Motor
      Threshold (RMT) obtained in the left motor cortex for each subject.

      A sample size of 20 subjects with complete stimulation (2 stimulations per subject, for a
      total number of stimulation)

      Each patient will be evaluated before and after stimulation by a battery of gait and movement
      tests using wearing sensors technology.

      Sensors assessment:

      The following gait parameters will be evaluated in normal and cognitive/motor dual-tasks:

      i) step length ii) step variability iii) step phases iv) turning speed

    <description>The rTMS coil stimulation will be applied in the same position of the real stimulation. The Stimulation will be performed like in the real arm with the difference that the coil will be masked and thus will be inactive. The patient will hear the same sound of real stimulation, which will be only functionally inactive but will be completely performed (for the whole time of duration of stimulation)</description>
