      and adolescents with solid tumours.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I open-label, multicentre study to determine the RP2D of olaparib monotherapy in the
      paediatric population, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PDx and preliminary
      efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in paediatric patients from ≥6 months to &lt;18 years of age at
      enrolment, with relapsed or refractory non-CNS solid tumours for whom there are no standard
      treatment options. It is anticipated that eligible patients fulfilling all of the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will include but will not be limited to those
      with osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, Ewing Sarcoma
      and neuroblastoma.

          -  For dose finding phase only: recruitment will be open to all patients with HRR
             deficiency, either based on a local test or by using a central germline test. For the
             signal identification phase: recruitment will be open only to patients with documented
             evidence of a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tumour HRR gene
             mutation that meets the olaparib HRR classification rules

          -  Previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including olaparib

          -  Receipt of any radiotherapy for cancer treatment (except for palliative reasons)
             within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment or receipt of last dose of an
             approved (marketed) anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biologic
             therapy, monoclonal antibodies, etc) within 21 days prior to the first dose of study
             treatment.

          -  Concomitant use of known strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or concomitant use of
             known strong or moderate CYP3A inducers
