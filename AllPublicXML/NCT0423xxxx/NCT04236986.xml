  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, individuals with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will
      undergo one positron emission tomography (PET) scan using the radiotracer [11C]PBR28, which
      binds to the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO). A subset of individuals who complete the
      first PET [11C]PBR28 scan will be invited to complete an inflammatory challenge and second
      PET [11C]PBR28 scan. Approximately 3 hours prior to the second [11C]PBR28 PET scan,
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) will be administered to evoke a robust neuroimmune
      response. Subjects will also undergo behavioral and cognitive testing. Vital signs,
      subjective response, and peripheral biomarker levels will be assayed periodically throughout
      the experimental session.

      Specific aims: 1) Determine if individuals with PTSD exhibit neuroimmune system disruption
      relative to well-matched comparators at baseline. 2) Determine if individuals with PTSD
      exhibit a disrupted neuroimmune response after a classical immune stimulus relative to
      well-matched comparators. 3) Determine if LPS differentially alters cognitive function,
      subjective response, or physiological markers in individuals with PTSD compared to
      well-matched comparators.

      Hypothesis: Individuals with PTSD will exhibit a suppressed neuroimmune system at baseline
      and an attenuated neuroimmune response following LPS challenge.
