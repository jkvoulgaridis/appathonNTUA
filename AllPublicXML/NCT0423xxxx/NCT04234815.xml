  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomized controlled trial (c-RCT) evaluates the effectiveness of a brief,
      single-session psychosocial workshop, &quot;CETA Short Session&quot; (CSS), for reducing symptoms of
      distress and functional impairment and increasing treatment engagement among conflict
      veterans and their families in Ukraine. The CSS workshop includes psychoeducation, a
      self-assessment, safety screening, and training in cognitive coping. This will be evaluated
      against a single-session comparison workshop that includes all of the same workshop elements
      except for cognitive coping. Both conditions include a follow-up phone call to individually
      discuss self-assessment results. Participants with safety concerns will be immediately
      referred to mental health treatment; others will be asked to wait for one month before being
      reassessed and, if indicated, referred to mental health treatment. Distress and functional
      impairment outcomes will be assessed one month from baseline. Treatment engagement outcomes
      will be assessed one month from referral. The investigators hypothesize that individuals
      attending sessions randomized to CSS will show greater improvement in mental health outcomes
      and greater treatment engagement than those attending sessions randomized to the comparison
      condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-based organizations in Ukraine that are currently providing social services to
      veterans or their families and are interested in receiving training to provide CSS will be
      engaged as implementing partners. Individuals selected to be providers at these organizations
      will complete a 2-day Provider Training and will additionally receive ongoing supervision
      over the course of the study to ensure intervention fidelity and appropriate response and
      support to individuals needing referral to mental health treatment.

      Cluster-level randomization to CSS or eTAU will be carried out within each organization, such
      that all Providers will deliver both the CSS and eTAU workshops to groups that have been
      randomly allocated to either receive CSS or eTAU. In this way, all organizations will offer
      both CSS and eTAU, integrated into each organization's regular program offerings and
      advertised through organizations' regular communication channels.

      As part of psychoeducation/self-awareness and triage procedures included as regular
      programming in both arms of the trial, participants will self-complete a short, locally
      validated Self-Assessment Form that assesses symptoms of distress (depression, post-traumatic
      stress), functional impairment, and safety risk (two safety-related questions assessing
      recent thoughts of harm to self or others). At the end of the workshop, participants will be
      informed of the study and invited to participate; those who agree will provide informed
      consent.

      After the workshop, as part of regular programming the provider will review and score the
      Self-Assessment forms for purposes of triage and will follow up with all participants who
      agree to programmatic follow-up contact to discuss recommended next steps. Evaluation of
      level of need, and therefore choice of follow-up response, will be made by the provider using
      the self-assessment scores and safety question responses. Follow-up contacts will be ordered
      by priority.

        1. Individuals who indicate any safety concerns will be contacted within 24 hours for
           further assessment to determine the appropriate referrals and/or safety plan.

        2. Individuals with high symptom scores, but who report no safety concerns, will be
           contacted within 72 hours and offered a referral to outpatient mental health care.

        3. Individuals with moderate symptom scores will be contacted within 1 week for triage and
           encouraged to use the newly learned skills over the next month. On that triage phone
           call, participants will be told they will be re-assessed in one month to determine if
           they still require mental health treatment (at which time they would be referred if
           indicated). For those who attended CSS (rather than eTAU), providers will also ask about
           participant use of the cognitive coping skill over the past week, including asking them
           how often they've used it, whether it has been helpful, and soliciting an example
           through a series of questions that walk them through the skill.

      All study participants who are not immediately referred to outpatient mental health services
      will be sent an individual link to re-administer the self-assessment, the CSS skill check,
      and complete an implementation feedback questionnaire.

      For all study participants who receive an outpatient mental health referral, either immediate
      or delayed, engagement outcomes will be assessed one month following referral.

    <description>CETA Short Session (CSS) is a brief, low-intensity psychosocial intervention incorporating foundational components of the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA). CETA is an 8-12 session, transdiagnostic psychotherapy for common mental disorders. CSS was designed to serve as both a prevention/support approach for a broader range of needs, as well as an engagement/outreach strategy to identify and refer individuals to treatment. CSS is delivered in a group format over approximately two hours and consists of: 1) Psychoeducation: instruction about the brain and brain functioning, including normalization of psychological responses to stress and a brief self-assessment; 2) Safety: screening and referral for individuals identified as at risk of harm to self or others; and 3) Cognitive coping: based on the cognitive triangle, participants practice identifying an unhelpful thought changing it to a more helpful alternative, and examining how these thoughts impact feelings and behaviors.</description>
