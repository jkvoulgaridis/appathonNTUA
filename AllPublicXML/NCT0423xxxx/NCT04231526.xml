             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).
