  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections on the
      neuropathic pain, quality of life and disability patients with cervical radiculopathy. After
      the clinical and MRG evaluations of patients with neck and arm pain, injection was given to
      eligible patients.

      Patients undergone the procedure were evaluated before and after injection for neuropathic
      pain, quality of life and disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck and arm pain related to cervical radiculopathy is the second indication for epidural
      steroid injections after lumbar radiculopathy in the many a pain clinic. In this procedure
      corticosteroids and local anesthetics were given to the epidural space with
      fluoroscopy-guided special techniques. The underlying mechanism of action of these epidurally
      administered medications is not clear and ıt is believed to be due to anti-inflammatory
      properties of corticosteroids. In addition local anesthetics is thought to be as effective as
      corticosteroids in spinal pain of various origin. So far, many studies have shown the
      efficacy of these injections in acute/chronic pain of cervical radiculopathy. Although mixed
      pain is seen in most of patients, the relationship between pain pattern and treatment
      response is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the treatment responses of the patients who
      were diagnosed with neuropathic pain and the patients who weren't by means of LANSS. It is
      also intended to serach whether the presence of neuropathic pain will help to predict the
      treatment response or not. In this regard, the patients were evaluated with LANSS, SF-12 and
      neck pain and disability scale before the procedure. Categorized as the patients with
      neuropathic pain and the patients without, their treatment responses were compared.

    <description>LANSS is an assessment tool that used to analyze and classify pain. The scale comprises of a 7-item pain scale, including the sensory descriptors and items for sensory examination.According to various research reports, these LANSS tests correctly classified the patients as suffering from nociceptive and neuropathic pain, in four out of every five patients experiencing chronic pain. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire in Turkish were conducted by Yucel et al.</description>
