  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to test the feasibility of measurement of the critical closing pressure
      (Pcrit) during drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) for use in future studies, which are aimed
      at finding an alternative method for patient selection and response prediction before
      implementation of non-CPAP therapies.Twenty patients diagnosed with OSA and eligible for
      non-CPAP treatments are going to be included into this study and undergo these measurements.
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is part of the standard clinical care for OSA patients
      that are eligible for non-CPAP therapies. We aim to expand this procedure with measurement of
      Pcrit, oesophageal pressure, airflow, EEG, EOG, respiratory effort, SpO2 and chin EMG during
      this study.

      Patients from the ENT department will be recruited and informed about the study. After
      obtaining informed consent, the patients will undergo DISE according to the normal clinical
      care.The study will be performed during this clinical DISE, using a standard polysomnographic
      set-up (Alice 6 LDx, Philips Respironics) expanded with pressure and flow measurements. After
      measurements and evaluations are done, the most suitable treatment option based on the DISE
      and PSG findings, as defined in the standard clinical care, will be advised to the patient.
      The treatment and its further choice are not part of the current study protocol.

    <description>DISE is performed in a semi-dark, silent operating theatre, starting with the patient in supine position. To first induce sleep, an IV bolus of midazolam (1.5 mg) is administered. Then, a flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope (Olympus END-GP, 3.7 mm diameter, Olympus Europe GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) is inserted through one of the nostrils. Either at the start of the examination or while holding the scope at the level of the palate, propofol (2.0-3.0 µg/ml) will be administered via a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump. Sleep occurrence is confirmed using the additional EEG measurement.</description>

    <description>After sleep onset, the CPAP pressure well be increased until no flow limitations are observed. This pressure is called the holding pressure and is used as a base for all the following measurements for that individual OSA patient. After observing sleep stage 2 or 3, the holding pressure is reduced abruptly by 1 cmH2O during expiration for 5 breaths. Then the pressure is set back to the holding pressure for the duration of 1 minute. This procedure is repeated until obstructive sleep apnea is noted.</description>
