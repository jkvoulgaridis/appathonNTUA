  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, single-arm, multi-channel, multicenter, non-interventional
      real-world study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Toripalimab injection in the
      treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with previously systemic failure . The study
      population currently included only in the melanoma cohort-unresectable or metastatic melanoma
      patients who had previously failed systemic therapy. If new indications are approved during
      the implementation of the project, patients with new indications using Toripalimab injection
      will also be included in this study as a new cohort.This study uses offline (physical
      hospital) and online (DTP pharmacy and Lingke (Yinchuan) Internet hospital) to collect data
      and information, relying on Lingke technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. EDC (Medical Research
      Cloud) database for data collection and processing. The classification of adverse events was
      based on the general toxicity evaluation standard NCI CTCAE 5.0 of the National Institute of
      Oncology (Chinese version).
