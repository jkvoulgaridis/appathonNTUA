  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds do not heal for prolonged periods of time with the significant financial
      burden on the healthcare system. It has become increasingly essential to improve our clinical
      treatments. The most promising potential treatment options rely on stem cell-based therapies.
      A large body of evidence indicates that mesenchymal stem cells can promote wound closure of
      chronic wounds in animal models and in preclinical studies. MSCs efficacy depends mostly on
      their paracrine activity. All the bioactive factors and cytokines in MSCs secretions
      constitute can be collected in the conditioned medium. In here, stem cell-derived conditioned
      medium was further made into a lyophilized powder. Patients with chronic wounds were
      enrolled. The wounds in control group treated with fibroblast growth factor commonly used in
      clinical practice. The wounds in experimental group treated with lyophilized powder. The
      effectiveness and safety of lyophilized powder will evaluate for chronic wounds.
