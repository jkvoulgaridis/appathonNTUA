      Primary objectives:

      To demonstrate biosimilarity with regard to the total and maximum pharmacokinetic exposure
      during one dosing interval (AUC ins. 0-24h, Cins.

      max) of Gan &amp; Lee Insulin Glargine with Lantus® (US RLD / EU RP) in subjects with type 1
      diabetes

      To demonstrate biosimilarity with regard to the total and maximum pharmacodynamic response
      during one dosing interval (AUC GIR.0-24h, GIR max) of Gan &amp; Lee Insulin Glargine with
      Lantus® (US RLD / EU RP) in subjects with type 1 diabetes

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Gan &amp; Lee Insulin Glargine
      and of Lantus® (US RLD / EU RP)
