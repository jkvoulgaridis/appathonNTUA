  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In countries with a low incidence of Tuberculosis (TB), the incidence remains higher among
      the immigrant population than among the autochthonous population beyond the first years after
      arrival in the host country. In addition, at a pediatric level, most cases are produced in
      immigrant children and the children of immigrants. This persistence of a greater incidence in
      the immigrant population might, in part, be explained by the increase in exposure to
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis during trips to their country of origin to visit friends and
      relatives (VFRs). The objectives of the study are to estimate the risk of latent infection by
      M. tuberculosis (LTBI)/TB in children VFRs and the factors associated with this risk. The
      investigators will also study the behavior of the diagnostic tests. This project will be
      carried out in collaboration with 21 primary health care centers and 5 hospitals in
      Catalonia.

      A prospective study will be carried out. The study subjects are children under 15 years of
      age, which are children of immigrants and born or not in Spain, who travel to VFRs to
      countries with an elevated incidence of TB (&gt; 40 cases/100,000 inhabitants). A sample size of
      492 children was estimated. Children will be recruited during a programmed visit to a
      traveler health clinic or a primary care center, a questionnaire will be completed with
      sociodemographic, epidemiologic and clinical data and a tuberculin skin test (TST) will be
      performed and read at 48-72 hours. At 8-12 weeks after returning from the travel abroad the
      child will have a new visit in which a questionnaire will be completed with epidemiological
      and clinical data, an a TST and QFT-Plus test will be performed. The rate of incidence of
      LTBI will be estimated per individual/month and person/year per country visited and by age
      group.

    <description>The children who participate in the study will be recruited during a programmed visit to a traveler health clinic or a primary care center. During the first visit the parents or legal guardian will be interviewed, a questionnaire will be completed with sociodemographic, epidemiologic and clinical data and a tuberculin skin test (TST) will be performed and read at 48-72 hours. At 8-12 weeks after returning from the travel abroad the child will have a new visit. A new interview will be carried out with the parents or legal guardian and a questionnaire will be completed with epidemiological and clinical data. The child will undergo a new TST and QFT-Plus test.</description>

             value proposed but which have regions with &gt; 40 cases /100,000 inhabitants are also
             included (Table and figure 1)

          -  The journey to the country of origin is made by at least one of the parents.

          -  The duration of the visit to the country of origin is of at least 21 days.

             population.

          -  Primary or secondary immunodeficiency to treatment with corticosteroids,
             transplantation, treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor, chronic renal
             insufficiency.
