      IMMUWHY Phase II Clinical Trial will test the Addition of the immunotherapeutic agents
      Durvalumab and Tremelimumab after an initial Standard of Care SIRT in patients suffering from
      non-resectable intrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer. Patients will be randomized into two

             by the authorities § 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 4 AMG.

         23. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature,
             significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a
             rational intention in the light of the facts [§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 3a AMG].

         24. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first administration of
             any of the IMPs and without need to receive any live attenuated vaccines during study
