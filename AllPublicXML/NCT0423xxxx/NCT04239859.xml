  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis (PsO) is a systemic immune disease that affect 2-4% of the population worldwide.
      PsO causes tremendous burden in terms of quality of life, psychological impact, disability
      and work productivity of affected individuals. PsO is associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular morbidities and mortality in the long term. Up to 30% of PsO patients develop
      psoriatic arthritis (PsA) over time causing joint deformities and further disabilities.
      Majority of patients with PsA developed PsO first, and arthritis develop 5-10 years after.
      PsA and PsO are increasingly recognized as two entities under the umbrella of psoriatic
      diseases.

      Advances in biological treatments have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with PsO.
      Remarkable efficacies have been demonstrated for patients with moderate to severe PsO in
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the high cost of biological treatment is one of
      the major barriers to its prescription and many patients may have limited access to these
      treatments.

      The best treatment strategy for PsO that takes into account efficacy and cost effectiveness
      is unknown. For instance, whether some PsO patients can stop biological treatment and be
      treated with non-biologic medications upon relapse, which may enhance cost effectiveness of
      treatment. Preliminary studies have shown that some PsO patients were able to maintain good
      control of disease without medications after biologics withdrawal. The patho-immunological
      mechanisms behind long term remission after drug withdrawal is poorly understood. Better
      understanding of these mechanisms in maintaining remission and relapses will advance the
      development of biomarkers that eventually guide development of best treatment strategies for
      PsO.

      Secukinumab targets interleukin (IL)-17a and is highly efficacious in the treatment of plague
      PsO with a favorable safety profile. Some patients may have the response maintained after
      withdrawal of secukinumab. With the proven efficacies, sustainability after withdrawal and
      safety profile, secukinumab could be a choice of initial treatment for patients with moderate
      to severe PsO. Secukinumab has been recommended as first line treatment for selected patients
      with moderate to severe PsO by the American Academy of Dermatology and the European S3
      guidelines. However, the use of biologics as first line is limited by cost issue. Overall,
      real-life data on biologic treatment for moderate to severe PsO is scanty.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators hypothesize that a proportion of participants with moderate to
      severe PsO may sustain good outcomes when a short course of secukinumab is withdrawn.

      Second, the investigators hypothesize that they can identify the perturbations in the
      architecture of the immunome which are pathogenic, and to discriminate such perturbations
      based on treatment and clinical responses, thus distilling therapeutics and diagnostics
      signatures.

      Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follow:

      Specific aim 1: To describe the clinical course, sustained good outcomes, relapse rate, time
      to relapse and quality of life in PsO participants who stopped a 6-month short course
      treatment of secukinumab, till the end of 2-years.

      Specific aim 2: To identify the genomic and immunomics signatures in skin biopsies and blood
      in PsO participants who has good outcomes (PASI 75) at 6 months, comparing treatment vs
      pragmatic control.

      Specific aim 3: To identify the genomic and immunomics signatures in skin biopsies and blood
      in PsO participants who sustained good outcomes at 1 year after stopping secukinumab,
      compared to those relapsed.

    <intervention_model_description>To evaluate the real-life effectiveness of secukinumab as first-line systemic treatment in participants with moderate to severe PsO, the investigators would recruit a pragmatic control arm.
⦁ Intervention arm Eligible participants will be offered secukinumab as first-line systemic treatment for PsO. Standard dose of subcutaneous secukinumab for moderate to severe PsO will be given at 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, then monthly thereafter, for a total duration of 6 months.
Secukinumab will be withdrawn after 6 months. For some participants, there may be relapse of PsO. Relapses will be managed as per standard care.
⦁ Pragmatic control arm
Eligible participants will be recruited to pragmatic control arm in these circumstances:
Patient disagree to secukinumab for personal reasons.
The quota for secukinumab is exhausted.
The management of PsO in this pragmatic control arm will be the same as that in the standard care.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In all participants (both secukinumab treated and standard care) the investigators will describe the following:
Every 3-6 monthly till end of 30 months, investigators will evaluate the change scores of Quality of Life (EQ5D-5L). It consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions. Each dimension is measured on a scale of 1-5, with '1' indicating no problem, '2' indicating slight problems, '3' indicating moderate problems, '4' indicating severe problems, and '5' indicating unable to/extreme problems. The highest and the lowest scores for both EQ-5D-5L indices were 1.00 (best imaginable health) and -0.769 respectively; where negative values are valued as worse than dead.
EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale from 0-100 with '0' indicating worst health one can imagine and '100' indicating best health one can imagine.</description>
