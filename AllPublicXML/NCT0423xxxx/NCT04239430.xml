  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for and timing of booster doses of meningococcal vaccines in People Living with HIV
      (PLWHIV) is currently unknown. As such it is impossible for clinicians to recommend booster
      doses or to know if and when these might be necessary.We propose to follow up a group of
      participants from the Propositive study who received two doses of both MenB (Bexsero) and
      MenACWY (Menveo). This was a group of PLWHIV between the ages 18-45 years. We propose
      following up these participants at 12 and 24 months post completion of two doses of vaccine
      and investigating their immunological response.

    <description>Blood samples will be taken from participants at two time points in the study. Serum Bactericidal Assays from participant serum using relevant MenB and MenACWY strains will be undertaken at 12 and 24 months post two doses of 4CMenB (Bexsero, GSK) and MenACWY-conjugate (Menveo, GSK) vaccine. The Vaccines were given to participants during an earlier clinical trial (Propositive). This trisal is a follow up study.</description>
