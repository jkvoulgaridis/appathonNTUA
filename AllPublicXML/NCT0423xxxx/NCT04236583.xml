  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new process for having a virtual visit with a primary
      care doctor after discharge from the hospital, instead of an in-person visit.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to fully develop the protocol for identifying patients who would
      benefit from a virtual visit and develop the protocol for implementing the virtual visit. The
      value of this project is that the results will provide ample preliminary data for a future
      randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. This project
      will have an intervention group only. The hypothesis is that the intervention can be
      implemented in a way that is feasible and acceptable to providers and patients.
