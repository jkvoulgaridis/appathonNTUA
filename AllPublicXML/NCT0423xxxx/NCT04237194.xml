      To assess the impact of Paclitaxel treatment on the nerve excitability of the small and large
      nerve fibers

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of many
      chemotherapeutic agents, especially antineoplastic agents. To limit the nerve damages, early
      detection and management of CIPN is crucial and leaves an urgent demand for new diagnostic
      tools. Perception threshold tracking has enabled assessments of nerve excitability tests of
      both small and large sensory nerves and may be used to assess CIPN at early stages. The
      purpose of this study is to examine whether a new nerve excitability test can detect changes
      in the membrane properties of the small and large nerve fibers during chemotherapy treatment.

      In this study nerve excitability tests will be performed with 2 different electrodes using a
      novel perception threshold tracking technique to assess the Nerve excitability of small and
      large fibers. Further quantitative sensory tests (QST) will be performed to estimate the
      vibration threshold, warm and cool perception thresholds, heat and cold pain thresholds, and
      perceived intensity to static mechanic stimulations will be assessed. Symptoms of CIPN will
      be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events scale and a Quality of
      Life Questionnaire CIPN twenty-item scale.
