  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, placebo-controlled, 2-period,
      crossover study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of budesonide/albuterol metered-dose
      inhaler (BDA MDI/PT027) as compared with a placebo metered-dose inhaler (placebo MDI) on
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma.
      Subjects will receive each study treatment on separate visits and undergo a treadmill
      exercise challenge test for up to 10 minutes so that the effect of study treatment on
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be evaluated.

    <description>Lung function will be measured by spirometry.
