  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global public health problem. According to literature reports, as of 2016,
      China's obese population has reached more than 90 million and type 2 diabetes mellitus has
      reached more than 100 million, which has brought a serious health and economic burden to
      China. In addition to various health problems such as cardiovascular, osteoarthritis, and
      tumors, obesity can also cause abnormalities in reproductive endocrine. In women, it can
      cause abnormal menstruation, polycystic ovary syndrome, and male obesity can cause secondary
      gonadal. Hypofunction (MOSH). MOSH is an endocrine dysfunction. It is reported to have a
      prevalence of approximately 45% in moderate to severe obesity. In addition, studies have
      pointed out that the prevalence of hypogonadism in men with type 2 diabetes and obesity
      higher. However, there are no studies on the reproductive function of Chinese male patients
      after bariatric surgery. Pre- and post-operative semen will be collected for analysis to
      observe the effect of bariatric surgery on male reproductive function.
