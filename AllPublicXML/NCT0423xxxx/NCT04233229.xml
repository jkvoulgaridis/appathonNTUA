  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop insulin delivery system has the potential to improve the condition of many poorly
      controlled insulin-treated T2D patients.

      A wide acceptance of the AP usage in T2D care will strongly depend on the identification of
      subpopulations and care settings where the AP could significantly improve the risk- and
      cost-benefit balances of T2D management as compared to established practice.

      The aim of this interventional study, therefore, is to investigate whether a therapeutic
      solution combining an automated insulin delivery AP system with a tailored HHP service can
      improve blood glucose control, reduce the rate of acute metabolic complications
      (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia), improve both the patients quality of life and experience,
      and reduce the healthcare related costs in patients with uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes needing
      home nursing care for their daily insulin treatment versus usual care.

        Selection criteria:

          -  1. Male or female patient aged 18 years or older, 2. Type 2 Diabetes diagnosed for at
             least 6 months with a stable authorized antidiabetic therapeutic regimen for 3 months,
             3. Treated with insulin for at least 6 months, 4. Patient with 8.0% ≤ HbA1c &lt;12.0%
             within the last 3 months before selection, 5. Patient with a current minimum of 2
             daily insulin injections and who would benefit of an optimisation, 6. Patient
             requiring long term family nurse's daily assistance at home for performing insulin
             injections and/or glucose monitoring, 7. Total daily insulin dose &lt; 1.5U/kg, 8.
             Patient willing and able to complete the requirements of the study, 9. Recent fundus
             examination (≤3 months) having shown no proliferative retinopathy, 10.Patient not
             living alone, or having a caregiver living nearby who has a telephone and a key to his
             or her home, 11.Patient living in an area covered by a GSM (Global System for Mobile
             Communications) network and not considering a trip outside of France or out of an area
             covered by a GSM network within 30 days of the installation of the &quot;closed-loop&quot;
             insulin therapy system (or &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; one).
