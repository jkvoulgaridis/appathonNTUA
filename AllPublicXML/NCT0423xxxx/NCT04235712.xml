  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Working with a health system, the investigators will recruit practices to participate in the
      pilot study, consent and enroll patients with major depressive disorder, and collect the
      PHQ-9 from those patients at three timepoints (baseline, 6 months post-enrollment, and 12
      months post-enrollment). The PHQ-9 will be captured either at an office visit or directly
      from patients. The investigators will build and implement an open-source SMART on FHIR app to
      collect key data from the EHR, combine that data with the PHQ-9 results, and present the
      measurements back to the clinicians. The investigators will then obtain feedback from
      clinicians on the value and usefulness of the app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a longitudinal, observational pilot study that will assess the utility and value
      displaying the harmonized outcomes data to clinicians in the clinical workflow using an
      open-source, SMART on FHIR app. The app will connect with the site EHR, aggregate EHR and PRO
      data, calculate the outcome measure results, and return the results to the EHR so that they
      are viewable within the clinician workflow. Baseline data on patient characteristics,
      treatments, and symptoms will be combined with longitudinal data on outcomes during the study
      timeframe. All data will be collected from institution electronic medical records (EMRs), PRO
      portals, and other existing data sources, as needed.
