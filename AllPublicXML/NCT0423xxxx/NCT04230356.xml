  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the use of viral specific
      T-lymphocytes (VSTs) to treat viral infections that may happen after allogeneic stem cell
      transplant. Allogeneic means the stem cells come from another person. VSTs are cells
      specially designed to fight viral infections that may happen after a stem cell transplant
      (SCT).

      Stem cell transplant reduces the body's ability to fight infections. Viral infections are a
      common problem after transplant and can cause significant complications. Moreover, treatment
      of viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with families often administering
      prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or patients requiring prolonged
      admissions to the hospital. The medicines can also have side effects like damage to the
      kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study the investigators are trying to
      find a better way to treat these infections.

        SCHEDULED ARM:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipient must be at least 21 days after stem cell infusion

          -  Clinical status must allow tapering of any steroids to &lt; 0.5mg/kg prednisone or other
             steroid equivalent

          -  No critical illness making VST infusion hazardous

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active acute GVHD grades II-IV.

          -  Uncontrolled relapse of malignancy.

          -  Infusion of ATG or alemtuzumab within 2 weeks of VST infusion. Alemtuzumab levels will
             be collected in the second week following stem cell infusion in patients who received
             alemtuzumab as part of their conditioning regimen. The level must be less than or
             equal to 0.15 prior to infusion of VSTs. In patients with level greater than 0.15,
             alemtuzumab levels can be checked serially until a level ≤ 0.15 is obtained. They
             would become eligible for scheduled VST infusion at that point.

        TREATMENT ARM

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Blood adenovirus PCR ≥1,000

          -  Blood CMV PCR ≥ 500

          -  Blood EBV PCR ≥ 9,000

          -  Plasma BKV PCR &gt;1,000

          -  Evidence of invasive adenovirus infection. Adenovirus infection will be defined as the
             presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by PCR or culture from one site such as
             stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx. Adenovirus disease will be defined as the
             presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by culture or PCR from more than 2 sites
             such as stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx.

          -  Evidence of invasive CMV infection, e.g. pneumonitis, retinitis, colitis

          -  Evidence of EBV-associated lymphoproliferation (EBV-LPD) defined as proven EBV-LPD by
             biopsy or probable EBV-LPD defined as an elevated EBV DNA level in the blood
             associated with clinical symptoms (adenopathy or fever or masses on imaging) but
             without biopsy confirmation.

          -  Evidence of symptomatic BK virus infection, which may include symptomatic hemorrhagic
             cystitis

          -  No active acute GVHD grades II-IV

          -  No uncontrolled relapse of malignancy

          -  No infusion of ATG or alemtuzumab within 2 weeks of VST infusion.

          -  Clinical status must allow tapering of any steroids to &lt; 0.5mg/kg prednisone or other
             steroid equivalent
