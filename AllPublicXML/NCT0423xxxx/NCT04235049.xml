  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a chronic infection with significant morbidity and mortality. The
      development of directly acting antivirals (DAA) has dramatically improved the cure rate of
      HCV treatment. People who experience incarceration are disproportionately infected and often
      involved in ongoing transmission of disease. However, despite availability of effective
      treatment, people who experience incarceration are often unable to access this curative
      therapy, and are often not readily engaged in medical care upon release. This perpetuates
      transmission and progression of disease in an incredibly high risk, marginalized population.
      Therefore, in order to effectively eliminate HCV, it is imperative that the epidemic of HCV
      in prisons is addressed, and that models of care are established for treatment of HCV in
      incarcerated individuals, both during and after incarceration.

      As such, the investigators propose a comprehensive model of care to engage incarcerated
      individuals in treatment of HCV upon release from prison. This care is provided in
      conjunction with collocated services to prevent HCV reinfection, including opioid agonist
      therapy. This pilot trial will demonstrate whether a comprehensive model of care can
      effectively cure HCV in recently incarcerated individuals, while simultaneously treating
      opioid use disorder and preventing HCV reinfection.

    <description>Of patients who achieved SVR, 100 inmates will be enrolled for long-term monitoring for re-infection after they have completed treatment. Patients will be seen every 6 months to test for reinfection, however they will not be subject to any medical or behavioral interventions through the study team. Limited opioid agonist therapy may be available as per the standard practice of the DOC, however syringe exchange and other harm reduction services will not be accessible to inmates, per DOC policy.</description>
