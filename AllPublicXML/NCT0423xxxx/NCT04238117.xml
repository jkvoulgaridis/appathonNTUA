  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of women after giving birth have low back pain (LBP), however, LBP is often
      accepted as a normal part of postpartum. Unsolved low back pain undoubtedly affects women's
      physical health and may be negatively affect their psychological health. This study was aimed
      to investigate the efficacy of laser acupuncture therapy (LAT) in postpartum LBP. Postpartum
      women with LBP admitted at a postpartum care center were recruited and randomly assigned to
      the intervention group or the control group. The participants in the intervention group
      underwent 10 sessions/2 weeks of LAT and received standard obstetric care. The participants
      in the control group only received standard obstetric care. Primary outcome measurements were
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and salivary cortisol values. Secondary outcome
      measurements were Chinese versions of the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ),
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) version 2.1and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
