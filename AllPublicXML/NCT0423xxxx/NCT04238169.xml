             neurological, or metabolic dysfunction; physical examination finding or laboratory
             finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the
             use of an investigational drug or puts the patient at high risk for treatment-related
             complications.

         19. Patients diagnosed with a tracheo-oesophageal fistula.
