  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the evidence on the impact of the intestinal microbiome on the Graft Versus Host
      Disease (GVHD) after allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT), it is
      hypothesized that the skin-microbiome may play a role in cutaneous GVHD as well. Therefore,
      this study aims at investigating the skin-microbiota of patients with GVHD after allo-HSCT
      and of patients without GVHD after allo-HSCT.

    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>before transplantation and at week 4, week 12, week 24, week 36 and at week 52 after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>There are 10 questions, covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the patient's life over the previous week. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range form 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>

    <time_frame>before transplantation and at week 4, week 12, week 24, week 36 and at week 52 after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Single‚Äêitem numerical rating scale anchored at 0 and 10, on which 0 represents &quot;no itching&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot;. The patient indicates the overall severity of itching attributable to his or her psoriatic skin condition by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Change in Eppendorf Itch Questionnaire (EIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>before transplantation and at week 4, week 12, week 24, week 36 and at week 52 after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of two pages, which are filled in by the patient. Form 1 presents 80 randomized descriptors. Sensory items are grouped on the left side and more affective or emotional items of different intensity values are found on the right side. Every item is scored within the range of 0 ('not true') to 4 ('describes exactly my itch sensation'). Statistically evaluable intensities can be derived from form 1 for every item. Form 2 deals with temporary and topographic aspects. Anti-itch ('pruritofensive') measures are grouped here and itch intensity is rated on a visual analog scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>before transplantation and at week 4, week 12, week 24, week 36 and at week 52 after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Scores of greater than or equal to 11 on either scale indicate a definitive case.</description>

The first swab serves as baseline reference (ideally taken at the earliest one week after a systemic antibiotic treatment). Swabs will be taken from the neck, back, right hip, buccal oral cavity and the genital mucosae. In patients who develop acute or chronic skin-GVHD additional swabs will be taken from affected skin at the time of diagnosis and then again according to the schedule of the non-lesioned skin swabs.</description>

    <description>During the first visit, a single skin punch biopsy will be taken to state the skin condition and microbiome before allo-HSCT. Further biopsies will only be taken in case of acute or chronic cutaneous GVHD. A 4-6 mm punch biopsy will be taken from the affected skin area and a second one from a nearby unaffected part of the skin. Before the biopsy, skin disinfection will be performed to avoid contamination with surface bacteria.</description>
