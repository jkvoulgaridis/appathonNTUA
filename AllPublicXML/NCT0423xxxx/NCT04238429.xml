  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of a commercially available
      dentifrice containing 10% high cleaning silica base, 0.5% sodium phytate and 0.5% sodium
      pyrophosphate versus a negative control dentifrice on removal of extrinsic stains.

    <textblock>
      There is great concern on the tooth esthetics and color among people, especially young
      adults. Great efforts have been made in order to improve patients' smile. Epidemiological
      studies have reported that dissatisfaction with tooth color ranged from 19.6% to 65.9%,
      depending on different population. An oral health related quality of life questionnaire for
      use among young adults reported that tooth color was the most important concern. This
      dissatisfaction with tooth color has been shown to be associated with increased desire for
      treatments that improve dental aesthetics including tooth whitening dentifrices. Tooth
      whitening products generally help to improve the overall whiteness of teeth, by removing and
      controlling the formation of extrinsic stains. In recent years the interest on the treatment
      of tooth stain with various tooth whitening agents, among which dentifrice containing high
      cleaning silica is widely used.

    <description>Tooth stain of the anterior teeth were measured using the Lobene Stain Index. The index measures the area and intensity of extrinsic tooth stain on the facial and lingual surfaces of the lower anterior teeth and facial surfaces of the upper anterior teeth. The tooth surfaces were divided into two parts: body and gingival. For each part, the stain intensity was assessed using 0-3 scale. 0= No stain; 1=Light stain(yellow to light brown or gray); 2=Moderate stain(medium brown); 3=Heavy stain(dark brown to black).</description>

          <title>Lobene Stain Index of Stain Composite Scores 8 Weeks After Dentifrice Use</title>
          <description>Tooth stain of the anterior teeth were measured using the Lobene Stain Index. The tooth surfaces were divided into two parts: body and gingival. For each part, the stain area was assessed using 0-3 scale and the stain intensity was assessed using 0-3 scale. Lobene Stain Index: Composite for each part is the product of the stain area and intensity scores. The minimum score for Lobene Stain Index: Composite is 0 when both the stain area and intensity scores are 0. The maximum score for Lobene Stain Index: Composite is 9 when both the stain area and intensity scores are 3.</description>
