  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic phase of the study will evaluate the effects of pre-exercise and post-exercise
      ingestion of a multi-ingredient supplement on adaptations to a 6-week exercise program
      consisting of both resistance training and high intensity aerobic exercise, using a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants will complete an
      enrollment/familiarization visit, a baseline testing session, followed by a 6-week supervised
      exercise intervention, and post-testing session identical to baseline testing. Participants
      will be randomized during the baseline session to groups receiving either 1) Active Treatment
      (pre-post supplementation), 2) placebo (noncaloric beverage), or 3) control, not
      participating in exercise or consuming a treatment. During the supervised 6-week resistance
      training program, participants will complete a moderate-intensity warm-up, a full-body
      resistance training workout (2 x per week) and an interval training session (1 x per week).
      Thirty-minutes prior to each training session, and within 15 minutes post-exercise,
      participants will consume their randomly assigned treatment beverage. Body composition, blood
      markers of muscle damage/recovery, strength, and performance tests will be measured before
      (baseline) and after training (Post) to evaluate the effects of supplementation. All data
      collection will be conducted by the Principal Investigator and Research Assistants. All
      subjects will report to the Applied Physiology Laboratory and Human Performance Center in
      Fetzer Hall for all testing and training sessions, which will span approximately 8 weeks.
