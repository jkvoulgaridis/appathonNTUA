  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AION is the main cause of blindness in patients with GCA. High dose steroid is the reference
      treatment of this condition, but medical unmet need remains. Subcutaneous tocilizumab, a
      targeted biotherapy, recently received marketing authorization for the treatment of GCA, but
      only demonstrated at yet that it can allow steroid dose sparing. The aim of this study is to
      assess the benefit of tocilizumab and IV steroids combination or IV steroids alone, in the
      treatment of AION due to GCA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tocilizumab will be proposed to eligible patients as an emergency treatment, in addition to
      the standard high-dose steroid treatment. Each patient will receive the reference treatment,
      i.e. one pulse of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone per day during 3 days, followed by
      1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone, and low dose aspirin. Depending on the randomization, each
      patient will receive the reference treatment only, or will received in addition to the
      reference treatment four subcutaneous injections of tocilizumab 162 mg over one month (1
      injection per week), the first tocilizumab injection being delivered on the same day than the
      first steroid IV pulse. Study visits will take place at 4, 8 and 13 weeks. The primary
      endpoint will be the ocular improvement at W8, defined as an increase of at least two lines
      of visual acuity on the ETRS chart. For each patient, the duration of participation will by
      of 3 months. The study duration is expected to be 15 months.

    <description>Stabilization of vision, as judged at Week 8 after treatment start, correspond to a lack of deterioration :
If the patient can see the light initially, no light perception at W8 will represent a deterioration
If the patient is able to count finger at any distance, but the visual acuity is less than 20/400 on the ETRS chart, a &quot;off chart&quot; visual acuity at W8 will represent a deterioration
If initial visual acuity is equal or more than 20/400, a loss of 2 lines or more on the ETDRS at Week 8 will represent deterioration</description>
