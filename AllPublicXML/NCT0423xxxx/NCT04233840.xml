  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the new adjuvant treatment of
      curative HCC, or the treatment of long-acting interferon P1101 alone, or the use of
      long-acting interferon P1101 and subsequent treatment of anti-PD1, and any efficacy in
      reducing the recurrence rate of patients after surgery.
