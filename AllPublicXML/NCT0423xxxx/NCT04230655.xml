  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Sweden, approximately 1.3 million adults have obesity. Obesity decreases quality of life
      (QoL) and increases the risk of diseases such as type 2-diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD), cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, weight loss improves QoL
      and decreases the risk for obesity-related comorbidities.

      A treatment combination using a low energy diet (LED) and group treatment based on cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT), leads to 18 percent weight loss after 6 months. Six months
      treatment with an intragastric balloon (IGB) leads to 13 percent weight loss. However, both
      treatments are usually followed by weight regain. Combining these treatments has not been
      studied before but could lead to better weight maintenance.

      The hypothesis is that treatment of adults with obesity, with LED, CBT and IGB, leads to
      greater weight loss after 1 year compared to treatment with LED and CBT only.

      The study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial, with a 2-year follow-up. One hundred
      and ten adults, age 30-65 years, with a BMI of 30-45 kg/m^2 will be included. All
      participants will receive 6 months of LED, followed by randomization to either 6 months with
      IGB or a control group without IGB. All participants receive CBT-based group treatment during
      12 months and followed up after 2 years.

      If the treatment combination of LED, CBT and IGB leads to significant weight loss and
      improved weight maintenance, increased QoL and reductions of comorbidities and costs of
      health care are expected. Effects of treatment on eating behavior, NAFLD, physical activity,
      psychological parameters, the gut microbiota, gut permeability and metabolomics will be
      assessed.

    <description>All participants in the control group are treated with LED and CBT-based group treatment as described below.
All participants (control and intervention) receive 2.5-hour sessions of CBT-based group treatment every 4 weeks for 1 year. Participants are randomly assigned to groups of 8-16 participants. Two groups of about the same size start simultaneously.
The LED phase (from baseline to 24 weeks) consists of 12 weeks with 4 portions/day of liquid meal replacements, for a total of 800-880 kcal/day, followed by a 12-week slow phasing out to a regular diet. Thereafter, an energy-reduced diet (1400-1600 kcal/day) is recommended.</description>

    <description>An IGB (Orbera IGB, Apollo Endosurgery Inc., Austin, Texas, (CE certified)) is set in place endoscopically by a gastroenterologist at Örebro University Hospital, Region Örebro county, and is left in the stomach for 6 months. A proton-pump inhibitor is prescribed to counteract an increased risk to develop a gastric ulcer. During the first 2 weeks, dietary adjustments are necessary to adapt to the IGB. Thereafter, an energy-reduced diet (1400-1600 kcal/day) is recommended identical to the control group. The IGB is removed endoscopically after 6 months IGB treatment.</description>
