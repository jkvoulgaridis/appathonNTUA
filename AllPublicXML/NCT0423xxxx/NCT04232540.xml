  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of
      delivery of the investigational &quot;MedViewer&quot; intervention in adult patients living with HIV
      who have been prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) medications. The Medviewer uses Infra-red (IR)
      matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) technology for mass
      spectrometry imaging (MSI) to analyze patient hair samples to provide information on ARV
      adherence in real-time.

      The study has two different groups of participants: the patients, and their clinician
      providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a larger research program that is investigating a novel non-invasive
      approach to rapidly quantify ARV concentrations and provide evidence of drug ingestion. The
      ultimate goal is to provide clinicians and patients feedback on ARV adherence. Infra-red (IR)
      matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) technology for mass
      spectrometry imaging (MSI) is used to visualize and quantify ARV concentrations in hair. The
      IR-MALDESI MSI has been labeled the &quot;MedViewer&quot;.

      Patient participants will be scheduled for the sampling visit to correspond with their next
      appointment at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Infectious Disease (ID) clinic. Patient
      participants will be asked to arrive to their clinic appointment at least two hours prior to
      the scheduled time to be consented and enrolled. If eligible and enrolled in the study,
      patient participants will have a small hair sample (5 strands) plucked from a discrete
      location on the back of their head. Patient participants will also have a small blood sample
      collected. The results from the MedViewer test will be provided to both the patient and their
      provider, in order to facilitate a discussion around medication adherence. After receiving
      the results, all participants will complete a brief questionnaire about their experience with
      the MedViewer.

      As this is a feasibility study, results from the Medviewer test will not be used to make
      clinical decisions related to care.
