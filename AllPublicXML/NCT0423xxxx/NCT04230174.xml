  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using magnetic resonance-PET (MR-PET) imaging with [11C]PBR28, a second-generation 18kDa
      translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer, we have previously demonstrated abnormally high TSPO
      expression, indicative of microglia activation, across different brain tissue compartments of
      multiple sclerosis (MS) patients1.

      In this study, we propose to study the efficacy of ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal
      antibody that has been shown to decrease neuroinflammation in relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis (RRMS) and progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

      We will test these effects by studying a cohort of 24 MS patients (12 RRMS, 12 progressive
      MS). Participants will be studied before (within 3 months prior to initiating treatment) and
      after treatment with ocrelizumab (~12 month follow up), a therapeutic drug that will be part
      of their standard medical care. We will use [11C]PBR28 to help determine changes in
      neuroinflammation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ocrelizumab treatment on
      neuroinflammation by analyzing the uptake and distribution of [11C]PBR28 in individuals with
      multiple sclerosis. The specific aims of the current study are:

        1. To assess whether treatment with ocrelizumab in subjects with either relapsing-remitting
           MS or progressive MS is associated with decreased [11C]PBR28 binding in the cortex and
           white matter (lesions and normal appearing white matter), suggesting reduced
           neuroinflammation.

        2. To assess whether changes in neuroinflammation under ocrelizumab treatment, as measured
           by [11C]PBR28 uptake at 12-month follow up relative to baseline, are associated with
           changes in structural MR metrics of brain tissue damage including white matter lesion
           load, cortical atrophy, and demyelination in the cortex and in the normal-appearing
           white matter as measured by magnetization transfer ratio (MTR).

        3. To explore whether changes in functional and structural imaging metrics under
           ocrelizumab are associated with changes in clinical outcome measures.
