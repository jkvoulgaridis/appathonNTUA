  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza vaccine uptake remains low worldwide, inflicting substantial costs to public health
      and health systems. Messages promoting social welfare have been shown to increase vaccination
      intentions, and it has been recommended that health professionals communicate the socially
      beneficial aspects of vaccination. This study aims to provide the first test whether this
      prosocial vaccination hypothesis applies to the actual vaccination behaviour of high-risk
      patients by comparing the effects of two motivational messages for promoting vaccination at a
      tertiary care public hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.

    <description>Difference in the number of patients in each arm who agree to receive influenza vaccine following the introduction of the pamphlet. The first half of the pamphlet contains information about the the influenza vaccine and the risk groups who are vulnerable to influenza-associated serious diseases. The second half introduces the self-benefit message. And the final part asks if the participant wants to receive the influenza vaccine now.</description>

    <description>A pamphlet consisting of a short text and an abstract figure. The top half of the pamphlet described the official criteria for qualifying to be in the risk group. Bottom half indicated that one can gain immunity against influenza by getting the vaccine, and gaining immunity would lower the chances of transmitting the disease to others. The figure included one smiley face surrounded by three other smiley faces.</description>
