  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Purpose: Ankle fractures represent one of the most common fractures in North
      America. Surgical fixation is often required in the presence of dislocation or instability
      and has been shown to have a high rate of success. Following surgical fixation, physical
      therapy is commonly utilized to assist in regaining function. Advice alone has been shown to
      be non-inferior to traditional physical therapy for patients post-ankle fracture in two
      studies. The results of these studies have yet to be repeated in the US. It is the intent of
      this study to investigate the feasibility of a large clinical trial comparing the results of
      traditional physical therapy and an internet-based telerehabilitation program. Following
      surgical repair of ankle fractures, patients will be randomized to traditional rehabilitation
      or telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation may represent an alternative patient option to
      traditional physical therapy following ankle fracture repair. The results of this study will
      inform the design of larger multi-site clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of
      telerehabilitation for this patient population.

    <measure>Change in self-reported function</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, a patient-reported function of the lower extremity. Scores range from 0-80 with lower scores indicating increased impairment levels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey. This is a 12-Item global health questionnaire with a physical and mental component scores. Utilizes a t-score method standardized to the US population. Positive t-scores indicate better than average quality of life and negative t-score values represent lower than average quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ankle range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Goniometric measurements (degrees) of ankle dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in plantarflexion strength</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Plantarflexion strength as measured by the heel-rise endurance test. Range of 0-25 heel rises, with higher numbers of heel rises indicating increased strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in static single leg balance</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Single leg balance measured by the time (seconds) a patient can stand on one foot. Range of 0-60 seconds. Longer duration indicates improved balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory short form</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Brief Pain Inventory short form. This is a 15-item questionnaire resulting in scores for pain severity and pain interference. Each of these is scored 0-10 with higher scores indicating increased pain severity/interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction as assessed by a 0-10 satisfaction scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported measure of satisfaction with treatment received and progress made while recovering from injury. Will be measured on a scale of 0-10, with higher scores indicating increased satisfaction with treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Out of pocket cost</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported estimate of patients' out of pocket costs associated with rehabilitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Travel time (hours)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported estimate of time spent traveling to and from rehabilitation appointments.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>12-Item questionnaire assessing self-efficacy for completing assigned home exercises. Scored 0-72 with higher scores indicating increased self-efficacy.</description>
