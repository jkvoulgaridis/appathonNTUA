  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is an important developmental phase for prevention and intervention initiatives
      for well-being and mental health. Accordingly, school has been recommended as an optimal
      location for such initiatives. Universal programmes - programmes that are designated for all
      individuals in a population - have a number of advantages, including reducing the risk of
      stigma and yielding high recruitment rates.

      A Lust for Life is a universal school-based multi-component intervention whose target is to
      build well-being and emotional resilience in adolescents. The programme was informed by
      evidence-based psychological approaches including cognitive behaviour therapy, positive
      psychology and mindfulness and consists of six lessons, each delivered by the adolescents'
      school teacher on a weekly basis. The lessons involve classroom discussions, videos,
      classroom activities and homework assignments.

      Study participants will complete the Adolescent Mental Health Continuum-Short Form,
      Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, Emotional Literacy and Intervention Inventory-Pupil
      Checklist, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale for Children at pre-intervention. Following
      this, schools randomly assigned to the experimental group will receive A Lust for Life, while
      those randomly assigned to the control group will be placed on a twelve-week waiting list.
      The questionnaire measures and a Brief Satisfaction Scale will be completed by participants
      at post-intervention. In addition, a six-week follow-up assessment will determine whether the
      effects of the programme are sustained over a period of time. The programme will be delivered
      in the waiting list control group schools after the six-week follow-up assessment.
