    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of an antidepressant medication and placebo on the brain
      functioning of normal subjects. In this study, recordings of brain electrical activity are
      being used to detect and monitor the response to treatment with venlafaxine IR (Effexor), a
      drug used for the treatment of depression. The intent of this study is to test specific
      hypotheses regarding:

        1. long-term brain effects of a single course of antidepressant treatment

        2. pharmaco-conditioning effects underlying antidepressant tolerance/sensitization

        3. brain functional response to initial versus subsequent antidepressant trials in normal
           healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a lifelong and recurrent illness, such that many
      individuals require multiple courses of antidepressant medication treatment. While some
      patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each
      unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This
      raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment
      may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or
      classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as
      pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned
      stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a
      conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of
      placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects
      (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated
      exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant
      treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive
      courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific
      hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential
      confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would
      suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects
      who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical
      conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of
      antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant
      treatment.

    <masking_description>We compared EEG outcomes for those subjects who had been randomly assigned to blinded treatment with venlafaxine (antidepressant-experienced, n=2) vs. placebo (antidepressant-naive, n=4). All subjects received 1 week of placebo followed by 4 weeks of venlafaxine. Subjects were blinded to the treatment during both phases of the study using lookalike capsules. Outcomes assessors and the treating physician also were blinded to treatment condition.</masking_description>

    <measure>Changes in Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG) Prefrontal Cordance (PFC) Over Time (4 Weeks).</measure>
    <time_frame>Average over 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cordance values were calculated from conventional 'absolute' and 'relative' qEEG power measures using a three-step procedure. First, EEG power values were computed using a re-attributional electrode montage. Second, the absolute and relative power values were z-transformed to measure deviation from the mean values for each electrode site s in each frequency band f for that recording, yielding Anorm(s,f) and Rnorm(s,f), respectively. Third, these z-scores were summed to yield a cordance &quot;intensity&quot; value, Z, for each electrode in each frequency band where Z(s,f) = Anorm(s,f) + Rnorm(s,f). Analyses for this report focused on changes-from-baseline theta-band (8-12Hz) cordance in the prefrontal region (electrodes Fp1, Fpz, Fp2). Results are defined in terms of positive and negative change where a positive change represents an increased physiologic and behavioral response to the drug (sensitization) and a negative change represents an increased tolerance to the drug (habituation).</description>

            <other_analysis_desc>Group differences in PFC changes over time during administration of venlafaxine were assessed using mixed-model analysis.
we compared brain functional changes over the course of venlafaxine treatment between antidepressant-experienced and antidepressant-naïve subjects using linear mixed model analysis (random intercept model) conducted using full maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Changes in PFC were calculated from the end of placebo lead-in to 48 hours, and 1, 2, and 4 weeks, yielding a within-group factor of time with four levels. We employed a first-order autoregressive covariance structure to reflect our assumption that PFC measurements closer together in time would be more highly correlated.</other_analysis_desc>

        <title>Changes in Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG) Prefrontal Cordance (PFC) Over 1 Week Placebo lead-in.</title>
        <description>Cordance values were calculated from conventional 'absolute' and 'relative' qEEG power measures using a three-step procedure. First, EEG power values were computed using a re-attributional electrode montage. Second, the absolute and relative power values were z-transformed to measure deviation from the mean values for each electrode site s in each frequency band f for that recording, yielding Anorm(s,f) and Rnorm(s,f), respectively. Third, these z-scores were summed to yield a cordance &quot;intensity&quot; value, Z, for each electrode in each frequency band where Z(s,f) = Anorm(s,f) + Rnorm(s,f). Analyses for this report focused on changes-from-baseline theta-band (8-12Hz) cordance in the prefrontal region (electrodes Fp1, Fpz, Fp2).
