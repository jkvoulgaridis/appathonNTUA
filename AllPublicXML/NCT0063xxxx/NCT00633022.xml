    <measure>Change From Baseline of Mean of Maximum Tissue to Background Ratio (TBR) in the Qualifying Artery, Following 12 Weeks of Treatment in the Setting of Chronic Statin Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -14 to -1) and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Qualifying artery was defined as the artery (left or right carotid or ascending aorta) with the highest segmental mean of maximum (max) TBR at Baseline. The TBR of the qualifying segment was to be ≥ 1.6. If more than one artery qualified, the hottest (greatest mean of max TBR) artery was the qualifying artery. Baseline was defined as the value between Days -14 to -1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-treatment values.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline of the 'Most Diseased Segment (MSD)' Average Maximum TBR in the Qualifying Artery Following 12 Weeks of Treatment With GW856553 or Placebo in the Setting of Chronic Statin Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -14 to -1) and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Most diseased segment (MDS) mean of max TBR was mean of all the slice max TBR that compose the most diseased segment. TBR was derived by dividing the arterial vessel wall SUV (tissue) by the background venous blood pool SUV. Unless noted otherwise, the tissue max SUV value for each ROI was used as inputs to the TBR. Baseline was defined as the value between Days -14 to -1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-treatment values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Blood Concentration of High Sensitivity C-reactive Protein (Hs-CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84</time_frame>
    <description>CRP is a protein that the liver makes when there is inflammation in the body. It's also called a marker of inflammation, and can be measured with an hs-CRP test. Blood samples were collected to analyze hs-CRP. Baseline was defined as the value on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-treatment values.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98</time_frame>
    <description>All 12-lead ECGs were obtained after the participant had rested in the supine position for at least 15 minutes. All ECGs were evaluated by the principal investigator or designee for any other abnormality of potential clinical importance (PCI). Data for abnormal ECG findings have been reported under abnormal - Not clinically significant (NCS) and Abnormal - Clinically significant (CS) categories. Data only for categories with values have been presented.</description>

    <description>A urine dipstick test is a basic diagnostic tool used to determine pathological changes in a participant's urine in standard urinalysis. Data was analyzed for urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones and urine protein ranging from 2+, trace, 1+, 3+, 1+or 1/4, 3+ or 1 and trace or 1/10, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with established atherosclerosis were planned to be enrolled across 4 sites in the United Kingdom from 02 June 2008 to 03 December 2009. Participants were screened within 45 days prior to the first dose and underwent radiological scan within 14 days prior to the first dose.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in the study to receive oral dose of Losmapimod 7.5 milligram (mg) twice daily, Losmapimod 7.5 mg once daily or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline of Mean of Maximum Tissue to Background Ratio (TBR) in the Qualifying Artery, Following 12 Weeks of Treatment in the Setting of Chronic Statin Therapy</title>
        <description>Qualifying artery was defined as the artery (left or right carotid or ascending aorta) with the highest segmental mean of maximum (max) TBR at Baseline. The TBR of the qualifying segment was to be ≥ 1.6. If more than one artery qualified, the hottest (greatest mean of max TBR) artery was the qualifying artery. Baseline was defined as the value between Days -14 to -1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-treatment values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the 'Most Diseased Segment (MSD)' Average Maximum TBR in the Qualifying Artery Following 12 Weeks of Treatment With GW856553 or Placebo in the Setting of Chronic Statin Therapy</title>
        <description>Most diseased segment (MDS) mean of max TBR was mean of all the slice max TBR that compose the most diseased segment. TBR was derived by dividing the arterial vessel wall SUV (tissue) by the background venous blood pool SUV. Unless noted otherwise, the tissue max SUV value for each ROI was used as inputs to the TBR. Baseline was defined as the value between Days -14 to -1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-treatment values.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
