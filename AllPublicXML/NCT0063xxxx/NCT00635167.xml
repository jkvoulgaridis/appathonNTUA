  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid tumors, including prostate cancer, commonly exhibit tumor-associated neovascularity
      (growth of new blood vessels to feed the tumor) with increased microvessel density. Systemic,
      hormonal, and radiotherapy treatments typically decrease or suppress tumor - associated
      vascularity through several mechanisms, including apoptosis (process of cell death) and
      anti-angiogenic pathways (ways to destroy new blood vessel growth). Previously at the
      investigators' center, they have demonstrated that increased prostatic vascularity (blood
      vessels defined to prostate) detected ultrasonographically correlated with disease free
      survival after radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of entire prostate), and may be
      indicative of higher grade, higher stage disease. The significance of prostate neovascularity
      in response to treatment with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (standard of care) has not
      been well studied. The investigators hypothesize that prostate cancer that recurs after
      radiotherapy may exhibit measurable patterns of tumor-associated vascularity, which may
      represent a minimally invasive marker of cancer stage, grade and response to treatment. The
      investigators propose a pilot study to assess the feasibility of serial enhanced transrectal
      ultrasonography (TRUS) examinations during and after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
