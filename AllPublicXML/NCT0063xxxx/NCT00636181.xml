    <measure>Apnea-Hypopnea Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 180 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The Apnea-Hyopnea Index is the number of average number of apneas (complete pauses in breathing lasting at least 10 seconds) and hypopneas (decreases in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds) per hour of sleep. This data was compared from the polysomnography (sleep study) data after the first night of device use and at 180 days</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Hours of Nightly Use.</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The average hours of nightly use is the average number of hours the participant used there device overnight at home during the study.</description>

    <measure>Psychomotor Vigilance Task - Number of Lapses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 180 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Psychomotor Vigilance Task-PVT is a 10-min attention/vigilance test. To measure trends of vigilance after 180 days of home use randomized sleep apnea trial. This measured how quickly participants reacted to visual stimulus and counted number of lapses.
Lapses (errors of omission) are measured or usually defined as reaction Times ≥ 500 ms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 180 Days</time_frame>
    <description>FOSQ is a quality of life questionnaire for sleep disorders. It's a 30 question survey with 5 subgroups: general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2 questions),activity level (9 questions), vigilance (7 questions) and intimate relationships &amp; sexual activity (4 questions).
Scores are provided on a 0 to 4 scale:
0- I don't do this activity for other reasons or missing response
1- Yes, extreme difficulty 4- no difficulty
The average score was calculated based upon average sub-scores. The total score was,calculated using the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying the mean by the number of subscales. The range of scores for the total score is 5-20. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. The lower the score the more difficulty a person has carrying out certain activities because they are too sleepy or tired.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes Toward Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 180 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes Toward Use Questionnaire (ATUQ) a self-efficacy scale based on psychological theories of behavior change and modified from one developed by Stepnowsky and Marler this outcome focused on confidence, expectations and importance.
Confidence is a 5 question survey, it is measured on a scale of 1 to 5 1- disagree completely and 5 being agree completely. The scores range from 5 to 25 with 25 being extremely confident.
Importance is a 11 question survey, it is measured on a scale of 1 to 5 1- disagree completely and 5 being agree completely. The importance ATU was combined with Exceptions survey, which is 4 questions. The expectations survey is measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all effective and 5 extremely effective. The scores range from 15 to 75 with 75 being extremely important/ extremely effective.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Assessment of Therapy Comfort.</measure>
    <time_frame>30, 90, and 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>visual analog scales where used to assess the question &quot;in the last month how do you rate the overall comfort of the mask&quot;?
0 = very uncomfortable to 100 = very comfortable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a test that measures sleepiness during daily life activities. This is an 8 question survey.
Scores are provided on a 0 to 3 scale:
0 = no chance of dozing
= slight chance of dozing
= moderate chance of dozing
= high chance of dozing
Scores range from 0 to 24. The higher the total number, the higher the overall sleepiness.</description>

        <title>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</title>
        <description>FOSQ is a quality of life questionnaire for sleep disorders. It's a 30 question survey with 5 subgroups: general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2 questions),activity level (9 questions), vigilance (7 questions) and intimate relationships &amp; sexual activity (4 questions).
Scores are provided on a 0 to 4 scale:
0- I don't do this activity for other reasons or missing response
1- Yes, extreme difficulty 4- no difficulty
The average score was calculated based upon average sub-scores. The total score was,calculated using the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying the mean by the number of subscales. The range of scores for the total score is 5-20. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. The lower the score the more difficulty a person has carrying out certain activities because they are too sleepy or tired.</description>

        <title>Epworth Sleepiness Scale</title>
        <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a test that measures sleepiness during daily life activities. This is an 8 question survey.
Scores are provided on a 0 to 3 scale:
0 = no chance of dozing
= slight chance of dozing
= moderate chance of dozing
= high chance of dozing
Scores range from 0 to 24. The higher the total number, the higher the overall sleepiness.</description>
