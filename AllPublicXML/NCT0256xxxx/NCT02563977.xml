    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to perform an evaluation of the structural changes in the
      abdominal wall after harvesting a DIEP flap in breast reconstruction.

      14 women undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction were recruited to the study
      and underwent a 2 year postoperative CT scan of the abdomen (without contrast).

      Structural changes were assessed by comparing the abdominal CT scans performed prior to
      surgery with the 2 year postoperative CT scans.

      The purpose of this study was to perform an evaluation of the structural changes in the
      abdominal wall after harvesting a DIEP flap in breast reconstruction.

      14 women undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction were recruited to the study
      and underwent a 2 year postoperative CT scan of the abdomen (without contrast).

      Structural changes were assessed by comparing the abdominal CT scans performed prior to
      surgery with the 2 year postoperative CT scans.

      The following structural changes were evaluated at four specific levels of the abdomen by two
      radiologists (among the authors): 1) rectus diastasis, 2) thickness and width of the rectus
      muscles, 3) thickness of the adipose tissue, 4) hernias (in the zone between the xiphoid
      process and the symphysis).

      The measurement levels chosen were: 1) 7 cm below the xiphoid process, 2) umbilicus level, 3)
      &quot;central zone&quot; (between level 2 and 4), 4) 5 cm above the symphysis

      Statistical analysis were performed to see if the structural measurements were significantly
      different comparing preoperative CT versus 2 year postoperative CT.

        14 women consecutively undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction with a DIEP
        flap were identified and recruited to participate in the study. The patients were informed
        about of risks and benefits and gave written consent prior to participation. All smokers
        stopped smoking 4 weeks prior to surgery
