    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to develop and test the effectiveness of a 24 month,
      patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable obesity treatment program delivered within primary
      care, inclusive of an underserved population. Half of the clinics received a behavioral
      intervention delivered in a primary care setting and half of the clinics received usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster-randomized, two-arm controlled trial in primary care settings. A
      total of 18 primary care clinics inclusive of low income populations with a high percentage
      of African Americans from urban and rural areas across Louisiana were randomized to either 1)
      intervention or 2) usual care. The sample includes 803 patients with obesity (BMI 30-50
      kg/m2) (18 clinics, median of 40.5 patients / clinic). The primary aim of this trial is to
      develop and test the effectiveness of a 24 month, patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable
      obesity treatment program delivered within primary care, inclusive of an underserved
      population. Patients in the intervention arm attended weekly (16 in-person) sessions in the
      first six months, followed by monthly sessions for the remaining 18 months. The behavioral
      intervention was delivered by a trained health coach embedded in the primary care clinic.
      Primary Care Practitioners in the intervention arm received a series of webinars on obesity
      science to help them manage and treat obese patients. Patients assigned to the usual care arm
      will continue to interact with their Primary Care Practitioner according to their usual
      schedule, and will receive a series of newsletters on topics of interest, including
      importance of sleep for health, brain and memory health, goal setting, smoking cessation,
      etc. Primary Care Practitioners in the usual care arm received a webinar describing the
      current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approach to reimbursing for obesity
      treatment, and a reminder informational brochure will be sent to the Primary Care
      Practitioners each year. Patients in both arms were assessed on primary and secondary outcome
      measures at baseline, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of intervention.
