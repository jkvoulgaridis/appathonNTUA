  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part, multiple study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      DS-8201a in patients with advanced solid malignant tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is one single group of participants in two periods. It is therefore not
      randomized. The dosage strength will change during the study but all participants will
      receive the same study drug DS-8201a. So the study is not a true 2 arm study, it is a 2 part
      study.
