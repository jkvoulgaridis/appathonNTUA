    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, 3-part rollover study in subjects with CF who are
      homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who participated in studies
      VX13-661-103 (Study 103, NCT02070744), VX14-661-106 (Study 106, NCT02347657), VX14-661-107
      (Study 107, NCT02516410), VX14-661-108 (Study 108, NCT02392234), VX14-661-109 (Study 109,
      NCT02412111), and VX14-661-111 (Study 111, NCT02508207). The study is designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor.

        <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Data are reported separately for Placebo-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received placebo in parent study 106 and TEZ/IVA in current study 110) and TEZ/IVA-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received TEZ/IVA in both parent study 106 and in current study 110) as per pre-specified analysis plan. Baseline was defined as the parent study baseline except for Placebo-TEZ/IVA category, for which baseline was study 110 baseline.</description>

        <population>The 106/110 efficacy set included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A and rolled over from parent study 106 and had pre-defined CFTR genotypes.</population>

        <title>Part A: Absolute Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Domain Score for 108/110 Efficacy Set</title>
        <description>The CFQ-R is a validated participant-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for participants with cystic fibrosis. Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms, score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health-related quality of life. Data are reported separately for Placebo-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received placebo in parent study 108 and TEZ/IVA in current study 110); IVA-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received IVA monotherapy in parent study 108 and TEZ/IVA in current study 110); and TEZ/IVA-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received TEZ/IVA in both parent study 108 and in current study 110) as per pre-specified analysis plan. Baseline was defined as the parent study baseline.</description>

        <description>The z-score is a statistical measure to describe whether a mean was above or below the standard. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Data are reported separately for Placebo-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received placebo in parent study 106 and TEZ/IVA in current study 110) and TEZ/IVA-TEZ/IVA category (participants who received TEZ/IVA in both parent study 106 and in current study 110) as per pre-specified analysis plan. Baseline was defined as the parent study baseline except for Placebo-TEZ/IVA category, for which baseline was study 110 baseline.</description>
