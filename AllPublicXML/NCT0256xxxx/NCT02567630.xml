      This is a prospective interventional study involving young children who will all receive
      non-invasive, passive assessments of sensory and motor function. In addition a subpopulation
      of young children with cerebral palsy will participate in a randomized controlled trial of
      constraint-induced movement therapy, a routinely prescribed therapy used in clinical practice
      for children with motor difficulties. The study attempts to apply a rigorous scientific
      approach to study a widely used but poorly studied practice. The design is an RCT with
      wait-list controls to allow all children to benefit from the therapy, even if they are
      randomized to the control group. All children, regardless of group allocation will continue
      with their standard of care occupational and physical therapy throughout the study.

    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in childhood.1 It affects 3.6/100
      children in the US2 with ~10,000 new diagnoses every year. The prevalence of CP in developing
      countries is estimated to be ~5-10 times greater. CP is a disorder resulting from sensory and
      motor impairments due to perinatal brain injury, with lifetime consequences that range from
      poor adaptive and social function to communication and emotional disturbances,9 all
      contributing to a shortened life expectancy. The societal costs are difficult to estimate but
      the financial burden is well over $1 M per life affected. A growing number of evidence-based
      therapies aim to improve gross motor function through changes in body structures and function
      in children with CP (e.g. hip surveillance, surgery). However, infants with CP have a
      fundamental disadvantage in recovering motor function: they do not receive accurate sensory
      feedback from their movements, leading to neglect of an affected extremity and difficulty
      learning new movements, a process called developmental disregard (DD). As a consequence, even
      children who receive time- and resource-intensive standard therapies have stable or declining
      motor function and developmental trajectories that do not &quot;catch up&quot; to those of typically
      developing children. DD can then lead to school-age learning problems, decreased
      participation in physical and social activities and costly long-term mental and physical
      morbidities.

      Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is one of the few effective neurorehabilitative
      strategies shown to improve upper extremity motor function in adults and older children with
      CP, potentially overcoming developmental disregard. It is mainly applicable to CP patients
      who are diagnosed with asymmetric or hemiparetic forms of the disorder, in which one side of
      the body is more affected than the other. CIMT is based on the premise that preferential use
      of an affected upper extremity (by constraining the less affected one), and shaping with
      repetition of movement by skilled therapists, can overcome neglect and restore function of
      that extremity.

      The investigators are conducting a randomized trial of CIMT in children with CP using a
      wait-list control group. This design allows every child with CP to eventually receive the
      treatment and avoids issues of equipoise. The RCT portion of the study extends only for a
      7-month period, from baseline to 6 months after the 1-month CIMT ends. For CP wait-listed
      controls, the study continues for 6 months following the CMIT intervention, separate from the
      completed RCT. We will reference data from both groups to a cohort of typically developing
      (TD) children to determine developmental trajectories.

    <description>We will use a motion analysis system tracks reflective markers at a rate of 240 Hz with spatial precision at the 1-mm level to capture movement in three-dimensional space. Markers will be positioned bilaterally on the head of the second metacarpal bone and on the object. Tracker software will be used to determine the three-dimensional position of the hand as it approaches each object, and to construct segments, angles and moments using Matlab software.
For each trial, approach velocity and movement units (marked by changes in speed or position) will be calculated. A single movement unit is defined as the portion of reach between one acceleration and another. The sum composite of movement units in one reach attempt is defined as smoothness. The motion tracking data will also be used to determine the time from presentation to first contact, time from first contact to grasp and approach velocity on the unilateral task.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post intervention (1 month), and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>A high-density array of 128 electrodes embedded in soft sponges (Geodesic Sensor Net, EGI, Inc., Eugene, OR) will be used to record ERPs with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, filters set to 0.1-400 Hz. All electrodes will be referred to Cz and re-referenced offline to an average reference. Recording of brainwaves will be controlled by Net Station (v. 4.3; EGI, Inc., Eugene, OR). E-Prime (v. 2.0, PST, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) software will control stimulus delivery. Air puffs will be delivered using a custom-made apparatus with two flexible nozzles, one positioned approximately 0.5&quot; below the palm of hand secured in a molded soft holder (puff condition), the other placed in proximity but directed away (sham condition). The pressure at the skin surface is 5 psi, or less than the pressure of the smallest microfilament used to test for neuropathies. For each hand, 60 puffs will be presented randomly interspersed with 60 sham trials.</description>

    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley III) — 3rd Edition</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post intervention (1 month), and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley III is the gold standard for the evaluation of former NICU graduates, and we have extensive experience using it in the Follow-Up Clinic. The motor scales provide a developmental and functional assessment, address unimanual as well as bimanual skills, are normed against a large population and designed to be adjusted for varying degrees of prematurity.
The Bayley fine motor items for 6-24 months (score range: 0-42) measure prehension, motor planning, grasping patterns, and eye-hand coordination. The examiner is masked to intervention vs. control group membership and administers the fine motor subscale twice, repeating unilateral items for right and left hands. Most (about 80%) of the Bayley fine motor items for infants aged 6 to 24 months require unilateral reach and grasp.
In addition to standard testing, separate scores will be obtained to characterize the difference between more and less affected extremity.</description>
