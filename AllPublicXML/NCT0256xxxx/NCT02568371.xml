    <textblock>
      The bio-Share project aims at collecting blood samples in students participating in the
      i-Share cohort (www.i-share.fr). Investigators aim at setting up a platform that will enable
      investigators in the future to study biological determinants of conditions that affect young
      adults and to test certain hypotheses on the pathophysiology and mechanisms underlying
      diseases occurring both at a young age and later in life (as early exposures may also impact
      late onset diseases)

      The i-Share cohort was set up to study various important aspects of students' health and to
      better understand early mechanisms contributing to the occurrence of common diseases
      representing an important public health burden. The i-Share cohort is funded by an
      &quot;investment for the future grant&quot; from the French National Research Agency
      (ANR-10-COHO-05-01) with the aim to recruit 30000 students at the University of Bordeaux, and
      a few additional partner universities in France and abroad (www.i-share.fr).

      The bio-Share study is a biological repository embedded within the i-Share study, aiming at
      collecting blood samples (for genetic analyses as well as measurement of other biomarkers)
      from a subset of 2000 i-Share participants volunteering for this ancillary project.

      The goal is to set up a platform that will enable investigators in the future to study
      biological determinants of conditions that affect young adults and to test certain hypotheses
      on the pathophysiology and mechanisms underlying diseases occurring both at a young age and
      later in life (as early exposures may also impact late onset diseases).

      The biobank will comprise the following biological materials: plasma, serum, whole blood, red
      blood cells, DNA, RNA. Levels of fasting glucose and lipid levels (total cholesterol,
      HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides) will be returned to participants.
