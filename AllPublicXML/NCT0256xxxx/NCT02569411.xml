  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the impact of incentivizing authors of RCTs that
      are eligible for a systematic review and meta-analysis, versus usual contact strategies to
      obtain original IPD

Authors were first contacted in June 2016, where we sent: a) an email requesting their IPD, b) email reminders (4 in total) at 2, 6, 10, and 14-week intervals after the initial email, c) reminders by post in week 7, and d) reminders via telephone in week 15.</description>
