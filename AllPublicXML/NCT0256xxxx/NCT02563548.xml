      This is a Phase 1b study evaluating a combination of PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab in
      hyaluronan-high (HA-high) participants with relapsed/refractory non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and HA-high participants with relapsed/refractory gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC).

      Study involves dose escalation phase (completed in Nov-2016) to assess the safety and
      tolerability of PEGPEM (PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase [PEGPH20] combined with
      pembrolizumab [Keytruda®]) and to find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) ; and an expansion
      phase to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of PEGPEM in stage III b/IV NSCLC and
      relapsed/refractory GAC participants. Plan was to include approximately 51 HA-high
      participants (30 NSCLC and 21 GAC participants) in the dose expansion phase on the obtained
      RP2D from dose escalation phase of the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. A total of 56 participants were enrolled (35 with gastric adenocarcinoma [GAC] and 21 with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>14 participants (10 with GAC and 4 with NSCLC) were enrolled in dose escalation part. Due to evolving standard-of-care in the immuno-oncology treatment landscape, this study discontinued further enrollment on 31 May 2018. At the time of the early termination, 42 participants (25 with GAC and 17 with NSCLC) had been enrolled in dose expansion part.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dose date until the first occurrence of either radiographic or clinical disease progression as determined by the Investigator or death from any cause before discontinuation from treatment. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in tumor burden from nadir. PFS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>
