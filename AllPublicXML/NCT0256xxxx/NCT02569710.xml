        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has provided written consent

          2. In the Investigator's opinion, the participant is able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol stated restrictions and is likely to
             complete the study as planned

          3. Male or female, 18-70 years of age

          4. Body mass index (BMI) 18-35 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), inclusive

          5. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening

          6. Female participants must either:

               -  not be of childbearing potential defined as: i. Postmenopausal for at least 12
                  months (that is [i.e.], 2 years of amenorrhea without an alternative medical
                  cause) and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal
                  range (per reference laboratory), OR ii. Surgically sterile (example [e.g.],
                  underwent total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal
                  ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation), or otherwise
                  incapable of becoming pregnant, OR

               -  be of childbearing potential AND

               -  not heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from screening until 6
                  months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by local
                  regulations), OR

               -  if heterosexually active

                    -  have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile per verbal account of the
                       participant), OR

                    -  using an acceptable method of birth control from screening and agree to
                       continue to use the same method of contraception throughout the study and
                       for 6 months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by
                       local regulations). Oral hormone based contraceptives are not allowed from
                       14 days before the planned study drug administration until 6 months after
                       the last dose of treatment due to the potential for drug-drug interactions
                       which might undermine their efficacy. An intrauterine device (IUD), being
                       either hormonal (i.e., Intra-Uterine System [IUS*]) or non-hormonal, is
                       considered highly effective and reliable; therefore participants using an
                       IUD/IUS are not required to use additional contraceptive methods (no
                       double-barrier method is required). Other non-oral hormone-based
                       contraception methods (e.g., injectable, implants, transdermal system,
                       vaginal ring) may be continued, but as the interaction of the study drug
                       with hormone-based contraception is unknown, these methods are not
                       considered to be reliable and therefore participants should use a
                       double-barrier method (e.g., male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap
                       with or without spermicide).

                         -  An IUS does not rely on systemic plasma concentrations and is therefore
                            not expected to be impacted by a potential drug-drug interaction (DDI)

             Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated
             with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             participant.

             Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage
             or damage caused by latex friction

          7. A post-menopausal female who is receiving hormone replacement therapy and is willing
             to discontinue hormone therapy 30 days before study drug dosing and agrees to remain
             off hormone replacement therapy for the duration of the study may be eligible for
             study participation.

               -  Male participants must either:

               -  be surgically sterile (had a vasectomy), or otherwise incapable of fathering a
                  child, OR

               -  not be heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from enrollment (Day
                  1) in the study until at least 6 months after study drug administration, OR

               -  if heterosexually active:

                    -  have a partner who is postmenopausal (2 years amenorrhea), surgically
                       sterile (e.g., has had a total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                       bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation),
                       or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant OR

                    -  be practicing an acceptable method of birth control from enrollment in the
                       study (Day 1) and agree to continue to use the same method of contraception
                       throughout the study and for at least 6 months after study drug
                       administration (or longer, if dictated by local regulations). An acceptable
                       method of birth control for male participants is a double-barrier method
                       (e.g., male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without
                       spermicide).

             Note: Male participants with a female partner who uses hormonal contraceptives (oral,
             injectable, implants) or a hormonal (IUS) or non-hormonal IUD and male participants
             who are vasectomized or otherwise incapable of fathering a child are not required to
             use additional contraceptive methods.

             Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated
             with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             participant.

             Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage
             or damage caused by latex friction.

             NOTE: Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical
             studies if these are stricter than what is proposed in these inclusion criteria

          8. Participants must agree to refrain from sperm/egg donation from start of dosing
             through 6 months after the completion of study drug administration

          9. Genotype (GT) 1a or 1b or GT2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C (CHC), depending on cohort,
             with positive Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and a positive HCV ribonucleic acid
             (RNA) at screening including documentation of CHC infection for at least 6 months.
             Genotype testing must occur at a screening visit. NOTE: GT1 patients are eligible for
             inclusion even if they cannot be successfully subtyped unless a specific subtype is
             required for a cohort

         10. Screening HCV RNA viral load greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50,000 International Units
             per milliliter (IU/mL), except for participants with compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh
             Class A) who may have HCV RNA viral load &gt;=10^4 IU/mL

         11. No prior treatment for CHC (defined as no prior exposure to any approved or
             investigational drug including direct-acting antivirals, and interferon-based
             treatments)

         12. Fibroscan, collected within 6 months of baseline visit, with liver stiffness score
             less than or equal to (&lt;=) 12.5 kilo Pascal (kPa) to be eligible (except for
             participants with cirrhosis, see below).

               -  participants with compensated cirrhosis must meet the Child-Pugh Class A
                  definition (see Appendix G) and at least one of the following criteria: i. Liver
                  biopsy result indicating the presence of cirrhosis (e.g., Metavir F4; Ishak &gt;5)
                  or ii. Fibroscan evaluation with a liver stiffness score &gt;12.5 kPa

         13. Participant is otherwise in good health as deemed by the investigator, based on the
             findings of a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG)

         14. Willing to avoid prolonged sun exposure and use of tanning devices while taking
             Simeprevir (SMV) and through 4 weeks of follow up. Participant should also be advised
             to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen and lip balm of at least sun protection factor &gt;30

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant (during treatment and up to 6 months after the
             end of treatment [EOT]), or breast-feeding female participant, or male participant
