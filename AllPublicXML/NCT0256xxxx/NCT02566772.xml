    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of TAS3681 and to
      find the maximum tolerated dose of TAS3681.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, multinational, phase 1, open-label study of TAS3681 in patients
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)evaluating safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with mCRPC for which there is
      no standard therapy. Eligible patients will either be enrolled in the dose escalation phase
      to evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose for TAS3681, including a
      preliminary evaluation of food effect, or the expansion phase in which additional cohorts of
      patients may be enrolled to further evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of TAS3681 at
      the MTD or at a lower dose.

      Approximately 100 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase and
      approximately 100 patients will be enrolled in the Expansion Phase.

    <description>All patients will receive TAS3681 in 28 day cycles,. The study will enroll patients who have progressed after abiraterone or enzalutamide (expansion phase) and those who have progressed after abiraterone, enzalutamide and chemotherapy (dose escalation phase). - Number of cycles: approximately 6 or until discontinuation criteria is met. Eleven dose escalation cohorts are planned, one of which will include preliminary assessment of food effect. The MTD/recommended dose for further development will be used for patients in the expansion phase.</description>
