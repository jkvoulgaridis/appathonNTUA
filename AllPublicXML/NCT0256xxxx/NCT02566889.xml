  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether trough serum infliximab concentrations at
      the time of loss of clinical response will identify pediatric participants with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) who would benefit (regain clinical response) from dose escalation above
      the currently approved dose [5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) every 8 weeks (q8wk)] and the
      safety of that dose escalation.

      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), prospective (study following participants forward in time), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention) study of infliximab in pediatric participants
      with inflammatory bowel disease. The study consists of 3 Phases: screening Phase (up to 4
      weeks), open-label treatment Phase (56 weeks) and follow up safety Phase (8 weeks). The
      duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately up to 68 weeks
      (including screening period). Participants' efficacy and safety outcomes will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <measure>Clinical Response at Week 16 After Dose Escalation as Evaluated by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in Crohn's Disease (CD) Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as Crohn's disease (CD) participants with decrease from baseline in PCDAI of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 points with total score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 30 points. PCDAI includes three history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, general wellbeing), five physical examination items (abdominal examination, perirectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations, weight, height), and three laboratory tests (hematocrit, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Items are scored on a three-point scale (zero, 5, or 10 points) except for hematocrit and erythrocyte sedimentation rate which are scored as zero, 2.5 or 5 points. PCDAI scores can range from zero to 125 with higher scores indicating more active disease. Data for this OM was planned to be analyzed for Dose escalation (DE) group only.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Response at Week 16 After Dose Escalation as Evaluated by Mayo Score in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Response as per Mayo score was defined as decrease from baseline in partial Mayo score of &gt;= 2 points and &gt;= 30 percent (%) and decrease in rectal bleeding sub-score by &gt;= 1 point or achievement of an absolute sub-score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 point (for UC participants). A Partial Mayo Score which is Mayo score without endoscopy ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment [PGA]) with each ranging from 0 to 3 (0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Data for this OM was planned to be analyzed for the DE group only.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Reference arm was planned only for safety analysis in participants being treated with labeled dosing of infliximab. A participant was incorrectly considered as enrolled in the study database hence shown 54 participants in Protocol registration form but was actually screen failure participant. Therefore the actual enrollment was 53 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Clinical Response at Week 16 After Dose Escalation as Evaluated by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in Crohn's Disease (CD) Participants</title>
        <description>Clinical response was defined as Crohn's disease (CD) participants with decrease from baseline in PCDAI of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 points with total score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 30 points. PCDAI includes three history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, general wellbeing), five physical examination items (abdominal examination, perirectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations, weight, height), and three laboratory tests (hematocrit, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Items are scored on a three-point scale (zero, 5, or 10 points) except for hematocrit and erythrocyte sedimentation rate which are scored as zero, 2.5 or 5 points.

          <title>Clinical Response at Week 16 After Dose Escalation as Evaluated by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in Crohn's Disease (CD) Participants</title>
          <description>Clinical response was defined as Crohn's disease (CD) participants with decrease from baseline in PCDAI of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 points with total score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 30 points. PCDAI includes three history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, general wellbeing), five physical examination items (abdominal examination, perirectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations, weight, height), and three laboratory tests (hematocrit, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Items are scored on a three-point scale (zero, 5, or 10 points) except for hematocrit and erythrocyte sedimentation rate which are scored as zero, 2.5 or 5 points. PCDAI scores can range from zero to 125 with higher scores indicating more active disease. Data for this OM was planned to be analyzed for Dose escalation (DE) group only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Absolute Stool Frequency Based on PCDAI Score at Week 16 and Week 56 in CD Participants</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in Absolute stool frequency at Week 16 and Week 56 in CD participants were reported. PCDAI includes three history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, general wellbeing), five physical examination items (abdominal examination, perirectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations, weight, height), and three laboratory tests (hematocrit, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Items are scored on a three-point scale (zero, 5, or 10 points) except for hematocrit and erythrocyte sedimentation rate which are scored as zero, 2.5 or 5 points. PCDAI scores can range from zero to 125 with higher scores indicating more active disease. An absolute stool frequency subscore of =&lt;1 point was indicative of mild disease. Data for this OM was planned to be analyzed for the DE group only.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in Stool frequency sub-score of the partial Mayo score at Week 16 and Week 56 in UC participants were reported. A Partial Mayo Score which is Mayo score without endoscopy ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA) with each ranging from 0 to 3 (0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). An absolute stool frequency subscore of &lt;=1 point was indicative of mild disease. Higher scores indicate more severe disease.

A Partial Mayo Score which is Mayo score without endoscopy ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA) with each ranging from 0 to 3 (0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). An absolute stool frequency subscore of &lt;=1 point was indicative of mild disease. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Data for this OM was planned to be analyzed for the DE group only.</description>
          <population>Analysis population included all participants who received at least one infusion of infliximab after enrollment. Here ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies the number of participants for whom data was available for this endpoint and 'n' (number analyzed) signifies number of participants analyzed at specified timepoints.</population>

The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale is a pain scale that combines pictures and numbers to allow pain to be rated by children over the age of 3. The scale shows a series of faces ranging from a happy face at 0, &quot;No hurt&quot; to a crying face at 10 &quot;Hurts worst&quot;. The participant must choose the face that best describes how they are feeling. Data for this OM was planned to be analyzed for the DE group only.</description>

        <description>PCDAI is validated clinical tool used to assess disease severity in pediatric CD participants. PCDAI collects information on disease-related variables:Total number of liquid stools, abdominal pain, and general well-being (scored by participants or participant's legal representative);Extra-intestinal manifestations;Physical examinations of abdominal mass, perirectal disease;Weight change, height change or, height velocity;Hematocrit;erythrocyte sedimentation rate; albumin. PCDAI score is calculated as sum of individual component scores and ranges from 0-100 points. Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale combines pictures and numbers to allow pain to be rated by children over age of 3.
