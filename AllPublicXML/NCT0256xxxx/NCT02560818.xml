    <textblock>
      This is a case-control study of molecular diagnostics.

      This study requires two steps:

        -  The first part of the study will be conducted on a population of 20 women without breast
           cancer and, or ovarian family (Healthy Volunteers controls)

        -  The second part of the study will be conducted on a population of 50 patients
           predisposed to familial breast and, or ovarian cancer compared to 20 controls .

      For analysis of leucocytes of the patients, a blood sample collected in a prior study (EXSAL
      study, ID-RCB 2009-A00833-54) will be used.

      This study requires two steps:

      - The first part of the study will be conducted on a population of 20 women free of breast
      cancer and, or ovarian Family (healthy volunteers controls) and without a known family
      history of breast and or ovarian cancer.

      Mapping the level of blood (leukocytes) and the breast tissue will be drawn for the same
      individual on the physiological profiles splicing of the messenger RNA of genes involved in
      this predisposition, targeted by high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNASeq).

      A direct comparison of RNA splicing patterns between blood and breast tissue from the same
      witness will detect any differences between these two tissues.

      -The second part of the study will be conducted on a population of 50 patients predisposed to
      familial breast and, or ovarian cancer compared to 20 controls with no known family history
      of breast and, or ovarian cancer.

      Analysis of the results will highlight potential splicing abnormalities.
