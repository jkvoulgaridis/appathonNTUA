      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oral sodium fusidate (CEM-102) as chronic
      antibiotic for the treatment of bone or joint infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of CEM-102 for chronic antibiotic suppressive therapy of bone or joint
      infections. Subjects enrolling in this study must have a refractory staphylococcal bone or
      joint infection that requires suppressive antibiotic therapy (e.g. having an infection that
      cannot be managed by complete removal of the infected bone or foreign material, a refractory
      infection not responding to previous treatment, or not being a candidate for long-term
      intravenous antibiotic therapy).

    <time_frame>6 months after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants in the intent to treat (ITT) analysis set who meet all the criteria for clinical success at the 6-Month Visit.
Clinical success was defined to occur when subjects met all of the following criteria: 1) Subject was not hospitalized due to worsening of the study-qualifying orthopedic infection. 2) Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation). 2) No additional antibiotics (after completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen. 3) Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the graft remains viable without evidence of infection. 4) No purulent discharge from the surgical wound, or new or recurring sinus tract. 5) No worsening of redness, tenderness, or swelling at the primary infection site. 5) No bacteremia</description>

        <description>Number of participants in the intent to treat (ITT) analysis set who meet all the criteria for clinical success at the 6-Month Visit.
Clinical success was defined to occur when subjects met all of the following criteria: 1) Subject was not hospitalized due to worsening of the study-qualifying orthopedic infection. 2) Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation). 2) No additional antibiotics (after completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen. 3) Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the graft remains viable without evidence of infection. 4) No purulent discharge from the surgical wound, or new or recurring sinus tract. 5) No worsening of redness, tenderness, or swelling at the primary infection site. 5) No bacteremia</description>

          <description>Number of participants in the intent to treat (ITT) analysis set who meet all the criteria for clinical success at the 6-Month Visit.
Clinical success was defined to occur when subjects met all of the following criteria: 1) Subject was not hospitalized due to worsening of the study-qualifying orthopedic infection. 2) Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation). 2) No additional antibiotics (after completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen. 3) Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the graft remains viable without evidence of infection. 4) No purulent discharge from the surgical wound, or new or recurring sinus tract. 5) No worsening of redness, tenderness, or swelling at the primary infection site. 5) No bacteremia</description>

Clinical success was defined to occur when subjects met all of the following criteria: 1) Subject was not hospitalized due to worsening of the study-qualifying orthopedic infection. 2) Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation). 2) No additional antibiotics (after completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen. 3) Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the graft remains viable without evidence of infection. 4) No purulent discharge from the surgical wound, or new or recurring sinus tract. 5) No worsening of redness, tenderness, or swelling at the primary infection site. 5) No bacteremia</description>
