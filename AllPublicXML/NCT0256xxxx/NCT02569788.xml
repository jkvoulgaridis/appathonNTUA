  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal
      cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be
      treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD)
      in terms of acute and subactue toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the
      completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be
      used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II
      part of the trial.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal
      cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be
      treated with CIRT with escalating dose starting from 55GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to
      potentially 65GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in
      terms of acute and subactue toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion
      of CIRT. Time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is used for the phase I dose
      escalating part of the trial and approximately 25 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD for
      locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II part of the
      trial will be a single phase single arm study.

    <description>Five dose levels (55GyE, 57.5GyE, 60GyE, 62.5GyE, 65GyE) are planned within the Phase I part. Daily fraction of 2.5 GyE will be delivered for all dose levels. After the recommended dose (RD), i.e., MTD, is determined or if the treatments to 65 GyE are safely delivered, the recommended dose (or 65 GyE) will be the prescribed dose in the Phase II part of the study. Ninty-five percent (95%) of the isodose line should cover the GTV+3~5mm.</description>
