  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to test whether a
      medication called ramelteon (Brand Name: Remeron) will help smokers quit and whether it
      reduces sleep problems that smokers experience during a quit attempt.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ramelteon, an FDA-approved treatment for insomnia, is used to treat sleep problems (e.g.,
      specifically sleep onset latency) by enhancing melatonin receptor function. The investigators
      propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study.

      Fifty chronic smokers will complete a validated procedure for screening new medications. All
      subjects will receive 8mg ramelteon and placebo. The order in which ramelteon and placebo is
      received will be randomized across participants. This is a 6-week study consisting of two
      2-week medication phases separated by a 2-week washout. Each phase includes 1 week of ad
      libitum smoking (baseline) and 1 week of medication (ramelteon vs. placebo) plus transdermal
      nicotine patches while trying to abstain from smoking (quit assessment). Subjects will
      complete the same procedures during each study phase. Following completion of the study,
      participants will be offered standard smoking cessation treatment.

      For the duration of the study, subjects will be asked to keep sleep diaries and to wear an
      armband while sleeping, which provides objective indices of sleep duration and quality
      (SensewearPro® armband).

      The primary outcome will be the total number of days abstinent (out of 5) during each quit
      assessment period. Intermediate outcomes include sleep onset latency (self-report) and sleep
      efficiency (SensewearPro®).

      This study will provide information about the role of the melatonin system during brief
      abstinence and whether enhancing melatonin reduces abstinence-induced sleep problems that
      promote smoking relapse. Information obtained in this study may further establish the role of
      sleep disturbance in promoting smoking relapse.

    <description>Side effects will be assessed at each in-person visit using a Side Effects Checklist (SEC) that lists 21 possible side effects of ramelteon. The scale for rating each side effect is None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The higher the score, the more side effects reported by the participant. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 3 for each possible item on the scale. The Outcome Measure is an average of the 21 listed side effects.</description>

    <description>The study will be performed using 8mg of ramelteon, which is currently marketed for the treatment of sleep problems. The proposed study follows the typical dosing regimen for ramelteon (8mg once a day) for 5 days during each quit assessment period.
Ramelteon will be purchased and packaged into blister packs by the Investigational Drug Service (IDS) at the University of Pennsylvania. In accordance with FDA recommendations, subjects will be instructed to take study medication within 30 min prior to going to bed and avoid taking study medication with or immediately after a high fat meal.</description>

Placebo ingredients will be purchased, encapsulated, and packaged into blister packs by the IDS at UPenn. Both active medication and placebo will look identical.
The study medication assignments for each participant in this project is randomized and counterbalanced. This means that approximately 50% of participants will take ramelteon during the first medication period, followed by the placebo in the second medication period. Alternatively, approximately 50% of participants will take the placebo during the first medication period, followed by ramelteon during the second medication period.</description>

        <description>Side effects will be assessed at each in-person visit using a Side Effects Checklist (SEC) that lists 21 possible side effects of ramelteon. The scale for rating each side effect is None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The higher the score, the more side effects reported by the participant. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 3 for each possible item on the scale. The Outcome Measure is an average of the 21 listed side effects.</description>

          <description>Side effects will be assessed at each in-person visit using a Side Effects Checklist (SEC) that lists 21 possible side effects of ramelteon. The scale for rating each side effect is None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The higher the score, the more side effects reported by the participant. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 3 for each possible item on the scale. The Outcome Measure is an average of the 21 listed side effects.</description>
