  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (with rescue
      medication), two period crossover study in subjects with persistent uncontrolled asthma,
      currently not treated with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or long acting beta 2 agonist
      (LABA). This study is the first administration of GSK2269557 to asthmatic subjects, and the
      aims of the study are to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of four weeks of treatment with orally inhaled GSK2269557 1000 microgram (mcg) in subjects
      with persistent uncontrolled asthma. In a sub-study, biological mediators will be measured
      from induced sputum and blood.

      Approximately 50 subjects will be randomised into the study (including approximately 16
      subjects in the sputum sub-study). Each subject will complete two treatment periods: subjects
      will be randomised to receive GSK2269557 1000 mcg in one treatment period, and matching
      placebo in the other treatment period. Each treatment will be administered once daily for 28
      days (+/- 2 days) via the DISKUS™ dry powder inhaler (DPI).

      The study will consist of a Screening Visit; a Run-in Period (approximately 2 weeks in
      duration); two 28-day Treatment Periods (each with 4 clinic visits); a 4-week Washout Period
      (between the Treatment Periods); and a Follow-up Visit. The total duration of the study for
      each subject will be approximately 16 weeks. DISKUS is a registered trademark of the
      GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 28 in Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is the maximum volume of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath approximately 24 hours after the last administration of study drug. FEV1 was measured using a spirometer. Change from Baseline is calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value where Baseline is defined as Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28 for each treatment period</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the ITT Population which comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of trial medication and have at least one post-dose efficacy assessment. Six participants had entered the study without spirometric evidence of disease, and were excluded from the ITT population prior to unblinding.</population>

Trough FEV1 is the maximum volume of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath approximately 24 hours after the last administration of study drug. FEV1 was measured using a spirometer. Change from Baseline is calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value where Baseline is defined as Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the ITT Population which comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of trial medication and have at least one post-dose efficacy assessment. Six participants had entered the study without spirometric evidence of disease, and were excluded from the ITT population prior to unblinding.</population>

        <description>Triplicate measurements of FEV1 were collected in an eDiary pre-dose before breakfast [ante meridiem (AM)], and approximately 12 hours later at evening [post-meridiem (PM)]. The average change from Baseline was calculated by summing the total value of the endpoint (i.e. change from Baseline) within the time period of interest and dividing by the number of days with non-missing data for that endpoint to obtain an average for each subject. The AM Baseline is the Day 1 AM value, the PM Baseline is the last PM reading prior to taking the first dose of blinded study medication within that Treatment Period.

Evaluation of FeNO is a quantitative, noninvasive method of measuring airway inflammation to assess airway diseases including asthma. FeNO was measured in the clinic using a handheld electronic device. Change from Baseline for Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28 was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value where Baseline was defined as Day 1 (pre-dose).

          <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) at Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28</title>
          <description>Participants with asthma have high levels of NO in their exhaled breath. Evaluation of FeNO is a quantitative, noninvasive method of measuring airway inflammation to assess airway diseases including asthma. FeNO was measured in the clinic using a handheld electronic device. Change from Baseline for Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28 was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value where Baseline was defined as Day 1 (pre-dose). The number of participants with data available at the specified time points are represented by n=X in the category titles.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Values of Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of clinical chemistry parameters by Potential Clinical Importance Criteria. The clinical chemistry parameters included albumin, calcium, creatinine, glucose, potassium and sodium. Participants were counted in the category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there is no change in their category. The number of participants with data available at the specified data points are represented by n=X in the category titles.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of hematology parameters by Potential Clinical Importance Criteria. The hematology parameters included hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, total neutrophils, platelets and white blood cells (WBC). Participants were counted in the category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there is no change in their category. The number of participants with data available at the specified data points are represented by n=X in the category titles.</description>
