      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antineoplastic activity of
      avapritinib (also known as BLU-285), administered orally (PO), in adult patients with
      advanced systemic mastocytosis and other relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. The
      study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Part 1:Patients must have one of the following diagnoses based on World Heath
        Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria:

          -  Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).

          -  Systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) and at least 1
             C-finding attributable to systemic mastocytosis (SM). The AHN must be myeloid, with
             the following exceptions that are excluded: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
             Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is very high- or high-risk as defined by the
             International prognostic scoring system for myelodysplastic syndromes (IPSS-R) and
             Philadelphia chromosome positive malignancies.

          -  Mast cell leukemia (MCL).

          -  Histologically- or cytologically- confirmed myeloid malignancy that is relapsed or
             refractory to standard treatments. AML, MDS that is very high- or high-risk as defined
             by the IPSS-R, and Philadelphia chromosome positive malignancies are excluded.

          -  Upon discussion with the sponsor, other relapsed or refractory, potentially
             avapritinib-responsive hematologic neoplasms (e.g., evidence of aberrant KIT or
             platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling) may be considered for
             enrollment.

        For Part 2, patients must have one of the following diagnoses, based on WHO diagnostic
        criteria:

        For Part 2, Cohort 2, patients must have at least 1 measurable C-finding per modified
        IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria at Baseline, attributed to SM unless diagnosis is MCL, which does not
        require a C-finding.

             limit of normal (ULN); &gt;5 × ULN if associated with clinically suspected liver
             infiltration by mastocytosis or another disease for which the patient enrolled into
             the study

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN; &gt;3 × ULN if associated with liver infiltration by the
             disease being treated or in the presence of Gilbert's Disease (In the case of
             Gilbert's disease, a direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0 ULN would be an exclusion.)

          -  Estimated (Cockroft-Gault formula) or measured creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/min

          -  Brain malignancy or metastases to the brain

          -  History of a seizure disorder or requirement for anti-seizure medication

          -  Known risk of intracranial bleeding, such as a brain aneurysm or history of subdural
