    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Measured Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Of CLB And N-CLB With GWP42003-P Treatment, Days 1 And 33</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postdose on Days 1 and 33</time_frame>
    <description>The Cmax of CLB and its primary metabolite N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) was measured on Day 1 (before beginning GWP42003-P treatment; participants were taking CLB only) and Day 33 (following 21 days of GWP42003-P or placebo maintenance; participants were taking CLB and GWP42003-P or CLB and placebo). PK samples were taken at time points relative to the morning dose of CLB, as follows: Predose, 15 minutes (min), 30 min, 1 hour (h), 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h.
One participant in the placebo group was excluded from the PK set because placebo was administered on Day 1, after predose sampling. Six participants in the GWP42003-P group were excluded from the PK set because of GWP42003-P and/or CLB dose modification, discontinuation of IMP, discontinuation from trial, or administration of incorrect IMP dose.</description>

    <time_frame>Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postdose on Days 1 and 33</time_frame>
    <description>The tmax of CLB and its primary metabolite N-CLB was measured on Day 1 (before beginning GWP42003-P treatment; participants were taking CLB only) and Day 33 (following 21 days of GWP42003-P or placebo maintenance; participants were taking CLB and GWP42003-P or CLB and placebo). PK samples were taken at time points relative to the morning dose of CLB, as follows: Predose, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h.
One participant in the placebo group was excluded from the PK set because placebo was administered on Day 1, after predose sampling. Six participants in the GWP42003-P group were excluded from the PK set because of GWP42003-P and/or CLB dose modification, discontinuation of IMP, discontinuation from trial, or administration of incorrect IMP dose.</description>

    <measure>PK: Area Under The Plasma Concentration‑Time Curve Over A Dosing Interval, Where Tau Is The Dosing Interval (AUCtau) Of CLB And N-CLB With GWP42003-P Treatment, Days 1 And 33</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postdose on Days 1 and 33</time_frame>
    <description>The AUCtau of CLB and its primary metabolite N-CLB was measured on Day 1 (before first GWP42003-P dose; participants were taking CLB only) and Day 33 (following 21 days of GWP42003-P or placebo maintenance; participants were taking CLB and GWP42003-P or CLB and placebo). PK samples were taken at time points relative to the morning dose of CLB, as follows: Predose, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h.
One participant in the placebo group was excluded from the PK set because placebo was administered on Day 1, after predose sampling. Six participants in the GWP42003-P group were excluded from the PK set because of GWP42003-P and/or CLB dose modification, discontinuation of IMP, discontinuation from trial, or administration of incorrect IMP dose.</description>

    <measure>PK: Geometric Mean Ratios Of CLB And N-CLB For Cmax On Day 33 Compared With Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postdose on Days 1 and 33</time_frame>
    <description>The Day 33 compared to Day 1 geometric mean ratios of CLB and N-CLB were calculated for Cmax to look for evidence of drug-drug interactions between GWP42003-P/Placebo and CLB and between GWP42003-P/Placebo and N-CLB. A standard 90% confidence interval (CI) approach for the between time point ratios of geometric means of Cmax was carried out on a logarithmic scale using a linear mixed effect model. The no-effect boundary was set between 0.5 and 2.0, and if the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means of a PK variable fell within the interval [0.5, 2.0], a lack of meaningful effect was declared. Estimates were back transformed to provide summaries on the original scale. The model included a fixed effect term for PK assessment period. An unstructured covariance matrix was used. Kenward and Roger's method was used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effects.</description>

    <measure>Number Of Participants Who Experienced Severe Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Postdose on Day 2 up to Safety follow-up (Day 71)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event with an onset date on or after the first dose of IMP. If an adverse event (AE) had a partial onset date and it was unclear from the partial date (or the stop date) whether the AE started prior to or following the first dose of IMP then the AE was considered a TEAE. The number of participants who experienced 1 or more severe TEAEs after screening up to Day 71.
A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <description>Participants received GWP42003-P 20 milligrams [mg]/kilogram [kg]/day orally, twice daily immediately after their clobazam (CLB) dose. Participants titrated GWP42003-P to 20 mg/kg/day over 10 days and remained at this dose for the 21-day treatment period. Participants who then did not enter the open-label extension (OLE) or withdrew early had a 10-day taper (10% per day) period. Participants who transferred to the OLE (still blinded at that stage) tapered off their GWP42003-P treatment by reducing their maintenance dose by 10% per day and concomitantly titrating GWP42003-P for the OLE.
All participants (in the GWP42003-P and Placebo treatment groups) were on a stable dose of CLB at Baseline, administered either once or twice daily as per the physician's preferred CLB dosing regimen for each participant, and continued taking CLB, as an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), for the duration of this study.</description>

Participants titrated GWP42003-P to 20 mg/kg/day over 10 days and remained at this dose for the 21-day treatment period. Participants who then did not enter the OLE or withdrew early had a 10-day taper (10% per day) period.

All participants (in the GWP42003-P and Placebo treatment groups) were on a stable dose of CLB at Baseline, administered either once or twice daily as per the physician’s preferred CLB dosing regimen for each participant, and continued taking CLB, as an IMP, for the duration of this study.</description>

        <description>The Cmax of CLB and its primary metabolite N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) was measured on Day 1 (before beginning GWP42003-P treatment; participants were taking CLB only) and Day 33 (following 21 days of GWP42003-P or placebo maintenance; participants were taking CLB and GWP42003-P or CLB and placebo). PK samples were taken at time points relative to the morning dose of CLB, as follows: Predose, 15 minutes (min), 30 min, 1 hour (h), 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h.
One participant in the placebo group was excluded from the PK set because placebo was administered on Day 1, after predose sampling.

        <title>PK: Geometric Mean Ratios Of CLB And N-CLB For Cmax On Day 33 Compared With Day 1</title>
        <description>The Day 33 compared to Day 1 geometric mean ratios of CLB and N-CLB were calculated for Cmax to look for evidence of drug-drug interactions between GWP42003-P/Placebo and CLB and between GWP42003-P/Placebo and N-CLB. A standard 90% confidence interval (CI) approach for the between time point ratios of geometric means of Cmax was carried out on a logarithmic scale using a linear mixed effect model. The no-effect boundary was set between 0.5 and 2.0, and if the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means of a PK variable fell within the interval [0.5, 2.0], a lack of meaningful effect was declared. Estimates were back transformed to provide summaries on the original scale. The model included a fixed effect term for PK assessment period. An unstructured covariance matrix was used. Kenward and Roger's method was used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effects.</description>

        <title>Number Of Participants Who Experienced Severe Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event with an onset date on or after the first dose of IMP. If an adverse event (AE) had a partial onset date and it was unclear from the partial date (or the stop date) whether the AE started prior to or following the first dose of IMP then the AE was considered a TEAE. The number of participants who experienced 1 or more severe TEAEs after screening up to Day 71.
A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

            <description>Participants received GWP42003-P 20 mg/kg/day orally, twice daily immediately after their CLB dose. Participants titrated GWP42003-P to 20 mg/kg/day over 10 days and remained at this dose for the 21-day treatment period. Participants who then did not enter the OLE or withdrew early had a 10-day taper (10% per day) period. Participants who transferred to the OLE (still blinded at that stage) tapered off their GWP42003-P treatment by reducing their maintenance dose by 10% per day and concomitantly titrating GWP42003-P for the OLE.
All participants (in the GWP42003-P and Placebo treatment groups) were on a stable dose of CLB at Baseline, administered either once or twice daily as per the physician’s preferred CLB dosing regimen for each participant, and continued taking CLB, as an IMP, for the duration of this study.</description>

        <title>PK: Geometric Mean Ratios Of CLB And N-CLB For AUCtau On Day 33 Compared With Day 1</title>
        <description>The Day 33 compared to Day 1 geometric mean ratios of CLB and N-CLB were calculated for AUCtau to look for evidence of drug-drug interactions between GWP42003-P/Placebo and CLB and between GWP42003-P/Placebo and N-CLB. A standard 90% CI approach for the between time point ratios of geometric means of AUCtau was carried out on a logarithmic scale using a linear mixed effect model. The no-effect boundary was set between 0.5 and 2.0, and if the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means of a PK variable fell within the interval [0.5, 2.0], a lack of meaningful effect was declared. Estimates were back transformed to provide summaries on the original scale. The model included a fixed effect term for PK assessment period. An unstructured covariance matrix was used. Kenward and Roger's method was used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effects.</description>
