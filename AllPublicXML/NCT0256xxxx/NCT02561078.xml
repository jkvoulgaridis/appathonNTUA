    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the study drug known
      as human regular U-500 insulin (U-500R) administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin
      infusion (CSII) versus multiple daily injections (MDI) in participants with type 2 diabetes

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A. HbA1c is measured primarily to identify average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time.
Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with baseline of response, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) use, U-500R at entry, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is a test to determine how much glucose (sugar) is in a plasma sample after an overnight fast. Least Squares (LS) means was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline of response, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) use, U-500R at entry, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HbA1c &lt;7.0%</measure>
    <time_frame>26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A. HbA1c is measured primarily to identify average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. Longitudinal logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of having hbA1c&lt;7.0% at Week 26 with baseline of response, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) use, U-500R at entry, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>

    <description>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A. HbA1c is measured primarily to identify average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. Longitudinal logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of having hbA1c&lt;7.5% at Week 26 with baseline of response, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) use, U-500R at entry, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 7-point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Seven-point SMBG are completed at the following timepoints: Before Morning Meal, 2 Hours After Morning Meal, Before Mid-Day Meal, 2 Hours After Mid-Day Meal, Before Evening Meal, Bed Time and 03:00 AM hours. Least Squares (LS) means was determined by mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) methodology with baseline of response, GLP-1 or SGLT2 use, U-500R at entry, baseline HbA1C group, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Daily Dose (TDD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline TDD was defined as the last prestudy insulin TDD prior to randomization to receiving the first dose of U-500 insulin post randomization. Least Squares (LS) means was determined by mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) methodology with baseline of response, GLP-1 or SGLT2 use, U-500R at entry, baseline HbA1C group, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hypoglycemic Episodes (Documented Hypoglycemia With Blood Glucose &lt;= 70 mg/dL)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with hypoglycemic episodes (documented hypoglycemia) was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 hypoglycemic episode (documented hypoglycemia) over the 26-week treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio between the two treatments of at least 1 hypoglycemic episode (documented hypoglycemia) over 26 week treatment period adjusted for baseline documented hypoglycemia rate, GLP-1 or SGLT2 use, U-500R at entry, baseline HbA1C group, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Hypoglycemic Episodes (Documented Hypoglycemia With Blood Glucose &lt;= 70 mg/dL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Documented Hypoglycemic episodes with blood glucose&lt;=70mg/dL was used in this outcome measure. Hypoglycemia rate (documented hypoglycemia) per 30 days was summarized at each visit by treatment group. The rate of hypoglycemia (documented hypoglycemia) was analyzed using a generalized estimation equations model with a negative binomial distribution and a Log link. LS mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline documented hypoglycemia rate, GLP-1 or SGLT2 use, U-500R at entry, baseline HbA1C group, with log of exposure in days divided by 30 as the offset, treatment, visit, and visit by treatment interaction.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with hypoglycemic episodes (documented hypoglycemia) was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 hypoglycemic episode (documented hypoglycemia) over the 26-week treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio between the two treatments of at least 1 hypoglycemic episode (documented hypoglycemia) over 26 week treatment period adjusted for baseline documented hypoglycemia rate, GLP-1 or SGLT2 use, U-500R at entry, baseline HbA1C group, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction.</description>

Hypoglycemia rate (documented hypoglycemia) per 30 days was summarized at each visit by treatment group.

LS mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline documented hypoglycemia rate, GLP-1 or SGLT2 use, U-500R at entry, baseline HbA1C group, with log of exposure in days divided by 30 as the offset, treatment, visit, and visit by treatment interaction.</description>
