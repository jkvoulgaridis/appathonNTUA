    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of bivalirudin will reduce extent of
      the damage done to the heart muscle in participants who suffered a heart attack, compared to
      the comparator treatment (heparin).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effect of bivalirudin administration during primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) and for 4 hours (h) afterwards, looking at contrast enhanced
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) assessed infarct size and on circulating markers of
      thrombosis and cell injury in participants treated with PPCI for a large myocardial
      infarction (MI).

      The objective of this study is to determine whether bivalirudin, compared to heparin
      [unfractionated heparin (UFH)], for PPCI in large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) can:

      Primary Objective • Reduce infarct size assessed by CMR 5 days (defined as 5 days ±72 h from
      randomisation) after PPCI

      Secondary Objectives of this study are to determine the effects of bivalirudin compared with
      UFH treatment for PPCI in STEMI on:

        -  Other CMR derived parameters of myocardial recovery 5 days after PPCI (that is, left
           ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], myocardial salvage index [MSI], and micro-vascular
           obstruction [MVO])

        -  LVEF by CMR at 90 days

        -  Modulate markers of thrombin activity and cell injury after reperfusion

        -  Coronary flow and micro-circulation at the end of PPCI

        -  Survival at 90 days

      Approximately 200 participants will be randomized. Participants will be stratified prior to
      randomization: (a) according to total duration of ischemic pain (&lt;6 h versus ≥6 h); (b) by
      site.

      Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Selection: Adult participants (≥18 years) with an onset of
      ischemic symptoms of &gt;20 minutes (min) and &lt;12 h; a diagnosis of STEMI with ST segment
      elevation of ≥1 millimeter (mm) in ≥2 contiguous precordial leads, or presumably new left
      bundle branch block; had thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0 or 1 flow in the
      infarct related artery (IRA); fulfilled angiographic criteria/score for a large infarction;
      and were candidates for PPCI will be enrolled. All participants should receive as soon as
      logistically feasible: aspirin (150-325 milligrams [mg] orally or 250-500 mg intravenously
      [IV]) and a loading dose of any approved P2Y12 inhibitor unless already on maintenance dose.

      Bivalirudin will be administered at the time of PPCI at the approved dose of 0.75 mg/kilogram
      (kg) bolus followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion that will continue for 4 h after the
      completion of the index procedure.

      Participants randomized to UFH should be treated according to the standard institutional
      protocol (including the timing and dosing of the UFH bolus). A target activated clotting time
      (ACT) of ≥250 seconds (s) was recommended.

      Criteria for Evaluation:

      Primary Endpoint:

      • Infarct size assessed by CMR 5 days post-PPCI

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  CMR MVO assessment at 5 days

        -  CMR MSI at 5 days

        -  CMR assessment of LVEF at 5 days

        -  CMR assessment of LVEF at 90 days

        -  TIMI flow and Myocardial Blush Grade at end of PPCI

        -  In-hospital net adverse clinical events up to 5 days or discharge, whichever comes first
           (death, re-infarction, ischaemia driven revascularization, and Bleeding Academic
           Research Consortium ≥3 bleeding)

        -  Death at 90 days

      Exploratory assessments:

      • Assess patterns between comparator groups at various peri-procedural time points with
      respect to but not limited to: micro-particle release, thrombin anti thrombin complexes,
      myeloperoxidase

      Sub-study:

      • Index microcirculatory resistance

    <measure>CMR Assessment Of Infarct Size At Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days post PPCI</time_frame>
    <description>Size of cardiac infarct, expressed as grams, as assessed by CMR. The use of CMR has dramatically improved the ability for accurate infarct size estimations and is therefore currently considered the gold standard. The number of participants and their mean reported infarct size, as grams, at Day 5 are presented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CMR Assessment Of Myocardial Salvage Index (MSI) At Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days post PPCI</time_frame>
    <description>MSI is a CMR-derived parameter of myocardial recovery and treatment efficacy that allows comparisons among infarcts of different sizes. MSI is calculated as the difference between the area at risk (AAR) and the final infarct size, divided by the AAR, and it is expressed as a percentage of AAR. An MSI of 100% indicates maximum treatment success, whereas an MSI of 0% indicates no treatment benefit. The number of participants and their mean-reported MSI at Day 5 are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CMR Assessment Of Micro-vascular Obstruction (MVO) At Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days post PPCI</time_frame>
    <description>Early and late assessment of MVO, expressed as grams, as assessed by CMR. MVO is an established complication of coronary reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. MVO occurs in the setting of reperfusion following prolonged myocardial ischemia and provides incremental prognostic information beyond infarct size, to which it is related. Early MVO is a prolonged (approximately 60 s) perfusion deficit in dynamic gadolinium (Gd) first-pass images that is determined within 2 minutes (min) of administration of the Gd-based contrast agent. Late MVO is usually assessed as a hypointense infarct core on late-Gd-enhancement images acquired 10 min after contrast administration.
The number of participants and their mean reported early and late MVO, as grams, at Day 5 are presented.</description>

    <measure>CMR Assessment Of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) At Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days post PPCI</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of cardiac LVEF as assessed by CMR. LVEF is a measurement of the percentage of blood ejected out of the left ventricle with each contraction. The number of participants and their mean reported LVEF, as a percentage of blood, at Day 5 are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CMR Assessment Of LVEF At Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post PPCI</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of cardiac LVEF as assessed by CMR. LVEF is a measurement of the percentage of blood ejected out of the left ventricle with each contraction. The number of participants and their mean reported LVEF, as a percentage of blood, at Day 90 are presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TIMI Flow And Myocardial Blush Grade (MBG) At End Of PPCI</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (end of PPCI)</time_frame>
    <description>TIMI flow (grade 0-3) is an angiographic determination of briskness of epicardial coronary blood flow: TIMI 0 flow (no perfusion); TIMI 1 flow (penetration without perfusion); TIMI 2 flow (partial reperfusion); TIMI 3 flow (complete perfusion/normal flow).
MBG (grade 0-3) is an angiographic method for determination of blood flow in the distal myocardial vascular bed. Blush grades: 0 = failure of dye to enter the micro-vasculature; 1 = dye slowly enters but fails to exit the micro-vasculature; 2 = delayed entry and exit of dye from the micro-vasculature; 3 = normal entry and exit of dye from the micro-vasculature. Blush that is only mildly intense throughout the washout phase, but fades minimally, is also classified as grade 3.
The number of participants and their mean reported TIMI flow and MBG grades at the end of PPCI are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With In-Hospital Net Adverse Cardiac Events (NACE) At Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days post PPCI or at discharge, whichever occurs first</time_frame>
    <description>The NACE at 5 days is the composite of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 3 or greater [BARC type ≥3]), death, re-infarction, and ischaemia driven revascularization (IDR).
In brief, BARC ≥3 includes: Type 3a-3c, clinical, laboratory, and/or imaging evidence of bleeding; Type 4, coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding; Type 5, fatal bleeding that directly results in death that is either clinically suspicious or is confirmed as the cause of death.
A participant was defined to have a composite event if the participant experienced at least 1 of the components. If the participant did not have any of the components, then he or she did not have the composite endpoint. If a participant had more than 1 of the components, he or she was only counted once in the determination of the total number of participants experiencing the composite endpoint.
The percentage of participants with in-hospital NACE up to Day 5 is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Death At Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post PPCI</time_frame>
    <description>Participant survival during the clinical follow-up period is presented as the number of participants with reported death at 90 days post PPCI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Index Of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (end of PPCI)</time_frame>
    <description>IMR, a predictor of clinical outcome, is a readily available, quantitative, and reproducible method for invasively assessing coronary microvascular function. It is measured using the thermodilution technique and defined as mean distal coronary pressure, expressed in millimeters (mm) of mercury (Hg), multiplied by the mean hyperemic transit time (s) (mmHg*s). Higher IMR values indicate poorer microcirculation and are associated with a worse clinical outcome. A cutoff point of 32 (associated with better clinical outcomes) was selected as the threshold. Only participants at study locations with previous experience in IMR measurements participated in this sub study.
The number of participants and their mean reported IMR at the end of PPCI are presented.</description>

        <title>CMR Assessment Of Myocardial Salvage Index (MSI) At Day 5</title>
        <description>MSI is a CMR-derived parameter of myocardial recovery and treatment efficacy that allows comparisons among infarcts of different sizes. MSI is calculated as the difference between the area at risk (AAR) and the final infarct size, divided by the AAR, and it is expressed as a percentage of AAR. An MSI of 100% indicates maximum treatment success, whereas an MSI of 0% indicates no treatment benefit. The number of participants and their mean-reported MSI at Day 5 are presented.</description>

          <title>CMR Assessment Of Myocardial Salvage Index (MSI) At Day 5</title>
          <description>MSI is a CMR-derived parameter of myocardial recovery and treatment efficacy that allows comparisons among infarcts of different sizes. MSI is calculated as the difference between the area at risk (AAR) and the final infarct size, divided by the AAR, and it is expressed as a percentage of AAR. An MSI of 100% indicates maximum treatment success, whereas an MSI of 0% indicates no treatment benefit. The number of participants and their mean-reported MSI at Day 5 are presented.</description>

        <title>CMR Assessment Of Micro-vascular Obstruction (MVO) At Day 5</title>
        <description>Early and late assessment of MVO, expressed as grams, as assessed by CMR. MVO is an established complication of coronary reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. MVO occurs in the setting of reperfusion following prolonged myocardial ischemia and provides incremental prognostic information beyond infarct size, to which it is related. Early MVO is a prolonged (approximately 60 s) perfusion deficit in dynamic gadolinium (Gd) first-pass images that is determined within 2 minutes (min) of administration of the Gd-based contrast agent. Late MVO is usually assessed as a hypointense infarct core on late-Gd-enhancement images acquired 10 min after contrast administration.
The number of participants and their mean reported early and late MVO, as grams, at Day 5 are presented.</description>

        <title>TIMI Flow And Myocardial Blush Grade (MBG) At End Of PPCI</title>
        <description>TIMI flow (grade 0-3) is an angiographic determination of briskness of epicardial coronary blood flow: TIMI 0 flow (no perfusion); TIMI 1 flow (penetration without perfusion); TIMI 2 flow (partial reperfusion); TIMI 3 flow (complete perfusion/normal flow).
MBG (grade 0-3) is an angiographic method for determination of blood flow in the distal myocardial vascular bed. Blush grades: 0 = failure of dye to enter the micro-vasculature; 1 = dye slowly enters but fails to exit the micro-vasculature; 2 = delayed entry and exit of dye from the micro-vasculature; 3 = normal entry and exit of dye from the micro-vasculature. Blush that is only mildly intense throughout the washout phase, but fades minimally, is also classified as grade 3.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With In-Hospital Net Adverse Cardiac Events (NACE) At Day 5</title>
        <description>The NACE at 5 days is the composite of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 3 or greater [BARC type ≥3]), death, re-infarction, and ischaemia driven revascularization (IDR).
In brief, BARC ≥3 includes: Type 3a-3c, clinical, laboratory, and/or imaging evidence of bleeding; Type 4, coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding; Type 5, fatal bleeding that directly results in death that is either clinically suspicious or is confirmed as the cause of death.
A participant was defined to have a composite event if the participant experienced at least 1 of the components. If the participant did not have any of the components, then he or she did not have the composite endpoint.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With In-Hospital Net Adverse Cardiac Events (NACE) At Day 5</title>
          <description>The NACE at 5 days is the composite of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 3 or greater [BARC type ≥3]), death, re-infarction, and ischaemia driven revascularization (IDR).
In brief, BARC ≥3 includes: Type 3a-3c, clinical, laboratory, and/or imaging evidence of bleeding; Type 4, coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding; Type 5, fatal bleeding that directly results in death that is either clinically suspicious or is confirmed as the cause of death.
A participant was defined to have a composite event if the participant experienced at least 1 of the components. If the participant did not have any of the components, then he or she did not have the composite endpoint. If a participant had more than 1 of the components, he or she was only counted once in the determination of the total number of participants experiencing the composite endpoint.
The percentage of participants with in-hospital NACE up to Day 5 is presented.</description>

        <title>Index Of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR)</title>
        <description>IMR, a predictor of clinical outcome, is a readily available, quantitative, and reproducible method for invasively assessing coronary microvascular function. It is measured using the thermodilution technique and defined as mean distal coronary pressure, expressed in millimeters (mm) of mercury (Hg), multiplied by the mean hyperemic transit time (s) (mmHg*s). Higher IMR values indicate poorer microcirculation and are associated with a worse clinical outcome. A cutoff point of 32 (associated with better clinical outcomes) was selected as the threshold. Only participants at study locations with previous experience in IMR measurements participated in this sub study.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Since the measured difference in infarct size at Day 5 (by CMR) was &lt;18%, the study was terminated for futility at the interim analysis as pre-defined in the protocol.</limitations_and_caveats>
