    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate acute and long term clinical results
      of orbital atherectomy (OA) with adjunctive drug coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty versus DCB
      angioplasty alone for treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) in below the knee (BTK)
      lesions.

             may substitute to confirm distribution of calcium, if available as standard of care]

          -  Length of calcium ≥ 25 % of total lesion length or ≥ 2 cm total length

          -  Target lesion length up to 20 cm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has more than 2 target vessels requiring treatment

          -  The guide wire cannot be passed across the target lesion(s) and/or guide wire position
             distal to target lesion(s) outside vessel lumen

          -  Presence of significant (≥ 70 % DS) lesion(s) or occlusion(s) not meeting the study
             criteria which were not successfully treated during the index procedure (≥ 50 % DS
             and/or significant angiographic complication)

          -  Subject has planned amputation (including minor) of the index limb or previous major
             amputation of the contralateral limb

          -  Subject has any significant medical condition which, in the Investigator's opinion,
             may interfere with the subject's optimal participation in the study

          -  Subject is participating in an investigational drug or device study that has the
             potential to clinically interfere with the study outcome measures

          -  Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the study period
