  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, parallel, 4-dose design in subjects with mild-to-moderate
      Alzheimer's Disease. Subjects will be randomized to one of 4 doses of T3D-959. Subjects will
      be evaluated for changes from baseline in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (FDG-PET
      imaging), functional connectivity of the hippocampus (BOLD-fMRI), and cognitive function
      (ADAS-Cog11 and DSST) as well as assessed for safety and tolerability to T3D-959.

      An expanded access extension is planed to provide access to study medication to subjects who
      have completed the main study and requested continued use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T3D-959 is an orally-delivered, once-a-day administered, small molecule dual nuclear receptor
      agonist that has been shown in animal and Phase 1 studies in normal human subjects to be safe
      and well tolerated. The purpose of this clinical study in AD patients is to demonstrate
      mechanistic proof of concept that T3D-959, can produce desired changes in cerebral glucose
      metabolism and functional connectivity that may indicate potential for cognitive improvement.
      The therapeutic approach to be tested is based on two suppositions; (A) ameliorating multiple
      pathologies in the disease with a single therapy may provide a superior clinical benefit than
      therapeutic approaches which target a single pathology and (B) correcting insulin resistance
      in the brain, (highly correlated with AD and potential key driver of AD pathophysiology) and
      peripherally may be disease remedial.

      The brain requires integral insulin signaling for metabolic homeostasis and neuronal
      plasticity. Insulin resistance disrupts energy balance and signaling networks needed for a
      broad range of functions. Impaired insulin signaling in neurons enhances apoptosis, promotes
      oxidative cell death induced by Abeta1-42, increases secretion of Abeta1-42, blocks removal
      of extracellular Abeta oligomers and increases plaque loads. A growing body of evidence
      suggests that brain insulin resistance promotes or possibly is the trigger of key pathologies
      in AD and is supported by observed changes in levels of insulin signaling molecules in AD
      forebrains and associated changes in memory. Pre-clinical studies in animals have
      demonstrated the insulin sensitizing activity of T3D-959 and ability to improve multiple
      pathologies of AD in a rat model of disease.

      This non-placebo controlled trial will be conducted in one to three clinical centers. Thirty
      six (36) patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease will be randomly assigned to once
      daily, orally administered treatment with 3mg, 10mg, 30mg or 90mg doses of T3D-959.
      Participants will be treated for two weeks and will undergo at baseline and at two weeks;
      FDG-PET scans to measure brain glucose metabolism, BOLD fMRI scans to measure functional
      connectivity of the hippocampus, venous blood draws for biomarker analysis and ApoE
      genotyping, and ADAS-Cog11 and DSST cognitive testing. For monitoring potential toxicities of
      the drug subjects will undergo physical examination, neurological examination, adverse event
      review, blood chemistries, and pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses for T3D-959 plasma levels.

      Expanded Access Extension: This is an open label 10 visit extension for up to 5 subjects who
      have completed the T3D959-201 protocol and whose caregivers and physician requested their
      continued treatment in an expanded access protocol. All subjects enrolled in this study will
      be treated with a 15mg q.d. dose of T3D959 for six months, regardless of their assigned dose
      level from the main study. A continued risk/benefit assessment by the investigator will be
      conducted at each visit to determine the need for treatment continuation. Subjects will be
      assessed for safety and tolerability to T3D-959 and evaluated for changes from baseline
      cognitive function via ADAS-Cog11 and DSST testing and global change via CIBIC-plus testing.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (End of Treatment - Baseline) for FDG-PET Imaging With Whole Brain and White Matter as Reference Region</measure>
    <time_frame>after 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in relative brain glucose metabolism (delta R CMRgl) were measured by FDG-PET. At each time point, a ratio of the PET reading in a pre-defined region of interest (sROI), known to be affected by AD, and in a reference region (RR) that is spared in AD, is determined. This ratio is defined as &quot;sROI index&quot; (spared region). A second RR, brain white matter (WM), was also used in this calculation: sROI index&quot; (WM) value. delta sROI is defined as change in the sROI index values, over the treatment period. In this study we are looking for changes in delta sROI with increasing doses of T3D-959. Dose dependent changes in delta sROI (AD spared) are compared to those observed with the WM as the RR: delta sROI (WM). Dose related changes in delta sROI suggests T3D-959 is entering the brain and effecting glucose metabolism in a dose dependent fashion.</description>

    <measure>The Effect of Treatment With T3D-959 on Changes in Resting State Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Signal in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the Brain Areas Associated With Cognitive Tasks.</measure>
    <time_frame>after 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in BOLD fMRI parameters such as GoF (see Study Description) over the course of two weeks of treatment, were obtained in this study. BOLD fMRI has been used in cross sectional and longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's subjects, for instance in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies. However, no studies monitoring Default Mode Networks measured parameters such as GoF, in the context of an effective AD therapeutic, as a result it is difficult to interpret the observed small changes listed in BOLD fMRI parameters obtained in this trial. Instead the changes in the listed BOLD fMRI parameters (EOT - BL) are reported without interpretation. These values represent changes in fMRI connectivity patterns over time and are unitless.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Score of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test</measure>
    <time_frame>after 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The digit symbol substitution test assesses attention, psychomotor speed, complex scanning, visual tracking, and immediate memory. This test consists of 4 rows each with 25 small blank squares; above each square is a number between 1 and 9. At the top is a 'key,' which pairs each number (1 through 9) with an unfamiliar symbol. The participant has 90 seconds to work as quickly as possible (left to right across the rows) to fill in each blank square with the appropriate symbol based on the number above the square. Results are presented as total number correct; therefore, lower numbers indicate greater impairment. Scores on the DSST range from 0-93.</description>

    <description>The 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 11) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis. The score can range between 0 and 70. A higher score indicates more cognitive impairment. A positive change in the score indicates cognitive worsening. The minimum severity score is 0 and the maximum severity score is 70.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Treatment - Baseline) for FDG-PET Imaging With Whole Brain and White Matter as Reference Region</title>
        <description>Changes in relative brain glucose metabolism (delta R CMRgl) were measured by FDG-PET. At each time point, a ratio of the PET reading in a pre-defined region of interest (sROI), known to be affected by AD, and in a reference region (RR) that is spared in AD, is determined. This ratio is defined as &quot;sROI index&quot; (spared region). A second RR, brain white matter (WM), was also used in this calculation: sROI index&quot; (WM) value. delta sROI is defined as change in the sROI index values, over the treatment period. In this study we are looking for changes in delta sROI with increasing doses of T3D-959. Dose dependent changes in delta sROI (AD spared) are compared to those observed with the WM as the RR: delta sROI (WM). Dose related changes in delta sROI suggests T3D-959 is entering the brain and effecting glucose metabolism in a dose dependent fashion.</description>
        <time_frame>after 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Both + &amp; - values for delta sROI represent “better outcomes” with regard to the demonstrating pharmacological activity of a PPAR delta, such as T3D-959, in the brain. It is unknown at this time, both from this presented data and from the literature, whether the pharmacological action of a PPAR delta agonist will translate to better outcomes in AD.</population>

        <title>The Effect of Treatment With T3D-959 on Changes in Resting State Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Signal in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the Brain Areas Associated With Cognitive Tasks.</title>
        <description>Changes in BOLD fMRI parameters such as GoF (see Study Description) over the course of two weeks of treatment, were obtained in this study. BOLD fMRI has been used in cross sectional and longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's subjects, for instance in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies. However, no studies monitoring Default Mode Networks measured parameters such as GoF, in the context of an effective AD therapeutic, as a result it is difficult to interpret the observed small changes listed in BOLD fMRI parameters obtained in this trial. Instead the changes in the listed BOLD fMRI parameters (EOT - BL) are reported without interpretation. These values represent changes in fMRI connectivity patterns over time and are unitless.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Score of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test</title>
        <description>The digit symbol substitution test assesses attention, psychomotor speed, complex scanning, visual tracking, and immediate memory. This test consists of 4 rows each with 25 small blank squares; above each square is a number between 1 and 9. At the top is a 'key,' which pairs each number (1 through 9) with an unfamiliar symbol. The participant has 90 seconds to work as quickly as possible (left to right across the rows) to fill in each blank square with the appropriate symbol based on the number above the square. Results are presented as total number correct; therefore, lower numbers indicate greater impairment. Scores on the DSST range from 0-93.</description>

        <description>The 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 11) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis. The score can range between 0 and 70. A higher score indicates more cognitive impairment. A positive change in the score indicates cognitive worsening. The minimum severity score is 0 and the maximum severity score is 70.</description>
