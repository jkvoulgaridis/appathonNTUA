  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will examine the behavioral effects and neurophysiological
      mechanisms of the pro-social neuropeptide oxytocin in patients with recent-onset
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Such research is a necessary first step towards
      identifying whether intranasal oxytocin administration can serve as an adjunct treatment for
      social impairments in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

      Aim 1: To quantify the effects of exogenous oxytocin on social cognition and behavior in
      patients with recent-onset schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis A: Patients and healthy comparison subjects will show enhanced social cognition
      (e.g., improved interpretation of paralinguistic and emotional cues, such as those involved
      in emotional or sarcastic communication) after administration of oxytocin versus placebo.

      Hypothesis B: Patients and healthy comparison subjects will show increased attention to
      others' eyes and patients will exhibit increased facial affect expressivity after
      administration of oxytocin versus placebo.

      Part 2: A supplementary study will be added to the proposed parent study, which includes
      additional behavioral testing consisting of several social cognition computer tasks, clinical
      assessments, physiological measurements, and questionnaires. The study will be conducted with
      the same study arms and study interventions as in the proposed parent study. For this
      supplementary study, the inclusion criteria has broadened to include patients with bipolar
      disorder with psychotic features and brief psychotic disorder.

    <description>Participants will undergo computer tasks that measure social cognition. Tasks will involve verbal responses, pressing buttons at specific times, listening, and viewing audio-visual stimuli. Investigators will be measuring the difference in accuracy and verbal content of the responses on the oxytocin day compared to the placebo day.</description>
