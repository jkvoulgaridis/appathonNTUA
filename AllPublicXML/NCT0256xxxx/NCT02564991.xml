      Background:

      The way alcohol affects brain structure has been widely studied. But the way it affects all
      parts of the brain is still unknown. Researchers want to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scans to study brain structure and function. They hope this will help them better understand
      changes that happen in brain regions during treatment of alcohol use disorders.

      Objectives:

      To study changes in the brain by using MRI in people with and without alcohol use disorders.
      To study how brain changes affect gait, balance, cognitive ability, and behavior. To see how
      the brain recovers when alcohol use stops.

      Eligibility:

      People with alcohol dependence who are currently hospitalized in a particular unit at NIH.

      Healthy volunteers 30 60 years old without an alcohol use disorder.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.

      Participants will give a urine sample for a drug test and pregnancy test at each study visit.
      They will also have to pass a breath alcohol test.

      At the first visit, participants will have an MRI. The scanner is a metal cylinder in a
      strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the
      cylinder.

      They will do behavior and memory tasks outside the scanner.

      They will have gait and balance tested. They will have to stand on both legs, stand on just
      one leg, and walk in a straight line. They will perform each task with eyes open, then with
      eyes closed.

      They will have tests of memory, thinking, and problem solving.

      Some participants will have a second visit. They will have another MRI and repeat some of the
      behavior and memory tasks.

      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is to characterize cerebellar volumes and function in alcoholics
      and recovery of cerebellar volume and function during early abstinence. This study also
      investigates how cerebrocerebellar circuits contribute to cognitive and motor impairment in
      alcoholism.

      Study Population

      Healthy volunteers and Inpatient participants with alcohol use disorders.

      Design

      Participants will receive whole-brain structural imaging and assessment of cerebellar
      function at the time of admission and again at the time of discharge.

      Outcome

      The Primary outcome of this study is to assess recovery of cerebellar structure and function
      at the end of treatment compared to treatment entry measures.
