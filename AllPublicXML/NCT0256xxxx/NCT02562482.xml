  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of a 2-injection vaccine Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) virus-like
      particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP) in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-injection vaccine regimen (Day 0 and 28) with
      Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) virus-like particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP, VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP) in
      healthy adults ages 18-60 years old that reside in CHIKV endemic regions.

      The hypothesis is that the vaccine regimen is safe and induces a neutralizing antibody
      response to CHIKV. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability of a
      2-injection investigational vaccine regimen of VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP at 20 mcg compared to
      placebo (PBS) in healthy adults in CHIKV endemic areas. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate neutralizing antibody response in vaccine recipients. The exploratory objectives
      relate to assessing incidence of CHIKV infection in vaccine and placebo recipients, as well
      as antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses during the study.

      The expected study duration per subject is approximately 72 weeks with intramuscular (IM)
      injections scheduled at Day 0 and Day 28.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of Any Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after any injection</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a memory aid for 7 days after any injection and reviewed the memory aid with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects are counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>

    <description>Safety laboratory parameters included hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte, basophil and eosinophil counts, mean corpuscular volume (MCV)) and chemistry (ALT). Complete blood count, differential, platelet and ALT results were collected at screening (≤ 56 days before enrollment), Day 0 prior to study product administration (baseline), and Days 28 and 56.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 72 weeks after first injection</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited AEs were reported from receipt of first study injection through 4 weeks after the last study injection administered. After the indicated time period through the last expected study visit at 72 weeks, only new chronic medical conditions and SAEs (reported as a separate outcome and in the AE module) were collected as unsolicited AEs. A subject with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity. The number reported for &quot;Any AE&quot; is the number of subjects reporting at least one or more AEs.</description>

    <description>SAEs were reported from receipt of first study injection through the last expected study visit at 72 weeks. Grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Life-threatening, and Death) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007). The relationship between a SAE and the study product was assessed by the investigator on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the definitions outlined in the protocol. A subject with multiple SAEs is counted only once.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of Any Injection</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a memory aid for 7 days after any injection and reviewed the memory aid with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects are counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>
        <time_frame>7 days after any injection</time_frame>
        <population>Population included all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection and provided safety data (via diary card and/or laboratory results) following the injection. Four subjects in Group 1 did not receive product and one subject in Group 2 did not provide a diary card following the first injection and were excluded from analysis.</population>

          <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of Any Injection</title>
          <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a memory aid for 7 days after any injection and reviewed the memory aid with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects are counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>
          <population>Population included all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection and provided safety data (via diary card and/or laboratory results) following the injection. Four subjects in Group 1 did not receive product and one subject in Group 2 did not provide a diary card following the first injection and were excluded from analysis.</population>

        <description>SAEs were reported from receipt of first study injection through the last expected study visit at 72 weeks. Grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Life-threatening, and Death) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007). The relationship between a SAE and the study product was assessed by the investigator on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the definitions outlined in the protocol. A subject with multiple SAEs is counted only once.</description>

      <time_frame>Solicited adverse events (AEs) were reported for 7 days after any injection. Unsolicited AEs were reported from receipt of the first injection through 4 weeks after the last study injection administered. Following the time period defined for AEs through the last expected study visit at 72 weeks, only new chronic medical conditions were collected as unsolicited AEs. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported from receipt of the first injection through the last expected study visit at 72 weeks.</time_frame>
      <desc>Solicited AEs collected through systematic assessment and unsolicited AEs collected through non-systematic assessment are reported by subjects who received at least one injection and provided safety data following the injection, and represent the number and percentage of subjects reporting the event. A subject with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity. A subject with multiple SAEs is counted only once.</desc>
