  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyanotic congenital cardiac patients require higher hemoglobin concentrations (red blood cell
      levels) for optimal oxygen delivery to the body. Prophylactic erythropoietin (EPO) and iron
      can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood transfusions needed in this population. We
      seek to investigate if EPO and iron make a clinically significant difference in the number of
      transfusions given to these patients and the morbidity associated with it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease occurs in about 1% of all live births. Cyanotic cardiac lesions in
      particular are at risk for significant mortality and morbidity because of their reduced
      ability to provide adequate oxygenation to the body and the brain. Many experts believe that
      to have adequate oxygen carrying capacity that these infants should ideally have a hemoglobin
      level greater than 13 g/dL. Many of these patients require blood transfusions prior to
      surgery to provide adequate oxygenation. The cause for this is likely multifactorial
      including normal neonatal physiology, frequent lab draws, and co-morbidities. Although rare,
      the morbidity due to transfusions can be devastating to this population including transmitted
      infections, transfusion reactions, extra hospitalizations, and antigen sensitization that
      would complicate heart transplant if needed.

      There are centers in the United States that have developed protocols using erythropoietin to
      minimize blood product transfusions before and after surgery, also referred to as &quot;bloodless
      surgery&quot;. There have been retrospective studies evaluating the success of these protocols,
      but there are no randomized controlled prospective studies that the investigators have
      studying the effects of erythropoietin effects in patients with cyanotic heart disease in
      regards to transfusion prevention.

      Congenital cyanotic cardiac patients require higher hemoglobin concentrations for optimal
      oxygen delivery. Prophylactic erythropoietin can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood
      transfusions needed prior to surgery. The researchers seek to investigate if erythropoietin
      makes a clinically significant difference in the number of transfusions given to these
      patients and the morbidity associated with it.

    <description>Prophylactic erythropoietin can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood transfusions needed prior to surgery. We seek to investigate if erythropoietin makes a clinically significant difference in the number of transfusions given to these patients and the morbidity associated with it during the period in which the subjects will be active in the study (from baseline to 14 weeks post initial injection). The primary aim will be assessed when all subjects have completed week 14 or discontinue early.</description>

    <measure>Oxygen saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>First 4 months of life</time_frame>
    <description>Often, cyanotic congenital heart defect neonates have prolonged initial hospital stays due to the inability to maintain acceptable oxygen saturations, and transition to adequate oral intake for appropriate weight gain. If the hospital stay is found to be shortened after starting erythropoietin, this may be of clinical and financial significance.</description>

    <measure>Number of hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>First 4 months of life</time_frame>
    <description>The number of hospital readmissions (related to failure to thrive or cyanosis) may imply the overall clinical stability of a patient. Because these infants are at high risk for mortality at home, there are multiple reasons why they may be admitted to the hospital including clinically significant anemia which requires blood transfusions, poor weight gain, difficulty feeding, inadequate oxygen saturations, and illnesses. Each admission is stressful to the patient and their families. Having a normal hemoglobin level may have a role in preventing several of these factors, especially regarding failure to thrive or cyanosis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight gain</measure>
    <time_frame>First 4 months of life</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of weight gain is appropriate in the setting of infants as this variable has been used to monitor the ability to thrive and meet the body's metabolic demands. It is well established in pediatrics that the neonate and infant should gain 15-30 grams per day for optimal growth. Infants who are cyanotic already have a deficiency in meeting their metabolic demands due to a reduced oxygen carrying capacity. This is further complicated in the instance of anemia. Thus, infants may have an increased ability to optimize weight gain in the setting of normal, stable hemoglobin levels which may be achieved with erythropoietin.</description>
