  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for men who have prostate cancer and have failed local therapy or are not a
      candidate for prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The purpose of this research study is to
      assess the safety and benefit of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT, blocks hormones) plus
      chemotherapy. Degarelix is the hormone blocking drug that will be used. Doxorubicin,
      Ketoconazole, Docetaxel and Estramustine are the chemotherapy drugs that will be used. The
      drugs used in this study are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Participants will be treated with ADT plus chemotherapy for three, four, or five 8-week
      cycles (12, 18, or 24 months). The number of cycles of chemotherapy they receive and the
      number of months they receive ADT will be based on their disease. The current standard
      treatment is ADT and chemotherapy. What differs in this research study is the cycling and
      combination of chemotherapy drugs chosen. The drugs chosen for this study have fewer side
      effects and are believed to provide maximum benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a working hypothesis, investigators suspect that the transformation from an
      androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent phenotype is mediated by expansion of an
      androgen-independent clone already present at the time of ADT that continues to grow while
      androgen-sensitive clones are being suppressed. It is thus desirable to bring treatment to
      bear on the androgen-independent component while the corresponding tumor burden remains
      minimal and prolong the time to hormone resistance. Investigators view the
      androgen-independent component as analogous to &quot;microscopic residual&quot; or &quot;micro-metastatic&quot;
      disease, for which adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in other contexts,
      even when the same drugs had little or no impact on survival in the setting of more advanced
      disease.

      By treating all components of the tumor initially, investigators anticipate that the
      emergence of androgen-independent growth will be delayed, ultimately prolonging patient
      survival. Additionally, instead of treating patients empirically with an identical regimen,
      as in investigator's previous work, these patient subsets were designed to ensure a level of
      treatment appropriate to their individual disease, thus potentially lessening the burden of
      treatment (such as the long-term adverse effects of ADT). Investigators have chosen 3, 4, or
      5 cycles of chemotherapy to be administered on the basis of tumor burden, a treatment
      selection method long established in germ cell tumors and used by this PI. Sub-analyses of
      previous data have raised the concern that treating patients with varying levels of disease
      the same way does not produce optimal results. Therefore, investigators seek to improve
      outcomes by tailoring treatment to tumor burden. In this study, patients with less tumor
      burden will receive 3 cycles of chemotherapy and 12 months of ADT, those with moderate tumor
      burden will receive 4 cycles and 18 months of treatment, and those with the greatest tumor
      burden will receive 5 cycles and 24 months of treatment. Additionally, this regimen of
      administering treatment sequentially, including a 2-week break, reduces toxicity.

        <title>Efficacy as Measured by PSA Level</title>
        <description>Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood.
The time point is the end of treatment, which is about about 8 weeks after the start of the last cycle. For the arm completing 3 cycles, the time point is 24 weeks after treatment initiation. For the arm completing 4 cycles, the time point is 32 weeks after treatment initiation. For the arm completing 5 cycles, the time point is 40 weeks after treatment initiation.</description>

It consists of 27 core items which assess patient function in four domains (Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being), and it is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert type scale, and then combined to produce a global QoL score, with a range of scores of 0 to 156. Higher scores represent better QoL.</description>

          <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) scale is a tool used for assessing the health-related quality of life (QoL) in men with prostate cancer. It consists of 27 core items which assess patient function in four domains (Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being), and it is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert type scale, and then combined to produce a global QoL score, with a range of scores of 0 to 156. Higher scores represent better QoL.</description>
          <population>Fewer were analyzed than the number that started study because not all participants completed the full number of cycles of treatment assigned. For some participants treatment was prematurely discontinued at different points through the course of treatment because of adverse events, progression, and participant withdrawal from study.</population>

        <title>Quality of Life Measure by FACT-P Scale</title>
        <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) scale is a tool used for assessing the health-related quality of life (QoL) in men with prostate cancer. It consists of 27 core items which assess patient function in four domains (Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being), and it is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert type scale, and then combined to produce a global QoL score, with a range of scores of 0 to 156. Higher scores represent better QoL.
The time point is about 12 weeks after completion of the last cycle. For the arm completing 3 cycles, the time point is 36 weeks after treatment initiation. For the arm completing 4 cycles, the time point is 44 weeks after treatment initiation. For the arm completing 5 cycles, the time point is 52 weeks after treatment initiation.</description>
