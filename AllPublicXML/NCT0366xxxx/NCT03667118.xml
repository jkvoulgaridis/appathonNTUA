  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a food supplement to:

        -  Show that the food supplement is well tolerated and safe to feed to infants;

        -  Find out how often parents/caregivers feed their infants the food supplement;

        -  Find out how parents/caregivers usually add the food supplement to infants' regular
           solid or liquid food; and

        -  Learn what aspects of the food supplement are more or less attractive to infants and to
           parents/caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves parents/caregivers of infants, ≥ 5 months but &lt; 11 months of age. Parents
      who enrolled their infants complete a 1-month blinded placebo run-in period, followed by
      randomization to placebo or the food supplement.

      During the intervention period, infants randomized to the food supplement are fed a once
      daily, individual packet of the food supplement mixed into liquid (e.g., breast milk, infant
      formula) or solid (e.g., applesauce, pureed carrots) foods being fed to the infant. The food
      supplement is a blend of 16 common allergenic proteins ([oat, milk, egg, sesame, wheat]
      [almond cashew, hazelnut, peanut, pecan, pistachios, soy, walnut] [cod, shrimp, salmon])
      combined with 400 IU of Vitamin D3. Parents complete a daily diary about any reactions or
      symptoms within 2 hours of ingesting the food supplement. Infants randomized to the placebo
      are also fed a once daily individual packet of the placebo mixed into liquid or solid foods
      being fed to the infant. Parents also complete a daily diary about any reactions or symptoms
      within 2 hours of ingesting the placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  healthy infants, ≥ 5 months but &lt; 11 months of age whose parent/caregiver can provide,
             in English, consent, understand instructions and complete a daily diet diary for their
             child, answer questions about how much and in what food they mix the Food supplement,
             and report any reaction or adverse event. Pregnant women will not be excluded if they
             have a child who is eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Any parent/caregiver who cannot provide consent.

          -  Any parent/caregiver who cannot understand or write English.

               -  Has a previous or current diagnosis of food allergy, made by a board-certified
                  allergy and immunology specialist;

                       professional that your infant has eczema or any kind of skin allergy?
                       (National Health Interview Survey, 2012) If yes, go to Question 2.

                    2. Would you describe (his/her) eczema or skin allergy as mild, moderate, or
                       severe? (National Survey of Children's Health, 2007) If described as severe,
                       infant is excluded.
