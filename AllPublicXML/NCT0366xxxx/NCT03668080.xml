    <textblock>
      Whether and to what extent burnout risk is actually higher in surgical specialties than in
      non-surgical specialties is still unknown. Little is also known about what factors are
      associated with burnout between surgical residents and non-surgical residents. In this
      context, the present study has a three-fold aim: 1) to measure the prevalence of burnout
      among a sample of Italian medical residents; 2) to contrast the prevalence of burnout and
      psychological distress in surgical residents and non-surgical residents, and 3) to identify
      the work-related factors associated with burnout between surgical residents and non-surgical
      residents.

      Surgical training is considered to be very stressful among residents and graduating medical
      students choose less often surgery for their career. To elaborate burnout prevention
      programs, the assessment of the prevalence of burnout during the early career stage of the
      surgeons and associated risk factors, becomes central.

      Residents from the University of Bologna were asked to participate in an anonymous online
      survey. The residents completed a set of questions regarding their training schedule and
      three standardized questionnaires: 1) the Maslach Burnout Inventory, assessing the three
      dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal
      accomplishment (PA); 2) the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale; 3) the Psychosomatic Problems
      scale. High scores in either the EE or DP subscale categories predicted professional burnout.

    <description>a validated 22-item questionnaire that evaluates burnout in its three dimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE) depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). Responses are made on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 6 (&quot;daily&quot;).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of depressive symptoms was measured using the 20-item Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Items responses rank from 1 (&quot;none or little of the time&quot;) to 4 (&quot;most or all of the time&quot;), and the total score range from 20 to 80 points. A score of 50 and above indicated the presence of at least mild-moderate depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosomatic Problems Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Psychosomatic symptoms were measured using the Psychosomatic Problems Scale, which consists of 8 items: difficulty concentrating, sleep problems, headache, stomachache, tensions, lack of appetite, feeling sad, and dizziness. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (&quot;never&quot;) to 5 (&quot;always&quot;). Participants answering &quot;often&quot; or &quot;always&quot; on an item are coded as having a psychosomatic symptom.</description>
