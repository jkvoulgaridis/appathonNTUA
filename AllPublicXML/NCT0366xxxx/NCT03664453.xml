  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of omaveloxolone (150
      mg) in healthy adult subjects and will assess the safety, tolerability, and dose
      proportionality of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg omaveloxolone in healthy adult subjects.

      The study will be conducted in two parts, conducted simultaneously. Part 1 will assess the
      food effect, while Part 2 will assess dose proportionality.

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment sequences. Two single doses of omaveloxolone 150 mg (taken in multiple 50 mg capsules) will be administered to the subjects beginning in the fasted state (Period 1) with a crossover and then in the fed state (Period 2).
Subjects will be confined beginning on Study Day -1 through the last PK blood draw on Study Day 6 during Period 1, and from Study Day 14 through the last PK blood draw on Study Day 20 during Period 2.</description>
