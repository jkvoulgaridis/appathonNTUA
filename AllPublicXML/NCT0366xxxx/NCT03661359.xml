  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to connect patients with community resources to
      improve social determinants of health. Secondary objectives are improving patient
      satisfaction within the trauma and general surgery service, enhancement of physician-patient
      communication, betterment of surgery department Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
      Providers and Systems scores, and increased understanding of correlations between patient
      satisfaction and social determinants of health.

      The investigators hypothesize that (1) directed screening and intervention can have a
      positive effect for patients and hospitals, (2) directed patient advocacy will have an effect
      on patients' perception of care, (2) social determinants of health will have an effect on
      patients' perception of care, and (4) traumatic injury and acute surgery will have an effect
      on patients' perception of care.

      The investigators will be conducting this study as a prospective, non-randomized quality
      improvement study that will look at patients 18 years of age and older who are admitted under
      the trauma and general surgery specialties. Patients will be identified through admission to
      the trauma or general surgery service or referred to surgery services.

      Eligible patients will be identified and approached by the study team. Once the informed
      consent is completed, patients will be given a Social Determinants of Health Screening Tool,
      an Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Feedback Tool, and an
      short form health survey (SF-12) Quality of Life Questionnaire. Feedback from the Hospital
      Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems results will be given immediately to
      the relevant teams (nurses, doctors, etc.) to address the patient's concerns. Prior to
      discharge, the patients will also be given referrals to designated community resources. On
      day 15 (+/- 7 days) after discharge, the patients will receive a follow up phone call where
      they will be asked if they have utilized the Social Determinants of Health Referrals.
      Participants will also be given a second Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers
      and Systems Feedback Survey at this time. On day 30 (+/- 7 days) after discharge, the
      patients will receive a follow up phone call where the participants will be asked if they
      utilized the Social Determinants of Health Referrals. Participants will also be given a
      second short form health survey (SF-12) Quality of Life Survey at this time.
