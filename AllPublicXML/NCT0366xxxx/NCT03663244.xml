  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to assess the feasibility and to improve the quality of a definitive Randomised
      Controlled Trial (RCT) with the purpose to investigate the effectiveness of stress reduction
      programmes in the community. (A definitive RCT = an RCT with statistical power). Intermediate
      aims: to investigate 1) the potential generalizability: the accept among the target
      population (people with perceived stress) of participating in an RCT, including a description
      of the participant characteristics and the recruitment time ; 2) the risk of intervention
      effect dilution: the accept of allocated intervention in terms of programme completion ; 3)
      the risk of contamination: potential participation in (other) stress reduction treatment
      beyond the allocated intervention or non-intervention ; 4) the risk of selection problems or
      -bias: the lost to follow-up in the trial arms ; and finally, 5) the risk of information
      problems: the accept among participants of chosen outcome measurements, sensitivity of chosen
      outcome measures to detect effects, and indications of potential effects.
