  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Importance: The problems of side effects of metabolic disturbances in schizophrenic patients
      have been of worldwide concern for some time. Patients with dyslipidemia have an increased
      risk of cardiovascular diseases. A Chinese herb, Hawthorn, is widely used for the treatment
      of dyslipidemia.

      Objective: Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of Hawthorn on lipid profile
      levels in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal case-control study was used in a general
      hospital in Taiwan. A total of 59 schizophrenics treated with antipsychotics, and 76 healthy
      adult subjects, who were all hospital workers, were enrolled in this study.

      Main outcomes and measures: All participants received Hawthorn at a dose of 3 gm/day for six
      months.

    <textblock>
      The problem of metabolic disturbances in schizophrenic patients who take antipsychotics has
      always been a cause for global concern and discussion. Although Hawthorn is widely used in
      the treatment of heart problems and the lowering of blood lipid levels, it is unknown whether
      Hawthorn has an effect in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. Hence, there
      are several areas of interest in the present study: 1) the effect of Hawthorn on lipid
      profile levels in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics; 2) a comparison of
      lipid profile levels between schizophrenic patients and healthy adults; 3) the contributing
      factors that relate to changes in lipid profile levels in patients who take Hawthorn.
