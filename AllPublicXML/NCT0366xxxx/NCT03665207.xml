  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients usually develop hyperglycemia, which is associated with an increased
      risk of morbidity and mortality. Controversy exists on whether targeting normal blood glucose
      concentrations with insulin therapy, referred to as tight blood glucose control (TGC)
      improves outcome of these patients, as compared to tolerating hyperglycemia. It remains
      unknown whether TGC, when applied with optimal tools to avoid hypoglycemia, is beneficial in
      a context of withholding early parenteral nutrition. The TGC-fast study hypothesizes that TGC
      is beneficial in adult critically ill patients not receiving early parenteral nutrition, as
      compared to tolerating hyperglycemia.
