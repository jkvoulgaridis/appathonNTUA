  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label sequential dose escalation and cohort expansion study evaluating
      the safety, tolerability and preliminary clinical activity of COM701 as monotherapy and in
      combination with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study evaluates the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary
      clinical activity of COM701 an inhibitor of poliovirus receptor related immunoglobulin domain
      containing (PVRIG) as monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in subjects with
      advanced solid tumors. Cohort expansion will be explored evaluating COM701 monotherapy and in
      combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in subjects with the following select tumor types
      (Non-Small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Ovarian, Breast (including Triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) and endometrial cancer. Other tumor types such as CRC-MSS, CRC-KRAS mutant will be
      enrolled based on emerging clinical activity data.
