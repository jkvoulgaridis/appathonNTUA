  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans is due to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque
      in the lower extremities, resulting in the stenosis and occlusion of the artery, leading to
      chronic ischemia of the limbs. Although bypass surgery and angioplasty ( or interventional
      therapy ) are effective methods for vascular treatment in patients with PAD to revascularize,
      a significant proportion of patients with the arterial disease are not eligible for direct
      arterial surgery. Meanwhile, there are many patients who suffer from diffuse arterial disease
      or severe peripheral disease not suitable for interventional therapy. Stimulation of
      arteriogenesis( blood bypassing the occluded arteries through a large number of collateral
      vessels ) and angiogenesis ( generating new small blood vessels ) have become the focus of
      research.

      Our recombinant SeV-hFGF2/dF injection (R&amp;D code BF30 ) uses the human basic fibroblast
      growth factor ( FGF2 ) gene to express the target protein FGF2 locally by intramuscular
      injection. The preparation can efficiently express FGF2 in infected cells and secrete it to
      the periphery and be fixed in the intercellular substance. Since FGF2 is in the upstream
      regulatory pathway of VEGF, HGF and other factors, it can regulate the coordinated expression
      of these cytokines related to the growth and function of new blood vessels, and finally,
      produce mature blood vessels.

      To evaluate the safety ( tolerance), pharmacokinetics (PK), biological activity, and
      immunogenicity of BF30 in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease, and to
      explore clinical benefits.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety ( tolerability ) of single-dose BF30 in patients with
      lower extremity arterial occlusive disease, and to provide evidence for the dose of
      subsequent clinical trials.

      Secondary objective: To explore the pharmacokinetics (PK), biological activity, the
      immunogenicity of BF30, and to initially explore clinical benefits.
