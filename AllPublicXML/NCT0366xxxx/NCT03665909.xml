      The objective of this 5-year demonstration project is to build on the work of The Lutheran
      Home Association (TLHA) and conduct an embedded experimental mixed methods evaluation to
      determine the efficacy of the eNeighbor technology in improving outcomes among persons with
      Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) living in the community and their family
      caregivers. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1) To compare 100 ADRD caregivers randomly
      assigned to an attention control with 100 ADRD caregivers who utilize eNeighbor over an
      18-month period to determine if the use of the remote sensor technology results in a)
      significant (p &lt; .05) increases in caregiver self-efficacy and sense of competence, b)
      significant decreases in caregiver distress (subjective stress, depressive symptoms), c)
      significant delays of or reductions in negative health transitions (falls, wandering events)
      and service utilization (residential care placement, hospitalizations) for persons with ADRD;
      and d) greater cost-effectiveness; 2) To determine through &quot;embedded&quot; qualitative data
      collection components how eNeighbor is successfully utilized and why this health monitoring
      technology benefits persons with ADRD and their family caregivers; and 3) To engage
      stakeholders on a quarterly basis throughout this 5-year demonstration project in order to
      enhance the utility and stakeholder-relevance of health monitoring technology for families
      who care for persons with ADRD. The investigators anticipate that the successful completion
      of the project aims will position the eNeighbor as an innovative, stakeholder-centric service
      that offers robust support for family caregivers of persons with ADRD in the community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In collaboration with a 15-member Community Advisory Board that includes community care
      providers, healthcare organizations, and ADRD caregivers themselves, the proposed 5-year
      project will build on the current efforts of The Lutheran Home Association (TLHA) to evaluate
      eNeighbor remote monitoring technology for persons with ADRD living in the community and
      their family caregivers. The Specific Aims are as follows:

        1. To determine the efficacy of remote sensor technology over an 18-month period for 100
           persons with ADRD and their caregivers randomly assigned to an eNeighbor treatment
           condition when compared to 100 usual care controls. The investigators hypothesize:

           Hx. 1) Significant (p &lt; .05) improvements in caregiver self-efficacy and sense of
           competence in managing a relative's ADRD; Hx. 2) Significant reductions in caregiver
           distress (e.g., subjective stress, or feelings of emotional fatigue and role entrapment;
           depressive symptoms); Hx. 3) Significant delay of or reductions in health transitions
           (falls, wandering) and service utilization (hospitalizations, nursing home admission)
           for persons with ADRD; and Hx. 4) Greater cost-effectiveness associated with a person
           with ADRD's health service use.

        2. To &quot;embed&quot; evaluation components: a) during the randomized controlled evaluation through
           the administration of open-ended survey items to all ADRD caregivers in the eNeighbor
           treatment condition every 6 months to examine the utility of the remote health
           monitoring technology; and b) at the conclusion of the 18-month evaluation by
           purposively sampling 15 ADRD caregivers who reported positive acceptance on the embedded
           qualitative and quantitative 6-, 12-, and 18-month system reviews and 15 ADRD caregivers
           who reported low acceptance on the embedded qualitative and quantitative 6-, 12-, and
           18-month system reviews to participate in semi-structured interviews. The interviews
           will help the research team determine why the health monitoring intervention was or was
           not efficacious; and

        3. To engage stakeholders on a quarterly basis throughout the 5-year project with the goal
           of enhancing the utility (via community-based participatory approaches) and
           stakeholder-relevance of eNeighbor implementation and evaluation for family caregivers
           of persons with ADRD.

    <description>The home-based sensor technology of eNeighbor relies on multiple, non-invasive and safe remote monitors (up to 6 sensors) that can alert family caregivers and/or health professionals to potentially negative situations that lead to adverse outcomes (e.g., wandering, falls, incomplete activity of daily living tasks). The technology platform of eNeighbor relies on wireless infrastructure that allows for remote monitoring via alerts that are communicated to the family caregiver's or nurse care manager's personal computers or handheld devices. The Alerts that are generated from the sensors detected abnormal motion or activity are sent to the family caregiver as well as a nurse care manager that monitors the real-time information generated by the eNeighbor sensors.</description>
