      Pilot study to assess the feasibility of creation of a bone and arterial panorama by 2D-2D
      registration technique during endovascular femoro-popliteal procedures with a mobile C-arm
      X-ray system using EndoNaut® software.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to show that it is possible to give a complete image of the area to
      be operated by the surgeon by creating a complete bone and arterial panorama of the
      femoro-popliteal axis with 2D-2D registration techniques. This study should have a clinical
      impact for the patient and caregiver. With this technique, we expect a reduction in the
      irradiation of the patient and the caregivers, a decrease in the volume of injected contrast
      product and a decrease in operating time.

    <description>The routine care procedure begins with staged injections of contrast medium to provide a map of the lesions. The lesions are then treated by angioplasty with or without stenting.
New injections of contrast product are made to control the results of the treatment.
As part of this pilot study, the assistive software and its interface will be linked and with the mobile C-arm X-ray system. Scopic images and angiograms will be retransmitted to be processed by the EndoNaut® software.</description>
