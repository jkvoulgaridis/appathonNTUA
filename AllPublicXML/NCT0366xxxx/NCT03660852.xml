  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IRM-DU is a prospective observational single center study conducted in an emergency
      department to evaluate the impact of a MRI scanner exclusively dedicated to emergency in the
      clinical management of patients presenting with dizziness or diplopia.

      The study will compare 2 strategies : after and before availability of a MRI scanner
      dedicated to emergency.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of stroke confirmed by
      imaging (MRI or Computed tomography (CT)) in the group &quot;before implementation of the
      emergency MRI scanner&quot; and the group &quot;after implementation of the emergency MRI scanner&quot;.

      The hypothesis is that the availability of a MRI scanner dedicated to emergency will improve
      the diagnosis of stroke in patients presenting with dizziness or diplopia, and will reduce
      Emergency Department stay, hospital stay and hospitalisation costs.
