      The aims of the Improving Communication with Formal/Informal Caregivers among Older Adults
      with Dual Sensory Impairment: Feasibility of Hearing Intervention in a Low Vision
      Rehabilitation Clinic (LVR) are:

      Primary aims Aim 1 To characterize prevalence of objective hearing impairment (i.e. DSI)
      among a clinical LVR population) in older adults (≥60 years) with English proficiency free
      from moderate to severe depression or cognitive decline using the Hearing Handicap Inventory
      for the Elderly (HHIE) assessment and an objective hearing evaluation.

      Aim 2 To describe the perceived burden of care on primary caregiver (identified people who
      assist with two or more activities of daily living. instrumental activities of daily living
      (ADLs/Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs))of individuals with dual sensory
      impairment (DSI) among a clinical LVR population in older adults (≥60 years) with English
      proficiency free from moderate to severe depression or cognitive decline using the Zarit
      Burden Interview questionnaire and qualitative interview data analyses.

      Aim 3 To determine feasibility and benefit of a pilot manualized over-the-counter hearing
      intervention program on LVR patients to address communication among a DSI population using
      the Zarit Burden Interview questionnaire.

      3A: Describe feasibility based on completion of pilot, drop-out rate, and semi-structured
      interviews 3B: Describe perceived communication improvements based on semi-structured
      interviews

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot is a prospective cohort study. Approximately 100 participants and their identified
      people who assist with two or more ADLs/IADLs will be assessed for DSI prevalence and DSI
      impact on communication. A sub-cohort of 10 participants with DSI will be provided a hearing
      intervention and followed for 4-6 weeks to assess the over-the-counter hearing intervention
      program's impact on communication among a DSI population and its identified people who assist
      with two or more ADLs/IADLs.

      Recruitment will be based at the Wilmer Eye Institute (East Baltimore location) LVR clinic.
      Recruitment efforts will focus on older adults (≥60 years) with English proficiency attending
      the LVR clinic. Caregivers will be identified based on self-report assistance with at least
      two ADLs and/or IADLs.

      The hearing intervention, for the sub-cohort of 10 individuals with DSI and their identified
      people who assist with two or more ADLs/IADLs, consists of instruction and best-practices
      provided by an occupational therapist on the utilization of a handheld amplifier (SuperEar
      SE9000). Prior to the LVR session with the handheld amplifier, individuals with DSI will
      complete a daily functioning (ADLs/IADLs) questionnaire (a measure of LVR success). The
      occupational therapist will give participant a handheld amplifier (SuperEar SE9000) and
      provide instruction on device use and best-practices (i.e. reducing background noise) to
      improve communication for the patient-caregiver pairs.

      Participant-caregiver pairs will utilize the device and communication strategies over a
      4-6-week period between LVR visits. Upon return, pairs will complete semi-structured
      interviews to elicit information about utilization (successes, barriers), impact on
      communication, and open qualitative feedback. Participants and caregivers will complete
      post-intervention functioning questionnaire and Zarit Burden Interview, respectively.

          -  Residency. Participants must plan to reside in the local area for the pilot duration

          -  Willingness to participate and adhere to the protocol. Participants must be willing
             and able to consent to participate in the study, be willing to adhere to the pilot
             protocol for the duration of the pilot (1 session for aim 1 and aim 2, 2 sessions 4-6
             weeks apart for aim 3).

        To be eligible for aim 3 of the study, older adult participants must meet the following
        additional criteria:

          -  Dual Sensory Impairment (only for aims 2 and 3)

          -  Hearing Impairment. Participant hearing will be measured by pure tone audiometry a
             four-frequency test in both ears. Hearing impairment score &gt;=25dB in better ear.

        Caregiver (Identified People who Assist with Two or More ADLs/IADLs) Participants

        To be eligible for aims 2 &amp; 3 of the study, caregiver participants must meet the following
        criteria:

        • Assist an eligible and willing older adult pilot participant with two or more ADLs/IADLs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential candidates for enrollment who meet one or more of the following criteria are
        excluded from participation in the study:

          -  Medical contraindication to use handheld amplifier. Because hearing amplifier will be
             the primary device used in the hearing intervention, participants with medical
             contraindications to hearing amplifier use are excluded. Contraindication will be
             determined by pilot audiologist. These may include:

          -  Active ear infection

          -  Atresia

          -  Profound hearing loss beyond the limits of the device

          -  Asymmetrical hearing loss

          -  Central hearing loss (i.e. neurologic in origin)

          -  Free from Vision Impairment. Participants will be excluded who have no vision
             impairment after refraction on acuity, visual field status and contrast sensitivity as
             assessed by a low vision rehabilitation clinician.

          -  Depression. Screened with Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) score
             ≥16.
