        The study population will include ambulatory participants diagnosed with schizophrenia that
        switched from oral antipsychotics (OAPs) to paliperidone palmitate 1-month formulation
        (PP1M), and with available information concerning the annual schizophrenia-related
        hospitalizations before and after initiation of PP1M treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis schizophrenia according to the International
             Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th Edition codes, or the correspondent ICD-10 codes
             if applicable

          -  Must have been treated with oral antipsychotics (OAPs) and who switched to
             paliperidone palmitate 1-month formulation (PP1M) due to poor adherence, or lack of
             efficacy (no significant symptom reduction, as judged by the treating physician, at
             maximum recommended dose of an antipsychotic for 6 weeks), or participants' choice, or
             unknown reason when the switch has not been clearly justified

          -  Had been treated with OAPs for at least 12 months prior to switching to PP1M. During
             the treatment with OAPs, dose adjustments were allowed. Participants should have been
             treated with PP1M for at least 4 consecutive months after the switch

          -  Must have available information concerning the annual schizophrenia-related
             hospitalizations before and after initiation of PP1M treatment during the observation
             period, and with the indication of PP1M initiation in their medical charts

          -  Must be being treated at an ambulatory setting at study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with schizophrenia resistant to treatment (TR). TR is defined for the
             purpose of this study by at least two failed adequate trials with different
             antipsychotics (at maximal antipsychotic efficacious label dose for 4 to 6 consecutive
             weeks)

          -  Participants that used clozapine as treatment for schizophrenia in any given period
             prior to or during the observation period, independently of other concomitant
             psychotropic medication

          -  Participants who have participated in a clinical trial during the observation period

          -  Participants that switched to PP1M before the 31st of July 2014, that is in the first
             6 months after it was available for reimbursement in Portugal
