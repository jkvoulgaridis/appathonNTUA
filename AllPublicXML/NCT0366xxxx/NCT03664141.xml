  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in two parts: 1) The pharmacokinetic (PK) part and 2) The
      appetite and nutritional evaluation part.

      The PK part of study will be conducted in open label manner on 10 end stage kidney disease
      (ESKD) patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) treatment. For the PK part, a
      starting dose of cannabis oil -1 drop of 3% cannabis oil once a day [each drop contain 1.2 mg
      CBD (cannabidiol) and 1.2 mg of ∆9-THC (∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol)], was judged to be safe for
      a first-in-MHD patient's administration. Escalation to the next higher dose and any dose
      adjustments of the next dose levels will be based on safety and tolerability results of the
      previously administered dose and available PK data of previous dose groups. Once the first
      dosage proved to be safe, there will be a 2 fold increase from the first dose level (2 drops
      once a day) to the second dose level. The dose levels will be increased by 2-fold from the
      previous dose level, until basal hunger and prospective consumption ratings assessed by the
      visual analogue scale (VAS) will increase at least by 10 mm between screening and the study
      visits (change-from-baseline) . PK parameters will be evaluated after first dosage
      administration and after dosage increased.

      The appetite and nutritional evaluation part of study will be conducted as a 3-month,
      double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single center study. The study population
      will include 30 ESKD patients receiving MHD treatment with different degrees of
      protein-energy wasting (PEW) defined as malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS) above 6. A
      total of 30 subjects will be randomized to treatment with either cannabis oil or matching
      placebo.

    <measure>Change in appetite assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>For 5 months from the day of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>VAS, 100 mm in length with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive (=100) and the most negative rating (=0), will be used to assess specific domains of appetite separately: hunger, satiety, fullness, prospective food consumption. Each domain will be measured by the 0-100mm scale as mentioned above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nutritional status assessed by the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS).</measure>
    <time_frame>For 5 months from the day of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>MIS consists of four sections (nutritional history, physical examination, body mass index [BMI], and laboratory values) and 10 components. Each MIS component has four levels of severity from 0 (normal) to 3 (very severe). The sum of all 10 components results in an overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 30 (severely malnourished).</description>

    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life assessed by short form 36 (SF-36) quality of life (QoL) scoring system</measure>
    <time_frame>For 5 months from the day of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of 36 questions, 35 of which are compressed into eight multi-item scales:
(1) physical functioning; (2) role-physical (3) bodily pain ; (4) general health; (5) vitality ; (6) social functioning (7) role-emotional and (8) mental health. In the SF36 scoring system, the scales are assessed quantitatively, each on the basis of answers to two to ten multiple choice questions, and a score between 0 and 100 is then calculated on the basis of well-defined guidelines, with a higher score indicating a better state of health.</description>
