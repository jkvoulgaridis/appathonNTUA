  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Korea has the highest incidence of gastric cancer worldwide and Helicobacter pylori
      infection is still prevalent. Clarithromycin-containing triple therapy is still the primary
      therapy approved by the Korean government. However, studies of antibiotic resistance has
      shown that regional resistance pattern to antibiotics such as clarithromycin, metronidazole,
      or quinolone. Recent study in Korea has shown that modified-quadruple therapy has comparable
      eradication rate to concomitant therapy. However, there has been no comparable study of
      modified-quadruple therapy with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. The aim of this study
      is to compare the eradication rate of modified-quadruple therapy and bismuth-containing
      quadruple therapy with presenting phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance profile.
