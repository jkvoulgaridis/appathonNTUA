  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac biomarkers have dramatically impacted the way HF patients are evaluated and managed.
      In fact, the role of biomarkers has developed to better differentiate HF against other
      diseases and, to timely initiate and influence more accurate diagnosis (rule out) and
      treatments, to predict the onset of future HF, to risk‐stratify affected patients, and to
      serve as a tool to guide intensity of therapy. NT‐proBNP has become validated biomarkers with
      highest guideline recommendation (class I) and independent predictors for re‐hospitalization
      and mortality in HF patients. However, many Indonesian cardiologists do not use of those
      biomarkers, mostly due to limited available cardiac biomarkers for the cost effective heart
      failure management. We evaluate 2 alternative treatments which one that more cost-effective
      between biomarker's guided therapy and without biomarker.

    <textblock>
      With growing demands on limited health care budgets, optimal resource allocation in HF
      patients is essential. Although NT pro BNP is proposed to be effective for the evaluation and
      management patients with heart failure, no data exist about cost-effectiveness analysis that
      are based on practice patterns endorsed by universal coverage systems in Indonesia (Jaminan
      Kesehatan Nasional). Because NT-proBNP therapy guidance in HF is believed to create
      additional costs, it is not yet broadly applicable. Its why we need to elaborate this issue.

    <description>Subjects who be included in NT-pro BNP group examined NT-pro BNP in the ED to determine the baseline level and prior to discharge for determine the percent decline from baseline level. Patients in the NT-pro BNP group can be discharged if the NT-pro BNP level decreased ≥ 30% from baseline. If the target percent decline is not met, we will do intensification of therapy according to the algorithm</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group were managed based on clinical judgment without use of NT-pro BNP testing. In the control group, the decision whether patient can be discharged or not was determined by cardiologist in charge of the patient based on clinical assessment.</description>

    <description>. AHF patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to 2 groups, NT-pro BNP group and control group. In the NT-pro BNP group, serial NT-pro BNP levels at admission and pre-discharge was measured, the latter with the target of decrease ≥ 30% NT-pro BNP level. Randomised patients were followed during treatment up to 90 days post-discharge to assess short-term outcomes and costs.</description>
