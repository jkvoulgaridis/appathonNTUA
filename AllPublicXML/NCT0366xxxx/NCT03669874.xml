  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a spontaneous, prospective, monocentric, observational, cohort study, with the aim of
      evaluating the effect of ultrasound-guided endoscopic fundoplication using the Medigus
      Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler (MUSESystem; MediGus, Ltd. Israel) in patients with
      esophageal or extra-esophageal gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms. The
      end of the study will be at the end of the 6-year follow-up of the last patient enrolled. The
      study proposes the following objectives:

        -  Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic fundoplication with MUSE for
           the treatment of GERD, through clinical experience, in terms of:

             -  effect on GERD-Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI)
                questionnaire scores

             -  effect on the use and dosage of proton pump inhibitors (PPI)

             -  feasibility and safety of the endoluminal fundoplication procedure

        -  Secondary objective: to characterize the treated patient population (demographic and
           objective data) and to identify the successful predictors of the procedure.

      The study design includes the following phases:

      *Preliminary patient evaluation and verification of inclusion criteria through: Upper GI
      endoscopy Esophageal high-resolution manometry 24-hours esophageal pH-impedance OFF PPI PPI
      use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI

        -  6-month follow-up: Upper GI endoscopy Esophageal high-resolution manometry 24-hours
           esophageal pH-impedance OFF PPI PPI use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI

        -  12-months follow-up: Upper GI endoscopy 24-hours esophageal pH-impedance OFF PPI PPI use
           GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI

        -  Yearly clinical follow-up (up to 6 years):

      PPI use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Endoscopic fundoplication</intervention_name>
    <description>Endoscopic fundoplication is a less invasive alternative to the traditional surgical fundoplication.
The MUSE device is similar to an endoscope, so the whole procedure can be done by a single operator. The device is composed of a shaft with a distal rigid part which is placed in the esophagus 3 cm proximal to the esophago-gastric junction containing a cartridge holding five B-shaped titanium surgical Staples and a tip which is retroflexed and contains an ultrasonic transducer which defines the correct tissue thickness for stapling the fundus against the esophagus. The device must be extracted to be reloaded with 5 more staples at a time for creation of a 180° anterior fundoplication.</description>
