      The patient was given a daily dose of apatinib 500mg (or based on weight). Individualized
      chemotherapy regimens were given based on molecular expression and prior chemotherapy. Brain
      MRI+MRS was examined every 3 months; Blood routine, urine routine and liver and kidney
      function were examined once a week.

    <description>The patient was given a daily dose of apatinib 500mg (or based on weight). For adult, the dose of apatinib was prescribed with 425 mg or 500 mg per day and four weeks for a cycle. The dosage was modified to 250 mg if patients experienced ≧grade 2 hematologic adverse events, hand and foot syndrome, proteinuria, fecal ocular blood, or grade 3/4 hypertension, or other grade 3/4 adverse events. Apatinib was administrated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) 18 years &lt; the age of patients &gt; 70 years. (2) Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) ≥
             60. (2) Histologically confirmed diagnosis of GBM World Health Organization [WHO]

             resonance imaging (MRI) confirmation and a minimum life expectancy of 8 weeks. (4)
             Definition of relapse: all patients must have progressive disease on MRI defined by
             Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria after the standard Stupp
             protocol. The time interval for the start of treatment was at least 12 weeks from
             prior radiotherapy unless there was either histopathologic confirmation of recurrent
             tumor or new contrast enhancement on MRI outside of the radiotherapy treatment field.

             ≥1500/µL, platelet count ≥100 000/µL, hemoglobin ≥8.0g/dL), adequate renal function
             (serum creatinine ≤ 150μmol/L, 24 hours urine protein ≤3.4g), and liver function
             (total bilirubin ≤34μmol/L and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase ≤120U/L).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) extracranial metastatic disease, (2) Gliadel wafer treatment, (3) severe
             cardiopulmonary insufficiency, (4) status epilepticus, (5) pregnancy, (6)
