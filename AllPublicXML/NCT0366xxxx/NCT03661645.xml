    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a prospective randomized control trial of a group of patients
      undergoing surgical management of common orthopedic pathologies including fractures of the
      upper extremity and shoulder arthroplasty; patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for
      osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Patients will be assigned randomly to one of two treatment arms: (1) single intraoperative
      dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone (control group, IV dexamethasone is standard of care)
      or (2) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone followed with a 6-day
      oral methylprednisolone taper course (Active Group).

      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of a post-operative course of
      glucocorticoids (GCs like Methylprednisolone) on pain, nausea and range of motion after
      surgical management of common orthopedic upper extremity pathologies, including fractures of
      the upper extremity and shoulder arthroplasty and patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
      for osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reducing pain and improving function is of great importance in the immediate period after
      surgery. Many orthopaedic procedures result in fluid build-up around the surgical site which
      results in pain and decreased healing. Glucocorticoids are drugs that block the inflammatory
      process which can decrease this pain and fluid build-up. Furthermore, glucocorticoids are
      safe if given in low doses and for a short period of time. To help address this gap, the
      study intend to give patients glucocorticoids after various upper extremity orthopedic
      procedures; total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty
      for osteoarthritis of the knee, assessing their pain and range of motion post-operatively.
      The study hypothesize that glucocorticoids will result in less inflammation around the
      surgical site, leading to pain relief, greater healing ability, and improvements in range of
      motion of the injured joint.

      The study aims to enroll 1000 subjects that are assigned randomly to one of two treatment
      arms: (1) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone (control group), IV
      dexamethasone is standard of care) or (2) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous
      dexamethasone followed with a 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper course (active group).
      Subjects will be followed up in clinic 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively that is a standard
      of care for upper extremity fractures, shoulder arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty for
      osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the knee

    <measure>Change in post-operative pain scores using numeric verbal analogue scores (VAS-Pain) during follow up in the methylprednisolone treated group compared to the control group</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Operative day (1-7), 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment will be assessed before performing the injection, at the time of injection, and at each subsequent follow up visit using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS-pain). The pain VAS is self‐completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10‐cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. Pain will be assessed at rest and active movement of the affected joint. Cut points for VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm). Normative values are not available.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey. SF-12 is a standardized self-report questionnaire that assesses mental and physical functioning. The SF-12 consists of 12 items with a Likert-type response format that measures quality of life with a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Subscales associated with the PCS include physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. Subscales associated with the MCS include vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. A scoring algorithm is used to generate a total score for each component ranging from 0 to 100. Low values represent a poor health state while high values represent a good health state.</description>
