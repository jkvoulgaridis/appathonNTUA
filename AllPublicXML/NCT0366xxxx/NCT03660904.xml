  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate and compare cryo-survival, re-expansion, and
      implantation rates of Day 5/6 human blastocysts that were vitrified with home-made media (HM)
      according to (Shady grove protocol) and warmed with gradual Thawing HM according to (Kuwayama
      protocol)with Global Fast Freeze/Thaw Kits (LifeGlobal, Canada).

      Group 1 blastocysts were vitrified with the Vit HM according to shady grove protocol using
      open system on cryotopvit. device and thawed with gradual thawing technique using HM
      according to Kuwayama protocol. Group 2 blastocysts were cryopreserved with the Global Fast
      Freeze Kitusing open system on cryotopvit. device and thawed using Gobal fast thaw kit.
      Blastocysts were subsequently cultured for 6-8 h, assessed for survival and expansion, then
      transferred and the percentages of Positive hCG, clinical pregnancy, implantation, multiple
      pregnancy and abortion were recorded.

    <intervention_model_description>Group 1 blastocysts were vitrified with the Vit (home made) HM according to shady grove protocol using open system on cryotop vit. device and thawed with gradual thawing technique using HM thawing media according to Kuwayama protocol.
Group 2 blastocysts were cryopreserved with the Global Fast Freeze Kit using open system on cryotop vit. device and thawed using Global fast thaw kit. Blastocysts were assessed immediately for survival, subsequently cultured for 6-8 h, assessed for survival and expansion, then transferred and the percentages of Positive hCG, clinical pregnancy, implantation, multiple pregnancy and abortion were recorded.</intervention_model_description>
