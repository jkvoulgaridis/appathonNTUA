  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the accuracy of a Clinical Decision-Support System to support
      early recognition of SIRS in paediatric intensive care patients. This assessment will be
      rated by the primary goals, the sensitivity and specificity of the system. Two experienced
      paediatric intensivists, who are blinded for the CDSS results, will analyse the electronic
      patient file (EPF) for SIRS criteria and thus establish our Goldstandard. All SIRS events
      recognized by the CDSS during the patient's stay are taken into account and will be compared
      with the established Goldstandard.

      The secondary goal of this trial is to evaluate the CDSS-results with the assessment of SIRS
      by paediatric doctors during their routine work on the PICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) are designed to solve knowledge-intensive tasks for
      supporting decision-making processes. Although many approaches for designing CDSS have been
      proposed, due to high implementation costs, as well as the lack of interoperability features,
      current solutions are not wellestablished across different institutions. Recently, the use of
      standardized formalisms for knowledge representation as terminologies as well as the
      integration of semantically enriched clinical information models, as openEHR Archetypes, and
      their reuse within CDSS are theoretically considered as key factors for reusable CDSS. The
      investigators already successfully transferred their concept into a prototype and evaluated
      the practicability on clinical data sets and in close cooperation between the clinicians and
      the technical experts. To the author's knowledge, currently, there are no openEHR based CDSS
      approaches which have been implemented and evaluated with such complex and important clinical
      contexts. Hence, the first clinically evaluated CDSS based on openEHR was successfully
      designed. When enhancing the described approach and implementing a live system, it might
      support clinicians to identify the patient's course of disease at an early stage, which can
      lead to better outcome for the patient. Furthermore, the system can serve as a basis for
      integrating (cross-institutional) machine learning components that could facilitate dealing
      with other high-complex decision problems or revealing yet unknown disease patterns.
