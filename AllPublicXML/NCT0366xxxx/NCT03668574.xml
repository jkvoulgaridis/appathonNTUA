  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a clinical trial testing the
      effectiveness of aerobic exercises program in patients with chronic non-specific low back
      pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (with a duration of at least
      12 weeks) who are seeking for treatment will be recruited. These patients will be randomly
      allocated into two groups.

      Patients allocated to the placebo group will be treated twice a week for a total of 12 weeks
      with detuned ultrasound and shortwave therapy

      Patients allocated to the exercise group will be trained with aerobic exercises on a
      treadmill twice a week for a total of 12 weeks.

      Primary outcomes will be pain and disability. Feasibility outcomes will be adherence,
      satisfaction and recruitment. Kinesiophobia, perceived global effect and physical capacity
      will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes. The outcome assessor of this trial will be
      blinded to the group allocation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity measured by a 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured by a 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale. Higher values represent higher pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability measured with the 0-24 Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be measured with the 0-24 Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire. Higher values represent higher disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia measured with Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiophobia (i.e. fear of movement) will be measured with the 17-68 point Tampa Scale of kinesiophobia. The higher the score, the higher is the fear of movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Impression of Recovery measured with the 11-point Global Perceived Effect Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Global impression of recovery will be measured with the 11-point (-5 to + 5) Global Perceived Effect Scale. A negative score means deterioration of symptoms and positive scores mean improvement. A score of +5 means that the patient is considered as fully recovered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity levels measured with an Accelerometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity will be measured with an accelerometer. Patients will wear an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. The higher the values, the higher the physical activity levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum exercise capacity measured with the modified Shuttle Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum exercise capacity will be measured with the modified Shuttle Walk Test. The purpose of this test is to see how far and fast patients can walk by following a series of time signals.
Patients will be asked to walk between two cones spaced 10 metres apart. Participants will begin by walking at a very slow pace; this pace is set by a beep. Patients will walk around the 10 metre course aiming to turn around a cone at the first beep, and around the second cone at the next beep.
The beep's will very gradually get faster, which means that patients will begin to walk at a quicker pace, getting faster and faster until he/she cannot keep up with the set pace, or until the participant is too breathless or tired to continue.
The test has 12 levels each lasting 1 minute with a minimum walking speed of 1.2 miles per hour, up to a maximum of 5.3 miles per hour.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This is the first measure to test if a larger trial will be feasible: the investigators will count the number of treatment sessions that patients attended during the treatment phase of the trial. The higher the number, the higher the adherence.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Recruitment measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will record the number of patients who will not agree to participate in the study and reasons for declining.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with care measured with the 0-130 Medrisk Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the 0-130 Medrisk Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire for measuring satisfaction with care. The higher the score, the higher is the satisfaction with care.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will firstly warm up for 5 minutes and begin training on the treadmill. There will be two weekly sessions, lasting 40 minutes, for 6 weeks, reaching a total of 12 sessions. The exercise intensity will vary from 60 to 90% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax) predicted by the percentage formula HR = HR rep + percentage (HRmax - HR rep), where HRmax = 220-age (years) and HR rep = HR obtained for five minutes of rest. Heart rate and level of subjective perception of the effort will be monitored during all sessions. Patients from this group will also be educated about their back pain by receiving a copy of The back Book.</description>

    <description>Patients will received a detuned pulsed 5-minute ultrasound and pulsed short-wave diathermy for 25 minutes, twice weekly for 6 weeks. The devices will be used with disconnected internal cables to obtain the placebo effect; however, it will be possible to manipulate the devices and adjust the doses and alarms as if they were connected, in order to simulate the pragmatism of clinical practice as well as to increase the credibility of the use of these devices in patients. Patients from this group will also be educated about their back pain by receiving a copy of The back Book.</description>
