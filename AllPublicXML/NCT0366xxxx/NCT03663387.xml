    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance. CSF cushions the
      brain from impact and carries waste products from the brain to the bloodstream. This process
      is known as clearance. Researchers have considered that impaired clearance of amyloid (a
      protein) from the aging brain causes buildup of amyloid in the brain and plays a role in
      increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. However, until recently, there has not been a method
      to measure CSF clearance. This study will examine CSF clearance using positron emission
      tomography (PET) scanning, which creates images of structures in the body and their
      functioning. This study will also measure the amount of two proteins, tau and amyloid, in the
      brain. Tau and amyloid are proteins that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's
      disease. An investigational compound (tracer) called [18F]MK-6240 is injected into the blood
      prior to the scan in order to take images of the CSF clearance and measure tau protein in the
      brain. This tracer is considered investigational because it is not approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and is only being used for research purposes.

        This study will involve male and female volunteer subjects from any racial or ethnic group
        with a diagnosis normal cognition. The base clinical cohort uses the same diagnostic
        inclusion and exclusion criteria for NL subjects as the NIHADNI protocol. The proposed
        sample is not intended to be representative of a general population, but it will
        approximate the samples recruited in NIH and industry sponsored FDA approved clinical
        trials targeting secondary AD prevention. At this stage of knowledge of human brain CSF
        clearance, a population based approach was considered premature and over cap funding to
        support a larger study was not permitted for RFA AG-17-055. Rather, our design uses Aβ
        enrichment to enable an efficient test of the CSF clearance hypothesis in a clinically
        relevant group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects between 40-85 years old will be enrolled. Younger subjects
             are not included as the risk for brain amyloid lesions is too low

          -  All subjects will speak English as their first language or demonstrate proficiency in
             English (defined as reaching a scaled score of &gt; 11 on the WAIS vocabulary test).

          -  All subjects will have normal cognition at baseline: a Clinical Dementia Rating CDR=0,
             Global Deterioration Scale GDS&lt;2.

          -  All subjects will be in good general health and able to participate in the LP and
             imaging exams. This determination is made by the study neurologist and reviewed at a
             consensus meeting for each subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension or metabolic disease
