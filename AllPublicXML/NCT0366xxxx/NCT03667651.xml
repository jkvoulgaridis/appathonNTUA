      This is a phase III, single blind (outcome assessor is blinded), randomised controlled
      multicentre trial of the effect of EpiCeram emollient for improving and maintaining skin
      barrier function and reducing incidence of eczema and food allergy in high risk infants.

      A total of 760 participants with a first degree family history of allergic disease (asthma,
      eczema, allergic rhinitis or food allergy) will be recruited (380 each group) from maternity
      wards of three hospitals.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that twice daily application of a
      ceramide dominant emollient reduces the risk of eczema and food allergy, when compared to
      standard skin management. Secondary objectives are to determine if twice daily application of
      a ceramide dominant emollient reduces the risk of infants developing allergic sensitisation
      (as measured by skin prick test); to determine if twice daily application of a ceramide
      dominant emollient improves infant skin barrier function; to determine the level of parental
      compliance with a program to build infant skin barrier function; to confirm that a ceramide
      dominant emollient does not cause adverse effects in infants; to determine the level of
      compliance required to demonstrate an improvement in infant skin barrier function and to
      determine if twice daily application of a ceramide dominant emollient influences infant skin
      microbial colonisation, or skin lipid profile.

      This is a phase III, single blind (outcome assessor is blinded), randomised controlled
      multicentre trial of the effect of EpiCeram emollient for improving and maintaining skin
      barrier function and reducing incidence of eczema and food allergy in high risk infants.

      A total of 760 participants with a first degree family history of allergic disease (asthma,
      eczema, allergic rhinitis or food allergy) will be recruited (380 each group) from maternity
      wards of three hospitals.

      Treatment will be from birth until six months, with a six week, six month and twelve month
      follow-up. An initial assessment will be performed at baseline which incorporates three
      surveys, a skin assessment, diary card (which is to be completed weekly and measures
      compliance), a breast milk sample, guthrie card and tape stripping. The six week and six
      month assessments entail a skin assessment, survey, compliance check, breast milk sample,
      tape stripping and guthrie card. Primary outcomes are assessed at the 12 month follow up
      where in addition to the aforementioned items, a saliva sample will also be taken and skin
      prick testing and food challenges will be performed when children have a positive SPT to one
      or more foods..

    <time_frame>12 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>This diagnosis is derived from a combination of allergic sensitisation, reaction history and food challenge. A skin prick test to six common allergens will be performed (egg white, cows' milk, peanut, dust mite, cat dander, and rye grass) along with a negative (saline) and a positive (histamine) control. Participants that are sensitised to certain foods (&gt;=1mm wheal) during the skin prick testing will be given a challenge to determine if they are allergic to those foods. This will be conducted at the MCRI Allergy Clinic under the supervision of a Doctor specifically trained in oral food challenges.</description>

    <description>They will be instructed to apply EpiCeram™ to the full skin surface of their child twice per day for 6 months. The prophylactic use of EpiCeram™ is the intervention that is being tested for its effect on infant skin barrier function. We will instruct parents to apply approximately 6 grams of EpiCeram™ per application at two regular times each day, including after bathing the infant, or at the time they would normally bathe their child.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Infants will be eligible for this study if their mother, father, or an older sibling has a
        self-reported history of at least one of the following conditions:

          -  asthma,

          -  eczema/atopic dermatitis,

          -  hay fever/ allergic rhinitis or

          -  food allergy

        Exclusion Criteria: infants with any of the following will be excluded:

          -  A parent who has a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of EpiCeram™ will
             be excluded, as it would be difficult for these parents to apply EpiCeram™ to their
             infant, and there is likely to be an increased risk of the infant reacting to the
             cream.

          -  Multiple births (twins, triplets etc.) will be excluded, due to the difficulty in
             randomising individual twins and because of the clustering effect of multiple children
             from the same family which would reduce the effective sample size of the study.

          -  Who are born premature (&lt;36 weeks) as the effect of the intervention may be different
             in premature infants.

          -  Who have major birth or early life medical complications that require admission into a
             special care nursery, as it will be difficult for parents to comply with the study
             requirements.

          -  Whose parents do not have sufficient English language skills to be able to answer
             questions.

          -  Whose parents are not able to comply with all protocol required visits and procedures
