  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propionibacterium acnes is a pathogen frequently identified during postoperative infections
      of the shoulder. A recent study has shown that P. acnes is likely to be disseminated in the
      operative field from the subcutaneous layer by soft tissue manipulation by the surgeon and
      the instruments (Falconer 2016). This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of
      subcutaneous tissue disinfection on P. acnes contamination during primary shoulder surgery.
      The literature shows that approximately one-third of patients have a P. acnes-infected
      surgical drape during primary shoulder arthroplasty (Falconer 2016). The source of this
      contamination would be the subcutaneous tissue. The hypothesis is that a disinfection of the
      subcutaneous tissue would reduce the contamination of the operative field with the aim of
      reducing the infection rate after shoulder surgery.

      It is a randomized, single-center, open-label, category A clinical trial, a research project
      on people involved in the collection of biological material and the collection of
      health-related personal data with the existence of consent.

      The investigators will study the effectiveness of Betadine subcutaneous tissue disinfection
      during primary shoulder surgery. They will randomize 105 patient on two arms. The control
      group receiving no disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue (A) and intervention group,
      receiving disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue (B). The investigators estimate that 4
      years is enough to recruit the number of patients needed for this study.

      All patients 18 years of age or older admitted to the Valais Hospital to receive primary
      shoulder surgery and who have signed the consent of the study will be eligible.
