  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to understand how pharmacokinetics and immunological inactivation affect the
      therapeutic efficacy of Asparaginase (ASP), it is of help and advised in the frame of
      clinical font-line protocols to monitor the enzymatic activity by measuring the serum ASP
      levels in the days following the administration of the drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent according to ICH/EU/GCP and national local laws

          -  Age 18 - 65 years

          -  Diagnosis of untreated Ph- ALL entering treatment including PEG-ASP in induction and
             consolidation

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2, unless a performance of 3 is unequivocally caused by the
             disease itself and not by pre-existing comorbidity, and is considered and/or
             documented to be reversible following the application of antileukemic therapy and
             appropriate supportive measures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Burkitt's leukemia

          -  Down's syndrome

          -  Adults with Ph+ ALL

          -  Pre-existing, uncontrolled pathology such as heart failure (congestive/ischemic, acute
             myocardial infarction within the past 3 months, untreatable arrhythmias, NYHA classes
             III and IV)

          -  Severe liver disease with serum bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL and/or ALT &gt;3 x upper normal limit
             (unless attributable to ALL)

          -  Kidney function impairment with serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL (unless attributable to ALL)

          -  Severe neuropsychiatric disorder that impairs the patient's ability to understand and
             sign the informed consent, or to cope with the intended treatment plan

          -  Presence of serious, active, uncontrolled infections

          -  Pre-existing HIV positive serology (i.e. already known before enrolment). If HIV
             positivity is detected after enrolment, the patient is put off study.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Men and women should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6
             months after Asparaginase discontinuation. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding
             should be discontinued during treatment with Asparaginase and should not be restarted
             after discontinuation of Asparaginase
