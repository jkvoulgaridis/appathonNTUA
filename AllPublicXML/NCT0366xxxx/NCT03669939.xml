    <textblock>
      The overarching plan for TOWER is to develop and test an algorithmic version of the Center
      for Disease Control Guidelines (CDCG) tailored for a specific primary care setting, the HIV
      primary care clinic. This CDCG intervention incorporates communication and implementation
      strategies tailored for the HIV primary care setting, and enabled with technology (an app for
      use by patients and EMR tools for providers).

    <textblock>
      However, according to a 2014 AHRQ report, there have been no studies evaluating the
      effectiveness of any prescription opioid risk mitigation strategies. Furthermore, due to
      ambiguity in some of the CDCG recommendations and the challenging nature of the
      patient-provider opioid conversation, the success of the CDCG may hinge on the manner in
      which it is implemented in individual care settings. Thus it is unclear what the true effect
      of the CDCG will be. The investigators believe that for the CDCG to have the greatest
      likelihood of achieving its goals of improving prescription opioid safety without causing
      unintended effects (e.g. exacerbation of pain, disruption of other aspects of care), its
      recommendations will need to be skillfully communicated. Furthermore, because of this &quot;human
      element&quot;and other sources of variability, documenting the effectiveness of the CDCG will
      require standardization of implementation. The overarching plan for TOWER is to develop and
      test an algorithmic version of the CDCG tailored for a specific primary care setting, the HIV
      primary care clinic. This CDCG intervention incorporates communication and implementation
      strategies tailored for the HIV primary care setting, and enabled with technology (an app for
      use by patients and EMR tools for providers). Achieving this goal has involved soliciting
      input from the HIV community using the method of Public Deliberation (PD) in the setting of
      two Citizen' s Panels, each with ~22 HIV-infected participants and lasting one day; and using
      the information obtained from the deliberative process to inform the development of the CDCG
      intervention. The investigators now plan to test the CDCG intervention for feasibility.

    <description>Per the CDC guideline (CDCG) for prescribing opioids in general primary care settings, there are 12 recommendations providers must follow in order to reduce prescription opioid-related harms while maintaining pain control and function. In order to monitor providers' adherence to the guideline and to establish appropriateness of &quot;usual care&quot;, within the control arm, we will implement the CDCG Adherence Assessment Tool. The CDCG Adherence tool will score patients' EMR notes and will consist of 10-items relevant to the 12 recommendations outlined in the CDCG. If the CDCG recommendations have been denoted in the EMR note, each item will receive points based on a 1-2 numeric scale (max of 16 points). All clinical visits completed during the duration of the study will be scored. A higher number indicating a favorable outcome of adherence to the CDCG guideline.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Two tools will be provided to Intervention providers, an Opioid Managing-app (OM-app) and an EMR note template. The acceptability of the OM-app and EMR tool within the clinical setting will be measured. The OM-app was designed to help collect data needed by the PCP to follow the CDC guideline. The OM-app will contact patients once daily with a link which will take them to a series of questions relevant to their pain management. The app will be responsible for aggregating this data into a report form that the PCP can utilize to facilitate a discussion with the patient and to populate an EMR progress note. The EMR note template will be provided to intervention providers in order to import data collected from the app into a patient's EMR during clinic visits. As with the control arm, the CDCG Adherence Assessment Tool will be implemented which will score patients' EMR notes on a 1-2 numeric scale (max of 16 points). A higher number indicating a favorable outcome.</description>

    <description>Tool for quantifying how much pain meds a patient is taking, by calculating the total weekly doses, the QAQ (&quot;as reported&quot;), and comparing them to the regimen score previously established by physicians who actively treat chronic pain. Regimens are rated on scale from 1 (small amount of meds) to 5 (large amt of meds). 1 QAQ point is assign for taking any opioids at all, &amp; an additional point assign for every equivalent of 100 mg of oral morphine used per week (1-99 mg = 1 pt; 100-199 = 2 pts, etc.). For all other oral meds, 1 point for taking the meds at all, &amp; an additional point for each 25% of the maximum dose taken (1-24% = 1 pt; 25-49% = 2 points, etc.). For topicals, 1 point for each topical reports using regardless of dose or frequency. No upper limit to the amt of QAQ points a patient may accrue. The lowest number of QAQ is 0=no medication. A higher discrepancy between the sum average of QAQ points and &quot;as prescribed&quot; points will indicate a lower adherence rate.</description>
