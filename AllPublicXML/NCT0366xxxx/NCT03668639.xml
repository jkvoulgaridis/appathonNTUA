  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, single-arm, phase II study to investigate the safety and antiemetic
      efficacy of Akynzeo (a fixed dose combination of palonosetron and netupitant) plus
      dexamethasone in patients receiving concomitant chemo-radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin for
      at least five weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Akynzeo contains a combination of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist netupitant and the
      serotonin receptor antagonist palonosetron. Akynzeo is approved as antiemetic prophylaxis in
      patients receiving high emetogenic chemotherapy e.g. high dose cisplatin administered every
      three weeks.

      From a previous clinical trial (GAND-emesis trial) we know that patients receiving
      radiotherapy and concomitant weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 are better protected against nausea
      and vomiting when a triplet antiemetic prophylaxis (neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist,
      serotonin receptor antagonist, and corticosteroid) is applied.

      In the Akynzeo phase III clinical trials, Akynzeo was administered every three weeks. The
      neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, netupitant, has a long plasma half-life (approx. 90 hours),
      and theoretically the drug could accumulate when administered on a weekly basis.

      The DANGER-emesis trial is designed to collect safety and efficacy data in patients receiving
      Akynzeo weekly as antiemetic prophylaxis in combination with dexamethasone in patients
      treated for cervical cancer with radiotherapy and concomitant weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a diagnosis of cervical cancer.

          2. The patient understands the nature and purpose of this study and the study procedures
             and has signed informed consent.

          3. The patient is aged ≥ 18 years.

          4. The patient must be both chemo- and radiotherapy (RT) naïve. NB: previously low
             voltage RT or electron RT for non-melanoma skin cancers is allowed.

          5. The patient is scheduled to receive fractionated radiotherapy and concomitant weekly
             cisplatin at a dose of ≥ 40 mg/m2 for at least five weeks.

          6. Brachy therapy is scheduled to be initiated after the third cycle of weekly cisplatin,
             and preferentially after the fifth week of treatment.

          7. Chemotherapy with an emetic risk potential of minimal or mild (up to 30%) is allowed
             on days 1-4 (see ref. 14).

          8. The patient has a WHO Performance Status of ≤ 2.

          9. Hematologic and metabolic status must be adequate for receiving weekly cisplatin in a
             dose of ≥ 40 mg/m2, and meet the following criteria:

               -  Total neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm3 (Standard units : ≥1.5 x 109/L)

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 (Standard units: ≥100.0 x 109/L)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x
                  ULN

               -  GFR ≥ 50 ml/min

         10. The patient is able to read, understand, and complete questionnaires and daily
             components of the Patient Diary for each study cycle.

         11. For patients of childbearing potential, urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
             (urine dipstick pregnancy test) or blood hCG results must be negative at screening,
             and these patients must agree to one of the following methods of contraception:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches,
                  hormonal vaginal devices or injections with prolonged release).

               -  Male partner who is sterile prior to the patient's entry into the study and is
                  the sole sexual partner for that patient.

               -  Complete abstinence from intercourse for two weeks before study entry and
                  throughout the study period plus a period after the trial to account for
                  elimination of the drug (minimum of eight days). Abstinence is only an acceptable
                  contraception form, when it reflects the usual and preferred lifestyle of the
                  patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a current malignant diagnosis other than cervical cancer, with

          2. The patient is pregnant or lactating.

          3. The patient has experienced emesis (i.e., vomiting and/or retching) or clinically
             significant nausea (defined as nausea graded as moderate or severe) in the 24 hours
             preceding the first dose of study medication.

          4. The patient has a history active peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal obstruction,
             gastrointestinal carcinoma, increased intracranial pressure, hypercalcemia, or any
             uncontrolled medical condition (other than malignancy) which in the opinion of the
             Investigator may confound the results of the study, represent another potential
             etiology for emesis and nausea (other than CINV/RINV) or pose an unwarranted risk to
             the patient.

          5. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to palonosetron, another
             5-HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or netupitant.

          6. The patient has previously received an NK1 receptor antagonist.

          7. The patient has received an investigational drug in the previous 30 days or is
             scheduled to receive any investigational drug during the study period.

          8. The patient has taken/received any medication of moderate or high emetogenic potential
             within the 48 hours prior to the first dose of study medications. Opiate drugs for
             cancer pain will be permitted if the patient has been on a stable dose and has not

                  tropisetron, ramosetron). Palonosetron is not permitted within 7 days prior to
                  receiving study drugs.

               -  Benzamide / benzamide derivatives (e.g., metoclopramide, alizapride).

               -  Benzodiazepines (except if the patient is receiving such medication for sleep or
                  anxiety and has been on a stable dose for at least seven days prior to the first
                  dose of study medications).

               -  Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone; with the
                  exception of topical steroids for skin disorders, inhaled steroids for
                  respiratory disorders).

               -  Anticholinergics (e.g., scopolamine).

               -  Cannabinoids.

               -  Mirtazapine.

               -  Olanzapine.

             (7) days prior to administration of study drugs (see Section 10.3.1., &quot;Inhibitors of
             CYP3A4&quot;).

         11. The patient has taken/received inducers of CYP3A4 within thirty (30) days prior to the
