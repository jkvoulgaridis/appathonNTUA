  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this open-label, Phase I, trial is to evaluate the toxicity profile
      of intraperitoneal talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) in patients with peritoneal surface
      dissemination from gastrointestinal or recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian tumors. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and viral shedding of TVEC
      by measuring viral load in serum and urine as well as viral load in peritoneal washings.

      This is a non-randomized, open-label Phase I trial in patients with Stage IV peritoneal
      surface dissemination from gastrointestinal or recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian tumors
      enrolled at Duke Cancer Institute. All subjects will complete an extensive medical history,
      baseline physical examination and clinical assessment to ensure subject eligibility
      requirements within 4 weeks of starting study drug. All eligible patients must have a
      peritoneal catheter placed at least 2 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy. All patients
      will receive an initial loading dose of TVEC 4x106 Plaque Forming Units (PFU) on Cycle 1 Day
      1 to enable the formation of protective antibodies as described in the currently approved
      treatment protocol for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma. Three weeks after the initial
      loading dose, patients will receive TVEC at the dose level for the cohort for which they are
      enrolled every 2 weeks for up to 4 doses. The length of the first cycle is 5 weeks and
      subsequent cycles are 2 weeks in duration.

      The first portion of the study, the Dose Escalation cohort, will evaluate the toxicity
      profile of TVEC in patients with peritoneal surface dissemination from gastrointestinal or
      recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian tumors. Using a standard '3+3' dose escalation design,
      there are up to three dose levels that may be explored. Dose escalation will be dependent on
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within the cohorts.

      Once the MTD has been determined, an additional 6 subjects will be enrolled to the dose
      expansion cohort. All subjects will receive an initial loading dose of TVEC 4x106 PFU on
      Cycle 1 Day 1. Three weeks after the initial loading dose, patients will receive TVEC at the
      MTD every 2 weeks for up to 4 doses. The length of the first cycle is 5 weeks and the
      subsequent cycles are 2 weeks in duration. There are a total of four cycles.

There will be two parts to this phase I study: 1) Dose Escalation Cohort; 2.) Dose Expansion Cohort
In the Dose Escalation Cohort, three subjects will be enrolled at the starting dose of 4x106 PFU, and the dosing will continue in the standard '3+3' dose escalation scheme. If the starting dose is tolerated, enrollment will continue at 4x107 and 4x108 PFU. Once the MTD is determined, six subjects will be enrolled to the Dose Expansion Cohort at the MTD. All subjects will be dosed with talimogene laherparepvec intraperitoneal (IP) once every 2 weeks for up to 4 doses (in addition to the initial seroconversion dose, which all patients will receive).</description>

             cancer that cannot be completely resected at the time of abdominal exploration, or
             recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastasese.
             Radiographically measurable disease is preferable, but for patients with previously
             documented gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer, for whom tumor markers (CEA or CA-125)
             have been useful markers of disease progression and/or response to treatment, a rising
             tumor marker (CEA or CA-125) could be substituted for radiographic imaging.

          2. Subjects must have had at least one prior round of systemic therapy or have refused or
             be ineligible for standard systemic therapy for their disease type.

             anticoagulants (and may need to be held per institutional standards for placement of
             the Bard peritoneal catheter).

             and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug, even if oral contraceptives are
             also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier
             method and a second method of birth control during the course of study and for 90 days

             new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids &gt;10 mg/day of prednisone
             or equivalent. The exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is
