  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hemophilia Growth and Development Study (HGDS) nearly 25 years ago showed haemophilia and
      HIV impacted brain development, thinking, and behaviour in children and adolescents. The
      eTHINK study is designed to understand whether advances in hemophilia treatment have removed
      any impact of hemophilia. If there still is an impact of hemophilia, the eTHINK study will
      help to identify which children or adolescents are still at risk, and how to screen other
      children. Participants and their child will participate in a comprehensive assessment of
      child's brain development, thinking and behavior through completing tests and questionnaires.
      There is only one study visit of 1 to 1.5 hours with no follow-up required

    <description>The participants will undergo a brief physical examination focused on neurologic function (muscle function, sensation, coordination, walking). Parents will be asked by the study team or the psychologist about their children and will complete several commonly used standard surveys about brain development, thinking, behavior, and decision making. The participants will also engage with the psychologist to evaluate development or thinking (IQ), and depending on their age they may be asked to complete one or more commonly used standard surveys about behavior and decision making.</description>
