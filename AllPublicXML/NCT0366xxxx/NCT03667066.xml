  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of clopidogrel resistance among a
      selected group of patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention and to
      observe whether there was any south-Asian (Indo-Trinidadian) predilection for HPR considering
      the well-established epidemiologic trends for accelerated CAD within this subgroup.

    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel, a second generation oral thienopyridine, remains an integral component of dual
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for almost two
      decades. Several studies underscore the importance of high on-treatment platelet reactivity
      (HPR) as a prognosticator for cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis. This
      phenomenon is often alluded to as &quot;clopidogrel resistance&quot; and yet to be clearly defined.
      Generally, it reflects the failure to achieve its antiaggregatory effect. Clopidogrel
      response is both complex and multifactorial, determined by a multitude of intrinsic and
      extrinsic mechanisms including genetic polymorphisms of the P2Y12 receptor, drug-drug
      interactions, and clinical factors such as suboptimal dosing regimens, acute coronary
      syndromes, diabetes mellitus, and possibly smoking.

      High pre-treatment platelet reactivity may lead to mitigated clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet
      effects and are more commonly observed in specific clinical scenarios such as ACS, increased
      body mass index, and diabetes mellitus, in particular, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
      Matetzky et al also surmised that nearly one-quarter of ST-segment elevation acute coronary
      syndrome patients would incur stent thrombosis due to this phenomenon.

      Overall, HPR prevalence in various studies is estimated at 5%-44%, however, these are based
      on largely Caucasian populations and yet to be ascertained in a Caribbean subpopulation.
      Trinidad and Tobago has an ethnically diverse population with approximately one-third South
      Asian (Indo-Trinidadian), one-third Caribbean Black (Afro-Trinidadian) and the remaining
      one-third, mostly interracial and mixed. CVD is currently the leading cause of mortality in
      Trinidad and Tobago, accounting for up to 60% of all deaths annually.

        This is a cross-sectional, open-label (Plavix, Sanofi SA, Gentilly, France, Bristol-Myers
        Squibb, New York, USA) pilot study aimed to assess high on-treatment platelet reactivity
        which occurred during the period September 2017 to January 2018. Patients were screened
        with a stratified permuted block randomization technique which applied to both recruitment
        days (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) and patients enrolled at the cardiac catheterization
        laboratory (cardiac bays 1 to 4) at the investigator's institution (Eric Williams Medical
        Sciences Complex, Trinidad and Tobago). The clinical research associates were blinded to
        the allocation assignment and randomization sequence numbers were obtained from SPSS
        version 24.0 software (IBM SPSS Statistics, New York City, New York, USA). On average, 1-2
        patients were enrolled every week for 8 months.
