      The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the iGrow Readers curriculum in
      changing diet and physical activity knowledge among preschool-aged children. The secondary
      objective of this study was to better understand the relationship between diet and physical
      activity related outcome variables in preschool aged children and their primary caregivers.

      The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the iGrow Readers curriculum in
      changing diet and physical activity knowledge among preschool-aged children. The secondary
      objective of this study was to better understand the relationship between diet and physical
      activity related outcome variables in preschool aged children and their primary caregivers.

      iGrow Readers was created to support literacy development among preschoolers, while promoting
      nutrition and physical activity messages. This program utilizes the social cognitive theory
      because it focuses on different environments influencing individual's behaviors and knowledge
      acquisitions, primarily through observing others within the context of social interactions
      and experiences. Developmentally appropriate preschool-aged children books, including
      relevant Native American books, facilitate the themes of healthy physical activity and
      nutrition practices. The program, a 6-8-week educational curriculum, helps young children
      understand the benefits of making healthy decisions involving nutrition and physical
      activity.

    <description>The Teacher Feedback Questionnaire was used to evaluate teacher perceptions, ideas, and events related to iGrow Readers. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions that asked teachers about the changes they may have noticed in their children and themselves, and if they modeled nutrition-based changes for their children after the program's implementation. In addition, teachers were asked to rate the children's responsiveness to the program, if they planned to spend more time on nutrition and PA education in the classroom, and what components of the program the teachers and children enjoyed the most.</description>

    <description>The Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire (HSFFQ) was used to assess dietary behaviors and was completed by teachers and guardians. Teachers provided responses about themselves and the guardians provided responses about themselves and on behalf of their child. The questionnaire lists 87 different food items for adults (86 for children) and ask the number of times the food was consumed during the past 4 weeks. Each food item has a response scale of 0 to 8 (0 = &quot;Never&quot;; 1 = &quot;1-3 times/month&quot;; 2 = &quot;1 time/week&quot;; 3 = &quot;2-4 times/week&quot;; 4 = &quot;5-6 times/week&quot;; 5 = &quot;1 time/day&quot;; 6 = &quot;2-3 times/day&quot;; 7 = &quot;4-5 times/day&quot;; and 8 = &quot;more than 6 times/day&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Caregiver physical activity practices</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver physical activity practices were assessed via the parent report version of the Activity Support Scale for Multiple Groups (ACTS-MG). The ACTS-MG measures parental support for children's physical activity and includes the following sub-scales: modeling, logistical support, and restricting access to screen-based activities. Each of the 20 items on the questionnaire has a response scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The overall score is a mean score across all questions and subscale scores are mean scores of the questions within the subscale. The higher the score, the greater the parental support for physical activity of the child.</description>

    <description>As part of the iGrow Readers curriculum, the primary teacher first reads a book as a group with a specific health behavior theme. Then, children participate in nutrition and physical activities that relate and reinforce the lessons learned in the book. Informational newsletters highlighting healthy behaviors from the stories' themes are provided to parents. All implementation strategies are reinforced by research to promote positive choices in young children's health behaviors through the use of literature and language strategies and modeling of others in the children's microsystems.</description>
