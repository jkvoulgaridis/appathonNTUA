  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of two home
      ergonomics programmes, by reference to a control group, on functional capacity and quality of
      life in post-stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For post-stroke patients, rehabilitation must address different aspects. When the resulting
      condition has become established, treatment should take the form of a mixed intervention
      model, incorporating preventive, rehabilitational and compensatory or adaptive approaches,
      aimed at enhancing the patient's performance within the environment. Physiotherapy and
      occupational therapy are key disciplines in the composition of multi- and inter-disciplinary
      teams for the care of stroke patients. In this clinical trial we evaluate the effectiveness
      of two programmes of ergonomic intervention in the home, with respect to levels of
      functionality (performance of activities of daily living) and the quality of life of
      post-stroke patients, by reference to a control group.

For each domain, with the exception of the first two questions, the quality of life was considered to be impaired when a score &lt;70 points was assigned.</description>

    <measure>Change from the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) scale at 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional capacity is measured using the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) scale, which consists of two parts. The Brazilian-language version of this scale allows each part to be used independently. Each item is scored according to a Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 2 points, where 0 indicates a total level of dependence for the performance of ADL, 1 point corresponds to partial independence, and 2 points represents a satisfactory level of independence. The scale consists of 15 items that evaluate activities such as using the telephone, transport, shopping, preparing and consuming food, cleaning and housework, administering medicines, financial affairs, dressing and undressing, personal hygiene and grooming, functional mobility, getting into and out of bed, bathing and mobility in the bathroom.</description>
