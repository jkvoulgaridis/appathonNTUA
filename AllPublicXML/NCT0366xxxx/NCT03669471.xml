  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) decreased hip
      muscle strength for adduction, extension, flexion, and external rotation including impaired
      functional performance have been observed. However, no studies are lacking on more demanding
      muscular and functional parameters such as hip muscle rate of force development and reactive
      strength index. Information on such muscular properties following hip arthroscopy for FAIS
      may help guide future planning of post-operative rehabilitation strategies.

      This is a cross-sectional study with an embedded prospective non-randomized study. The aim of
      the cross-sectional study is to investigate hip muscle function and functional performance in
      patients who have undergone hip arthroscopy for FAIS during the preceding 6-30 months.

      The aim of the prospective non-randomized study is to investigate the effect of a 12-week
      structured and supervised physiotherapy-led intervention aiming at improving hip muscular
      function on self-reported hip and groin function including hip muscle function and functional
      performance.

      Forty-five subjects from the Capital Region with an age of 18-40, who have undergone a hip
      arthroscopy for FAIS during the last 6-30 months, will be included in the cross-sectional
      study. Additionally, all included subjects will be offered to take part in the prospective
      non-randomized study consisting of 12 weeks of supervised and structured physiotherapy-led
      treatment.

      The below measures will be obtained at baseline, and at 12-weeks follow-up if subjects are
      included in the prospective study. All testing, and supervised physiotherapy-led treatment,
      will be performed at Hvidovre Hospital:

        1. Hip muscle function

        2. Single leg jump performance

        3. Self-reported hip and groin function

        4. Evaluation of return to sport

        5. Evaluation of satisfaction regarding usual-care post-operative rehabilitation
