  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection (AD) is a serious pathology affecting one person for 300 000 habitants per
      year. In case of complicated AD on the descending aorta, it is necessary to perform an
      endovascular surgery in association with medical treatment. An endoprosthesis is implanted on
      the descending thoracic aorta in order to close the main intimal tear. This closure lead to
      an increase in the thoracic true lumen diameter, a decrease in the thoracic false lumen
      diameter, a better perfusion of the aortic branches. Furthermore, even in case of open
      surgical treatment of the ascending aorta it can be necessary to perform an endovascular
      treatment on the descending aorta, either to prevent and treat aneurysmal evolution or to
      treat patent malperfusion syndrome.

      CT and Magnetic Resonance angiography, by the realization of an aortic morphologic
      evaluation, are the two key imaging exams in the DA. Nevertheless, CT can't provide aortic
      dynamic evaluation, contrary to MRI. This exam, thanks to the phase-contrast sequence can
      measure velocity and flow data in vessels, including aorta but also true and false lumen in
      the AD. Thus, by verifying the perfusion of the aortic true lumen and the aortic branches it
      is possible to perform an early evaluation of the endovascular treatment of the DA.

      Actually, only one study has realized an aortic dynamic evaluation on the AD, unfortunately
      this study was limited to non-operated patients.

      In order to assess the place of MRI in the AD, the ingestigation propose to determine if
      phase-contrast MRI is able to evaluate the impact of the endovascular treatment on the
      hemodynamic state of the aorta and its branches.
