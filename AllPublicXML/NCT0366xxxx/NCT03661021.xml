  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sante Fe is an investigation of a new technique to distinguish between different types of
      movement disorders, specifically organic versus functional, by observing changes in
      involuntary movements in two different situations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a short, one-time visit. Subjects will be asked to undergo a brief
      neurological examination while being video taped in two different scenarios. The severity of
      the abnormal movement will be analyzed and compared among subjects with functional (FMD)
      versus organic movement disorders (OrgMD).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Simplified Functional Movement Disorders Rating Scale (sFMDRS) score according to video raters between two conditions in FMD vs OrgMD patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Because this is a one-time visit study, outcome will be measured during the visit, data reported at study conclusion after successfully recruiting 40 subjects and completing analysis with projected finish date in 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Simplified Functional Movement Disorders Rating Scale (sFMDRS) score according to video raters between two conditions in FMD vs OrgMD patients. Score reports total abnormal movement score ranging from 0-3 for 9 different regions of the body or body functions. Higher score implies more severe movement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in the numerical change in self-perception of movement severity between two conditions in FMD vs OrgMD patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Because this is a one-time visit study, outcome will be measured during the visit, data reported at study conclusion after successfully recruiting 40 subjects and completing analysis with projected finish date in 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the numerical change in self-perception of movement severity, as measured by a Likert-style scale, between two conditions in FMD vs OrgMD patients. Self-perception is scored on a scale of 0-4, with a higher score indicating more severe abnormal movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between severity of depression or anxiety using PHQ-SADS scale and degree of change in severity of abnormal movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Because this is a one-time visit study, outcome will be measured during the visit, data reported at study conclusion after successfully recruiting 40 subjects and completing analysis with projected finish date in 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between severity of depression or anxiety using PHQ-SADS scale and degree of change in severity of abnormal movement. Scale includes three sets of questions relating to symptoms of anxiety and depression. Each symptom is scored on a range of 0-2 or 3 and summed. Higher score indicates higher levels of anxiety or depression symptoms.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between health care utilization using Health Care Utilization scale and degree of change in severity of abnormal movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Because this is a one-time visit study, outcome will be measured during the visit, data reported at study conclusion after successfully recruiting 40 subjects and completing analysis with projected finish date in 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between health care utilization using Health Care Utilization scale and degree of change in severity of abnormal movement. Scale asks about number of health care related experiences in the past 6 months.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between illness belief/diagnosis agreement using B-IPQ and Agreement with Diagnosis scales and degree of change in severity of abnormal movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Because this is a one-time visit study, outcome will be measured during the visit, data reported at study conclusion after successfully recruiting 40 subjects and completing analysis with projected finish date in 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between illness belief/diagnosis agreement using B-IPQ and Agreement with Diagnosis scales and degree of change in severity of abnormal movement. B-IPQ asks subjects to answer questions about the impact of their illness on their lives on a scale of 0-10, where higher implies greater impact. Agreement with Diagnosis scale asks FMD subjects to rate the confidence in their diagnosis on a scale of 0-10, with 10 implying full confidence.</description>
