  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The circadian regulation in mammals have been known for a long time. A special group of clock
      genes, organized in feedback loops, are responsible for the circadian regulation in both the
      SCN and peripheral organs. The central clock is mainly entrained by the light-dark cycle,
      while the peripheral ones in organs such as liver and intestine, are more influenced by the
      feeding-fasting cycles. The coordination of central and peripheral clocks is thought to be
      essential in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis.This study aim to investigate the
      association between biological rhythm and metabolism.
