  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest epithelial malignancies, has a 5-year survival rate
      of only about 8%. The mortality rate has decreased slightly, but the incidence rate has been
      steadily increasing, and it is predicted to be the second leading cause of cancer mortality
      in 2030. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the development of innovative therapies are
      needed, and various basic and clinical studies based on pancreatic cancer biology are
      underway. Recently, studies on the effect of natural killer (NK) cells on cancer progression
      and the development of therapeutic agents using them have been actively conducted. NK cells
      are a component of innate lymphoid cells, accounting for approximately 5-15% of total
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

      Investigators will apply a new method to evaluate the activity of NK cells in pancreatic
      cancer patients, and to analyze the correlation with the progression of the tumor and the
      prognosis of the patient. And investigators will analyze the multifactorial factors affecting
      the activity of NK cells and conducted this study to help establish new diagnostic and
      therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.
