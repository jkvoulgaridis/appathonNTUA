  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic antireflux surgery for
      treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) comparing with that of non-surgical
      treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To treat GERD, the most patients with GERD are managed with acid suppressive medication
      first, and followed by antireflux surgery when the medical therapy is not effective or when
      the patient prefer surgery to quit the medicine.

      This study has a single cohort in which the patient has the past history of GERD and medical
      treatment with proton pump inhibitors, and has scheduled to have laparoscopic antireflux
      surgery for treatment of GERD.

      Treatment outcome of surgery will be evaluated comparing with the outcome of medical
      treatment before registration.
