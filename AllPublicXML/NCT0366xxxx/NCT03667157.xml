  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is a characterized by orbital soft tissue inflammation and oedema
      associated with glycosaminoglycan deposition and fibrosis. The most frequent cause is Graves'
      disease. The classification is comprised based on the severity of orbital changes ranging
      from mild, moderate-to-severe GO and sight-threatening GO, which includes dysthyroid optic
      neuropathy (DON). Intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy is the first-line
      treatment in the active-phase of moderate-to-severe GO and DON. This therapy is more
      effective and better tolerated than oral glucocorticoids (GCs). The current recommendation of
      the European Group of Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) is that cumulative doses of IVMP should
      not exceed 8.0g in each treatment course, and pulses should not be given on consecutive or
      alternate days, except in the case of DON. According to EUGOGO recommendations patients with
      moderate-to-severe GO are treated with IVMP cumulative dose 4.5g during a 12-week period (for
      the first 6 weeks 0.5g IVMP per week, for the next 6 weeks 0.25g IVMP per week). According to
      EUGOGO recommendations patients with DON should receive 3.0g IVMP (1.0g/day for 3 consecutive
      days) as the basic treatment. This limitation in doses are due to the necessity of the
      prevention of severe side effects that are rare but may be fatal. One of the most severe
      adverse events is acute liver injury (ALI), in some cases irreversible and/or fatal. The
      estimated morbidity and mortality of ALI was found to be 1-4 % and 0.01-0.3%, respectively.
      Since 2000, there were 5 reported fatal cases.

      Mechanisms causing an IVMP-induced ALI remains incompletely elucidated. There are some
      possible hypotheses that may explain the occurrence of ALI. Firstly, GCs can lead to
      reactivation of autoimmune hepatitis: an immune &quot;rebound phenomenon&quot; following GCs
      withdrawal. The second mechanism of ALI is reactivation of viral hepatitis. Finally, there is
      well known direct toxic effect of GCs on hepatocytes, probably dose-dependent.

      This study was performed to evaluate the influence of two different, routinely used schemes
      of therapy with IVMP in patients with moderate-to-severe GO (first scheme) and DON (second
      scheme) on biochemical liver parameters. Patients included into the study were treated
      according to EUGOGO recommendations with routine doses of IVMP and routine scheme of
      administration for moderate-to-severe GO and DON. No additional treatment was performed
      during the study protocol.

      Depending on the severity according to EUGOGO recommendations, patients were divided into two
      groups: the first group with active, moderate-to-severe GO (49 patients) and the second group
      with DON (19 patients). Moderate-to-severe GO was diagnosed according to EUGOGO
      recommendations. Diagnosis of DON in patients with GO was based on at least two signs,
      including (i) deterioration of VA (&lt; 1.0), (ii) loss of colour vision (more than two errors
      in Ishihara plates), (iii) optic disc swelling, and/or (iv) signs of DON in a magnetic
      resonance (MR) scan (presence of apical crowding and/or optic nerve stretching).

      Laboratory tests were performed before treatment in all patients from both evaluated groups.
      Serum markers of exposure to hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) were checked: hepatitis
      B surface antigen (HBs-Ag), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs-Ab), hepatitis B core antibody
      (HBc-Ab), hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab). Serum autoantibodies associated with autoimmune
      hepatitis including anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA1), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA),
      anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and anti-liver kidney-microsomal antibodies (anti-LKM)
      were also assessed. Thyroid evaluation included measurement of: thyroid-stimulating hormone
      (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and serum antithyroid
      autoantibodies including anti-thyroid peroxidase (aTPO), thyroglobulin antibodies (aTG),
      thyroid-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII).

      According to EUGOGO recommendations: patients with moderate-to-severe GO were treated with
      IVMP cumulative dose 4.5g during a 12-week period (for the first 6 weeks 0.5g IVMP per week
      was administrated and for the next 6 weeks 0.25g IVMP per week) and patients with DON
      received 3.0g IVMP (1.0g/day for 3 consecutive days).

      Liver function parameters for further analysis included alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin. These parameters were measured the day
      before treatment in both groups and the day after administration of IVMP in selected pulses:
      after 0.5g (1st pulse), after 3.0g (6th pulse) and after 4.5g (12th pulse ) in the group with
      moderate-to-severe GO; after 3.0g IVMP in the group with DON.

      Depending on concentrations of ALT, liver dysfunction was divided into: mild (above the upper
      limit of normal but less than 100 U/L), moderate (100-300 U/L) and severe (&gt;300 U/L). ALI was
      defined as an ALT concentration &gt;300 U/L. However, the investigators also evaluated a 4-fold
      increase of ALT in comparison to the initial values.

      Routine laboratory tests and clinical evaluation were performed before every single pulse.
      Laboratory tests consisted of: ALT, AST, C reactive protein (CRP). In cases of moderate and
      severe increase in ALT (more than 100U/L) therapy was stopped.

      Follow-up was performed in all of the patients and it included evaluation of AST, ALT and
      total bilirubin between 1-3 months after completion of IVMP therapy.
