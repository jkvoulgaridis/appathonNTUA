      A phase III confirmatory trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of remimazolam (CNS7056)
      compared to propofol for intravenous anesthesia during elective surgery in ASA Class III/IV
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III single-blind, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority multi-center trial
      in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class III/IV patients undergoing elective
      surgery, comparing remimazolam to propofol for induction and maintenance of intravenous
      anesthesia. In accordance with general anesthetic standard regimen, remimazolam or propofol,
      will be administered together with remifentanil as analgesic agent, and with a neuromuscular
      blocker to facilitate intubation and achieve muscle relaxation

             surgical procedure of a minimum duration of approximately 90 minutes under general
             anesthesia (GA) and planned to be extubated immediately post-operatively.

          -  Total intravenous GA with the requirement for mechanical ventilation via endotracheal
             tube and necessary invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring either due to severity of
             illness, severity of concomitant diseases, type of surgery or decisions of the
             anesthesia staff.

          -  Patients scheduled to stay in the hospital long enough after the surgical procedure to
             perform all trial follow-up procedures (~1 day)

          -  For female patients of childbearing potential: Negative result of a pregnancy test
             taken shortly before the start of the administration of the IMP as well as consent to
             use highly effective birth control from the last menstrual cycle prior to the start of
             the IMP until the end of the trial follow-up procedures. Highly effective methods of
             birth control include:

               -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal and transdermal

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
                  oral, injectable and implantable

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

               -  Vasectomised partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the
                  female patient of childbearing potential and that the vasectomised partner has
                  received medical assessment of the surgical success)

               -  Sexual abstinence (this method is not acceptable in Switzerland)

        Women who had their last menstruation at least two years ago or who underwent surgical
        interventions (surgical birth control, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, etc.) are
        regarded as having no childbearing potential

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients scheduled for spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia (central neuraxial
             anesthesia) or regional anesthesia. The placement of a peridural catheter with a test
             dose application of a local anesthetic drug (up to 5 mL) to verify correct positioning
             to achieve post-operative analgesia and the regional administration of local
             anesthetic for post-operative analgesia after wound closure is accepted.

          -  Patients undergoing transplant surgery, cardiac surgery, or intracranial neurosurgery,
             patients which have to be in prone position for surgery, emergency surgery, or any
             surgical procedure with the need for or scheduled for post-operative ventilator
             support.

          -  Patients undergoing surgical procedures that require keeping the BP at a high level,
             e.g. surgical procedures in beach chair position

          -  Patients with severe hypertension, i.e., one baseline result of systolic BP 200 mmHg
             or more and / or diastolic BP of 120 mmHg or more. Baseline is defined as the time
             after signature of the informed consent form (ICF) and before arrival in the operating
             room (OR) suite.

          -  Patients with total bilirubin of ≥3.0 mg/dL or ≥3 times increase in aspartate
             aminotransferase (ASAT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) than the institutional
             reference range in laboratory tests, or any other laboratory results that make the
             patient unsuitable for the trial. All laboratory tests relevant for subject's
             enrolment must be performed within 7 days prior to start of IMP*

             * If the screening samples for the central laboratory were taken earlier than within
             the last 7 days prior to start of IMP, the lab parameters relevant for subject's
             enrolment are to be determined in a local laboratory within 7 days prior to start of
             IMP. If results from samples taken within 7 days prior to the start of the IMP/the
             surgery from a local laboratory are available, these can be used. If no results from
             the last 7 days prior to the start of the IMP/the surgery are available, samples need
             to be taken for the purpose of this trial and to be analysed in a local laboratory.

             condition such that these agents are contraindicated (according to local label)

          -  Presence of acute alcoholic or illicit drug intoxication, shock or coma state

          -  Known current dependency from central nervous system depressant drugs or alcohol

             increased risk for gastric aspiration

          -  Patients with an anticipated (small mouth opening, impaired neck movement, goitre,
             head and neck tumours or any other anatomical reason) or known airway difficulties or
             with known difficulties in airway maintenance or mask ventilation

          -  Patients in whom Narcotrend (NCT) may not provide reliable results due to organic
             defect of the brain or forehead, or any neurologic disease interfering with the EEG
             monitoring

          -  Patients on treatment with valproate

          -  Any pregnant or breast-feeding patient

          -  Patients who participated in any clinical trial within 30 days or 5 times the
             half-life of the drug under investigation, whichever is longer, prior to the beginning
             of administration of the IMP. Exception: Non-interventional trials as defined in the
             European Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC: A trial where the medicinal product(s)
             is (are) prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing
             authorisation. The assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is
             not decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the
             prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the
             patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures shall be
             applied to the patients and epidemiological methods should be used for the analysis of
             the collected data.

          -  Any patient judged to lack the ability to give informed consent or perform the trial
             assessments (e.g., due to dementia)

          -  Any patient judged by the Principal Investigator (PI) or Sub-Investigator to be
             inappropriate for the subject for any other reason
