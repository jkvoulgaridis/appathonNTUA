  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market clinical follow-up study is to evaluate the clinical
      outcomes of patients receiving PhotoFix as a patch within a vascular repair or reconstruction
      procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PhotoFix is prepared from bovine pericardium, which is stabilized using a dye-mediated
      photo-oxidation process and sterilized using aseptic processing techniques. The primary
      endpoint for patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) undergoing carotid endarterectomies
      (CEA) will be rate of ipsilateral central neurologic events; the primary endpoint for all
      other vascular procedures will be primary patency. The secondary endpoints include all-cause
      reoperation rate, device-related reoperation rate, explant rate, restenosis rate, secondary
      patency (hemodialysis access repair (HAR) only) and survival. A goal of 100 patients will be
      enrolled at approximately 10 sites. The enrollment period will span a minimum of 8 months
      from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and site activation. Candidates for this study
      are adults who require vascular repair or reconstruction surgery that necessitates the use of
      a patch. Patients will be consented pre-operatively and enrolled patients will be followed
      for approximately 6 months after PhotoFix surgery. Data will be collected at 5 time points:
      baseline (pre-operatively), intra-operatively, 1 month post-operatively, 3 months
      post-operatively, and 6 months post-operatively.

    <description>For all other procedures (non-CEAs): Time from PhotoFix implantation to the time when patency in the vessel is documented as lost. Loss of patency includes loss of previously palpable pulses, presentation of recurrent symptoms, a drop in ABI&gt;0.15 in the case of lower limb artery repair, Doppler ultrasound findings of occlusion, angiography of the affected vessel or a combination of these. Loss of patency will also be considered if an intervention to restore or maintain patency is documented.</description>

    <description>All patients will undergo a vascular repair or reconstruction surgery, which requires the use of PhotoFix. The surgical procedures will vary by patient and by underlying etiology. Therefore, PhotoFix implant sites will also vary. In all cases, PhotoFix will be implanted per the Instructions for Use (IFU).</description>
