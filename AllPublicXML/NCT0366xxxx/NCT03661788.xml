    <textblock>
      Attention deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder which manifests in childhood
      but often persists through adulthood. The most prominent symptoms in adults are inattention,
      emotional instability, disorganized behavior, impulsivity and restlessness, which cause
      several restrictions in different areas of life. It is suggested that those symptoms can be
      attributed to a general deficit in inhibitory control. This hypothesis is supported by
      several studies revealing that patients with ADHD show poor performance completing inhibitory
      control tasks.

      Furthermore, studies showed that a unique administration of atomoxetin (ATX) significantly
      improves inhibitory control in patients with ADHD as well as in healthy participtants. In
      contrast to other medication authorized for the treatment of patients with ADHD, does ATX has
      no risk for potential addiction. Due its indirect mode of action, ATX has a delayed effect
      occurence taking up to 2 weeks. However, this apects was unconsidered in those studies.

      Although we directly often associate failures in cognitive control with disruptions at
      prefrontal areas of the brain, there exists a specific brain network which is called the
      default mode network (DMN), which is suggested to be at least partly responsibe for the ADHD
      symptomatic.

      The following study is interested in which way a 2- week intake of ATX affects the DMN and
      surrounding networks in their connectivity during a inhibitory control task and during rest
      in patients with ADHD vs controls.
