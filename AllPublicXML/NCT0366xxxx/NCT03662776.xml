  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out about the quality of life and health in patients who
      had retinoblastoma in one eye (unilateral retinoblastoma), who either received treatment with
      chemotherapy injected directly into an artery leading to the eye (intra-arterial
      chemotherapy) or removal of the eye (enucleation). By quality of life, the investigators mean
      how the participants are feeling about being satisfied with things in their life, including,
      physical health, emotional health, and their ability to carry out daily activities. The
      investigators want to see if either treatment option would affect quality of life
      differently. The investigators hope that this information will help us provide better care to
      future children with retinoblastoma and better follow-up care for survivors of
      retinoblastoma.

    <description>as measured by Behavior Assessment System for Children, 3rd edition, (BASC™-3;as measured by the BASC-3) Surveys have been normed on a representative sample that closely matches United States census population characteristics; T scores and percentiles in relation to general norms are calculated for each scale. The BASC-3 uses a T score metric where 50 is the mean for the population norm and the standard deviation is 10.</description>

    <description>as measured by Behavior Assessment System for Children, 3rd edition, (BASC™-3; The following four T Scores will be analyzed for these BASC-3 summary scores (1) Externalizing Problems, (2) Internalizing Problems, (3) Behavior Symptoms Index and (4) Adaptive Skills. The &quot;at-risk&quot; category applies to any individual who scores 2 SD above the mean of 50, while &quot;clinically significant&quot; risk refers to those who score 3 SD above the mean. Additional scores are also provided which may be used to identify risk for more specific behavioral or emotional areas of concern.</description>

    <description>as measured by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) PROMIS measures use a T-score metric where 50 is the mean for the reference population and 10 is the standard deviation of that population. Higher scores correspond to a higher degree of symptom burden (for those items measuring symptoms) or a higher level of functioning (for physical functioning items)</description>
