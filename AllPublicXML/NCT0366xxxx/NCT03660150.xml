  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Massive burns are serious life-threatening conditions. Recent advances in their management
      now allow the survival of a growing number of patients. The burn care paradigm is
      transformed: the evaluation of survival at the end of acute care is no longer sufficient for
      a good evaluation of practices; the attention now focuses on long-term health-related quality
      of life (HR-QOL).The recently validated French translation of the burn specific health scale
      brief version makes this evaluation now feasible in French burn centers. The objectives of
      this study are to evaluate the HR-QOL of massive burn survivors, to compare it to another
      chronic condition (necrotizing fasciitis) and to determine the main predictive factor of
      health-related quality of life. This study is retrospectively conducted in 18 patients who
      survived a massive burn injury involving more than 80% of the total body surface area, or
      more than 70% of the total body surface area if the injury occured during childhood and who
      were treated between 1997 and 2017 in our Lyon burn center. Short Form-36 Medical Outcomes
      Survey (SF-36), and Brief Version of Burn Speciﬁc Health Scale (BSHS-B) are used for the
      present evaluation.

      The hypotheses are as follows:

        -  the HR-QOL of massive burns shows a significative alteration compared to general
           population

        -  this alteration is comparable with another chronic disease

        -  the main predictors of impaired quality of life related to physical health status are
           hand injury, age at time of burn and time since burn

        -  the main predictive factors of change in quality of life related to mental health status
           are age of onset and facial involvement.
