  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal growth restriction during pregnancy represents one of the biggest risk factors for
      stillbirth (Gardosi et al, 2013), with 'about one in three term, normally formed antepartum
      stillbirths are related to abnormalities of fetal growth' (MBRRACE, 2015).

      Therefore, antenatal detection of growth restricted babies is vital in order to be able to
      monitor and decide the appropriate delivery timing.

      However, antenatal detection of SGA babies has been poor, varying greatly across trusts in
      England in those that calculate their rates (NHS England, 2016). Most trusts do not calculate
      their detection rates and rates are therefore unknown. It is estimated that routine NHS care
      detects only 1 in 4 growth restricted babies (Smith, 2015).

      Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, in partnership with the Oxford Academic
      Health Science Network (AHSN) has introduced a clinical care pathway (the Oxford Growth
      Restriction Pathway (OxGRIP)) designed to increase the rates of detection of these at risk
      babies. The pathway is intended to increase the identification of babies who are at risk of
      stillbirth, in order to try to prevent this outcome, whilst making best usage of resources,
      and restricting inequitable practice and unnecessary obstetric intervention.

      It has been developed with reference to a body of research, however, the individual parts of
      care provided have not been put together in a pathway in this manner before. Therefore it is
      important to examine whether the pathway meets its goals of improving outcomes for babies in
      a 'real world' setting.

      The principles of the pathway are

        1. A universal routine scan at 36 weeks gestation.

        2. Additional growth scans at 28 and 32 weeks gestation based on a simplified assessment of
           risk factors and universal uterine artery Doppler at 20 weeks gestation.

        3. Assessment of further parameters other than estimated fetal weight associated with
           adverse perinatal outcome (eg growth velocity, umbilical artery Doppler and CPR).

      The clinical data routinely collected as a result of the introduction of the pathway offers a
      valuable and unique resource in identifying and analysing in the effects of the pathway on
      its intended outcomes and also in investigating and analysing other maternal, fetal and
      neonatal complications and outcomes, establishing normal / reference ranges for ultrasound
      values.
