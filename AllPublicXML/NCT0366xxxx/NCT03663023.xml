  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the prevalence of previous abdominal surgery in a cohort of patients
      operated for bowel obstruction and analyzes the causes of obstruction discovered at surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions are a common cause of small bowel obstruction. The
      extent of adhesions has been assigned to the magnitude of previous surgery. In a county
      hospital, with a catchment population of 120 000 inhabitants, records of operations performed
      for bowel obstruction over a period of 70 months were retrieved. Codes for bowel obstruction
      according to an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) will include: Intestinal
      adhesion with obstruction, Other and unspecified intestinal obstruction, Intestinal
      obstruction and Peritoneal adhesions. Amount of adhesions will be calculated in relation to
      previous surgery.

        According to the protocol, 213 surgical procedures were identified. 17 procedures were
        excluded due to no bowel obstruction at surgery. Intestinal obstruction was evident in 196
        procedures. These procedures were included in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects operated for bowel obstruction from January 1st 2006 to October 31st 2011.
        Surgical codes for bowel obstruction included: Intestinal adhesion with obstruction, Other
        and unspecified intestinal obstruction, Intestinal obstruction, unspecified and Peritoneal
        adhesions. Surgical procedures were identified for bowel obstruction, including; Division
        of band adhesion, Adhesiolysis, Other separation of adhesion during bowel obstruction,
        Laparotomy and reposition or detorsion of intestine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Extra-peritoneal surgery such as inguinal or ventral hernia repair was excluded.
