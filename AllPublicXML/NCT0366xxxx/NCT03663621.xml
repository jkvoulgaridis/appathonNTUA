  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital are
      conducting a study to learn more about how best to reach out to women (age 18-45) who are
      thinking about a pregnancy in the next couple of years and currently have a BMI greater than
      30 kg/m2.

      Interested participants will be asked to complete a 15-minute survey. The survey will ask
      some more questions about their prior reproductive health history, opinions and experiences
      regarding lifestyle, weight and health. After completing the survey, researchers would like
      to arrange a time to complete a 20- to 30-minute semi-structured interview about their
      perceived health in the process of planning pregnancy.

      The purpose of this study is to learn the best ways to support healthful behaviors and weight
      loss prior to pregnancy. Researchers are also interested in what motivates or prevents women
      of reproductive age from engaging in a structured weight loss program. Participants will be
      asked for no more than an hour of their time to complete a brief survey and participate in an
      interview. This study is being conducted by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. This study
      is being paid for by the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at Harvard (NORCH).

      At the end of the interview, study staff will also talk to participants about the opportunity
      to be referred to the Mass General Weight Center if they are interested in participating in a
      program now being offered there.

      If participants elect to participate in a program at the weight center, researchers would
      then like to complete 2 more short interviews with these participants about that process. The
      first will be about 5 minutes and will take place just after the initial Weight Center
      Orientation, and the last will be about 10 minutes and take place after 3 months of
      participation. During this final interview, researchers will ask for participant opinions
      about the program that they have just participated in.
