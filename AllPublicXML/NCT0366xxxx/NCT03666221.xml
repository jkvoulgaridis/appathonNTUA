  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assessed the clinical efficacy, and safety of the combination of Nimotuzumab
      administered concomitantly with intensity modulated radiation therapy(IMRT) in patients with
      recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of Nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy has been shown in advanced
      nasopharyngeal cancer, which was significantly higher than radiotherapy alone. The efficacy
      of radiotherapy combined with Nimotuzumab has not been confirmed in recurrent nasopharyngeal
      cancer.In this study, Phase II clinical trials were performed. The patients were treated with
      Nimotuzumab which were used concurrently with IMRT. The efficacy and toxicity will be
      assessed.
