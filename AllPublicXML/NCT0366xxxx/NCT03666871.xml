      A Comparative Study of Autologous CD4+ T Cells Genetically Modified at the CCR5 Gene by Zinc
      Finger Nucleases SB-728 versus ex vivo Expanded Unmodified Autologous CD4+ T Cells in Treated
      HIV-1 Infected Subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of infusing expanded autologous CD4+
      T cells with or without ex vivo modification of the CCR5 gene by zinc finger nucleases among
      HIV-infected patients with plasma HIV RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks and CD4+
      T cell counts greater than 350 cells/µL. The main hypothesis is that the infusion of modified
      CD4+ T cells will lead to a reduction in the size of the replication-competent HIV reservoir,
      as measured by the quantitative virus outgrowth assay (QVOA) that is greater than that
      resulting from infusion of unmodified CD4+ T cells. A total of 30 participants will be
      randomized to receive one infusion of 0.5 - 4 x 1010 ex vivo expanded autologous CD4+ T cells
      that have been either modified by transduction with a zinc finger nuclease designed to cleave
      CCR5 (arm 1, n=20) or unmodified (arm 2, n=10). All participants will be pre-treated with
      cyclophosphamide at a dose of 1 g/m2 before infusion. The primary outcome measure will be the
      change in the number of infectious units per million (IUPM) CD4+ T cells from study
      enrollment to 24 months after infusion of expanded CD4+ T cells.

             affecting the area, or foreign material.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to local anesthetic agents.
