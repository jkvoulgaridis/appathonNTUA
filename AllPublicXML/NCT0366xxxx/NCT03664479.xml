  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study to prepare clinical trials to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of 4-channel electric stimulation therapy devices as a newly developed function
      for the treatment of dysphagia disorders.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in effect by the electric
      stimulation method and to obtain the values such as mean, standard deviation and so on, and
      to determine the number of subjects to be studied for clinical trials of validation
      permission in the future.

      -  Design: Prospective study

        -  Inclusion criteria of patient group: who has a dysphagia symptom and confirmed by
           video-fluoroscopic swallowing study(N=9)

        -  Intervention: Participants are divided into two group and applied electrical stimulation
           by a &quot;Synchronized Electrical Stimulation Device(SESD)&quot; in different protocol

        -  Main outcome measures: high-resolution manometry(HRM) parameters, videofluoroscopic
           parameters, EQ-5D (EuroQoL-5D) questionnaire

    <description>apply 4 channel electrical stimulation device with protocol 1.
It will simultaneously stimulate suprahyoid, thyrohyoid and sternothyroid m with 4 channel electrical stimulation device.
during apply the device, we evaluate the manometry and videofluoroscopic swallowing study for evaluation of deglutition function.</description>

    <description>apply 4 channel electrical stimulation device with protocol 2
Is a revised sequential activation protocol, it sequentially stimulate bilateral suprahyoid m (channel 1), pharyngeal constrictors (ch 2), thyrohyoid m (ch 3), sternothyroid m (ch 4) with 4 channel electrical stimulation device.
during apply the synchronized electrical stimulation device, we will evaluate the parameters same as group 1.</description>
