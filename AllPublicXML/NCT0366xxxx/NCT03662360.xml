      Behavioral and psycological symptoms of dementia, (BPSD) are one of the major problem for
      families, doctors and for patients the same. To reduce the side effects of the standard
      treatments, is important to find an alternative methods of treatment, eg the aromatherapy.
      There is an incresing in scientific evidence the its use in dementia behavior related.

    <textblock>
      Behavioral and psycological symptoms of dementia, (BPSD) are one of the major problem for
      families, doctors and for patients the same.

      In absence of the universally recognized guidelines, the standard treatment involves the use
      of psychotropic drugs (typical / atypical neuroleptics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines)
      that are often not very effective and involve a series of side effects such as sedation,
      slowing down -motor with impaired cognitive performance, cardiac electrical changes and
      extrapyramidal syndrome. In view of this, it is important to find an alternative methods of
      treatment, which can reduce psychological and behavioral disorders and at the same time the
      use of psychotropic drugs.

      As for aromatherapy, ie the therapeutic use of natural essential oils, there is a
      decades-long clinical experience, especially in France, which is accompanied by increasing
      scientific evidence with considerable increase in publications in its use in psychological
      disorders and dementia behavior related. Based on the scientific publications available, it
      was therefore decided to use two essential oils (Citrus sinensis, Lavandula angustifolia) in
      environmental diffusion in the Geriatric Department of the Clinica Luganese Moncucco.

    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH) test will characterize the neuropsychiatric and psychopathological symptoms of patients affected by dementia.
Events as delirium, anxiety, depression, etc. will be recorded by the frequency with which they occur and the seriousness of the same. The total score of the NPI-NH is given by the frequency with which the event appears multiply the seriousness of the same. The total score has a range from 0 to 12. Four subgroups will be identified, the final total score of each group will be given by the sum of the single patients total score of the patients belonging to each subgroup:
Time 1 cases sum
Time 1 controls sum
Time 4 cases sum
Time 4 controls sum
