  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this project are to test if: i) Specific probiotic lactobacilli (added to
      stabilized ongoing treatment) are efficacious in treating depressive symptoms in individuals
      with low-grade inflammation, defined using high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and
      BMI. ii) This effect is mediated through decrease of inflammation, estimated by
      treatment-associated changes in blood and faeces biomarkers. Secondary aims are to
      investigate the relationship between specific depressive symptoms and inflammation and if
      there is a correlation between certain pro-inflammatory or metabolic markers and depression.

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention will be add-on specific probiotic to ongoing treatment with antidepressant medication or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Subjects will be randomized to placebo or probiotic. To assure a balanced subject recruitment, block randomization within strata (ongoing treatment with CBT, antidepressant or both) will be performed. Blood sampling and symptom rating scales will be completed at baseline, at weeks 4 and 8 (end of study). Feces will be collected at baseline and end of study. Biomarkers (from baseline, week 4 and week 8) will be analyzed after the study. Subjects will be recruited from outpatient or inpatient settings, Psychiatry Skåne or primary care clinics in Skåne, Sweden. Subjects will be recruited via clinical referrals, but also via ads.</intervention_model_description>
