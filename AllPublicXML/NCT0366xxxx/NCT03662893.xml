      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of this newly-established checklist
      for overactive bladder (OAB) and whether determinate to adherence and persistence rate of
      combination of behavioural therapy and anticholinergic medications in patients with OAB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) can worsen quality of life but it is not life-threatening condition.
      Although OAB medications effectively decrease disturbing symptoms of OAB, there are a lot of
      adverse side effects such as dry mouth, cognitive changes, constipation, urinary retention,
      blurred vision and dyspepsia. Therefore, guidelines have firstly recommended behavioural
      therapy which are noninvasive and not linked with adverse side effects. These behavioural
      recommendations include an advice on fluid balance, bladder retraining, urgency suppression
      or normal voiding techniques, pelvic floor muscle training, caffeine reduction, dietary
      changes, weight loss and other life style changes to improve lower urinary tract symptoms of
      OAB.

      Educational leaflets, verbal or audio-visual instructions and trainings for behavioural
      therapy have been recommended for patients with OAB, however, to date these beneficial
      instructions have not been documented as a written checklist. Therefore, they were collected
      and developed as a written checklist to instruct the patients. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficiency of this newly-established checklist for OAB and whether
      determinate to adherence and persistence rate of combination of behavioural therapy and
      anticholinergic medications in patients with OAB.
