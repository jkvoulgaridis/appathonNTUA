  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will entail an evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy and
      effectiveness of SCOPE coach supported internet-delivered psychoeducative program using a
      randomized controlled design in a clinical health care context.

      An estimated N=175 will be needed to enable block randomisation according a 2:1:1 ratio to:
      1) SCOPE internet-based psychoeducation intervention, 2) Self-study controls, who receive
      eight weekly emails containing informative and relevant websites about Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD), 3) Wait-list controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The internet-delivered intervention SCOPE was developed using a participatory research
      approach, i.e. in cooperation with the target group. SCOPE has eight ASD theme modules and
      weekly contact with an experienced clinician (coach) via a message function within the
      Swedish national platform for internet-delivered treatment (1177.se e-services).

      The three treatment arms means that the self-study controls as well as the wait-lsit controls
      will have the option to take part of SCOPE the following semester after having completed the
      data collection process. The assessment of eligibility is conducted on the national platform
      for internet-delivered interventions using a web camera application or phone interview. The
      assessment covers depression symptoms and suicidality using MADRS-R, functional impairment
      using WHODAS 2.0 (WHO), autism core symptoms using OSU Autism and Social Responsiveness
      Scale.

      Treatment expectancy and satisfaction will be measured using the Treatment Credibility Scale
      (see outcome measures) and an evaluation of each module.The criteria for feasibility were (1)
      attrition should be less than 40% and (2) the participants should attend at least 75% of the
      sessions. Efficacy-related measures will be gained through the primary outcome of gained
      knowledge about ASD. Secondary outcomes are mental health: anxiety and depression, and also
      acceptance of diagnosis as well as quality of life. In addition, measures of treatment
      credibility are also completed by the coaches. The measures will be analysed using a series
      of mixed design repeated measures ANOVAs (rmANOVAs).

      The recommended first-line intervention for ASD is psychoeducation. Psychoeducational
      interventions for young adult individuals with ASD however have a very limited evidence base.
      Therefore, the effect of psychoeducation for the target group is difficult to discern, the
      current study would contribute significantly to the research field. The findings will be
      important especially as psychoeducation is a clinically common intervention, provided in a
      non-standardized way and without sufficient information of its effects.

      Recruitment commenced during the autumn of 2016 and will carry on through until 2020 or until
      sufficient participant numbers have been met.

    <description>16 questions about general knowledge about ASD. The questions are based on the eight modules in the interventions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at three month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Has 14 items scored 0 (&quot;Often&quot; ) - 3 (&quot;Seldom&quot;), subsequently summarized for an overall score; high scores indicate higher levels of depression or anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at three month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptance of the diagnosis was estimated, using a modified version of the AAQ-II. The current version focuses on acceptance of having an ASD diagnosis, using a seven-item scale ranging from 1 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 7 (&quot;Always&quot;), and was then summarized for an overall score; high scores indicate low acceptance of the diagnosis. The item wording after adjustment to the current study were: (1) &quot;My diagnosis makes it difficult for me to lead a life I could value&quot;; (2) &quot;I am afraid of my diagnosis&quot;; (3) &quot;I worry about not being able to control my worries and my feelings regarding my diagnosis&quot;; (4) &quot;My diagnosis prevents me from leading a fulfilling life&quot;; (5) &quot;My diagnosis creates problems in my life&quot;; (6) &quot;I feel uncomfortable with my diagnosis&quot;; (7) &quot;My diagnosis gets in the way of my success&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Inventory (BBQ)</measure>

    <description>A measure estimating quality of life using 12 items: using a scale ranging from 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;), subsequently summarized for an overall score; high scores indicate high satisfaction with life.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Treatment Credibility Scale (TCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at three month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>As a measure of feasibility TCS is used to measure the expectation of improvement and treatment credibility. The TCS is a visual analogue scale rated from &quot;Low credibility&quot;/ &quot;Not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;High credibility&quot;/&quot;Very much&quot; (10) and the score calculated is a mean of all items. The TCS was administered after providing thorough information and presentation of the treatment content at baseline and after completion of the treatment. The item wording after adjustment to the current study were: (1) How logical does SCOPE seem to you?; (2) How confident are you that you will learn more about autism from SCOPE?; (3) Would you recommend SCOPE to a friend with ASD?; (4) How successful do you feel this type of program would be in teaching about other diagnoses?; (5) How much do you think you will have learned after completing the program?</description>
