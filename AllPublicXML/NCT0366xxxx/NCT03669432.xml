      This trial deals with cancers of the thyroid gland which are advanced at the local site of
      thyroid. These cancers are treated with surgery and complete removal of the thyroid gland.
      But due to advanced nature, there is risk of re-occurrence. Radiotherapy can be used to
      prevent this re-occurrence. This study attempt to see the effect of radiotherapy in
      preventing re-occurrence and its side effects in advanced thyroid cancer.

    <textblock>
      Surgery, when possible offers the best chance of cure for cancer of the thyroid gland.
      Surgery for thyroid cancer involves removal of the thyroid gland along with removal of the
      lymph nodes which drain the gland. After surgery most patients will receive radio-iodine
      treatment to diagnose and treat any spread of the cancer in the body. Most thyroid cancers
      will have good outcomes with the above mentioned treatment. However, in advanced thyroid
      cancer there is a higher chance of recurrence even with surgery and radio iodine. Surgery for
      recurrence of these cancers is very morbid This may entail surgeries which may also involve
      removing portions of the voice box and food pipe. You may therefore develop and discomfort or
      inability to eat or speak.

      Radiation therapy can be given to the neck along with radio-iodine therapy to decrease these
      re occurrences of the cancer. A number of studies have shown a benefit with the use of
      radiation therapy in advanced cases of thyroid cancer. However, the side effects of
      radiation, if any, have not been well documented. This study is being done to assess the
      impact of radiation on the outcome of cancer and the exact side effects of radiation therapy.
      If the side effects are not too many, then radiation therapy can be used to decrease the
      chances of recurrence in the neck after thyroid.

      In this study, patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer will be assessed
      for high risk features on the histopathology report and the intra operative findings. Those
      with advanced thyroid cancer as per the eligibility criteria will be counselled and consented
      for the study. Those patients willing to participate in the study will be randomised to
      either receive only surgery and radio-iodine or surgery, radio-iodine and external beam
      radiation.

    <description>In this Arm, after surgery, patient will receive radio-iodine treatment as per guidelines, 6-8 weeks after surgery. The patient will receive adjuvant radiation therapy about 8-10 weeks after completion of initial surgery. The duration of this radiation therapy will be approximately 45 days.
: The goal of the treatment plan would be to encompass the PTV subclinical disease with a dose of 54-60 Gy and the PTV of the gross disease with 70-74 Gy while sparing as much of the aforesaid critical structures as possible.
The maximum permissible point doses to the spinal cord will be limited to 46 Gy. IMRT planning and delivery will be carried out on the Tomotherapy Hi Art System.</description>
