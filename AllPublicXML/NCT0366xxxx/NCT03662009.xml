  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Parkinson disease commonly experience difficulty driving, which requires the arms
      and legs to do different tasks simultaneously. Driving difficulties can lead to isolation,
      depression, loss of independence and mobility, and increased incidence of car accidents.
      Through understanding the impact of Parkinson disease on mechanisms underlying attention and
      multi-limb control, training and rehabilitation programs can better focus on the needs of
      drivers with Parkinson disease. The proposed study aims to address this need by taking
      measures of simulated driving at one point in time. Subjects with PD are tested at a single
      time point when they are at their &quot;best&quot; point in their day and on another day when they are
      at their worst and are about to take their next dose of medication. Healthy age-matched
      subjects are not taking anti-parkinson medication so are tested at only one point.

        Individuals will be recruited through collaboration with hospitals, clinics, physical
        therapy centers, private practice physicians and physical therapists, neurology-based
        fitness centers, community centers, PD support groups, online trial-matching services
        (e.g., FoxTrialFinder.michaeljfox.org), word of mouth, and advertising. Recruitment will be
        limited to the greater Phoenix metropolitan area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  have a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate idiopathic PD (Hoehn &amp; Yahr stages 1-3),

          -  hold a valid driver's license and drive at least once a week, and

          -  be capable of providing informed consent and complying with study procedures. Control
             group participants will be healthy, neurologically intact individuals, age-matched to
             within 2 years of the PD subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  impaired global cognition (i.e., a score of &lt; 20 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
             (MoCA) screening tool)

          -  sensory loss in the lower limb as assessed by clinical test of vibration perception at
             the ankle,

          -  orthopedic, visual, or neurological conditions that would prevent performance of the
             experimental tasks,

          -  inability to complete and pass the assessment testing,

          -  history of neurological illness such as head trauma, previous stroke, epilepsy,
             demyelinating disease, or

          -  complicating medical problems such as diabetes.
