    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of high risk prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 8 or greater
      are eligible for this trial. The study will enroll 20 subjects in 3 years. This is a single
      arm study and the primary objectives is to assess if a patient can undergo a radical
      prostatectomy after SBRT without a post-operative grade 3 or higher toxicity (according to
      Clavien-Dindo Classification) at 30 days. Secondary objectives are to assess acute toxicity
      and quality of life scores. Exploratory objectives will include analysis of tumor and normal
      biopsied and resected tissue and serum markers and interpretation of interfraction and
      intrafraction MRIs.

    <description>This is a modified dose escalation and de‐escalation study with an expansion of 3 or 6 pts to allow the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) be examined in a total of 9 pts. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as Grade 3 or higher toxicity related to preoperative radiotherapy according to the Clavien‐Dindo Classification. 3 radiation dose levels, 5 Gy, 6 Gy and 7Gy are considered. At the start of each dose level, 3 pts will be enrolled and treated for five days. If none of the 3 pts develop the DLT, the testing dose will escalate to the next level. If 1 of the 3 pts develops the DLT, the current dose will be tested in an additional 3 pts. If no additional pts develop the DLT, the dose will escalate.</description>
