  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the use and effectiveness of mobile-messaging platforms as a public
      health strategy for improving sexual health outcome measures among men who have sex with men
      (MSM) by determining whether exposure to the message-delivery platform results in
      improvements in participants' self-reported sexual health and prevention behaviors, beliefs
      and attitudes. The study will enroll men into a randomized controlled trial. Participants
      randomized to the messaging intervention will have access to a smartphone-based messaging
      platform for three months while those assigned to the waitlist group will be offered access
      to the messaging platform after all follow up is complete. Participants will complete surveys
      at baseline, after the end of the 3 month intervention, and follow up surveys 6 and 9 months
      after the baseline survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the use and effectiveness of a smartphone-based messaging
      platform as a public health strategy for improving participants' self-reported sexual health
      and prevention behaviors, beliefs and attitudes. The study will enroll 1,206 men into a
      randomized controlled trial. They will be assigned to either the immediate intervention group
      (&quot;intervention arm&quot;) or the waitlist-control group (&quot;waitlist-control arm&quot;). All participants
      will take an assessment survey at baseline, and the intervention group will be oriented on
      the installation and use of the messaging app upon randomization to that group. All men in
      the randomized controlled trial will complete short follow-up surveys at 3-month intervals
      during the 9-month follow-up period. When the intervention arm activities and assessments
      have concluded, participants in the waitlist-control arm will then be given the option of
      accessing to the intervention app and participation in intervention post-test activities.

Summed scores can range from 11 to 55 where higher scores indicate increased intention to engage in healthy activities related to HIV prevention and care.</description>

    <description>From baseline to 3-month post-test, participants in the intervention arm are granted access and instructed to interact regularly with the HealthMindr messaging platform. The HealthMindr messaging platform delivers messages relevant to both general audiences of sexually-active MSM, as well as messages relevant only to specific subgroups of HIV-positive men, and currently higher and lower risk HIV-negative men. Answers provided during the assessments determine which subset of messages are delivered to app users, with information such as HIV status, changes in self-reported risk behaviors, or other factors that influence the relevance of any given message. The HealthMindr application also offers free condoms, lube, and a HIV and STI testing kits.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the waitlist-control arm will be given a welcome sheet orienting them to the study. The message they view will include the same resources links provided to the intervention arm. The information will cover the importance of testing, links to an online mapping tool about the HIV epidemic in the United States (AIDSVu) and resources to locate HIV testing services and prevention information in their area. No information recommending frequency of testing will be given in the welcome greeting.</description>
