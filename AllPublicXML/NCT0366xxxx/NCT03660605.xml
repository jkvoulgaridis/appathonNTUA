  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how using auditory cues of a metronome at various
      frequencies impacts the gait mechanics and balance in people with Parkinson's disease when
      walking over ground and on a treadmill. We will enroll 10 participants with a diagnosis of
      Parkinson's disease (Stages 2 or 3). All participants will complete 18 training sessions over
      6 weeks and participate in pre- and post-testing of gait and balance.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (made by movement disorders
             specialist) will be included in this study. Additional inclusion criteria include:
             self-reported ability to walk ~6 minutes overground as well as walk on a treadmill for
             a total of 10 minutes with rest breaks as needed, and be classified as Stage 2, or 3
             on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (Goetz et. al, 2004).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include Hoehn and Yahr Stages 1, 4, or 5, uncontrolled
             cardiorespiratory/metabolic disease (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled
             hypertension or diabetes, orthostatic hypertension, chronic emphysema), or other
             neurological or orthopedic disorders that may affect walking. The investigators will
             also exclude participants with severe communication impairments, which could impede
             understanding of the purpose or procedures of the study or an inability to comply with
             experimental procedures.
