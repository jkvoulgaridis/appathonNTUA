  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 5000 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) are performed annually in Norway. Pain and reduced
      physical function is present in patients operated with TKA up to a year after surgery and
      about one of five patients are not satisfied with the outcome from TKA surgery. The use of
      tourniquet during surgery may also have impact on pain and physical function. Whether TKA
      surgery should be performed with or without the use of tourniquet, is a much-debated issue in
      orthopedic surgery today, and there is still no consensus in this field. This study will
      investigate early muscle strength and power recovery, neuromuscular recordings, neuronal
      changes and patient reported outcome measures after surgery with tourniquet versus not
      tourniquet.The findings in this study are expected to have implications for rehabilitation
      and the outcome of the TKA surgery.
