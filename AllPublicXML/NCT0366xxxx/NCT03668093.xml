      randomized clinical study to evaluate 'caries management by risk assessment' Versus
      'international caries classification and management system' Caries Risk Assessment Models
      Acquisition On Treatment Plan In Young Adult Population with null hypothesis that
      International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS™) will have the same
      clinical performance as Caries management by risk assessment (CAMBRA)

      . (ICCMS™) Comprehensive Patient Care Pathway considered as significant development from the
      traditional system of treatment plan. Comprehensive patient care should include all recent
      information related to the biological, social, behavioral, cultural, systemic, and
      dental/oral risk factors which help development and progression of dental caries. (ICCMS™)
      also report all essential decisions that aid to preserve tooth structure; as diagnosis,
      prevention and restoration only if indicated [9]. Moreover ( ICCMS™) deals with caries as a
      disease and not as a lesion, prevent development of initial caries lesions, and restore
      moderate or extensive caries lesions with the aim of preserving of tooth structure as much as
      possible.

      Follow up period is selected to be 12 months, since risk category is changed for better or
      worse over 1-2 year.
