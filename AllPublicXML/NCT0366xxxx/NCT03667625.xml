    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, progressive disease with an unknown etiology which
      characterize with inflammation that leads to bone fusion in spinal joints. Besides the
      systemic manifestations, chronic pain acquired kyphosis, diminished exercise capacity may
      cause pulmonary dysfunction, muscle imbalance, reduced quality of life, sleep disruptions and
      depression. There are strong evidence and advice on exercise should start with diagnosis.
      Although stretching exercises are the most common exercises in this group the literature on
      the effectiveness of stretching exercises is scarce. The aim of the study is to investigate
      the effectiveness stretching exercises in ankylosing spondylitis.

      The study was carried on patients with ankylosing spondylitis followed by Division of
      Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dokuz Eyl√ºl University School
      of Medicine. 57 patients were assessed and randomized into two group control and
      intervention. Control group informed on the importance of exercise and given a home exercise
      brochure. The intervention group was also randomized into an aquatic and land stretching
      group and received stretching exercises two days a week for eight weeks. Two patients from
      the control group and nine patients (three from aquatic, six from land) from the intervention
      group were excluded.

      At the end of eight weeks, except FEV1, FVC, VC all results of the intervention group
      improved whereas an quality of health was the only result improved in the control group. When
      aquatic and land stretching groups the results were improved similarly. The improvements of
      BASFI and MIP of the aquatic group are superior to the land group.

      Home exercises are playing an important role in the management of ankylosing spondylitis.
      Addition of stretching exercises to home exercises enhances the effectiveness of the
      treatment. Aquatic stretching exercises have some benefits than land stretching exercises.

    <description>Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index. Includes 10 questions with 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to answer the questions. The mean of the ten scales gives the BASFI score - a value between 0 and 10. The higher the BASFI score, the more severe the patient's limitation of function due to their AS</description>

    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. BASDAI consists of 10 cm VAS used to answer 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of AS: Fatigue; Spinal pain; Joint pain / swelling; Areas of localized tenderness; Morning stiffness. To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean of the two scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final 0 - 10 BASDAI score.The higher the BASDAI score, the more severe the patient's disability due to their AS</description>

    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index. Tragus to wall distance, Lumbar side flexion, Modified Schober's, Cervical rotation and Intermalleolar distance were inculuded in BASMI. The BASMI was first published in 1994 as a 2-point scale, was adapted a year later into a 10-point scale, and has more recently been proposed and validated as a linear construct. Individual scores are summed for the BASMI2 or averaged for the BASMI10 to give a final score between 0 and 10, where a higher score reflects more significant impairment of spinal mobility.</description>

    <description>Aquatic multidimensional mobility exercises were given in the treatment pool at Balcova Thermal Centre, Izmir, Turkey. Group of 6-7 patients was instructed by a specialized physiotherapist twice in a week for eight weeks. The water temperature was 33-340C and the depth was between 110-140 cm, patients were asked to keep T11 level submersion during vertical exercises. Exercise span was kept 30-40 min in first 4 weeks then increased to 45-50 min with additional exercises.</description>
