    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigator's study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of the
      Cor-Knot device in isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) by right anterior minithoracotomy
      (RAMT).

      Four hundred and forty patients were operated for AVR by RAMT. Of these patients, 221
      underwent isolated AVR surgery with stented prosthesis. Sutures were secured using the
      Cor-Knot titanium fastener in 63 patients and knots were hand-tied in 158.

      The aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass times were significantly decreased in
      the AT group compared with the MT group. Clinical outcomes were similar in the two groups,
      whether in the analysis of non-matched or matched groups. There was no difference in 30
      day-mortality and the stroke and TIA rates were comparable The automated Cor-Knot fastener is
      an easy-to-use, time-saving device which does not increase perioperative morbi-mortality in
      patients undergoing AVR by right anterior minithoracotomy.
