  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To compare the effects between non-vibration foam rolling (NVFR) and vibration foam
      rolling (VFR) on visual analogic scale (VAS), pressure pain threshold (PPT), oxygen
      saturation (SmO2), counter-movement jump (CMJ), and hip and knee range of movement (ROM)
      after induction of muscle damage through eccentric acute-exercise using inertial flywheel.

      Methods: Thirty-eight healthy subjects (males n=32 females= 6, age 22.2±3.2 years) were
      randomly assigned in a counter-balanced fashion to either a VFR or NVFR protocol group. All
      subjects performed a 10x10 (sets x reps) eccentric squat protocol to induce muscle damage.
      The protocols were administered 48-h post-exercise, measuring VAS, PPT, SmO2, CMJ and ROM,
      before and immediately post-treatment. The technique of treatment was repeated on both legs
      for 1 min for a total of 5 sets, with a 30-s rest between sets.

      Muscle damage was induced with overload eccentric training using inertial flywheel (2.7-kg
      flywheels with a moment inertia of 0.07 kg m−2). Immediately after baseline measures,
      subjects performed 10 sets x 10 repetitions parallel squats using a gravity-free training
      device flywheel with 2 minutes of recovery between sets. The squat exercise was chosen as
      basic movement because of its similar muscles recruitment to many athletic movements
      patterns. Furthermore, the squat exercise is one of the main exercises used to improve the
      lower-body strength. The required technique was demonstrated to all subjects before beginning
      the eccentric session, and they were coached during the protocol to be sure adequate
      technique and maximal effort in each repetition were maintained. All participants performed 5
      min on a treadmill to warm up before performing the eccentric bout.

      Description of the foam roller intervention The foam-rolling technique was based on a
      previously published protocol. In both protocols, the technique was repeated on both legs for
      1 min for a total of 5 sets, with a 30-s rest between sets. The cadence for both techniques
      (NVFR and VFR) was fixed at 3:4 using a metronome.

      Using a protocol adapted from previous study, subjects began in the plank position with the
      foam roller at the most proximal portion of the quadriceps of both legs, with as much of
      their body mass as possible on the foam roller.

      Non-Vibration Foam Rolling (NVFR) Group: subjects performed the FR protocol using a
      custom-made foam roller composed of a polystyrene foam cylinder (15-cm diameter × 35-cm
      long).

      Vibration Foam Rolling (VFR) Group: subjects performed the same protocol using a foam roller
      with vibration (frequency: 18 Hz) composed of a polystyrene foam cylinder (15-cm diameter ×
      35-cm long).

    <description>used to measure DOMS and to estimate the intensity of its associated pain. In order to standardize the scaling instructions, the endpoints were described for the subject as 0 = 'no sensation' and 10 = 'the most worst intense sensation imaginable' (16,40). The VAS was measured in four different conditions: 1) passive, 2) during isometric quadriceps contraction, 3) performing a squat and 4) during stretch quadriceps.</description>

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>measured using a digital pressure algometer (Microfet3 ®, Hoggan Health Industries). The digital dynamometer with a 1 cm probe was used to measure three points at the quadriceps: vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF) and vastus medialis (VM). Subject was lying on the stretcher, the algometer was positioned perpendicularly to the skin at each point and gradual pressure was applied until the subject reported a change from the sensation of pressure to pain. In that point the pressure was stopped immediately and the value was recorded represented the pain threshold (16). The mean of the 3 measures was calculated. Algometry has been shown to be highly reliable (ICC = 0.91) (9).</description>
