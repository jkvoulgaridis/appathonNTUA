  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn scars are treated with compression garments. These are produced based on manual measure
      data. The aim of this study is to evaluate correct fitting, wearing comfort, suitability for
      daily use and scar properties after using garments produced on base of measuring data from
      scanning in comparison to manual measured data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment of burn scars is still challenging, because
      excessive and hypertrophic scarring can occur. Burn garments are usually used to reduce such
      scarring. However, measure are taken manually by a measuring tape using interpolation.
      Therefore, compression garments produced on base of 3D surface imaging using a scanning
      system are compared to compression garments based on manually measurements regarding correct
      fitting, wearing comfort, suitability for daily use and scar properties.
