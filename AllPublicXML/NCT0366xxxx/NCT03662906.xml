  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Urinary Retention (CUR) is defined as a non-painful bladder which remains palpable or
      percussible after the patient has passed urine by International Continence Society. Postvoid
      residual urine volume â‰¥300 mL seems to be widely accepted.

      CUR may be caused by a variety of diseases and events including injury of sacral plexus,
      cauda equina and sacral spinal cord, pelvic floor nerve lesion after pelvic surgery and
      peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, etc.. Aforementioned injuries generally affect lower
      motor neuron causing detrusor underactivity, acontractile detrusor or detrusor areflexia. The
      prevalence varies by different causes of lower motor neuron lesion. The symptoms of patients
      are voiding difficulty, bladder distention, bladder without sensation and overflow
      incontinence.

      A multi-center randomized sham-controlled trial will be conducted. The aim of this study is
      to assess the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for urinary function of patients with
      CUR caused by lower motor neuron lesion.

    <description>SF-Qualiveen is the only questionnaire that addresses the broad range of urinary problems experienced by patients with neurological disorders voiding symptoms. Qualiveen domain scores are calculated as an average of the scores on items in that domain and, thus, the range is 0 to 4 with an overall score representing the mean of the 4 domains, which also ranges from 0 to 4. A higher score indicates the greater the impact on the quality of life of patients.</description>
