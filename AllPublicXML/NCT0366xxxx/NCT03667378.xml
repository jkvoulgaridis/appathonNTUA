  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether adding personalized supportive care to medical treatment on a
      clinical trial affects the study participants' ability and desire to discuss their symptoms,
      their concerns about the future, and their approach to coping with cancer. The effects of
      supportive care on participants' responses to questions about these topics will be compared
      with those of other study participants who are being treated for cancer in a clinical trial,
      but are not receiving personalized supportive care.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        The study population will be patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor
        cancers who progress beyond standard treatment and are deemed eligible to receive treatment
        with investigational targeted or immune-based therapeutics with Phase I, Phase I/Ib, and
        Phase I/II trials at MSK.

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with disease progression on at least one standard chemotherapy regimen, and
             now eligible and consented to begin Phase I, Phase I/Ib, Phase I/II and non-randomized
             Phase II (including basket studies) investigational targeted and immune-based
             therapeutics in MSK medical oncology, EDD, or ITC clinics

          -  Able to speak, read, and understand English well enough to complete study assessments
             in the judgment of the consenting professional

          -  18 years of age and older

          -  Has a progressive or metastatic solid tumor cancer with MSK pathology confirmation at
             the primary or metastatic anatomic site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who already are receiving specialty supportive care (already referred for a
             supportive care consultation) prior to enrollment in a Phase I protocol.

          -  Patients will be excluded if the Phase I, Phase I/Ib, Phase I/II or Phase II trial
             involves known active drugs in combination with experimental drugs, in which the
             patient has not previously received the known active drug or active drugs of the same
             class. For example, a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer who has not received
             gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, but enrolls on a study that tests an experimental drug in
             addition to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, will be excluded.

          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive disturbance in the primary clinician‟s or
             investigator‟s judgment, to preclude providing informed consent or participating in
             the interventions (i.e. acute psychiatric symptoms which require individual treatment)
