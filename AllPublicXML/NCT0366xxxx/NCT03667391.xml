  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is difficult for
      numerous reasons and is related with a poor prognosis. In Taiwan, the incidence of CTEPH and
      its clinical features are unknown. This study aims at evaluating the prevalence, clinical
      characteristics, and management of CTEPH in a Taiwanese cohort.

      Primary objective:

      - To investigate the geodemographics of CTEPH in Taiwan

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To characterize the demographics and clinical presentation of patients with CTEPH

        -  To describe the real-world management and treatment outcome of patients with CTEPH

        -  To identify the risk factors of CTEPH

        -  To assess the relationship between risk factors/patients' characteristics and clinical
           outcomes for CTEPH

        -  To evaluate the prognosis of CTEPH in Taiwan using survival assessment

        Patients with contrast CT image and cardiac echo data and confirmed/suspected as CTEPH can
        be included in the screening (initial registration). Those who have confirmed diagnosis of
        CTEPH in expert centers (IRB approved for patient enrollment) will be enrolled into the
        study.
