    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well systemic light exposure works in preventing frailty in
      older patients with prostate cancer on hormonal therapy. Hormone therapy causes many symptoms
      of frailty in older men including fatigue, slower time to walk a specified distance, reduced
      activity levels, loss of lean muscle, and muscle weakness. It is not yet known if systemic
      light exposure may reduce frailty in older prostate cancer patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if bright white light (BWL), compared to dim white light (DWL), significantly
      prevents frailty development in older prostate cancer (PC) patients following prostate
      anti-androgen therapy initiation.

      II. Determine if BWL, compared to DWL, significantly increases functional performance and
      physical activity levels, yields significant reductions in fatigue, lowers body mass index
      (BMI), and reduces weakness in older PC patients following prostate anti-androgen therapy
      initiation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Examine the feasibility of collecting and storing clinically-usable bio-measures for
      future analysis in patients at baseline and if available at 6 months, including blood samples
      (inflammatory markers), and salivary swabs (genetics, genomics, cortisol circadian rhythms).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (BWL): Patients wear an Actiwatch for 5 days at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
      Beginning 1-4 weeks after first anti-androgen therapy, patients undergo BWL treatment using
      Luminette glasses for 30 minutes every morning for 3-6 months.

      ARM II (DWL): Patients wear an Actiwatch for 5 days at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
      Beginning 1-4 weeks after first anti-androgen therapy, patients undergo DWL treatment using
      Luminette glasses for 30 minutes every morning for 3-6 months.
