  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed at investigating the feasibility of a new guided participation (GP)
      discharge program for parents of very preterm infants. A randomized controlled trial was
      conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit. The intervention included three structured GP
      sessions and one follow-up phone call. The control group received usual care. Outcomes
      measured included parents' efficacy and satisfaction with parenting, and perceived stress.
      Data collection was conducted at baseline, on day of discharge, after the follow-up phone
      call, and 1 month after discharge. The outcomes were analyzed on the basis of
      intention-to-treat principles.

    <measure>Parents' change in score of Parenting Sense of Competence Scale from baseline to up to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at 3-, 4-, and 8-weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale is a self-reported instrument which includes 17 items in two subscales (efficacy and satisfaction). Each item is rated on a 6- point Likert scale ('Strongly disagree' = 1; 'Strongly agree' = 6). Nine items (items 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14 and 16) were reverse-coded. The total scores ranged from 17 to 102. A higher score indicates a higher sense of competence and satisfaction with parenting by parents.</description>

    <measure>Parents' change in score of Perceived Stress Scale from baseline to up to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at 3-, 4-, and 8-weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale consists of 10 items. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ('never' = 0; 'very often' = 4). The total score is yielded by summing the scores of all items. The total score ranges from 0 to 40. The higher the score, the higher is the parents' perceived stress in parenting.</description>
