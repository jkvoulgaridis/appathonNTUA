  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe exercise intolerance and shortness of breath are present in lung transplant
      candidates. Clinical features that reveal these symptoms in terminal period lung patients
      vary and are unclear. The effect of peripheral muscle strength on exercise capacity and
      dyspnea will be examined in our study.

      Yedikule Chest Diseases Patients who have been accepted to participate in the pre-operative
      rehabilitation program at the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit will be included in the study. A
      6-min walk test, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength measurements, and a dyspnea
      rating scale Mmrc will be applied to the lung transplantation candidates who are trained in
      3-month hospital-based preoperative exercise training in the Pulmonary Rehabilitation unit.
      The tests will be carried out at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. At each testing
      session, the tests will be performed by the same physiotherapist. The correlations of the
      test data with each other will be analyzed.

    <measure>Changes from baseline the muscle strength</measure>

    <description>Muscle strength will measure using a digital dynamometer (J-Tech Commander muscle testing device), wth three measurements make. Best result will be taken.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline the hand grip strength.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It was measured with hydraulic hand dynamometer calibrated in lbs.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline the maximum inspiratory muscle pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The mouth pressure measurement was performed with the Micro-RPMÂ® instrument from SensorMEDIC. Patient placed a rubber mouthpiece with flanges, on the device, sealed their lips firmly around the mouthpiece, exhaled/inhaled slowly and completely, and then tried to breath in as hard as possible. The patient was allowed to rest for about a minute and the maneuver was repeated five times. Verbal or visual feedback was provided after each maneuver. The aim is that the variability between measurements is less than 10 cm H2O. The maximum value was obtained.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline the distance covered in six-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The test was conducted in a 30-meter corridor in line with American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Patients were told that they should walk as fast as they can walk. Before and after the test, oxygen saturation, heart rate, Borg fatigue rating, and walking distance were recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC Dyspnea Scale is best used to establish baseline functional impairment due to dyspnea attributable to respiratory disease; tracking the mMRC over time or with therapeutic interventions is of less certain clinical utility.The severity of dyspnea is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. &quot;O&quot; means no dyspnea perception, &quot;4&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>
