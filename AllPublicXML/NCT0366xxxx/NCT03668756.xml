      To compare the functional outcomes of Computer-Assisted Navigation (CAS) and Conventional
      Instrumentation TKA at the 8-year follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data of the present study was collected from the review of the medical chart of the
      patients who were scheduled to undergo staged bilateral TKA and randomly assigned to receive
      Computer-Assisted Navigation (CAS) TKA in one limb and conventional TKA. Then, comparing the
      functional outcomes of CAS and Conventional Instrumentation was performed by statistical
      software.

    <description>Standard anteroposterior, lateral radiographs of the knee and standing long-leg radiographs of the lower extremity were obtained pre- and postoperatively. The lower extremities were fully extended so that the tibial tuberosities were facing forward and the lateral malleoli were 15 cm apart to ensure that the tibia was vertical and facing forward with minimal rotation. The X-ray beam (20-25 mA/s; 80-85 kV) was centered at the knee joint level at a distance of 120-140 cm.Radiographic data included the mechanical axis angle and the four component alignments described by Ewald: the femoral valgus (FV) angle; tibial valgus angle (TV); femoral flexion (FF) angle; and tibial flexion angle (TF)</description>
