  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, non-blinded, non-randomized, pilot trial for safety and efficacy of DBS
      for AUD. Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be identified and recruited
      from the practices of Sunnybrook psychiatrists. Five (5) to ten (10) subjects will be
      enrolled and study duration for each patient will be of one (1) year. Our primary objective
      is to establish the safety of DBS in a patient population with treatment refractory AUD. In
      addition to demonstrating safety, our second primary objective will be to evaluate if
      DBS-targeted nucleus accumbens in alcoholism is efficacious in the treatment-refractory
      patients with AUD. This will be measured by various outcome measures that will include
      validated scales to assess addiction and craving behaviours.

    <description>Our primary objective is to establish the safety of deep brain stimulation in a patient population with treatment refractory alcohol use disorder. This is an exploratory pilot study. safety will be reported in the form of adverse event collection, and reported for each patient recruited into the study. Infection, hemorrhage, seizure, sensorymotor disturbance, oculomotor disturbance, or worsening on any adjunctive measure scales used will be reported. These will all be reported on a case-by-case basis, and presented descriptively in the publication. (no specific scale will be used).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alcohol consumption measured with the alcohol timeline followback</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of alcohol consumption preoperatively will be compared with the amount of alcohol consumption postoperatively using the alcohol timeline followback method at 6 months (compared to the preoperative baseline). This will be administered by a psychometrist, and reported as average number of standard drinks consumed daily and weekly during the 6 month postoperative period. An increase from preoperative values is considered a worse outcome, and a decrease in number is an improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Dependency Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months. This scale is scored out of 47, and will be administered by a psychometrist preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Higher scores are considered worse, so a decrease from baseline is an improvement.</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol Dependency Scale (ADS) will be compared between preoperative baseline and at 6 month follow up.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) will be compared between preoperative baseline and at 6 month follow up. This scale is scored out of 84, and will be administered by a psychometrist preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Higher scores are considered worse, so a decrease from baseline is an improvement.</description>

    <description>DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the administration of small amounts of electricity to disrupt abnormal activity of brain structures associated with disease symptoms. It involves inserting thin electrodes into deep brain structures and electrically stimulating them in a controllable and ultimately reversible manner. The electrodes are connected to an internal pulse generator that is implanted in the upper chest region, below the collarbone.</description>

          6. Likely to relocate or move during the study's one year duration

          7. Presence of clinical and/or neurological conditions that may significantly increase
