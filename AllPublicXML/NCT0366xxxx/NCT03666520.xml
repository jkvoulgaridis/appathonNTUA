  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent report, drug spending increased by 23.4 percent annually in the inpatient setting
      from 2013 to 2015 with the average inpatient drug spending increasing from $714 to $990 per
      admission. A retrospective analysis from Johns Hopkins showed potential annual savings of
      over $1,100,000 dollars with a switch from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) administration of
      four inpatient medications. Another study actively encouraging the conversion of IV to PO
      medications demonstrated a decrease in therapeutic costs.

      A number of benefits occur at the conversion of IV to oral medications including the reduced
      risk of secondary cannula- related infections, inflammation, and pain in the area of
      administration. Most oral agents are less expensive than the related IV medications. Other
      benefits occur in indirect administration costs such as the expense of nursing labor and
      equipment. The switch from IV to oral medication has also been shown to result in earlier
      discharge of patients, potentially saving medical costs.

      The investigators have chosen to further the research of the conversion of IV to PO
      medications by combining prior knowledge on the subject with robust clinical decision
      support. Our research will prompt providers at the right time in the workflow to switch from
      IV to PO medications. The investigators will exclude patients less than 18 years old, with a
      NPO status, or a severe disease state (vasopressor dependent, decreased consciousness,
      seizures, severely immunocompromised (ANC &lt; 500), or life- threatening infections such as
      sepsis, Central Nervous System (CNS) infections, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, etc.). The
      medications eligible for this research project were identified through comparison of the
      wholesale price of the intravenous and oral formulations. To select medications with a
      potential for savings, the investigators factored in the frequency of IV administrations in
      the past five months using our electronic health record system (EHR) to help identify highly
      utilized medications. The product of the largest cost differential and frequency was used to
      decide on the following list of medications for this project: Lacosamide, Doxycycline,
      Levothyroxine, Linezolid, Acetaminophen, Rifampin, Amiodarone and Levofloxacin.

      The principal trigger for the clinical decision support prompt will be a current diet order
      listed in the patient's chart or an order for another medication via the oral route. These
      orders will flag the patient as eligible for po medications. Once the patient has been
      identified to be eligible for PO medications, the presence of an order for an IV formulation
      of one of the above drugs will prompt a once-daily alert to the provider upon opening the
      chart for the conversion to PO medication. Providers will be randomized to receive the alert.
      Past experience has shown that such an alert will remind providers not only to switch the
      drug in questions to PO form, but other medications as well. For the providers not receiving
      the alert, the investigators will record when it would have been triggered for the first
      time. The trial will run for three months to completion.

      Analysis at the time of study completion will occur on primary (number of doses of candidate
      medication administered IV and PO after the alert) and secondary outcomes (number of doses of
      other medication not on our IV and PO list, cost savings, presence of an iv drip, episodes of
      sepsis or bacteremia). The investigators will monitor for potential complications by
      monitoring length of stay after triggering the alert. The investigators will also monitor the
      doses of hyaluronidase administered to patients after the alert was triggered.

    <description>This study is designed to further research the conversion of Intravenous medications to oral medications in patients in an inpatient setting whenever it is appropriate and safe. We have chosen eight medications to research in this study. These medications were chosen because large difference in cost between an intravenous (IV) dose of this medication versus an oral (PO) dose of this medication exist. This study aims to further evaluate the appropriateness and safety of converting IV medications to PO medications for hospitalized patients through a pilot clinical trial.</description>
