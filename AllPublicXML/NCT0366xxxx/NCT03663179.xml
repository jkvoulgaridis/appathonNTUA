    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of impulsivity,
      inattention, and hyperactivity that emerge in childhood and frequently persist into
      adulthood. These symptoms are accompanied by deficits in cognitive control and risky decision
      making that can lead to negative psychosocial and health-related outcomes. With advances in
      the neuroimaging field, researchers are learning where and how self-control over decisions
      and behaviors is executed in the brain. This work points to the central role of neural
      activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) in self-control processes that
      contribute to healthy choices. Emerging evidence shows that activity in the prefrontal
      cortices and cognitive control circuits can be modulated using a noninvasive and safe
      intervention: repetitive TMS. This within-subject proof of concept study will investigate
      whether 20 sessions of TMS (versus sham stimulation) can enhance executive cognitive function
      in adults with ADHD.

    <measure>Change in Performance on Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale - Self-Report: Long Version (ADHD Symptoms)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD symptoms will be assessed using the well-validated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale - Self-Report: Long Version (CAARS-S:L). The CAARS-S:L is a 66-item rating scale designed to assess ADHD symptoms in adults. The scale contains multiple subscales to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) specified ADHD criteria as well as other facets of ADHD such as inattention/memory problems, hyperactivity/restlessness, impulsivity/emotionality, and problems with self-concept. Subscale results are converted to T-scores (range: 25-90), where 50 is the standardized population mean and every 10 points indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Higher values generally indicate more difficulties with ADHD symptoms. This measure will be administered at baseline at at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline to week 4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Performance on Conners Continuous Performance Task (Sustained Attention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners Continuous Performance Task (Conners CPT) will be administered and baseline and weekly during the treatment period to assess sustained attention. In this task, participants are shown a series of letters on a computer screen and are asked to press the spacebar in response to all letters except for the letter X. The primary outcome for the Conners CPT is the change in number of commission errors (e.g., false positives) from baseline to week 4.</description>

This coil has an active side and a sham side, and can be used to perform double-blinded studies. TMS will be administered at 10 Hertz (Hz) with an intensity of 120% of patient resting motor threshold. Stimulation will be delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using 20 sec cycles (i.e., 5 sec train with 15 sec inter train interval). Subjects will receive 80 trains per session for a total of 4000 pulses per session (~26 min sessions). Twenty sessions will be completed on sequential weekdays (5 days per week for 4 weeks).</description>

    <description>A MagPro R30 (Magventure, Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) device with a Cool-B65 A/P figure 8 coil will be used to deliver TMS. This coil has an active side and a sham side, and can be used to perform double-blinded studies. For sham stimulation, the sham side of the coil is positioned toward the participant's scalp. The sham coil is designed to mimic the appearance and sound of active TMS stimulation, but is equipped with a magnetic shield that reduces the strength of the field by approximately 80%. This reduction in field strength ensures that no neural stimulation occurs. Twenty sessions will be completed on sequential weekdays (5 days per week for 4 weeks).</description>

        <title>Change in Performance on Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale - Self-Report: Long Version (ADHD Symptoms)</title>
        <description>ADHD symptoms will be assessed using the well-validated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale - Self-Report: Long Version (CAARS-S:L). The CAARS-S:L is a 66-item rating scale designed to assess ADHD symptoms in adults. The scale contains multiple subscales to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) specified ADHD criteria as well as other facets of ADHD such as inattention/memory problems, hyperactivity/restlessness, impulsivity/emotionality, and problems with self-concept. Subscale results are converted to T-scores (range: 25-90), where 50 is the standardized population mean and every 10 points indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Higher values generally indicate more difficulties with ADHD symptoms. This measure will be administered at baseline at at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline to week 4.</description>

            <description>Participants will receive 20 sessions of active TMS targeting the left DLPFC.
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): A MagPro R30 (Magventure, Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) device with a Cool-B65 A/P figure 8 coil will be used to deliver TMS. This coil has an active side and a sham side, and can be used to perform double-blinded studies. TMS will be administered at 10 Hertz (Hz) with an intensity of 120% of patient resting motor threshold. Stimulation will be delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using 20 sec cycles (i.e., 5 sec train with 15 sec inter train interval). Subjects will receive 80 trains per session for a total of 4000 pulses per session (~26 min sessions). Twenty sessions will be completed on sequential weekdays (5 days per week for 4 weeks).</description>

Sham Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Sham TMS): A MagPro R30 (Magventure, Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) device with a Cool-B65 A/P figure 8 coil will be used to deliver TMS. This coil has an active side and a sham side, and can be used to perform double-blinded studies. For sham stimulation, the sham side of the coil is positioned toward the participant’s scalp. The sham coil is designed to mimic the appearance and sound of active TMS stimulation, but is equipped with a magnetic shield that reduces the strength of the field by approximately 80%. This reduction in field strength ensures that no neural stimulation occurs. Twenty sessions will be completed on sequential weekdays (5 days per week for 4 weeks).</description>

In this task, participants are shown a series of letters on a computer screen and are asked to press the spacebar in response to all letters except for the letter X. The primary outcome for the Conners CPT is the change in number of commission errors (e.g., false positives) from baseline to week 4.</description>
