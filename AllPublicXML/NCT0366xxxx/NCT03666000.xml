  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, dose-escalation, and
      dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of PBCAR0191 in adults with
      r/r B ALL (Cohort A) and in adults with r/r B-cell NHL (Cohort N).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, dose-escalation, and
      dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, find an appropriate dose to
      optimize safety and efficacy, and evaluate clinical activity of PBCAR0191 in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL). Before initiating PBCAR0191, subjects will be administered lymphodepletion
      chemotherapy composed of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period,
      subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR0191. Subjects who receive a split
      dose will also receive an IV infusion of PBCAR0191 on Day 10 and/or Day 14. Subjects may be
      considered for retreatment. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period through
      Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR0191 will be followed in a separate long-term
      follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.

    <intervention_model_description>In each cohort (NHL and B-ALL), up to 6 dose levels will be enrolled and treated sequentially. Within each dose level, up to 6 subjects will be treated with PBCAR0191 using a standard 3 + 3 design. The starting dose of PBCAR0191 will be 3 × 10^5 CAR T cells/kg body weight. Subsequent dose groups will be treated with escalating doses to a maximum dose of 9 × 10^6 CAR T cells/kg. In the absence of DLTs, the dose will be increased using a fixed dose scheme.</intervention_model_description>
