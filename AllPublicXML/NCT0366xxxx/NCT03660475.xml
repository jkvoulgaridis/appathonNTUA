    <textblock>
      The objective of this exploratory study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 0.002%
      Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, compared to placebo for the treatment of the signs and
      symptoms of dry eye in diabetic subjects.

      This is a Phase 2, single-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study to
      compare the safety and efficacy of Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002% to placebo for the
      treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye in diabetic subjects. Subjects eligible to be
      randomized will receive one of the following treatments to be administered bilaterally BID
      for 29 days (from Visit 2 to Visit 5): Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002% or Placebo
      Ophthalmic Solution (Vehicle). During a 10-day study run-in period (for the purpose of
      subject selection) prior to randomization, all subjects will receive Placebo Ophthalmic
      Solution (Vehicle) bilaterally BID. Participants who terminate early during the application
      period will be asked to complete safety assessments (if the participants agree) prior to
      study exit. Participants who are terminated early from the study will not be replaced.

          -  Have a history of use or desire to use eye drops for dry eye symptoms within 6 months
             of Visit 1;

          -  Have a corneal fluorescein staining score of ≥ 2 in any region (inferior, superior, or
             central regions) in at least one eye at Visits 1 and 2 (must be the same eye at Visits
             1 and 2);

          -  Have at least one of the following at Visits 1 and 2:

               1. A total lissamine green conjunctival score of ≥ 2 in at least one eye, based on
                  the sum of the temporal and nasal regions at Visits 1 and 2 (must be the same eye
                  at Visits 1 and 2);

               2. Report an OSDI score ≥ 20 at Visits 1 and 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any clinically significant slit lamp findings at Visit 1 that may include active
             blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), lid margin inflammation or active
             ocular allergies that require therapeutic treatment, and/or in the opinion of the
             investigator may interfere with study parameters;

          -  Be diagnosed with an ongoing ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), or active
             ocular inflammation at Visit 1;

          -  Have concurrent neurotrophic keratopathy from a source other than diabetes (h/o HSV
             keratitis, h/o HZO with ocular manifestations, or CN VII palsy or other condition
             resulting in lagophthalmos);

          -  Have active diabetic foot ulcers;

          -  Have a corneal sensitivity score ≤ 1.5 cm as measured by Cochet-Bonnet at Visit 1;

          -  Report an OSDI score &gt; 75 at Visits 1 and 2;

             as a woman who is permanently sterilized (i.e., has had a hysterectomy or bilateral
             tubal ligation), or is post-menopausal (without menses for 12 consecutive months);

          -  Be a woman of childbearing potential who is not using an acceptable means of birth

             a barrier such as a diaphragm or condom; IUD; or surgical sterilization of partner.
             For non-sexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of
             birth control; however, if the subject becomes sexually active during the study, they
             must agree to use adequate birth control as defined above for the remainder of the
             study;

          -  Have a known allergy and/or sensitivity to the test article or its components;

          -  Have a condition or be in a situation which the investigator feels may put the subject
             at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly
             with the subject's participation in the study;

          -  Be currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or have used an
             investigational drug or device within 30 days of Visit 1;

          -  Be currently using any medication known to cause ocular drying that is not used on a
             stable dosing regimen for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1;

          -  Be unable or unwilling to follow instructions, including participation in all study
             assessments and visits.

          -  Be currently using a systemic opioid antagonist (e.g., Naltrexone or Naloxone) or have
             used a systemic opioid antagonist in the previous 90 days
