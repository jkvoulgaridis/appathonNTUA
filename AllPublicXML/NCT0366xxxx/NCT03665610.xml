      Study Design

      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, extension study to collect safety data up to 75 ± 10 days
      postdose from the Phase 1 studies RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913 and RPC01-1914 (ie, the &quot;parent
      studies&quot;) and PK/PD data up to 75 ± 10 days postdose from studies RPC01-1913 and RPC01-1914.
      This study consists of two parts:

        -  Mandatory data collection for safety: Subjects enrolled in the parent studies were
           consented to have data on adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), pregnancy
           test results, and concomitant medications up to the 75 ± 10 days postdose follow-up
           collected and reported in this study.

        -  Optional sparse sampling for PK/PD: Eligible subjects from studies RPC01-1913 and
           RPC01-1914 will be offered the opportunity to return to the clinical research unit (CRU)
           at four separate occasions for PK/PD sample collections up to the 75 ± 10 days postdose
           follow-up. After signing the informed consent form, eligible subjects will be randomized
           to one of three sequences with stratification by site/protocol. Subjects will return to
           the CRU in the morning (between approximately 8 am and 11 am) once at each of the four
           time windows.

      Study Population The approximate number of subjects will be 230 for safety data and 129 for
      PK/PD data.

      Length of Study The study duration is up to 84 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For the mandatory data collection for safety, subjects who enrolled in the Phase 1
             studies RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913, or RPC01-1914 and received at least one dose of
             ozanimod or investigational product (IP) as applicable per the parent studies are
             eligible, except for subjects who discontinued during Period 1 of study RPC01-1913.

          2. For the optional sparse sampling for PK/PD, subjects must satisfy the following
             criteria:

               1. Subjects in study RPC01-1913 have completed the study at least through Period 2
                  and completed the 7 ± 2 days postdose follow-up assessments; or subjects in study
