    <textblock>
      The effect of Levodopa medication on inhibitory control in Parkinson's patients is extremely
      debated despite the fact that this has potential clinical and therapeutic implications. A key
      confounding factor of many previous studies is that they did not take the disease duration in
      consideration. In fact, in moderate-to-advanced stages of Parkinson dopaminergic drugs could
      not produce a clear effect because too few dopaminergic cells for the drugs to operate on
      survived. Hence, in this study, we will compare the performance in the stop signal task in
      early-stage versus moderate-to-advanced stages Parkinson's patients both in ON and in OFF
      medication. In addition, to have a baseline measure of inhibitory control we will compare
      patient's performances with that of age-matched subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability to stop a pending action is fundamental for survival in a natural environment
      where events cannot be fully predicted. Sudden events, such as the appearance of a physical
      obstacle, often require a quick change of the planned motor strategy and the first step
      toward this goal is to suppress the pre-programmed actions. Thus voluntary inhibition plays a
      crucial role in cognitive control and behavioral flexibility (1, 2). It has been shown that
      Parkinson's patients suffer from a specific deficit in this functions (3, 4, 5). However, it
      is extremely debated whether and how Levodopa medication (levodopa, dopamine agonists,
      anticholinergic drugs, or a combination of levodopa and an anticholinergic drug) affects
      response inhibition. A number of studies measuring inhibitory control via the stop signal
      task in Parkinson's patients seem to indicate that dopaminergic medications do not influence
      this executive function (5, 6, 7). However, a recent study (8) found that Levodopa medication
      does not affect specifically inhibitory control or movement readiness, but the balance
      between them. In fact, Parkinson's patients in the OFF medication state were able to maintain
      response latencies in the same range as healthy controls, but they showed a significant
      reduction in the ability to stop reactions abruptly. In contrast, patients' performance
      shifted significantly when taking dopaminergic medications. They move slower but stopping
      improved relative to the off dopamine state. This pattern suggests a role for dopamine in
      modulating the tradeoff between the two action control processes. In addition, studies of
      other specific populations and healthy adults suggest that dopaminergic medications deserve
      reconsideration in response inhibition. For instance, positron emission (PET) studies have
      found that higher levels of striatal D1 and D2/D3 receptor availability predict better
      performance on the stop signal task (9, 10) and that response inhibition performance evokes
      dopamine release in prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortex in healthy adults (11). Even
      more importantly, a few recent studies provided evidence that early-stage Parkinson's
      patients with response inhibition impairment seem to beneﬁt from dopaminergic treatment
      (12,13). Therefore, a plausible hypothesis is that the absence of a clear effect of
      dopaminergic medications could be ascribed to the fact that in most previous studies included
      Parkinson's patients in the moderate-to-advanced stages. In those patients, the diminished
      efﬁcacy of dopaminergic drugs could be a consequence that too few dopaminergic cells for the
      drugs to operate on survived (14).

      Hence, the aim of the present work is to re-assess the impact of dopaminergic medications on
      inhibitory control on Parkinson's patients using a reaching version of the stop signal task
      (e.g. 4, 15, 16, 17, 18) taking the disease duration in consideration. To this aim, the
      investigators will compare the performance in the stop signal task in early-stage versus
      moderate-to-advanced stages Parkinson's patients both in ON and in OFF medication. Finally,
      to have a baseline measure of inhibitory control the investigators will compare patients'
      performances with those of age-matched subjects.

    <description>Reactive inhibition refers to the ability of a subject to react to the stop instruction, and it is measured by the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). This variable cannot be measured, but it can be estimated by using the race model (21, 4, 16, 17, 18, 22).</description>

    <description>Proactive inhibition refers to the ability of subjects to shape their response strategy in anticipation of known task demands driven by endogenous signals. In the case of the countermanding task, the endogenous signal is represented by the awareness of the fact that sometimes an imperative stop-signal could have been presented. Proactive control could be assessed by measuring reaction times (i.e. the time to initiate a response, RTs) and movement times (i.e. the time to execute the motor response, MTs) of no-stop trials. Previous research has shown that when a movement is produced in the context of the countermanding task, that is when the subject executes a no-stop trial, its RT is lengthened (e.g. 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22) and its MT is shortened compared to situations in which the same movement has to be performed in the context of a simple RT-task (go-only trial; 4, 15, 17)</description>
