  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has completed the 16026A study and has received the last study treatment
             within 12 months of the screening visit for the present study.

          -  The patient has an MRI scan done in relation to study 16026A performed within 9 months
             before first study visit in the extension study.

          -  The patient has a knowledgeable and reliable caregiver/ study partner who will be
             available and able to accompany the patient to clinical visits, monitor
             Immunisation-Related Events after each immunisation, and participate with the patient
             at phone visits during the study

        Main exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient uses or has recently used (pre-trial time limits specified in Appendix II)
             disallowed concomitant medication or it is anticipated that the patient will require
             treatment with at least one of the disallowed concomitant medications (Appendix II)
             during the study.

          -  The patient has a disease or takes medication that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could interfere with the assessments of safety and tolerability

        More inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply
