  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in patients with ductal
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have failed only one prior line of systemic anti-cancer
      therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer and have measurable disease.

      Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      one of the following treatment arms (see figure below):

        -  Arm A (investigational arm): eryaspase in combination with either gemcitabine/Abraxane
           or irinotecan-based therapy (FOLFIRI [FOLinic acid-Fluorouracil-IRInotecan regimen] or
           Onivyde®/5 fluorouracil/leucovorin), or

        -  Arm B (control arm): gemcitabine/Abraxane or irinotecan-based therapy (FOLFIRI or
           Onivyde/5-FU/leucovorin)

      The chemotherapy will be investigator's choice and based on what patient has received in
      first line treatment. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or the patient's withdrawal of consent.

      An End of Treatment visit should occur within approximately 30 days from last dose of
      eryaspase or chemotherapy regimen.

      A survival follow-up period will include the collection of survival, progression of disease
      if applicable, treatment updates, and quality of life assessments every 8 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be eligible for the study if all the following criteria are met:

          1. Must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Must have histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

          3. Must have Stage III or IV disease (see APPENDIX 1).

          4. Must have received one line of systemic chemotherapy in the advanced setting with or
             without targeted agents, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy for treatment of advanced
             pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

          5. Must have radiological evidence of disease progression following most recent prior
             treatment, defined as appearance of any new lesion or increase of &gt;20% of one or more
             existing lesions.

          6. Must have measurable lesion(s) per RECIST version 1.1 by CT scan with contrast (or
             MRI, if the patient is allergic to CT contrast media).

               -  Measurable disease may be in the field of prior irradiation; however, at least 4
                  weeks must have elapsed between the completion of radiation therapy and the
                  baseline scan documenting disease status.

               -  Bone disease is considered radiologically measurable only if there is at least a
                  50% lytic component.

             NOTE: Bone disease consisting of blastic lesion only is not measurable.

          7. Archival or fresh tumor tissue must be available for evaluating relevant biomarkers.
             Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] block preferred, or a minimum of 10 unstained
             FFPE slides of one archived block is required.

             NOTE: Cytology samples from fine needle aspirates or brushing biopsies are not
             sufficient.

          8. Must have adequate performance status (see APPENDIX 2 and APPENDIX 3):

               1. ECOG Performance Status (PS) score of 0, or

               2. ECOG PS score one and score ≥80 on Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale.
                  NOTE: Must have body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5 kg/m2 (obtained &lt;14 days prior to
                  randomization.

          9. Must have life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks according to the investigator's clinical
             judgment.

         10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             additional negative pregnancy test prior to first dose. Males and females of
             childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception
             during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.
             These include, but not limited to:

             a. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
             with inhibition of ovulation:

             i. intravaginal

             ii. transdermal

             b. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:

             i. injectable

             ii. implantable

             c. intrauterine device (IUD)

             d. bilateral tubal occlusion

             e. vasectomised partner

             f. sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the
             entire period of risk associated with the study treatments) is intended. The true
             abstinence is when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]

             g. males with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use condoms

             NOTE: Since an indirect interaction between components of the oral contraceptives and
             ASNase cannot be ruled out, oral contraceptives are not considered acceptable as
             contraceptive methods in the current clinical trial. A method other than oral
             contraception should be used in women of childbearing potential.

             NOTE: All chemotherapeutic agents may be teratogenic and excreted in breast milk.
             Patients who are breast feeding should consider alternative methods.

         11. Must have adequate laboratory parameters at baseline (obtained &lt;14 days prior to
             randomization). Laboratory parameters outside of these ranges that are deemed
             clinically insignificant should be discussed with the medical monitor:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L.

               2. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL. Patients with a baseline Hemoglobin ≥13 g/dL should be
                  discussed with the medical monitor.

               3. Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L).

               4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) (≤5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases).

               5. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional ULN.

               6. Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2
                  for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional normal
                  range.

               7. Acceptable coagulation parameters: plasma antithrombin III &gt;70%, fibrinogen ≥1.5
                  g/L, international normalized ratio (INR) &lt;1.5, and partial thromboplastin time
                  (PTT) ≤ institutional ULN.

               8. Serum albumin ≥3.0 g/dL.

         12. Patients requiring biliary stent placement must have the biliary stent placed &gt;7 days
             prior to screening and must have normalization of bilirubin level after stenting.

         13. Must not be receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and must agree not to
             participate in any other interventional clinical studies during their participation in
             this trial while on study treatment. Patients taking part in surveys or observational
             studies are eligible to participate in this study.

         14. Must be able to understand and comply with the conditions of the protocol and must
             have read and understood the consent form and provided written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient is not eligible to participate in the study if any of the following criteria are
        met:

          1. Resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          2. Histology other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma (for example, but not inclusive:
             neuroendocrine, adenosquamous, etc.).

          3. More than one line of prior treatment in advanced or metastatic setting.

          4. Patient has experienced medically significant acute decline in clinical status

                  prior to randomization.

               2. Weight loss of ≥10% during screening.

          5. Presence of active or symptomatic untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

             NOTE: Patients with asymptomatic or stable CNS metastases are eligible, provided that
             the CNS metastases are radiologically and clinically stable, and the patient is off
             high-dose steroid treatment for at least one month prior to randomization.

          6. Prior radiotherapy to the only area of measurable disease. NOTE: Patients must have
             completed treatment and recovered from all acute treatment-related toxicities prior to
             administration of the first dose of eryaspase or chemotherapy.

          7. Bone as the only site of metastatic disease from pancreatic cancer (bone only

             with hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

             NOTE: Patients with unknown status of hepatitis B or C must be tested and declared
             negative before randomization.

         12. Hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapy or ASNase.

             NOTE: Patients known to be homozygous for UGT1A1*28 who are assigned to an
             irinotecan-containing regimen must have the initial irinotecan dose reduced unless
             they have previously tolerated full doses of irinotecan. Subjects whose UGT1A1 status
             is not known but are being considered for irinotecan-based chemotherapy must be
             screened for UGT1A1*28 allele unless they have previously tolerated full doses of
             irinotecan before enrollment into the trial and must have the initial irinotecan dose

             NOTE: Patients assigned to the irinotecan/5 FU arms in the study should not have
             dihydropyridine dehydrogenase deficiency (DPD). Patients whose DPD status is unknown
             at time of screening should be tested before enrollment in the irinotecan/5 FU arm
             unless they have previously tolerated full doses of 5 FU.

             randomization.

         14. History of other malignancies

             NOTE: Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or curatively treated in-situ cancer
             of the cervix may be eligible.

             NOTE: Patients successfully treated for other malignancies and are disease-free for at
             least 5 years may be eligible.
