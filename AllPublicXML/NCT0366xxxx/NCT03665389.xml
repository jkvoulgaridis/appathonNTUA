  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between fractional flow reserve
      (FFR) derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (FFRct) before transcatheter
      aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and FFR after TAVR so as to investigate whether FFRct is
      useful for evaluating myocardial ischemia of severe AS. Furthermore, by measuring the
      instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) which is a physiological diagnostic method of coronary
      artery stenosis before and after TAVR and comparing iFR (iFR before and after TAVR) and FFR
      (FFR after TAVR) with FFRct (FFRct before and after TAVR), It also aims to deepen
      understanding of resting coronary artery physiology in aortic valve stenosis.

      This is a single-center, open-label, exploratory, prospective study. Among patients who
      undergo coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) prior to TAVR, those with moderate or
      severe stenotic lesions will be included in the study. Patients from whom consent is obtained
      following TAVR will be enrolled in the study.

      Among patients who undergo TAVR at the Kobe University Hospital from September 2018 to March
      2022, those who are found to have moderate or severe stenosis on cCTA performed before
      surgery and judged to clinically require ischemia evaluation will be included in the study.
      At the time of pre-TAVR coronary angiogram, iFR (iFR before TAVR) will be measured. The cCTA
      data collected from patients whose consent is obtained following TAVR will be anonymized and
      sent to HeartFlow, Inc., where the FFRct（FFRct before TAVR) values will be calculated using
      their cardiovascular dynamics analysis program. FFR (FFR after TAVR) and iFR (iFR after TAVR)
      will be measured using a guide wire that is capable of sensing pressure after TAVR is
      performed. Furthermore, FFRct (FFRct after TAVR) is calculated from cCTA taken after TAVR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Among patients who have undergone cCTA prior to TAVR, those with moderate stenotic
             lesions (30 to &lt;70%) or severe stenotic lesions on CT who are candidates for
             percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) following TAVR

          2. Patients aged 20 years or older at the time of diagnosis

          2. Patients with stenosis of &gt;30% in the left main trunk who were implanted with at least
             one metal stent in the vessel(s) of the left coronary circulation,
