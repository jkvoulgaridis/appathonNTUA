      Magnesium sulfate is, generally, applied in order to alleviate or to avoid seizures. It can
      be administered according to many medical approaches. Nevertheless, at Rajavithi Hospital,
      the recommended administration of magnesium sulfate is 4 grams for loading dose in 15
      minutes, followed by 2 grams for maintenance dose per hour (Zudpan regimen). The therapeutic
      index of magnesium is in the range of 4.8-8.4 mg/dL. After that, the level of magnesium
      sulfate will be evaluated every 4 or 6 hours.

      At Rajavithi Hospital, there are a lot of patients having pre-eclampsia symptom and many
      patients, who were received magnesium sulfate in the treatment, having the level of magnesium
      sulfate lower than the therapuetic level and needed to increase the maintenance dose to 2.5
      grams/hour. Therefore, this work aims to studying the amount of magnesium sulfate
      administered to pregnant woman with pre-eclampsia symptom who possess high body mass index
      (BMI), especially for BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2.
