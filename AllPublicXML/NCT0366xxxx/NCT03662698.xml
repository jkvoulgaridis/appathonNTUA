    <textblock>
      The goal of this interdisciplinary pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability
      and preliminary efficacy of a guided imagery intervention to reduce RT-related symptoms of
      anxiety and depression in patients with HNC relative to treatment as usual.

      The goal of this interdisciplinary pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability
      and preliminary efficacy of a guided imagery intervention to reduce RT-related symptoms of
      anxiety and depression in patients with HNC relative to treatment as usual. Treatment as
      usual contains no psychological interventions to aid in distress, however participants will
      have access to the psychosocial supports at the cancer center available to all patients.
      Patients will be randomized to either condition, and surveys of their well-being will be
      conducted throughout the study.

    <description>GI is a relaxation technique involving the visualization of images and is considered an adjuvant cancer therapy.The GI intervention will include two hour-long meetings between the participant and a trained interventionist. The sessions will include direct, written, and audio delivery of one of three GI vignettes. The patient will be able to choose one of the three vignettes. The approximately twelve minute long vignettes included in the study will be: Taking a Walk, Healthy Cell Alliance for Treatment, and Daily Intention (32). Patients will also be given access to psychosocial support resources (i.e., clinical psychologists and social workers) at UCCC.</description>

Patients will also receive educational materials about RT including the process of RT and CT simulation, treatment side effects, pain management, and swallowing exercises. Participants in this condition will also have access to psychosocial support resources (i.e., clinical psychologists and social workers) at UCCC.</description>
