  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with acquired brain injuries have deficits in reading decoding, reading
      comprehension, and written expression. Alexia is a phenomenon in which a person who
      previously could read has trouble doing so after having sustained a brain injury; likewise,
      agraphia is an acquired writing problem affecting one or more aspects of written
      communication. Alexia and agraphia sometimes co-occur with one another and/or with other
      language challenges, but they can also occur as isolated phenomena. Methods to treat alexia
      and agraphia often focus on single intervention techniques that address aspects of reading or
      writing in isolationâ€”such as matching written and spoken letters or letter sounds, performing
      choral reading, tracing letters, etc. Existing research suggests that the effectiveness of
      these techniques is limited. However, when used in combination, such techniques may promote
      improved reading and written communication skills. As such, the purpose of this research is
      to determine the extent to which a multicomponent intervention program improves the reading
      and writing capabilities of people with acquired alexia and/or agraphia.
