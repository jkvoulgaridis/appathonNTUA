    <textblock>
      A non-interventional, prospective, open, multicenter study in Germany in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with, or are not considered
      candidates for, available therapies and with decision for treatment with
      trifluridin/tipiracil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this NIS, after market approval of trifluridin/tipiracil as treatment for mCRC
      patients who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for,
      available therapies, is to evaluate effectiveness, QoL, treatment details and safety of
      trifluridin/tipiracil treatment in a real-world setting. In addition, therapy management and
      health economic parameters regarding trifluridin/tipiracil treatment will be assessed.
