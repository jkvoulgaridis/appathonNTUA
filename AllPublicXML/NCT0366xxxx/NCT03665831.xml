  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will be examining the effects of the deep repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the H1 coil in patients over the age of 60
      diagnosed with mild to early-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have been unable to tolerate or failed
      to respond to antidepressant medications. The coil was designed to stimulate deeper regions
      of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Based on prior research, the
      investigators propose that active stimulation with the H1 coil for 4 weeks may result in
      significant remission rates and will be tolerable and safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of H1-coil dTMS in
      treating depression in MCI and mild AD patients over 60 years of age who have not tolerated
      or failed to respond to antidepressant medications. 28 patients will be assigned to receive 4
      consecutive weeks of daily active dTMS treatment. The long-term effects of treatment on
      emotional cognitive measures will be assessed at a 4-week follow-up visit (8 weeks from
      baseline). Symptom change and remission criteria will be assessed using the Montogmery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognition will be assessed using a validated
      neuropsychological battery.

      We will also offer patients to receive 4 weeks of treatment using theta-burst TMS, which is a
      milder version of TMS.

    <description>Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) is a new form of TMS which allows direct stimulation of deeper neuronal pathways than the standard TMS. The H-coil is a novel dTMS coil designed to allow deeper brain stimulation without a significant increase of electric fields induced in superficial cortical regions. dTMS will be administered daily for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>
