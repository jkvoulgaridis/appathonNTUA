  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum effective dose of the cysteine binding
      thiol drug (CBTD) Tiopronin on urine cystine capacity, which is a measure of cystine
      solubility in the urine, in patients with cystinuria to evaluate the effect of escalating
      doses of cystine binding thiol drugs on the cystine capacity of the urine. The overall goal
      will be to help guide therapy and ultimately minimize unnecessary side effects caused by
      larger dosages.

      Cystinuria is a rare genetic disease that can lead to significant morbidity in affected
      patients due to the recurrent nature of the disease. This study will follow the levels of
      urine cystine capacity in order to help guide treatment and to use lower than usually
      prescribed Tiopronin doses to decrease the potential side effects while maintaining
      therapeutic benefit. This will increase adherence with the medications by decreasing the
      burden of the large number of pills that need to be taken daily.
