  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants do not usually wear glasses because they usually do not need them to see clearly.
      Most infants are born with a moderate amount of farsightedness. Most infants then undergo a
      natural process called 'emmetropization' that reduces the amount of farsightedness. However,
      up to 10% of infants don't emmetropize and end up with very farsighted prescriptions.
      Farsighted infants must use extra focusing effort to see clearly, which may make their eyes
      cross and perhaps cause a &quot;lazy eye&quot;. If infants avoid this effort and their vision stays
      blurred into childhood, they may develop two lazy eyes. Farsightedness in school-aged
      children makes reading and learning more difficult. New studies in animals and in humans show
      that infant eyes will emmetropize best if they have just a normal, moderate amount of
      farsightedness. The infant eye must be in this normal target zone in order to emmetropize. If
      a baby were given glasses with the full prescription to correct all of his farsightedness,
      the eyes would also be out of the target zone and would not receive any signal to grow. The
      best strategy might be to give a partial spectacle correction for the farsightedness, just
      enough to put them in the zone that is most effective for emmetropization.

      The purpose of this project is to determine if emmetropization can be enhanced in very
      farsighted babies. We will give them glasses with a partial correction and accommodative (eye
      focusing) training. The partial correction is an amount that is less than their full degree
      of farsightedness but enough to put them in the zone of effective emmetropization. As changes
      in farsightedness occur, the power of the glasses will be reduced to keep the farsightedness
      within the target zone. If an infant reaches a normal amount of farsightedness, the glasses
      will be discontinued. The comparison group will be farsighted babies who receive the current
      standard of care, namely no correction. The main outcome of the study will be whether there
      is a significant difference in the decrease of farsightedness between the two groups when the
      infants are 18 months of age.

      If emmetropization can be enhanced in very farsighted babies, the risk of developing crossed
      or lazy eye will be reduced. The lifelong need for spectacles, contact lenses, or refractive
      surgery for high amounts of farsightedness would also be reduced. Positive results might also
      make infant eye examinations more common and place a new therapeutic option in clinicians'
      hands.

    <description>The subject's central refractive error will be measured (in Diopters) with cycloplegic retinoscopy to determine if partial refractive correction and accommodative training can enhance emmetropization in highly hyperopic infants. Successful enhancement is defined as being an average of 1.75 Diopters less hyperopic than control subjects at 18 months.</description>
