  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreasing donor chimerism is considered as an early sign of graft failure or relapse in
      patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The treatment option included
      tapering or stop of immunosuppression and or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which may
      restore a full donor chimerism but subsequent graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the major
      complications. In this single arm prospective study, the investigator evaluate the effect and
      safety of low-dose decitabine alone or with DLI in patients with decreased donor chimerism
      after allo-HSCT.

      Decreasing donor chimerism is considered as an early sign of graft failure or relapse in
      patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The treatment option included
      tapering or stop of immunosuppression and or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which may
      restore a full donor chimerism but subsequent GVHD is the major complications. In this single
      arm prospective study, the investigator plan to evaluate the effect and safety of low-dose
      decitabine treatment alone in patients with decreased donor chimerism after allo-HSCT. The
      investigators expect an overall response rate of 80% without serious toxicity such as grade
      III-IV aGVHD, ext cGVHD and lethal infection event associated with low-dose decitabine
      (LD-DAC) treatment. In case of donor chimerism decreasing, 5-day low-dose decitabine (5mg/m2)
      will given every 6 to 8 weeks until full donor chimerism is achieved (&gt;99%). Fast withdraw of
      immuno-suppression or stop of immunosupression is not carried out in the study.

In case of decreasing donor chimerism, patients will receive low-dose decitabine with 5mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 6-8 weeks until the chimerism recovered to full donor type (&gt;99%).</description>
