      The Duke research team will work with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and lead the design and
      implementation of a cluster-randomized trial in Northern Ghana to assess the impact of the
      Integrated Mothers and Babies Course &amp; Early Childhood Development (iMBC/ECD) intervention on
      the mental wellbeing of mothers of children under 2 and their children's attainment of
      age-appropriate developmental milestones.

      Maternal psychological disorders around the time of pregnancy and childbirth have been
      identified as a key risk factor for poor child development outcomes in growth, cognition, and
      overall child health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Maternal depression during
      a child's infancy predicts negative behavior and lower achievement scores, as well as
      increased absences in elementary school), and has been identified as a significant risk
      factor for poor infant growth in the developing world. There is considerable evidence to
      suggest that a community-based intervention, delivered by trained community volunteers, can
      have a significant impact on perinatal depression and child development outcomes. This
      cluster-randomized trial in Northern Ghana will assess the impact of the Integrated Mothers
      and Babies Course &amp; Early Childhood Development (iMBC/ECD) intervention on the mental
      wellbeing of mothers of children under 2 and their children's attainment of age-appropriate
      developmental milestones. In Ghana, the iMBC/ECD will be implemented in the context of the
      Rural Emergency Health Service and Transport project (REST II). A key activity of REST II is
      Community Pregnancy Surveillance and Targeted Education Sessions (C-PrES). Routine C-PrES is
      delivered via educational group sessions that promote the adoption of key Maternal, Neonatal
      and Child Health and Nutrition (MNCHN) behaviors (e.g. newborn care, exclusive breastfeeding,
      etc.) among pregnant women and mothers of children under age two.

    <intervention_model_description>The present study is a cluster randomized trial (CRT) of 32 program groups with 16 groups randomly assigned to receive the intervention program (iMBC/ECD + C-PrES) and 16 groups randomly assigned to receive the control program (C-PrES only).The main reason for including randomization is to reduce the risk of selection bias. The unit of inference for this CRT is at the individual level but the unit of randomization is the C-PrES group (cluster) level due to issues of program feasibility.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire:Social Emotional-2 (ASQ: SE-2) will be used to assess the attainment of age-appropriate social emotional development. The questionnaire that is administered is based on the child's age in completed months:
ASQ:SE 2 Month Questionnaire: 1 month 0 days - 2 months 30 days
ASQ:SE 6 Month Questionnaire: 3 month 0 days - 8 months 30 days
ASQ:SE 12 Month Questionnaire: 9 months 0 days - 14 months 30 days
ASQ:SE 18 Month Questionnaire: 15 months 0 days - 20 months 30 days
ASQ:SE 24 Month Questionnaire: 21 months 0 days - 26 months 30 days</description>

    <description>The Integrated Mothers and Babies Course/Early Childhood Development (iMBC/ECD) will be implemented along side normal C-PrES programming (key MNCHN behaviors). The iMBC curriculum is a prevention model based on cognitive behavioral therapy with the aim of supporting pregnant women and mothers with children under two years of age to become more resilient, decrease risk for future depression, and manage daily stressors effectively. In addition, the updated version of the iMBC is integrated with selected early childhood development (ECD) messages. The integration of these messages is intended to increase mothers' knowledge of the stressors associated with pregnancy and parenting young children and promote early stimulation behaviors and bonding to support child development.</description>
