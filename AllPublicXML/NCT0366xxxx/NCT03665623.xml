    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications in pregnancy that causes maternal death
      and preterm delivery, the incidence rate is about 5~10% in Chinese population. Series studies
      has show that multiple markers in early pregnancy has the potential to predict preeclampsia
      effectively but has show crowd difference. Since preeclampsia is a placental-derived disease,
      early prevention with aspirin and other intervention has the potential to &quot;treat&quot; the disease
      .Preeclampsia prediction will change the way doctors treat the disease and profoundly improve
      both the outcome of mother and the baby.

      The prospective multi-center observational study aimed to recruit at least 12,000 pregnant
      woman during the first trimester conducted among 21 medical centers in China. The medical
      history of each candidate was recorded , blood pressure was measured , blood sample was taken
      between 11 gestational weeks and 13+6 gestational weeks, to get the PlGF and PAPPA tested.
      Routine ultrasound was taken with measurement of the uterine artery pulsatility index. The
      results of the recruited patients were not released to the patients or the doctor. Pregnancy
      outcome was recorded as to whether the women develop preeclampsia , the SGA babies, or low
      birth Apgar score and other preeclampsia related adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The
      basic medical information, the mean artery pressure, the PlGF and PAPPA MOM, the UtA PI were
      used in combination to do the risk stratification, and to develop prediction model for
      Chinese people.
