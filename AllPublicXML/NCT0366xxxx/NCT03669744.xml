  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is defined according to the third edition of the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria. Chronic pain can have a major impact
      on the quality of life. First-line treatments are anti-epileptics, and surgical treatments
      are also possible according to several approaches. Sometimes the pain is resistant to these
      therapies. In this indication, sensory blocks may have a therapeutic impact but their place
      is not clear. In France, there are formalized expert recommendations on &quot;loco regional
      analgesia and chronic pain&quot;, from 2013. Several adjuvants to local anesthetics have been
      studied for acute and chronic pain. CLONIDINE and DEXAMETHASONE are of greatest interest in
      increasing block duration and reducing opioid consumption. The investigators report the case
      of 21 patients, treated by a trigeminal block from 2014 to 2018, suffering from a resistant
      trigeminal neuralgia. After a first consultation, the diagnosis is confirmed, an information
      is done and an appropriate support is established. The sensory block is performed as an
      outpatient care. It consists in a peri-neural injection of a mixture of LEVOBUPIVACAINE 5%,
      CORTIVAZOL 3.75mg / 1.5mL (or BETAMETHASONE 7mg / 1ml) and CLONIDINE (1μg / kg). Standard
      precautions are respected and patients are monitored in the recovery room after the
      procedure. The efficacity is evaluated before the exit and a follow-up is done within 15
      days. The level of satisfaction expressed by the patients seems to be globally high. The
      investigators wish to evaluate statistically the impact of the trigeminal blocks, in terms of
      improvement of the quality of life. This retrospective study, by its procedure, does not
      change the management of patients.

    <description>Percentage of patients with improvement of more than 50% in quality of life, mesured with the 'Medical Outcome Study Short Form 12', from baseline (day 0 = just before the block) to day 15. The questionnaire consists of 12 items questioned weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on twelve questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health.</description>
