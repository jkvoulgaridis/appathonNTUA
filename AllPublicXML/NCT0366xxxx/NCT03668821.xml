      An observational cohort study of the frailty of vascular surgery patients undergoing
      intervention and their outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular surgical operations are major procedures with significant associated morbidity and
      mortality. Frailty is a major factor influencing surgical outcome, but the effect on
      morbidity/mortality and quality of life is poorly understood in vascular surgery. Activity
      levels play a significant role in frailty and in pre-intervention preparation. It is
      anticipated that as frailty levels increase, activity levels decrease. It is hypothesised
      that vascular surgery patients suffer from a high prevalence of frailty and that increasing
      frailty will lead to increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life.

      This initial study will provide the foundations to identify targets for improvement in degree
      of frailty, appropriateness for surgery and outcome.

      This project aims to:

      Assess and quantify the prevalence of frailty as well as recording activity levels in the
      vascular surgery patient cohort Explore the impact of frailty and pre-op activity on surgical
      outcomes in the vascular surgical patient cohort to guide surgical treatments as well as
      future studies aimed at improving frailty and activity and thereby quality of life.

      Identification of an appropriate metric of frailty for this population group to include
      activity, is a secondary aim of this proposal.
