  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid challenge is often carried out in septic shock patients. Its responsiveness usually
      requires invasive monitoring. The pulmonary artery catheter(PAC) is the most effective means
      of monitoring.To use non-invasive methods is very tempting. Investigators hypothesize that
      venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference,venous-to-arterial carbon oxygen difference,
      central venous-arterial carbon dioxide to arterial-venous oxygen content ratio and Central
      Venous SO2 variations provides feasible estimation on fluid responsiveness in septic shock
      patients.

    <description>Patients (at least 18 years of age, no more than 75 years old) with refractory hypotension secondary to sepsis who, at the discretion of treating physicians, required fluid challenge in the presence of pulmonary artery catheter. Refractory hypotension was defined as need of vasopressors to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) no less than 90 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation.</description>
