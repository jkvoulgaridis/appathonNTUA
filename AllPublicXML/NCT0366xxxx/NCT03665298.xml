  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobile health interventions offer a longitudinal approach to reducing the burden of substance
      use disorders and may stem the rise of the opioid overdose epidemic. Smartphone applications
      are one of the most popular mobile phone features nationally, among patients in addiction
      treatment, and among criminal justice involved (CJI) patients enrolled in addiction
      treatment. This research conducted at Bellevue Hospital's inpatient detoxification program
      established attitudes and self-reported behaviors favorable to theoretical smartphone
      applications addressing opioid use, HIV, and HCV prevention and management strategies. This
      study aims to assess the feasibility and usability of a smartphone application to enhance
      access to sterile needles, naloxone overdose kits, and addiction treatment programs in New
      York City.
