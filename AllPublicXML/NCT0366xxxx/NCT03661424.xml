  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses bi-specific antibody (HER2Bi) armed activated T-cells (HER2 BATs) to target
      breast cancer cells that have metastasized to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal
      cord. This is known as leptomeningeal metastases. Two doses will be evaluated in order to
      determine a safe dose.

      Study treatment includes a test dose of HER2 BATs followed by 8 weekly infusions of HER2 BATs
      at the assigned dose level. Before, during and after study treatment, participants will be
      monitored objectively by brain MRIs and clinically through physical and neurological exams,
      and blood and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected to evaluate immune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via
      leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 to 4 weeks prior to the first BATs infusion. The
      white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins in order to
      activate the cells to multiply.

      After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and
      trastuzumab/Herceptin (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce
      bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to
      be infused.

      Up to 2 weeks following leukapheresis, participants will undergo surgery to place the
      catheter/reservoir into the lateral ventricle of the brain to allow intraventricular
      administration of HER2 BATs and a chemotherapy agent methotrexate. A few weeks later,
      participants will receive the intraventricular methotrexate in order to control disease while
      the BATs product is being manufactured. About 4-5 weeks following the leukapheresis and at
      least 7 days after receiving methotrexate, study treatment will begin with a test dose of
      HER2 BATs. If this dose is well tolerated by the participant, she will then receive 8 weekly
      doses of HER2 BATs at the assigned dose level.

For a subset of questions, the scale measures how much the symptoms interfered with other parts of life and the scale ranges from symptoms that &quot;Did Not Interfere&quot; (0) to those that &quot;Interfered Completely&quot; (10). Lower scores indicate fewer/less severe/less interfering symptoms and higher scores indicate more/more severe/more interfering symptoms.</description>
