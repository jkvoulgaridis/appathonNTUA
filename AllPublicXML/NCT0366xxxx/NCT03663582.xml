    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical study are to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of teduglutide in Japanese participants with short bowel syndrome (SBS)
      who are dependent on parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/IV) over a 24-week treatment
      period.

             disease) that resulted in at least 12 continuous months of parenteral
             nutrition/intravenous (PN/IV) dependence at the time of informed consent.

          4. Parenteral nutrition requirement of at least 3 times per week during the week before
