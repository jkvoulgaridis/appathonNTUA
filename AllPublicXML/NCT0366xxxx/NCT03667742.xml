  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sweat proteins are analysed to investigate differences in protein markers in patients with
      acute tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases (pneumonia, Bronchitis, chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD)) and healthy individuals. Differences in sweat protein markers in
      patients with positive and negative tuberculosis Enzyme-linked-immuno-Spot (EliSpot) are
      investigated.

      Differences in sweat protein markers in the course of treatment in patients receiving
      tuberculostatic therapy are investigated.
