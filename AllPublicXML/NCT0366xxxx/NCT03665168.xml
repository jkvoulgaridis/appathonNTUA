  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A nationwide, cross-sectional study, to determine the prevalence of symptoms of patients in
      the palliative phase in various care settings will be performed within a set period of two
      weeks in September 2018 and two weeks in November 2018. The participating settings will be
      selected by a total of seven coordinators, one for each consortium of palliative care in the
      Netherlands. To identify common combinations of symptoms and for multidimensional screening
      the Utrecht Symptom Diary-4 Dimensional (USD-4D) and Utrecht Symptom Diary (USD), a Dutch
      instrument based on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, will be used. The current protocol
      focuses on the cross-sectional study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Utrecht Symptom Diary-4 dimensional (USD-4D), a Dutch instrument based on the Edmonton
      Symptom Assessment Scale, will be used for multidimensional screening and assessment of
      intensity and prevalence of symptoms. The questionnaire assesses twelve symptoms: pain,
      sleeping problems, dry mouth, dysphagia, anorexia, constipation, nausea, dyspnoea, fatigue,
      anxiety, depressed mood and confusion. This is measured on a numeric scale from 0 (no
      complaints) to 10 (worst imaginable or intolerable).

      The prevalence of symptoms will be described by frequencies, dichotomizing symptom scores in
      absent (0 on NRS) or present (1 or higher on NRS). Symptom scores of 4 or higher on NRS are
      considered clinically relevant.

      There is a possibility to add two more complaints not enlisted and to prioritise the problems
      which should be addressed first by the HCP.

      Quality of life is assessed using a (un)well-being measure and the opportunity to score the
      experienced value of life.

      Finally, five multidimensional questions will screen for mental capacity (&quot;draagkracht&quot;), the
      relationship with loved ones and thoughts concerning end of life. These multidimensional
      questions will be filled out together with the HCP. Therefore the HCP decides beforehand
      whether those questions will be asked.

      The USD-4D will be filled out only once by participating patients without follow-up. The
      patients will be asked to fill out the following characteristics: age, gender, education
      level, cultural background, living situation, underlying disease, comorbidities, performance
      score, medication groups and interventions.

      The estimated time to fill out both questionnaires is fifteen to twenty-five minutes.

    <description>For each symptom assessed (pain, sleeping problems, dry mouth, dysphagia, anorexia, constipation, nausea, dyspnoea, fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood and confusion) we will ask patients to score how they feel. In a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10 that fits best to their experienced intensity of complaints. Zero represents 'no complaint at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst (pain, nausea, etc.) ever possible'.</description>

    <description>Five multidimensional theses will screen for mental capacity, the relationship with loved ones and thoughts concerning end of life. The following theses are presented:
I have the chance to be myself
I can bear what happens to me
I can let go of my loved ones
I am living a balanced life
Thoughts at the end of life gives me peace of mind
In a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10 that fits best to their experienced feeling. Zero represents 'totally agree' whereas the upper limit represents 'totally disagree'. These values will be descriptive, a higher or lower value is not necessarily a better or worse outcome.</description>
