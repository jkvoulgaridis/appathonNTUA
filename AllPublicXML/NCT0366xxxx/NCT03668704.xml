      The purpose of the study is to determine the survivorship, patient satisfaction and clinical
      outcomes of robotic-arm assisted medial bicompartmental knee arthroplasty using the MCK
      implant system starting at two years post-operative and continuing for five, seven and ten
      years post-operative.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients over 21 years of age who underwent robotic-arm assisted medial
             bicompartmental arthroplasty by the investigating surgeon and received MCK implants
             and are at least 24 months post-operative.

          -  Patient has signed an IRB approved Informed Consent Form or with IRB approved waiver
             of written signed consent, patient has verbally consented to study participation.

          -  Patient is willing to comply with follow up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if they are cognitively
             unable to answer questions related to their index procedure and health quality of life
             forms.

          -  Patient had active infection

          -  Implants were implanted without bone cement

          -  Patients did not have sufficient bone stock to allow for insertion and fixation of
             components

          -  Patient did not have sufficient soft tissue integrity to allow for stability

          -  Patient had a neurological or muscular deformity that did not allow for control of the
             knee.
