  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase III clinical
      study. Target population is patients with stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer who
      had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety
      of SHR-1210 + carboplatin + paclitaxel with placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel in study
      population in China. SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.

      In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept
      study treatment. Subjects who randomized into control will have the opportunity to receive
      cross over treatment of SHR-1210 monotherapy after confirmed disease progression. Treatment
      cycles of chemotherapy will be 4-6 which will be decided by investigators.
