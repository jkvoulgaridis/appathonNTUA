  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate equipment for lifelong health is essential to ensure healthy health for fetal
      development. In France, pregnant women with normal weight have increased protein intake to
      0.78-0.95g / kg / day (ANC 2001). And more recently, AFSSA from 2007 proposed a recommended
      nutritional intake of 0.82-1g / kg / d. An increased requirements in the second and third
      trimester of 0.25 g / kg / day and 0.46 g / kg / day, respectively, compared with
      non-pregnancy values. However, the prevalence of the incompatibility remains unknown.

      In addition, maternal protein intake is inadequate or excessively associated with both
      intra-uterine growth retardation and small gestational age weights. Neonatal hypotrophy is
      also associated with a risk of chronic diseases in adulthood, including cardiovascular
      disease, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, high blood pressure and coronary heart disease.

      In obese women or patients undergoing surgery for bariatric surgery, there is currently no
      recommendation on the recommended protein intake. Or, maternal obesity plays a role in the
      metabolic development of children and bariatric surgery is associated with a major risk of
      maternal micronutrient deficiencies and intra-uterine growth retardation.

      Prevalence of obesity in France is currently estimated at 17%. Moreover, bariatric surgery is
      also fast-growing in France with a number of interventions having tripled since 2006.

      Thus, a better understanding of maternal food needs and applications throughout pregnancy is
      needed to improve dietary guidelines and promote fetal, neonatal and long-term health.

      The main objective is to evaluate the protein intake of the pregnant woman in the 3rd
      trimester of pregnancy in 3 populations:

        -  Women with BMI ≥ 18.5 and &lt;30 kg / m² (group 1)

        -  Obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg / m²) (group 2)

        -  Women operated on a bariatric surgery (group 3)
