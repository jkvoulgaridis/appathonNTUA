  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if playing a newly developed videogame that
      requires physical activity (e.g. exergame), leads to increased physical activity and health
      benefits in children and adolescents who do not regularly participate in endurance training.
      Health benefits will be expressed in physical fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), blood
      markers of a healthy heart, body composition and objectively measured physical activity.
      Gaming frequency of the participants will be registered throughout the 24 week intervention
      period.
