  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      laparotomy benign gynecological surgery is the most common gynecologic operation worldwide
      because is major operation for surgery and can affect to bowel movement after operation and
      turn to postoperative ileus , clinically severe postoperative ileus affects up to 14% of
      patients after laparotomy for gynecologic surgery that leaded to more complication, slowly
      recovery , prolong length of hospitalized stay and consequently increase unnecessary cost of
      treatment.

      Preclinical studies has considered to use preventative therapeutic options for prevent ileus
      including coffee

      The investigators used the coffee reduces postoperative ileus However, no good quality of
      evidence base supports the effectiveness coffee (with or without caffeine) ingestion and
      water for reducing the duration of Postoperative ileus after Laparotomy of Benign
      Gynecological Patients
