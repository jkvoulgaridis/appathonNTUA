    <textblock>
      This study investigate CT images of patients with spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric
      artery dissection (SISMAD). The investigators also further analyze the CT morphological
      differences between different options, aiming to determine &quot;alarming CT character&quot; during
      initial conservative treatment.

    <textblock>
      57 Patients with SISMAD from Oct 2011 to Jan 2018 in investigator's hospital were included in
      this research. The investigators collected relevant clinical data and further investigated
      the CTA characters of both true lumen and false lumen. SMA angle, distance between entry site
      of dissection and SMA root were also measured.
