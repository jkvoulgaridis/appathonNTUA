  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing
      dialectical behavior therapy DBT for adolescents with bipolar disorder in an outpatient
      mental health clinic. In collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, this study will
      measure study therapists' knowledge of the DBT model, adherence to the treatment model, and
      satisfaction with the treatment model.

    <textblock>
      This study proposes to implement dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for adolescents with
      bipolar disorder (BD) in an outpatient mental health clinic serving youth with bipolar
      spectrum disorders. In collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, this study will
      systemically operationalize, implement, and examine the specific training, supervision, and
      programmatic systems needed to successfully implement and sustain the intervention in an
      adherent manner to achieve positive patient outcomes. This study therefore presents a unique
      opportunity to enhance understanding of the necessary procedures for implementing the
      treatment in the community, while allowing us to examine effectiveness of the intervention at
      the community level.

      Aim 1: To examine the short- and longer-term feasibility and acceptability of a training
      program in DBT for adolescents with BD through clinician satisfaction ratings.

      Aim 2: To examine the short- and longer-term effects of the training on practitioner
      knowledge and performance, and patient outcomes.

    <description>Tapes will be rated for adherence using the DBT Adherence Rating scale. The scale generates a Global Score of DBT adherence and subscale scores for the 12 DBT strategy domains. To examine sustained adherence, each therapist will submit 3 consecutive sessions for adherence coding. The rating scale is not available to the public and is utilized by the DBT-Linehan Board of Certification (copyright).

    <intervention_name>Dialectical behavioral therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>DBT will be conducted over 1 year, and divided into two modalities: skills training, conducted in 60 minute biweekly family meetings and individual therapy conducted in 60 minute biweekly sessions. Family skills training proceeds as follows: psychoeducation about DBT and bipolar disorder, mindfulness skills, emotion regulation skills, distress tolerance skills, interpersonal skills, and walking the middle path skills. Individual therapy sessions aim to aid the adolescent in applying skills in their daily lives. We adopt the standard DBT hierarchy of treatment targets, whereby the individual therapist selects behaviors to focus on based on the following priorities: 1) decreasing life-threatening behaviors, 2) decreasing therapy-interfering behaviors, 3) decreasing quality-of-life interfering behaviors, and 4) increasing behavioral skills. Therapists will be available to participants and their participating family members by cell phone for in-vivo skills coaching between sessions.</description>
