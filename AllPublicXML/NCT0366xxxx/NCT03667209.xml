  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of pain neuroscience education and neck/shoulder
      traditional exercises versus pain neuroscience education and neck/shoulder suspension
      training exercises for patients with chronic idiopathic neck pain (CINP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate that 66 patients with chronic idiopathic neck pain will be
      randomized to receive pain neuroscience education and shoulder/neck traditional exercises
      (n=33) or pain neuroscience education and shoulder/neck suspension exercises (n=33). Data on
      pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), pain disability, neck flexor and extensor muscles
      endurance, scapulae stabilizers endurance, pain catastrophizing (Pain catastrophizing Scale),
      trait and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and knowledge of pain neurophysiology
      (Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire) will be collected. Measurements will be taken before,
      after the intervention and at 3 months follow up.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.
