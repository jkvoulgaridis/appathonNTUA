  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, cancer incidence increases over the course of life and therefore it is considered
      as an important pathology of the elderly. Cancers are the second leading cause of death for
      patients over 70 years old.

      In 2015, 233,343 new cases of cancer were estimated for patients of 65 years and over (60.9%
      of estimated cancers of all ages), 42,547 new cases for older people over 85 years old (about
      11% of all diagnosed cancer cases).

      With the expected aging of the population in the coming years, the number of patients over
      the age of 70 will continue to increase. Life expectancy will also increase (12 years for the
      people above 75 years old and more than 8 years for the people above 80 years old).

      The elderly are a heterogeneous population. Some people age well with few chronic diseases
      and a preserved autonomy. Others have several pathologies, geriatric syndromes (malnutrition,
      functional disorders, sensory deficits or psycho-cognitive diseases). Poly-medication is
      therefore common with an increased risk of iatrogenic disease. All these factors, in addition
      to social and economic conditions, determine the health status of the elderly. The presence
      of comorbidities decreases life expectancy and may itself be a contraindication to treatment.
      Patients in this age group are therefore particularly exposed to the risks of over- or
      under-treatment.

      The multidisciplinary team meeting (RCP) is widely used for decision making in oncology.
      Various official texts govern it (Plan Cancer, HAS). However, the onco-geriatric decision is
      usually only a complementary opinion after a RCP of a specific organ.

      Since 2006, the E. Herriot Hospital's Multidisciplinary team meeting has been organized to
      discuss cases of patients over 70 years old. The specificity is the association of a real
      multidisciplinary geriatric oncology discussion. The latter between medical specialist :
      geriatrician, oncologist, surgeon, radiotherapist, pharmacist, onco-geriatric nurse allows
      the development of an appropriate individualized therapeutic project for the patient.

      The onco-geriatric multidisciplinary team is implementing a descriptive study of the RCP for
      the management of patients above 70 with cancer. The Regional Network of Oncology
      Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is a partner.

      The main aim is to describe the feasibility of the assessment of the follow-up of
      onco-geriatric recommendations 4 months after the onco-geriatric RCP of E. Herriot Hospital
      concerning patients with or with suspicion of cancer.

      The secondary aims are : 1/ To describe the process of RCP: participants, patient's
      characteristics and conclusions with recommendations, 2/ To assess the implementation of
      oncological and geriatric recommendations 4 months after RCP 3/ To assess the survival,
      autonomy and quality of life of patients 4 months after RCP.

      The hypothesis is that onco-geriatric RCP's recommendations improve the outcome for the
      patient.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to ensure that the assessment of the recommendations'
      follow-up at 4 months is feasible.

    <description>After inclusion, patient's results are discussed at a weekly onco-geriatric multidisciplinary team meeting including surgeons, geriatrics, oncologists, radiotherapist, nurse, pharmacist. Oncological and geriatric recommendations are given.
A phone call is made to the patient to evaluate the follow-up of the oncological and geriatric recommendations defined during the RCP along with their survival, autonomy and quality of life.</description>
