      The concordance of the current research is that muscle relaxants can improve the conditions
      of laryngeal mask incubation and reduce the related complications (such as laryngeal spasm
      and postoperative throat pain ) of laryngeal mask incubation. It is necessary to use muscle
      relaxants in laryngeal mask incubation under non-special circumstances. However, the dosages
      of muscle relaxants used in various researches vary greatly of normal endotracheal
      intubation. Previous studies have shown that the amount of muscle relaxant required for
      laryngeal mask intubation is smaller than that required for endotracheal intubation. Although
      the dosage of muscle relaxant required for tracheal intubation can ensure the smooth
      insertion of laryngeal mask airway, laryngeal mask airway is mostly used for short surgery,
      which is prone to postoperative muscle relaxation residue and prolongs the recovery. We
      planning use the most classical method for determining the ED50 or half effective
      concentration of cis-atracurium using sequential method, which is also called &quot; up and down
      method&quot; and &quot; ladder method&quot;.

    <description>The evaluation criteria of laryngeal mask insertion conditions are based on siva lingam's six-point three-level table, which is evaluated from the following six aspects: the degree of mouth opening, difficulty in laryngeal mask insertion, cough, retch, laryngeal spasm, and body movement. Each item is divided into 3, 2 and 1 points according to the degree of severity, with a full score of 18 points, 16 points and above being satisfactory, and 16 points and below being unsatisfactory.</description>
