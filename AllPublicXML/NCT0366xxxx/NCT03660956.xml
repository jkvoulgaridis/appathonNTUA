  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is most common occupational health problem among nurses. Therefore, how
      to prevent and reduce low back pain have been the important issue for nurses. A
      Quasi-Experimental design is used in this study to compare the effectiveness of 12-week
      exercise and counselling program to reduce low back pain in nursing personnel compared with
      counselling alone.

      A Quasi-Experimental design is used in this study. Purposive sampling is used to recruit
      participants from medical center in Central Taiwan. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      two groups: (1) exercise and back counselling, and (2) back counselling only. The results of
      this study will provide a guideline for nurses to prevent and to improve low back pain.
