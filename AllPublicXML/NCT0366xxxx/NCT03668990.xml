  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has 3 aimes:

        1. To investigate the feasibility of using IMUs (Xsens, MVN Studio) during functional tasks
           to assess upper limb kinematics in pwMS and stroke survivors. On the one hand, the
           feasibility of performing the tasks will be investigated . On the other hand, does the
           XSens give valuable data?

        2. To investigate the discriminative validity of kinematic measurements of upper limb
           movements post-stroke and pwMS in comparison with gender and age-matched healthy
           controls

        3. To investigate the test-retest reliability of the kinematic parameters collected during
           the different functional tasks in pwMS and stroke survivors

      It is a cross-sectional case-controlled observational study, with 3 different groups: 25
      Persons with Multiple sclerosis, 25 stroke patients and 50 healthy controls, matched by age
      and gender.

    <description>The data received of the IMU's are the angles of point task achievement (PTA). PTA is defined as the instant when the ROM, needed for successful task execution, was achieved. Different joint angles of PTA will be calculated by MVN BIOMECH software. Matlab (software version R2016b) and excel will be used to process the data.</description>

    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the clinimetric characteristics of the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS). This scale evaluates motor impairment of the trunk after stroke. The TIS scores, on a range from 0 to 23, static and dynamic sitting balance as well as trunk co-ordination. It also aims to score the quality of trunk movement and to be a guide for treatment.</description>
