  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to help manage chronic pain in cancer survivors through Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT) after undergoing active cancer treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and/or
      radiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study attempts to apply effective pain management interventions from other chronic pain
      populations to those of cancer related populations. It will assess the ability of ACT to
      alleviate chronic cancer related pain and evaluate ease of implementation of treatment.
      Patients will be allocated to either the intervention group (ACT) or the control group,
      getting them the usual course of treatment.

    <description>Intervention group participants will attend eight weekly, 90-minute, in person, group-based ACT sessions. Groups will be initiated with no more than 10 participants and no fewer than 6 participants. Sessions will include key theoretical ACT constructs and strategies as they relate to chronic pain. A licensed clinical psychologist or licensed clinical social worker trained in ACT will facilitate all sessions. Participants in the ACT intervention group will also continue to receive medication management and other behavioral management interventions that they would get as usual treatment.</description>
