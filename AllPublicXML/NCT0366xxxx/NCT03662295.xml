  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy—also known as SMART syndrome—constitute
      a rare condition typically characterized by headache, seizures, vision abnormalities,
      hemiparesis, and aphasia. The condition usually resolves within a few days or weeks of onset
      with no residual impairments. However, resolution in some cases extends over a period of
      months rather than weeks and may be incomplete. The purpose of this case report is to provide
      an in-depth description of the progression of changes in cognitive and language functioning
      for a person exhibiting SMART syndrome characterized by slow recovery.

        One adult with SMART syndrome will participate in this study. The person will have
        cognitive and language deficits typical of those exhibited by people with SMART syndrome.
        Given the rarity of the disorder, only one participant is anticipated.
