  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective cohort study to explore the mechanisms underlying the HIV risk
      associated with pharmacologic doses of exogenous sex hormones via hormonal contraceptives
      specially progestin-containing hormonal contraception (HC). The study seeks to test that HC
      induce immunologic changes capable of altering HIV susceptibilities, that these effects will
      vary by contraceptive type, and that they will be modified by the vaginal microenvironment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging data suggests that certain hormonal contraceptives may induce mucosal and systemic
      immune changes that could increase the risk of infection with HIV. While several studies have
      aimed to characterize immunologic changes in women using hormonal contraceptives, the nature
      and the magnitude of these immune changes have not been adequately defined due to limitations
      in study design rigor, and small and statistically underpowered sample sizes.

      The study will prospectively recruit cohorts of HIV-uninfected women initiating hormonal
      contraception to characterize systemic and lower genital tract innate and adaptive
      immunologic changes that occur over the course of 1 year. This study will test the
      overarching hypothesis that hormonal contraceptives induce systemic and mucosal immune
      changes capable of altering susceptibilities and/or responses to diseases including HIV
      infection, and that these effects vary markedly in nature and magnitude by contraceptive type
      and will be modified by the vaginal microenvironment. The main aim is to determine the
      immunologic alterations in female genital and systemic immune profile associated with depot
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), Etonogestrel implant (Eng-Implant) and Levonorgestrel IUD
      (Lng-IUD).

    <description>Using Fortessa flow cytometer and Luminex, effector memory Cluster Differentiation 4 (CD4) + Thymocytes (T) cells will be analyzed for surface expression of HIV coreceptors cell surface receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and reported as percent of total leukocytes and CD4+ T-cells. The cytometry will use the cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) collected by cervicovaginal lavage (CVL).This test will characterize the alterations in female genital and systemic immune profiles associated with three long-acting progestin-only Hormonal Contraception.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 3 (pre contraception) and 3, 6, and 12 months (post contraception)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nugent Score is a Gram stain scoring system for vaginal swabs to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus morphotypes; decrease in Lactobacillus scored as 0 to 4), small Gram-variable rods (Gardnerella vaginalis morphotypes; scored as 0 to 4), and curved Gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes; scored as 0 to 2). A score of 7 to 10 is consistent with bacterial vaginosis without culture.</description>

    <measure>Percent of expression of 16S rRNA gene sequencing among the three intervention groups pre and post contraception</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 3 (pre contraception) and 3, 6, and 12 months (post contraception)</time_frame>
    <description>16 Svedberg ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) is the component of the 30 Svedberg ribosomal RNA (30S rRNA) small subunit of a prokaryotic ribosome that binds to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The genes coding for it are referred to as 16S rRNA gene and are used in reconstructing phylogenies. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis can better identify poorly described, rarely isolated, or phenotypically aberrant strains, can be routinely used for identification of mycobacteria, and can lead to the recognition of novel pathogens and uncultured bacteria.The term 16S refers to how it settles to when centrifuged (it's called a sedimentation rate, and it's measured in Svedberg (S) units).</description>
