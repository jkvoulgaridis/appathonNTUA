      The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of ethnicity, central obesity and
      dietary components, on the human gut microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that these
      factors have an influence on the composition of the gut microbiome. Healthy subjects (n=35)
      provided stool samples for gut microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing and completed a
      dietary questionnaire. The serum samples were assayed for a panel of inflammatory cytokines.
      Their associations with central obesity were examined.

      Introduction: Perturbance in the composition of human gut microbiota has been associated with
      metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. The objectives
      of this study are to examine the effects of ethnicity, central obesity and dietary
      components, on the human gut microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that these factors
      have an influence on the composition of the gut microbiome.

      Methods: Subjects of Chinese (n=14), Malay (n=10) or Indian (n=11) ancestry, median age 39
      (range:22-70 years old), were enrolled. The subjects provided stool samples for gut
      microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing and completed a dietary questionnaire. The
      serum samples were assayed for a panel of biomarkers (Interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor
      alpha, adiponectin, cleaved cytokeratin 18, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and limulus
      amebocyte lysate). Central obesity was defined by waist circumference cut-offs in Asians.
