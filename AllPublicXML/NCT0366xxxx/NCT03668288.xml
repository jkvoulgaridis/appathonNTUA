  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) represent more than 150 diseases affecting the immune
      system. More than 50% of PIDs are due to a lack or an insufficiency in antibody production.
      Some of these immunodeficiencies as well as some secondary immune deficiency with deficient
      antibody production (especially in hematology and oncology) are responsible for repeated
      and/or severe infections, requiring long-term replacement therapy with intravenous polyclonal
      immunoglobulin. Intravenous replacement therapy is administered every 21 or 28 days in
      hospital. Subcutaneous administration (weekly or bi-weekly) can be initiated for patients who
      cannot tolerate intravenous infusions or who have difficult venous access. However, some
      patients experience a decrease in quality of life with these more frequent administration at
      home. A new treatment is available in France since 2017, which is a subcutaneous infusion of
      human immunoglobulin facilitated by recombinant human hyaluronidase (IGHy), administered
      every 3 to 4 weeks in a single abdominal site, at home. No direct data are available in
      adults to evaluate tolerance and satisfaction with this treatment, but we know it is a
      preferred option in children and adolescents.

      The objective of the study is to describe the continuation of the human
      immunoglobulin-assisted recombinant human hyaluronidase (IGHy) therapy at 6 months from the
      start of treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with human
      immunoglobulin-assisted recombinant human hyaluronidase (IGHy) therapy.

    <description>quality of life assessed by the SF-36. The Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36v2) is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 36-items measuring eight dimensions of general HRQOL: physical functioning (10 items), role limitation due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and general mental health (5 items). In addition to scores for individual dimensions, two summary scores assessing physical and mental dimensions of health and well-being can also be calculated: Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score, respectively</description>
