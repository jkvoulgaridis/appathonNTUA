    <textblock>
      This study focuses on reduction of X-rays dose applied to eye's lens during cranial CT in
      children. Principal objective is to analyse the efficiency of ocular bismuth masks, which are
      associated with an eye's lens dose modulation

    <textblock>
      Eye's lens radiosensitivity represents an important subject of investigation in radiology.
      Indeed, eye's lens is recognised as one of the most radiosensitive organs in human body.[1,2]
      Radiation induced cataracts represent a determining effect of ionising radiations and has
      been widely studied. &quot;International Commission for Radiological Protection&quot; has evaluated
      cataract appearance threshold at 15 Gy in 1977 &quot;,[3] then at 8 Gy [4] and 5 Gy in 2007.[5]
      Finally, in 2011 new studies gave rise to a new limit of appearance of 0.5 Gy. Eye's lens
      radiosensitivity seems to have been underestimated for several years and so there is a
      significant improvement to be made in radioprotection in order to protect to the best of the
      investigator's ability both patient and manipulator. This was also confirmed by the Directive
      EURATOM 2013/59 (which is in the process of being transposed in French legislation)[6] that
      reduces legal limit dose delivered to eye's lens from 150mSv to20mSv, for categories A
      workers.

      This study is performed on 4 sequential groups, of ten patients, whereby one control group
      without ocular protection added. Other groups benefit either from a bismuth ocular
      protection, from a dose modulation applied to the eye's lens, or from both techniques
      associated. For each group, experiment is then focused on dose received by the eye's lens
      (measured using TLD detectors) as well as on Image quality obtained. Currently, there is no
      recommendation regarding lens protection for patient who benefit of a head tomodensitometry.
      Some practices are already used routinely but without a critical analysis of a comparison of
      their respective benefits.
