  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will fully develop and implement an interactive text messaging intervention system
      for individuals sentenced to DTC. Upon completion of programming and testing of messages the
      investigators will enroll 40 participants and randomize participant to a control condition
      (TAU Group) or the intervention condition (TXS Group). Assessments will occur at enrollment,
      and day 30 follow up.

      This study builds on pilot work in which Live Inspired LLC and research partners, have a
      history of collaboration in the development, revision, and evaluation of web-based and mobile
      phone technologies to promote behavior change. For this project the investigators will fully
      develop and implement an interactive text messaging intervention system for individuals
      sentenced to DTC who are entering the program, at which time participants are expected to
      begin addressing underlying issues related to their addiction, and during which time
      participants are highly vulnerable to relapse and noncompliance with mandated activities.
      Outcomes will include participation in and compliance with Court-mandated appointments,
      abstinence from drug use (measured by urine testing), participation in substance abuse
      treatment, participation in education/employment training programs, and participation in
      related programs and workshops as directed by the Court. Data will be collected directly from
      Court records using a database established by the participating courts for this study.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm (TXS) of the study will receive care as usual within the Drug Treatment Court (DTC) system plus supportive daily text messages which will be delivered at specific times each day for 30 days and will be signed by the judge for their specific DTC.

    <intervention_name>TXS- Supportive Text Group</intervention_name>
    <description>TXS participants will receive one treatment supportive text message each day for 30 days.These messages will address three domains 1) Recovery oriented messages, 2) Avoiding relapse and sanctions,and 3) Commitment to family, community and the Drug Treatment Court program. After receiving each text message, participants will receive a second message asking them to reply with a rating of how helpful the original message was. Ratings will use a 5-point Likert scale,ranging from 1-not at all helpful to 5-extremely helpful. Participants will also be asked to describe, via text message, what they liked or did not like about the original message, and suggest a better message for those they did not like.</description>
