  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to determine whether oral dosing, up to 9 grams/day, of
      porous silica administered as a food additive can be used safely in normal weight and obese
      male humans, without significant side effects on gastrointestinal function, bowel emptying
      habits, and biomarkers.

      This single blinded safety study will consist of two study arms and include 10 males each
      (18-35 years). One arm will include participants with normal weight and one with obesity.
      After a placebo run-in period, all subjects will be given porous silica three times daily,
      with increasing dose up to 9 grams/day (Phase 1). Subjects with obesity continued the study
      with highest dose for additional 10 weeks (Phase 2).

      The participants will have weekly contacts during with the representative for the study (PI
      or other research staff). Clinical examinations, and blood sampling will be performed day 1,
      7, 14, and 21. Faeces and morning urinary sampling day 1, and 21. Information regarding
      eating habits, sleep patterns, living conditions and gastrointestinal health were obtained
      from written forms and orally. If gastrointestinal adverse events would occur after increased
      dosage, the study staff will adapt the dosage protocol to facilitate adherence.
