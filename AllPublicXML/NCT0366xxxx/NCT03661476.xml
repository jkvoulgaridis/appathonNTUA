  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In childhood strabismus, exotropia is most frequently seen with intermittent exotropia and
      convergence failure in the first decade of life. This situation adversely affects children's
      psychosocial development and creates worries about personal relationships and work life in
      their future lives. Patients' hesitant attitudes towards surgical treatment led to the
      out-of-surgery techniques such as exercise therapy. No studies have been found in the
      literature on the efficancy of the intermittent exotropia treatments with oculo-motor
      exercises. In our study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of oculo-motor exercises on
      intermittent exotropia in children.

      50 volunteer school-aged children between 2-17 years of age) were included in our study.
      Oculo-motor home exercise protocols were given to all participants for 2 sessions per day for
      6 weeks, and regular phone calls were made once a week. Participants were assessed
      cycloplegic refraction by autorefractometry, corrected and uncorrected visual acuity by
      snellen chart, ocular motility test, near and distant alternating prism cover test, streopsis
      test and patient satisfaction levels by intermittent exotropia survery.

    <description>Oculomotor Exercises (OME); The saccadic eye movement exercise included moving the eyes horizontally between two stationary targets while keeping the head still.
The smooth pursuit exercise included moving the target horizontally and tracking it with the eyes while keeping the head still.
The adaptation X1 exercise included moving the head horizontally while keeping the stationary target in focus.
The adaptation X2 exercise included moving the head and target in opposite directions horizontally while tracking the target with the eyes.</description>
