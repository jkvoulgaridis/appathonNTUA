      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of cabozantinib, at different doses, in
      combination with cetuximab to find out what effects, if any, this combined treatment has on
      people with HNSCC.

    <description>from 3 testing dose levels: 20, 40, and 60. Three patients will be enrolled at the dose level 0 of 40 mg. The dose escalation scheme is as follows:
If none of the initial three patients at a given dose level experience DLT within 4 weeks, the next dose level will be studied.
If one of the initial three patients at a given dose level experiences DLT, three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation will continue only if there is no additional DLT observed.If two or more patients experience DLT at a given dose, the previous dose level will be studied. Should two or more patients experience the DLT at the lowest dose level (20 mg), the study will be halted, and alternative dosing will be considered.
4. The highest dose level with no more than one DLT among six patients will be declared as the MTD. If only three patients were treated at a dose under consideration as the MTD, an additional three patients will be treated at that level.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet each of the following criteria will be considered &quot;eligible&quot;:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the
             head and neck.

          -  Disease must be considered incurable. Incurable is defined as metastatic disease or a
             local or regional recurrence in a previously irradiated site that is unresectable (or
             patient declines resection).

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan, as &gt;20 mm by chest
             x-ray, or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Patients may have received pembrolizumab, platins, cetuximab or other chemotherapies
             in the metastatic setting, but do not need to have received cetuximab.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 as determined by the investigator;

          -  The subject has had an assessment of all known disease sites e.g., by computerized
             tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan as appropriate,
             within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib.

          -  A CT of the neck and a CT of the chest will be required at baseline for all patients.

          -  The subject is ≥ 18 years old on the day of consent.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
             or 1.

          -  Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v.5.0 from toxicities related to any prior
             treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive
             therapy.

          -  The subject has organ and marrow function and laboratory values as follows within 14
             days before the first dose of cabozantinib.

               1. The ANC ≥ 1500/mm3 without colony stimulating factor support.

               2. White blood cell count ≥ 2500/mm3 (≥ 2.5 GI/L).

               3. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3;

               4. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL;

               5. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the ULN. For subjects with known Gilbert's disease, bilirubin ≤
                  3.0 mg/dL;

               6. Albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dl;

               7. Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min. For creatinine
                  clearance estimation, the Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used:

             i. Male: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 - age) × wt (kg) / (creatinine × 72); h. Female:
             Multiply above result by 0.85; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN). ALP ≤ 5 x ULN with documented bone metastases.

             i. Lipase &lt; 2.0 x the upper limit of normal and no radiologic or clinical evidence of
             pancreatitis.

          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements
             and has signed the informed consent document;

          -  Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier
             methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study
             and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are
             also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier
             method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4
             months after the last dose of study drug(s).

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening. Females
             of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of becoming
             pregnant (i.e., females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,
             with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been
             amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential
             if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body
             weight, ovarian suppression or other reasons.

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, synchronous H&amp;N primaries or low grade tumors deemed
             cured and not treated with systemic therapy. Other cancers that will not affect the
             study outcome may be included with the consent of the PI (Dr. Michel) as long as it
             would not affect the study outcome (e.g., low grade prostate cancer on surveillance
