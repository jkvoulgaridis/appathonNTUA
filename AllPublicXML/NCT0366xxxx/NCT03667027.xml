  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterize the changes in diaphragm structure, function and
      biology during bridging to lung transplant by mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal life
      support.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation has been linked to diaphragm injury and dysfunction. During mechanical
      ventilation, the amount of breathing work done by the diaphragm is unpredictable: the
      diaphragm could be completely rested, or it could be overworked. Either of these
      possibilities may cause injury to the diaphragm. Patients with an injured and dysfunctional
      diaphragm have greater difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation - they become too weak
      to breathe. However, little is known about the relationship between changes in the diaphragm
      and the histological (structure of cells and tissue) basis of these changes. The
      investigators have developed a new technique employing beside ultrasound to measure diaphragm
      thickness. This allows them to observe changes in diaphragm muscle structure and function.

      The goal of the study is to determine whether different forms of respiratory support
      (mechanical ventilation vs extracorporeal life support) lead to different degrees of
      diaphragm injury and to compare changes in the diaphragm seen on ultrasound to changes in the
      diaphragm tissues under a microscope. This will help the investigators to confirm the best
      way to avoid diaphragm injury and to understanding the meaning of diaphragm ultrasound
      images.
