  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess
      the effects of daily 4-gram marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (MO3PUFA), through
      treatment with AMR101 (VASCEPA, icosapent ethyl) on the tumor immune microenvironment and gut
      microbiome in patients who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer or with a colorectal mass or
      polyp suspected to be a cancer or advanced adenoma and will undergo surgical resection or
      interventional endoscopy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). It uses the novel
      &quot;window-of-opportunity&quot; clinical trial design to take advantage of the window of time between
      cancer/mass/polyp diagnosis and surgery to examine the effect of therapeutic agents on tumor
      pathologic and molecular features unperturbed by prior therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a chemopreventive agent to reduce
      risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of colorectal cancer, colorectal mass
      or polyp(s).

      AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances found in
      the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid cannot be
      produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through diet or
      supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for any
      disease. AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl).

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits during which participants will complete a lifestyle
      questionnaire and a nutritional survey. A drug diary will be provided to be completed.
      Measurements will be taken, and blood and stool specimens will be collected. Tumor,
      colorectal mass, or polyp tissue will be collected for research purposes at the time of
      surgery or interventional endoscopy.

      AMR101 administered daily, orally for up to 30 days and it is expected that 36 participants
      will take part in this study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to
        participate in the study:

        Participants have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon that is localized,
        with no evidence of distant metastasis (stage I, II, or III), and for which surgical
        resection of the primary tumor is being planned;

        OR

        Participants may have a colon biopsy that is suspicious for adenocarcinoma if clinical
        and/or endoscopic findings strongly support the presence of malignancy, and if surgical
        resection is being planned. NOTE: In the unlikely event that the final pathology of the
        surgical resection specimen is consistent with high-grade adenoma or dysplasia, the patient
        will not be considered ineligible and collected research samples will still be utilized.

        OR

        Participants have a diagnosis of a colorectal mass or polyp suspected to be a cancer or
        advanced adenoma at the most recent colonoscopy and are being referred to an advanced
        endoscopist to undergo interventional endoscopy within 30 days.

        Age &gt;= 18 years

        This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in
        children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with distinct
        biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults.

        ECOG performance status â¤2 (Karnofsky â¥60%, see Appendix A)

        Patients must be sufficiently healthy to undergo surgery/interventional endoscopy.

        The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
        child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
        study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible
        for admission into the study.

        Prior systemic or radiotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer.

        Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

        Concurrent use of other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy agents, targeted
        agents, biological agents, immunotherapy, or investigational agents not otherwise specified
        in this protocol.

        Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills.

        History of malabsorption or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, or any other disease that
        could interfere with absorption of oral medications.

        History of allergic reactions attributed to fish or compounds of similar chemical or
        biologic composition to MO3PUFA.

        Currently using or have used any fish oil supplement at any dose more than once per week
        within the last month.

        Regularly consuming more than three servings of fish per week.

        Known bleeding tendency/condition (e.g. von Willebrand disease)

        Current use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapies, including aspirin and other
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin], Naproxen
        [Aleve, Anaprox DS, Naprosyn], and Celecoxib [Celebrex]), Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin
        sodium, Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepirudin, Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an
        unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.

        Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the
        investigator, may increase the risks associated with study participation or study
        treatment, limit compliance with study requirements, or interfere with the interpretation
        of study results.

        Pregnant or breastfeeding.

        The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
        child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
        method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
        participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
        Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but
        potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother
        with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled
        on the study.

        Presence of synchronous (at the same time) malignancy for which the patient is currently
        receiving active treatment.

        Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or acute or
        chronic hepatitis B infection.

        Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased risk of
        significant complications in the perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from
        patients with these infections cannot be harvested for research purposes, per institutional
        policy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination
        antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

        Inclusion of Women and Minorities

        Women and minorities will be eligible for this study without alteration in eligibility
        criteria. Enrollment of these underrepresented populations to this trial will be
        encouraged.
