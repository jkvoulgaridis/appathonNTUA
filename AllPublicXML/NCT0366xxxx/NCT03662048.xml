  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if individualized feedback provided to parents on
      safe infant sleep can improve safety. This will be accomplished by having parents send
      photographs of their baby sleeping through the patient portal of the electronic health record
      (EHR).

      The purpose of this study is to assess if photographs of infants sleeping at night sent by
      parents through the patient portal of the electronic health record (EHR) can be used to a)
      deliver individualized feedback on safe infant sleep surfaces and sleep health and b) improve
      parental knowledge of and adherence to guidelines for safe infant sleep surfaces and sleep
      health. The feasibility of this approach will also be assessed through a randomized, clinical
      trial involving 130 infants with primary care through Penn State Health. Participants will be
      randomized to receive personalized feedback on the infant sleep position and surface at age 1
      month in addition to usual care or a usual care group. Both groups will receive personalized
      feedback on the infant sleep position and surface at infant age 2 months.

    <description>Feedback, according to the 2016 national American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines on Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID) risk factors, will be generated by the study team and communicated with parents. Feedback will be given to parents in the intervention group at ages 1 and 2 months. The control group parents will only receive this feedback at age 2 months.</description>
