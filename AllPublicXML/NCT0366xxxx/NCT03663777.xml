  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of isometric handgrip training (IHT) on blood
      pressure of hypertensive patients with peripheral arterial disease. Will be recruited 30
      patients which will be randomized into 2 groups (15 per group), IHT and control group (CG).
      IHT group will training isometric contraction for 12 weeks. In CG patients will be encouraged
      to increase the level of physical activity. In the pre and post-intervention cardiovascular
      measures will be obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meta-analyze studies have shown that 4 sets of 2 min of isometric handgrip training
      (IHT)reduces blood pressure (BP), reaching 10 mmHg for systolic and diastolic 7 mmHg in
      hypertensive patients after few weeks. However, using this protocol it was not observed any
      changes in BP in patients with peripheral artery disease. However, it is unknown whether
      reductions in BP does not occur after isometric handgrip training employing longer and
      protocol of IHT with more volume. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of IHT on
      blood pressure of hypertensive patients with peripheral arterial disease. Will be recruited
      30 patients, which will be randomized into 2 groups (15 per group), IHT and control group
      (CG). IHT group will hold three sessions per week with eight sets of two minutes of isometric
      contraction at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction and interval of two minutes between them,
      for 12 weeks. In the CG patients will be encouraged to increase the level of physical
      activity. In the pre and post-intervention, BP and cardiac autonomic modulationwill be
      assessed. Will be used to analyze two-factor variance for repeated measures, with group (IHT
      and CG) and the time (before and after 12 weeks) as factors and the post-hoc test of
      Newman-Keuls.

    <description>Intervention period will last 12 weeks. Experimental group will perform three sessions per week of home-based handgrip exercise. The exercise protocol will consist of eight sets of bilateral handgrip contraction of two minutes of isometric contraction, with 30% of maximum voluntary contraction, and two minutes of interval between sets. Patients will receive a diary to record the sessions and report difficulties during the training. The patients be recommended to increase daily physical activity levels, and weekly, there will be phone contacts with the patients to reinforce the exercise recommendations.</description>
