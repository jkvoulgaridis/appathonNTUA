      Objective: The study of medication adherence in depression (MAPDep study) aims to evaluate
      the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component strategy to enhance
      patient-centered care to improve adherence toward medications in patients with depression,
      formed by an educational intervention to psychiatrists and/or a collaborative care
      intervention group to patients and relatives plus a reminder system through the use of a
      mobile APP.

      Methods: The objective will be assessed under an open multicenter, clinical controlled trial
      with random allocation by clusters to one of three interventions or to usual care (control
      arm). In group 1 only patients and family members receive intervention, in group 2 only
      psychiatrists receive intervention, and group 3 is a combined intervention for patients and
      psychiatrists. The main measure will be the change in medication adherence rate. Secondary
      endpoints are depression, emotional distress, health-related quality of life, physical
      functioning, patients' knowledge about their medications, provider beliefs regarding
      patient-centeredness, and healthcare resource utilization.
