  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute High-risk abdominal surgery (AHA) is associated with high mortality rates, multiple
      postoperative complications and prolonged duration of hospital admission. A recent study
      revealed very low level of physical performance in the first postoperative week in patients
      undergoing AHA. Furthermore the included patients who were non-independently mobilized or had
      low level of 24-hour physical activity more often experienced a pulmonary complication.
      Studies examining the feasibility of early and intensive mobilization are needed, prior to
      investigating the effect of the intervention in an Randomised Controlled Trial. The purpose
      of this study is evaluating the feasibility of early and intensive mobilization during the
      first week postoperatively among patients who receive Acute High-Risk Abdominal Surgery
      (AHA). The aim is also to describe physical performance, physical activity, pulmonary
      function and health-related quality of life, as well as barriers to mobilization following
      AHA surgery.
