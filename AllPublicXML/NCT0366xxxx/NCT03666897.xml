  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our current biological understanding of stroke recovery in humans is extremely limited and
      this lack of knowledge is a major challenge in reducing stroke disabilities and deficits.
      Evidence of neural repair in humans can be gleaned indirectly through functional outcome
      measures, but we propose that metabolomics may also provide a minimally invasive window into
      human brain repair. This study will integrate clinical imaging and molecular biomarkers as a
      diagnostic tool in further understanding stroke recovery mechanisms.

      Our long-term goal is to improve and hasten recovery following a stroke with translational
      research, which would combine the use of neuroimaging and identify neural repair metabolites.
      The objective and sequential step in fulfilling our long-term goal, is to identify
      differential expression of select stroke plasma biomarkers of neural repair, and image CST
      integrity in patients with good and poor recovery following an ischemic stroke. Diffusion
      tension imaging (DTI), will be used to image the neural repair as it occurs, further
      enhancing our understanding of stroke recovery. There are currently no known plasma
      biomarkers of neural repair. Identification of such biomarkers would be extremely valuable
      for designing stroke recovery drugs and timing rehabilitation therapies.

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer will be used to assess motor function at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers, hip, knee, and foot. The scale ranges from 0 to 66 points, measuring the impairment level of the upper extremity. Zero indicates a high level of impairment or minimum hand motor function, while 66 points indicates an increased motor function which is similar to normal upper extremity function.</description>
