  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DermACELL acellular dermal matrix (D-ADM) is the trade name of LifeNet Health's acellular
      dermal matrix (ADM). LifeNet Health will remove the basement membrane from the D-ADM and this
      product will be compared to FlexHDÂ® Pliable, which does not include a basement membrane in
      order to demonstrate that D-ADM without a basement membrane is not inferior to FlexHD in the
      frequency of significant side effects that result from breast implants. This is a post market
      trial that is comparing two ADM products with a known safety profile. The D-ADM without a
      basement membrane is being prepared specifically for this UVA evaluation. Removal of the
      basement membrane by the manufacturer is considered minimal manipulation. D-ADM without a
      basement membrane will be considered a human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based
      product (HCT/P) and is eligible for marketing immediately within the US, if desired by
      LifeNet Health (LNH). Additionally, the applications of the products are indicated.
      Therefore, the trial is not in support of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE).

      Prior to surgery, the registered subject will be randomized to receive the D-ADM without the
      basement membrane or the comparator, FlexHD Pliable. The surgeon and the patient will be
      blinded to the product group. The patient will receive the ADM at the time of placement of
      the tissue expander. After a period of tissue expansion, the patient will have the
      expander-implant exchange. During this surgery, there will be 3 punch biopsies taken in 3
      different locations: native breast tissue, center of the ADM, and the border of the ADM and
      subject's breast tissue. These specimens will be analyzed to estimate differences in
      immunologic and inflammatory response for each ADM product.

      The patient will follow up with the surgeon at 1-3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and
      12 months post implant exchange. At these visits, the surgeon will assess for any adverse
      events and this information will be collected for research purposes. The patient will be
      asked to complete the reconstruction module of the Breast-Q at the baseline visit and 6 and
      12 months to assess quality of life and patient satisfaction.
