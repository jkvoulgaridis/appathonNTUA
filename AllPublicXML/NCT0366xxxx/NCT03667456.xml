      Evaluate the use by the patient and his family and professional environment of a
      self-rehabilitation device with follow-up in tele-rehabilitation in people with Parkinson's
      disease taking into account the different actors within a health area (health professionals
      and paramedics in structure and in liberal).

    <measure>SF36</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey is assessing the subjective quality of life of patients summarized in two component summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. The SF-36 includes one multi-item scale that assesses eight health concepts. All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible. Aggregate scores are compiled as a percentage of the total points possible, using the RAND scoring table. The scores from those questions that address each specific area of functional health status are then averaged together, for a final score within each of the 8 dimensions measured. Reliability is measured by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Its value is less than or equal to 1. It is considered &quot;acceptable&quot; from 0.7.</description>

    <measure>Rosenberg SES</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rosenberg's self-esteem scale (SES) assesses self-esteem. The questionnaire consists of 10 items of which 5 evaluate positive self-esteem and 5 negative self-esteem. The answer varies according to a four-point Likert-type scale from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;Totally agree&quot; (4). A score between 10 and 40 is obtained. A score below 25 means very low self-esteem; a score between 25 and 31 means low self-esteem; a score between 31 and 34 means an average self-esteem; a score between 34 and 39 means a strong self-esteem; a score above 39 means a very strong self-esteem.</description>

    <measure>Zarit's Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit scale assesses the emotional, physical and financial burden for caregivers of caring for someone with a loss of autonomy. The 22-item grid allows an assessment of this burden, ranging from mild to moderate to severe. The total score (sum of the 22-item scores) ranges from 0 to 88.
A score less than or equal to 20 indicates a low or no burden; a score between 21 and 40 indicates a light burden; a score between 41 and 60 indicates a moderate burden; a score above 60 indicates a severe burden</description>
