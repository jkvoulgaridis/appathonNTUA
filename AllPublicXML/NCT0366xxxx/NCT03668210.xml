  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common pathology (37 000 operations in 2006, nearly 43
      000 in 2012 in France) justifying more and more operating indications in younger and younger
      patients. 70-80% of ACL ruptures occur without contact, which makes it a major public health
      interest because of its frequency and accessibility in terms of prevention.

      The place of isokinetic assessment is important pre and postoperatively so that it has become
      systematic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main risk factors for known ACL lesions are female gender, pivotal sports, neuromuscular
      deficits, proprioceptive, hormonal, morphological deficits ... Moreover, there is also an
      increase in the number of contralateral fractures in patients who had a ligamentoplasty.
      There are many articles on the ACL pathology but unequal on the potential risk factors. The
      only proven risk factor for contralateral rupture is the age of the first episode; the female
      sex also seems to be important in some studies but remains more controversial. However, many
      factors have been studied: the intensity of the sport, the sex, the operative technique of
      ligamentoplasty, the operating duration, the duration of recovery of the sports activity, the
      level of recovery (of this sporting activity ) ...

      Isokinetics is used to measure the peak of strength of quadriceps and hamstrings, in
      concentric or eccentric, at slow and fast speed and to determine a hamstring / quadriceps
      ratio to highlight a deficit or imbalance.

    <description>Isokineticism makes it possible to measure the peak of force of quadriceps and hamstrings. Concentric hamstrings/quadriceps ratio in isokinetic is calculated to detect a relative deficiency if it is below threshold values of 55% at 60 °/s slow speed, or 65% at 180 °/s fast speed.</description>

    <measure>Investigating whether a lack of recruitment of hamstring at fast speed is a potential risk factor for ACL rupture, by evaluating hamstrings/quadriceps ratio in isokinetics.</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The lack of recruitment of the hamstrings when increasing speed is defined as normal ratios of peaks of force at the two speeds in isokinetic, but with an increase of the ratio hamstrings/Quadriceps in concentric at fast speed lower than 10%, with reference to the value of the ratio hamstrings/Quadriceps at slow speed.</description>
