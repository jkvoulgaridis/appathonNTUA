  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the most important method to screen for colorectal cancer and precancerous
      lesions, whose efficacy is closely related with the quality of bowel preparation, requiring
      consuming purgatives and restricting the diet. Compliance to bowel preparation is highly
      dependent on patient education. In most cases, such education is offered only once at the
      time of colonoscopy scheduling by either oral or written instructions. However, about one in
      fourth patients still cannot achieve satisfactory bowel preparation quality. Various methods,
      including booklet, telephone or message reminders, smartphone applications, social media,
      online videos, have been used to aid patient education and prove effective. These methods can
      increase patient activation, which is an independent factor related to bowel preparation
      quality. Virtual reality(VR) videos are used in this study, giving patients direct
      impressions of colonoscopy. This study aims to explore whether VR videos can increase patient
      adherence and experience, as well as improve bowel preparation quality, compared with
      conventional patient education methods.

    <measure>Boston bowel preparation score</measure>

    <description>A 10-point scale assessing bowel preparation. A four-point scoring system applied to each of the three broad regions of the colon: the right colon (including the cecum and ascending colon), the transverse colon (including the hepatic and splenic flexures), and the left colon (including the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum).
0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.
= Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid.
= Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well.
= Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid. The wording of the scale was finalized after incorporating feedback from three colleagues experienced in colonoscopy.</description>
