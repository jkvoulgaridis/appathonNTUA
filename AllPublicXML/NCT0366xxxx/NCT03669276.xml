      In this study the investigators took the opportunity of having a large sample of IUI cycles
      in a single centre to try to analyse the effect of stimulation protocols and of the
      infertility origin on the results, taking in account the main confounding variables (female
      age, IUI attempt rank, and sperm quality) on the clinical outcome.

      All couples had undergone a standard infertility evaluation, which included medical history,
      physical examination, and assessment of tubal patency by either hysterosalpingography or
      laparoscopy and hormonal analysis on cycle day 3. A transvaginal ultrasound scan was
      performed on the second day of the cycle. On the same day, ovarian stimulation was carried
      out with recombinant FSH (follitropinrFSH; Gonal-F, MerckSerono, France,
      orfollitropin;Puregon, MSD, France), urinary FSH (urofollitropin, Fostimon, France), orhMG
      (menotropin, Menopur, France) atastarting dose of 75 IU/day from the second day of the cycle.

      The main clinical outcome measures were clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates per cycle.
      Clinical pregnancy was defined as the evidence of pregnancy by ultrasound examination of the
      gestational sac at weeks 5-7.

      Many studies have evaluated the predictive factors of IUI clinical outcomes, including the
      female's age, the infertility duration, the rank of the attempt, and the sperm parameters
      [10-16]. However, few studies have compared the pregnancy rates based on the used COS or on
      the infertility type.

      In this study the investigators took the opportunity of having a large sample of IUI cycles
      in a single centre to try to analyse the effect of stimulation protocols and of the
      infertility origin on the results, taking in account the main confounding variables (female
      age, IUI attempt rank, and sperm quality) on the clinical outcome.

      All couples had undergone a standard infertility evaluation, which included medical history,
      physical examination, and assessment of tubal patency by either hysterosalpingography or

      performed on the second day of the cycle. On the same day, ovarian stimulation was carried

    <description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of success factors of intrauterine insemination (IUI) in controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in order to define the type of infertility.

        All couples attending our reproductive medical center to obtain homologous IUI program with
        COS between January 2007 and August 2014 ll couples had undergone a standard infertility
        evaluation, which included medical history, physical examination, and assessment of tubal
        patency by either hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy and hormonal analysis on cycle day
        3.
