  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, childhood overweight and obesity is a public health problem. Although the rising
      trend in children's body mass index (BMI) has plateaued in some high-income countries, it has
      accelerated in low- and middle-income countries. It is especially true amongst Chinese
      children with the annual increase rate of obesity during 2010-2014 greater than any other
      periods from 1985 to 2010.

      With the dramatic economic development in China, children are now growing up in an
      increasingly 'obesogenic' environment. For example, the availability and ubiquity of
      computers and smart phones promote sedentary time, and access to energy dense food and sugar
      sweetened beverages is now widespread. Effective childhood obesity intervention is urgently
      needed in China. Although over 20 intervention studies for overweight/obesity among children
      and adolescents have been conducted in China since the 1990s, most of them had moderate or
      serious methodological weaknesses. For example, they did not report the number of students,
      schools or districts initially approached to participate, raising the possibility of
      selection and recruitment bias. Additionally, although they stated the allocation of
      intervention and control were randomized, no description of the method of randomization was
      reported.

      Given the relative lack of high-quality interventions for childhood overweight/obesity, the
      investigators designed a cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a
      multicomponent one-academic-year intervention among 24 primary schools (approximately 1200
      students) in the eastern (Beijing), middle (Shanxi) and western (Xinjiang) part of China.

      The study aims to identify: 1) whether the school-based intervention will be effective for
      preventing excessive weight gain among children; 2) whether the intervention will be
      beneficial for improving healthy eating, physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors
      among children.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Eligibility criteria for schools The trial recruited a total of 24 schools. A
        convenience sample of 8 schools were selected from Beijing, Shanxi (Changzhi City) and
        Xinjiang (Urumqi City) respectively.

          1. Inclusion Criteria for schools:

               -  school leader agreeing to implement this intervention; requiring school teachers
                  who can implement this intervention (e.g. school doctors, physical education
                  teachers, physical education teachers, etc.); having at least 50 children from
                  Grade 4 (at the start of the intervention) per school;having a even number of
                  schools within each district.

          2. Exclusion Criteria for schools:

               -  boarding schools;schools solely for children with special skills; schools of
                  minor ethnic groups; similar programme (focus on weight gain prevention) would be
                  conducted in schools during the study period; schools having a cancelling or
                  relocation plan during the study period.

                  2. Eligibility criteria for classes One class per school will be selected if the
                  estimated number of students enrolled in the programme is no less than 40 within
                  the selected class; two classes per school will be selected if the estimated
                  number of students enrolled in the programme is less than 40 within the selected
                  class.

                  3. Eligibility criteria for students Eligible children will be those whose
                  primary caregivers will provide written consent to participate the study. After
                  collecting students' medical history from their parents, we will exclude
                  individuals suffering from or having a history of any cardiovascular and
                  metabolic diseases, asthma and disabilities that limit their ability to perform
                  physical activity.
