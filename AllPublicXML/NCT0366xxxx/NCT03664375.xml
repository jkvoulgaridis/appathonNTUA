  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to assess the combine role of Physiotherapy by providing task
      specific trainings and Botulinum Toxin Type A in improving the functional outcomes of upper
      limb in post stroke patients with focal hand dystonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke hemiparesis, with dystonia, is a major cause of disability. Dystonia can hinder
      the functional activities making patient dependent on others for performance of daily living
      activities. Dystonia not only limits the physical activity of the patient but also affects
      their quality of life significantly. Various treatment protocols have been used in the
      literature for treatment of focal hand dystonia in the past including deep brain stimulation,
      kinesio taping, sensory oriented training, splinting, extracorporeal shock wave therapy and
      botox. Out of these Botox has gained much importance but it results only in improving the
      passive range of motion and has no consensus in improving the active range of motion and
      functional independence of the patient. The current study was planned to determine the
      effects of botulinum toxin type A combined with task-specific therapy, for post-stroke focal
      dystonia of upper limb.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 46 patients were recruited in the study using non-probability purposive sampling and were divided randomly into two equal groups; control and experimental group, by sealed envelope method. The experimental group received botulinum toxin A followed by task specific training, while the control group received only task-specific training for 12 weeks. Data was collected at baseline, after 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks by using upper extremity items of Motor Assessment Scale and Fugl Meyer Assessment scale of upper limb, Stroke specific quality of Life, Arm dystonia Disability scale and WOLF Motor function test.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT):</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It assessed specific changes in limb function by 19 items grouped in four subscales. The total score ranged from 0 to 57. The lower score indicated no movement and upper score indicated normal performance of the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MOTOR ASSESSMENT SCALE (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was a performance-based scale, based on a task-oriented approach to evaluate and assesses performance of functional tasks rather than isolated patterns of movement. All items were assessed using a 7-point scale from 0 - 6. A score of 6 indicated optimal motor behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>WOLF MOTOR FUNCTION TEST (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It quantified motor ability through timed functional tasks. It used a 6-point ordinal scale with &quot;0&quot; = &quot;does not attempt with the involved arm&quot; to &quot;5&quot; = movement appears to be normal.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>FUGL- MEYER ASSESSMENT TEST</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was a performance-based impairment index to measure motor functioning. The total score possible was from 0 - 66, with higher function showing the improved level of independence</description>

    <measure>Severity Of Dystonia</measure>

    <description>The Arm Dystonia Disability Scale: The severity of dystonia was assessed using 0 (None) to 3 (Marked Difficulty in performing activity</description>

    <description>The experimental group received botulinum toxin type A. After one week of Botox administration, a specially made task specific training program was started for these patients. It was provided for a duration of one hour and for three times per week for a total of 12 weeks by a trained physiotherapist.</description>

    <description>All patients in the experimental group received a BoNT-A injection. The injected total dose for individual patient in the experimental group was 100 units which is equivalent to approximately 300-500 Units of Dysport (the other type of BoNT-A available). The Botox was injected by the neurophysician intramuscularly using insulin U100 syringe and determination of muscles for injection was assessed clinically.</description>
