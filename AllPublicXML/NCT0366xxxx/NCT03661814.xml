  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) system is
      effective and safe for the prevention of superficial and deep incisional surgical site
      infections (SSI) in high risk patients within 30 days after elective colorectal surgery. It
      has been shown that patients with an IBD, patients undergoing a reoperation or patients with
      certain comorbidities are at a higher risk of developing an SSI. The NPWT device is a wound
      dressing with a vacuum system that can be placed over abdominal wounds. The study will
      include up to 400 patients at this single site, where these high risk patients will be
      randomized to receive either one of two arms. The first arm involves the placement of the
      NPWT device in the immediate postoperative period over abdominal wounds after
      clean/contaminated colorectal surgical procedures. The device would then be left on for 5
      days. The second arm would be standard of care and would entail routine postoperative
      protocols. Subjects will then be seen once at a 30 day (Â± 7 days) follow-up visit to assess
      for the development of SSIs.

             colorectal surgical procedure.

          -  Patients must either have an inflammatory bowel disease, undergoing reoperation within
             30 days, or have two or more of the following risk factors: presence of an ostomy,
             type II diabetes, BMI greater than 30, immunosuppression, malnutrition, current

             second colorectal surgical procedure (e.g., colostomy or ileostomy takedown) or any
             other general surgery in less than 30 days of index-surgery,

          -  any patient in which the planned surgery would include: i) placement of a stoma in the
             principal incision; ii) placement of a drain into the supra-peritoneal fascia space
             that emerges through the principal incision; iv) placement of a drain into the
             intraperitoneal space that emerges through the principal incision; and v)
             supplementation of any of the irrigation fluid with antibiotic or antiseptic drugs,
