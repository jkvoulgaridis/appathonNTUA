      Introduction High dose chemotherapy followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT)
      is a therapeutic option in follicular Lymphoma after first line treatment failure. The
      clinical characteristics and outcome of FL patients who relapsed after HDT+ASCT and
      therapeutic management in the rituximab era are not well known and may represent a difficult
      challenge.

      Patients and Methods: The investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of FL patients who
      relapsed after HDT+ASCT in four French centers treated between 2000 and 2014. Clinical
      records were reviewed for clinical characteristics and treatment strategy at relapse. The
      investigators aimed to identify prognostic factors related to patient's outcome.

        95 consecutive patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria for this study were reviewed
        retrospectively with data cut-off of December 2014. FL patients in relapse after ASCT. All
        patients presented at diagnosis a grade 1, 2, or 3A follicular lymphoma confirmed by either
        excisional or core needle biopsy.
