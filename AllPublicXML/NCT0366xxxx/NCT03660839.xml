      Primary Objective:

      To show the contribution of OZ439 to the clinical and parasiticidal effect of OZ439/FQ
      combination by analyzing exposure-response of OZ439 measured by Day 28 polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR)-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) for the effect
      and the AUC of OZ439 as PK predictor.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To evaluate the dose response of OZ439 combined with FQ on PCR-corrected ACPR and crude
           Day 28 ACPR, and on other secondary endpoints.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of different dosages of OZ439 in combination
           with FQ and FQ alone.

        -  To characterize the PK of OZ439 in plasma, and of FQ and its active metabolite SSR97213
           in blood.

      before the single-dose treatment, 5 days of post-treatment surveillance (including 2 to 4
      days hospitalization) and 24±2 days follow-up.
