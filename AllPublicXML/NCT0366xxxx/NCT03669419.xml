  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate, whether the self administered quality of recovery (QoR-9)
      questionnaire can predict postoperative complications after non-cardiac surgery and whether
      preoperative risk estimates can be improved by implementation of the QoR-9 as postoperative
      screening tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The QoR-9 as established patient-centred outcome measure, which is validated in German
      language, is surveyed preoperatively, as well as on postoperative day 1 and 3 after
      non-cardiac surgery. We showed in a pilot study that this score reveals a high sensitivity to
      detect patients with a disturbed health status through a detailed and time-consuming physical
      examination.We want to evaluate if short screening tools can be used to categorize patients
      with increased risk for developing postoperative complicationsTherefore, patients undergoing
      non-cardiac surgery are informed preoperatively about the study and written informed consent
      is obtained. Afterwards, the QoR-9, as well as validated preoperative risk scores are
      obtained. Relevant intra- and immediate postoperative factors are recorded. On postoperative
      day 1 and 3 patients perform the QoR-9. Postoperative complications during hospital stay are
      determined using the Clavien Dindo score by searching the patients 'record. After 6 months
      the patients are contacted via telephone and the QoR-9 is obtained. 6-months mortality is
      determined.

    <description>The QoR-9 as established patient-centred outcome measure, which is validated in German language, is surveyed preoperatively, as well as on postoperative day 1 and 3 after non-cardiac surgery. Postoperative complications are evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo Score. A follow-up is intended after 6 months. Preoperative risk is estimated using the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) and the POSPOM (Preoperative Score to predict postoperative mortality) score.</description>
