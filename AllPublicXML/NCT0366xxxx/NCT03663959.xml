      Forty-three women who had vaginal sacrospinous fixations using Dr. Aksakal's Desta suture
      carrier and 36 women who had laparoscopic pectopexies between January 2014 and June 2018 at
      H.S.U Kocaeli Derince Training and Research Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics clinic were
      re-examined between 15 June and 30 December 2018 gynecologically.

      Forty-three women who had vaginal sacrospinous fixations using Dr. Aksakal's Desta suture
      carrier and 36 women who had laparoscopic pectocolpopexies were re-examined 7 to 43 months
      after surgery. All of the women had undergone surgery for stage 2 or greater uterovaginal or
      vaginal vault prolapse according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system.

      All of the patients received telephone calls and were invited for a gynecological
      re-examination. All but one patient in the vaginal surgery group came in for a gynecological
      control. We conducted a phone interview with the one patient not agreeing to come to the
      control, and we learned that she had a relapse 6 months after the operation. She underwent
      another prolapse surgery at a different hospital. She described her postsurgical complaints,
      and we noted that she was unsatisfied with the surgery. In the postoperative re-evaluation
      between 15 June and 30 December 2018, all of the women were examined in the lithotomy
      position for apical, anterior, and posterior compartment descensus. Stage 2 or greater apical
      descensus or a cystocele or rectocele according to the POP-Q system were accepted as
      postoperative relapses. All of the patients answered the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary
      Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) and Prolapse Quality of Life (P-QOL)
      questionnaire. All of the women were asked about de novo urge urinary incontinence and de
      novo stress urinary incontinence. In addition, each patient's satisfaction with the surgery
      was asked and recorded.

    <description>The PISQ-12 is a self-adminestered questionnaire that evaluates sexual function of women with pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence. The questionnaire has 12 items. Other than the first 4 questions that are scored from 4 to 0, all questions are scored from 0 to 4. The total score is calculated with totaling the score of each question. The maximum score is 48. Higher scores show good sexual functioning of women.</description>

The questionnaire has nine items, each of has 4-point scoring system and a total score of 0-100. A high total score indicates worsening of quality of life of women with pelvic organ prolapsus.</description>

    <description>A right sacrospinous fixation using Dr. Aksakal's Desta suture carrier with two permanent sutures that combined the sacrospinous ligament and vaginal cuff fascia was done. The Desta suture carrier was developed for deep pelvic surgery, and the suture depth can be easily adjusted. After the vaginal hysterectomy, under the vaginal cuff mucosa, we created a tunnel through the spinous process with a straight tool. After passing the rectovaginal pillars, the perirectal space was entered and the ischial spine was palpated. With the help of an index finger placed on the spinous process, we placed two permanent sutures 1.5-2 cm medial to the spinous process on the sacrospinous ligament and iliococcygeus muscle complex using the Desta suture carrier. Next, permanent sutures were combined with the pubocervicovaginal and rectovaginal fascia under the vaginal cuff mucosa.</description>

    <description>First, the peritoneal layer above and lateral to the bladder was opened parallel to the round ligament toward the pelvic side wall on the right side. Then, with the guidance of the obliterated umbilical artery, lateral to the obliterated umbilical artery and medial to the external iliac vein, the iliopectineal ligament was found . At this point, a segment of approximately 3-4 cm2 was formed, exposing the iliopectineal (Cooper's) ligament. In this area, behind the obliterated umbilical artery, the obturator nerve could be seen, and special care was given not to make contact with the nerve. The same area on the left side was prepared using the same steps. Then, anterior part of the vaginal cuff was prepared for mesh fixation. Bilaterally, the ends of a polypropylene monofilament mesh (1,5x15 cm) were fixed to the iliopectineal ligament with nonabsorbable polypropylene or polyester sutures . The vaginal cuff was elevated to POP-Q level 0-1.</description>
