  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the report to assess the effect of supplementation with gamma-aminobutyric acid on
      blood pressure among people with mild hypertension. Overall, &quot;Beauty Drink&quot; consumption for 8
      weeks could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of ACE
      that is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases
      the sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension.

      This is the report to assess the effect of supplementation with gamma-aminobutyric acid on
      blood pressure among people with mild hypertension. Fifty subjects with systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) between 120 and 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 and
      99 mm Hg were randomized to ingest 2 bottles &quot;Beauty Drink&quot; or placebo perday for 8 weeks of
      a stage. Anthropometric measurements (blood pressure, body weight, body fat) and blood
      biochemical markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total cholesterol (TC),
      triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), AST, ALT were
      examined every four weeks.
