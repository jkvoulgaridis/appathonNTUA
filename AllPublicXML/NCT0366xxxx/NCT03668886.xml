  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of elderly has been increasing in recent decades. Current studies focused on the
      risk factors of poor physical performance, poor daily activity performance, and even
      disability in the elderly. We planned to evaluate the physical performance of elderly
      dwelling in the community and designed a multimodal exercise program which can improve
      physical performance, prevent disability and promote quality of life.

    <description>WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index) questionnaire is used for evaluation of pain, stiffness, physical function of patients with knee osteoarthritis. It includes 5 questions for pain, 2 questions for stiffness and 17 questions for physical function. The score of every question is from 0 to 4. The larger the number, the discomfort becomes more servere. We use the difference of change between two time points (baseline, 3 months later) to measure the benefit of the exercise.</description>
