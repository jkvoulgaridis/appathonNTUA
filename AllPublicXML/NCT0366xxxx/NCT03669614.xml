    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2a randomized, double-blind, two-part, dose-ascending, multicenter study of the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of AR-501 (gallium citrate), administered via inhalation, in
      healthy adult and P. aeruginosa infected cystic fibrosis subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three dose levels will be assessed in succession, first in HV subjects, then in CF subjects.
      The study will be performed in 4 stages, beginning with the HV cohort single-ascending-dose
      (SAD) phase, followed by the HV cohort multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) phase, and then the CF
      cohort SAD phase, and finally the CF cohort MAD phase.

      The HV cohort will include up to 48 subjects. The CF cohort will have the same composition of
      subjects. Thus, the total number of subjects is 96.

      The study will be performed at a Phase 1/2 Clinical Study Unit for the HV cohort and at 9 to
      12 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF)-accredited Therapeutic Development Network (TDN) clinical
      trial sites located in the United States for the CF cohort.

      Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria, including giving informed consent, will be
      enrolled and undergo a screening period of 28 days.

    <intervention_model_description>SAD Phase The HV cohort will include up to 24 adult subjects in 3 groups (8 per dose group). In each dose group, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to the active drug or placebo, resulting in 6 subjects receiving inhaled AR-501 and 2 receiving placebo in a double-blind manner.
The MAD phase of the study will include up to an additional 24 adult subjects in 3 dose groups (also 8 per dose group). In each dose group, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to active study drug or placebo, resulting in 6 subjects receiving inhaled AR-501 and 2 receiving placebo in a double-blind manner.
Cystic Fibrosis Cohort The CF cohort, consisting of 24 adult CF subjects, will undergo the same treatment and monitoring process as the HV cohort during the SAD phase, including the use of sentinel subjects in the first dose group.</intervention_model_description>
