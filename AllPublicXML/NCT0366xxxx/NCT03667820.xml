  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the combination of two well-tolerated therapies, osimertinib and
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiation (SABR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer will receive the current optimal therapy
      with osimertinib. After 8 weeks of targeted therapy, there will likely be some persisting
      lesions that would not have completely regressed. These persisting lesions would likely
      consist of cells that are less sensitive to targeted therapy. From the data summarized above
      [14], these persisting lesions are most to subsequently develop resistance and demonstrate
      progression.

      To delay the onset of clinical progression, lesions that persist after 8 weeks of osimertinib
      therapy and are amenable to stereotactic ablative radiation will be radiated. Osimertinib
      will be held for 3 days before the first dose of radiation and resumed 3 days after the last
      dose.

      After radiation, all patients will continue osimertinib therapy. If subsequently there is any
      evidence of progression, there will be an assessment of whether a repeat course of radiation
      is feasible. If it is feasible to repeat SABR to sites of progression, this will be performed
      and osimertinib resumed. If SABR is not possible, then a change in systemic therapy will be
      required.

             or class to osimertinib) or any excipients of these agents
