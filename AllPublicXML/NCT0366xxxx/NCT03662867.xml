  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a family-based mindfulness
      intervention (FBMI) in reducing parental stress and promoting child adjustment. Intervention
      effectiveness will be tested by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing a group
      receiving FBMI to a wait-list control group. Children aged five and their parents will be
      recruited to participate in the study. Eligible families will be recruited, stratified by
      level of economically disadvantage, behaviour problem scores, and parental stress, and then
      randomly assigned to the two groups. Intervention groups will be conducted by instructors
      with professional training. Children in the intervention group are expected to show
      improvements in cognitive and language development, behaviour problems, attention and
      emotional/behavior regulation, and physiological stress (reduced cortisol and heart rate
      variability), compared with the waitlist control group. Parents are expected to show
      improvements in physiological and psychological stress, and mindfulness, compared with the
      waitlist control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Economic disadvantage has been found to be associated with delayed cognitive and language
      development, and mental health symptoms such as aggression, anxiety of children. Chronic
      cumulative stressors of poverty disrupt their attention, emotional and behavioural
      regulation, that would further lead to negative impact in early development. As their parents
      are also affected by stress, they often become unresponsive, harsh and inconsistent in child
      discipline, resulting in a chronic stress to their children. Mindfulness is defined as paying
      attention purposefully and non-judgmentally to the present moment. It has been shown to
      improve attention, promote exposure to unpleasant experiences, facilitate cognitive change,
      and enhance the ability to cope with life stress. Mindfulness training has been established
      as an evidence-based intervention for people suffering from various chronic conditions. Its
      application in a family context, including parents and children, is just beginning. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a family-based mindfulness
      intervention (FBMI) in reducing parental stress and promoting child adjustment. Intervention
      effectiveness will be tested by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing a group
      receiving FBMI to a wait-list control group. Children aged five and their parents will be
      recruited to participate in the study. Eligible families will be recruited, stratified by
      level of economically disadvantage, behaviour problem scores, and parental stress, and then
      randomly assigned to the two groups. Intervention groups will be conducted by instructors
      with professional training. Children in the intervention group are expected to show
      improvements in cognitive and language development, behaviour problems, attention and
      emotional/behavior regulation, and physiological stress (reduced cortisol and heart rate
      variability), compared with the waitlist control group. Parents are expected to show
      improvements in physiological and psychological stress, and mindfulness, compared with the
      waitlist control group. The proposed project will be the first of its kind to use mindfulness
      training in a family context in Hong Kong. It is also unique as it examines the effectiveness
      of a mindfulness-based intervention with multiple outcome measures related to stress,
      combining self-reported measures with biomarkers, and psychological tests. For model building
      and theory development, this study may shed light on assessing the change mechanisms for
      promoting child learning, emotional and behavioural regulation, particularly in relation to
      studies of stress physiology and economically disadvantaged families. The results may not
      only benefit in Hong Kong but also those in other Chinese societies and countries.

    <description>Assessed by parent-reported scale, named Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF), assessing the level of parenting stress from different sources of difficulties.
Total Stress (TS) score and three sub-scores, including Parental Distress (PD), Parental-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (PCDI) and Difficult Child (DC), are reported.
For the range of TS, the minimum score is 36 and the maximum score is 180. Higher values represent a higher level of total parenting stress.
For the range of PD, PCDI and DC, the minimum scores are 12 and the maximum scores are 60. Higher values represent a higher level of parenting stress respectively from the source of parental distress, parental-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child.
Three sub-scores are summed to compute a total score.</description>

    <description>Assessed by parent-reported scale, named Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), assessing the construct of parent's depression symptoms, directly based on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition).
One total score is reported. For the range of the total score, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 27. Higher values represent parents' more severe level of depression symptoms.</description>

    <description>Assessed by parent-reported scale, named Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting (IM-P) scale, assessing the construct of parent's quality of mindfulness specific to his or her family context.
The total score and four subscale scores, including Compassion for Child (CC), Emotional Awareness in Parenting (EAP), Nonjudgmental Acceptance in Parenting (NAP) and Listening with Full Awareness (LFA), are reported.
The range of the total score is 23 to 115. Higher values represent parents' better quality of mindfulness in parenting.
The range of CC is 7 to 35. Higher values represent parents' better quality of compassion for child.
The range of EAP and NAP is 6 to 30. Higher values respectively represent parents' better quality of emotional awareness in parenting and nonjudgmental acceptance in parenting.
The range of LFA is 4 to 20. Higher values represent parents' better quality of listening with full awareness.
Four subscale scores are summed to compute a total score.</description>

    <time_frame>(1) Pretest baseline, (2) through intervention completion, 8 weeks, and (3) 3-month follow up after intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by parent-reported scale, named Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), assessing parents' ratings of their children's behavior problems.
The Total Problem, and seven subscale scores, including Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior, are reported.
For the range of Total Problem and all subscale scores, including Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior, the minimum scores are 0 and the maximum scores are 1.

    <description>Family-based mindfulness intervention is a parallel-group intervention containing one parent program and one child program. The parent mindfulness program lasts for 6 weeks, one session per week, and each session lasts for 1.5 hours. The child mindfulness program lasts for 8 weeks, one session per week, and each session lasts for 1 hour. In the fourth and sixth sessions of the parent program, 30-minute joint practice of parents and children is incorporated. All sessions are implemented by qualified instructors.</description>
