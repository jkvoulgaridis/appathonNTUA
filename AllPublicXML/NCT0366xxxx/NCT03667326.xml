      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether women with severe preeclampsia
      taking low-dose aspirin (LDA) for 3 weeks post-delivery will experience an improvement in
      endothelial function (measured as flow-mediated dilation - FMD) and severity of disease, as
      the effects of preeclampsia can persist postpartum. Women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia
      prior to delivery will be enrolled and randomized to receive either low-dose aspirin (81mg)
      or placebo to take daily for up to 3 weeks post-delivery.

    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a serious disease of pregnancy that manifests with increased blood pressure
      and can affect all the organs in a woman's body. It usually develops after 20 weeks of
      pregnancy. There is an abnormal amount of protein in the urine and with worsening disease
      known as &quot;severe features,&quot; patients can have pain in the upper abdomen, changes in vision,
      fluid in the lungs, an intense headache, low number of platelets in the blood, and abnormal
      liver or kidney function. Very high blood pressure is also considered a severe feature. The
      exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown but women with the condition are at increased risk for
      complications during pregnancy, including seizures - eclampsia. Babies are at risk of being
      born premature because the only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. Women who have had
      preeclampsia are also at increased risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease later in life,
      including heart attack, stroke and high blood pressure.Studies show that women at high risk
      for preeclampsia, ie. have had preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy, are carrying more than one
      fetus, have a history of high blood pressure, kidney disease or both, have certain medical
      problems such as diabetes, thrombophilia or lupus, have a modestly decreased risk of disease
      with daily intake of low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy.

      Due to the limited data available on the topic of LDA in preeclamptic patients in the
      postpartum period, particularly as applicable to the American population, the investigator
      intends to start with a small pilot study involving the collection of information on 10 women
      not exposed to study intervention. This will allow for confirmation of the sample size based
      on the baseline FMD measurements 2 days after delivery.
