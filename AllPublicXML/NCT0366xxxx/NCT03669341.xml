  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1996 proton therapy has been applied very successfully at the Paul Scherrer Institute
      in Switzerland to irradiate deep-seated, stationary tumors. In order to treat tumors within
      an organ which moves due to breathing (e.g. lung) motion mitigation strategies need to be
      implemented to ensure the precise irradiation of the moving target. The aim of this study is
      to assess the feasibility and compare (via MRI imaging) 2 techniques which &quot;freeze&quot; the
      movement of the lung by breath hold. One method is suppression of respiratory movement via
      high-frequency, mechanical ventilation by means of a Jet Ventilator (HFPV). The other
      technique is deep Inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) with Hyperventilation and simultaneous
      Inspiration of 100% O2 including daily breath-hold exercise.

    <intervention_model_description>All study participants will perform both techniques of suppression of respiratory motion at 4 weekly visits. They always start with the deep-inspiration-breath- hold (DIBH) technique, extended by prior hyperventilation while breathing 100% O2, followed by the high-frequency-percussive-ventilation (HFPV) technique. Inbetween the weekly visits, participants are requested to perform a daily, short breath-hold training at home.</intervention_model_description>
