  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate in healthy volunteers the time-dependent effect of
      daily consumption for four weeks of six different nutrition ingredients on relative abundance
      of microbial taxa in fecal samples. Second, the study looks at the time-dependent effect of
      six different nutrition ingredients on alpha and beta diversity of microbiota in fecal
      samples. Moreover, the time-dependent effect of six different nutrition ingredients on
      gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life will be measured.

The Short Form (SF)-36 generates a profile of health-related quality of life outcomes by measuring health across eight different dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation because of physical health, social functioning, vitality, bodily pain, mental health, role limitation because of emotional problems and general health. Responses to each question within a dimension are combined to generate a score from 0 to 100; where 100 indicates &quot;good health&quot;.</description>
