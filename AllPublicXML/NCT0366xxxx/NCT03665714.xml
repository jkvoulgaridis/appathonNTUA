  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Impact Oral in Patients undergoing
      Surgery for Gastrointestinal Cancer, half of the participants will receive Impact Oral
      nutrition therapy, the other half will receive Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol describes a randomized, active-controlled, open labelled study in which
      either IMPACT Oral or Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) will be given to surgical patients
      for 5 days before surgery and 7 days after surgery. Both of the study products include
      immunonutrition, but the nutrient proportion is different.

      Prealbumin, C-reaction protein (CRP), Albumin，immunology parameters, the results of physical
      examination, vital signs, relevant nutrition- and safety-related laboratory parameters and
      the number, severity, seriousness, relatedness and outcome of Adverse Events (AEs) will be
      evaluated in this study.
