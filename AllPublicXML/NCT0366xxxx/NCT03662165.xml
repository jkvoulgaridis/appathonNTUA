  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to assess whether advertising the availability of self-administered oral HIV
      testing kits increases the number of truck drivers and female sex workers who come to the
      North Star Alliance clinics for HIV testing (Demand creation). The investigators sent text
      messages to eligible truck drivers and female sex workers registered in the North Star
      Alliance electronic health record system who, based on those records, were not accessing HIV
      testing regularly and randomized them to receive one of two messaged, (1) the standard
      message sent to all clients who have not tested for HIV in the past 3 months reminding them
      of the availability of HIV testing at North Star clinics or (2) a text message announcing the
      availability of HIV self-testing kits fat all North Star clinics in Kenya. The investigators
      then compared the number of truck drivers and female sex workers from our samples who came to
      the clinic for HIV testing over a 2 month period following the first text message in the two
      study arms.

      The study aimed to assess whether advertising the availability of self-administered oral HIV
      testing kits increases the number of truck drivers and female sex workers who come to the
      North Star Alliance clinics for HIV testing (Demand creation). The investigators first
      selected a sample of eligible truck drivers from the electronic health record system of the
      North Star Alliance who, based on those records, were not accessing HIV testing regularly,
      sent passive text messages alerting them that The North Star Alliance was planning to use
      their deidentified electronic health data for program evaluation purposes and gave them the
      option to opt out of being included. The investigators then randomized those who did not
      opt-out on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of two messages, (1) the standard (SOC) message sent
      to all clients who have not tested for HIV in the past 3 months reminding them of the
      availability of HIV testing at North Star clinics sent one time (2) the SOC message sent
      three times, a week apart (Enhanced SOC) or (2) a text message announcing the availability of
      HIV self-testing kits fat all North Star clinics in Kenya sent three times, a week apart. The
      investigators compared the number of truck drivers from our sample who came to the clinic for
      HIV testing over a 2 month period following the first text message in the three study arms.
      After completing the study among truck drivers, we followed the same procedures for a sample
      of female sex workers registered in the electronic health record system who were not
      accessing HIV testing regularly.

    <time_frame>2 months following the first text message</time_frame>
    <description>We compared the proportion who tested for HIV during the 2-month follow-up period among participants in the Intervention arm versus those in the Enhanced Standard of Care (SOC) arm (primary comparison) as well as among those in the Enhanced SOC versus those in the Traditional SOC arms (secondary comparison) to look at the impact of the content of the text message (i.e. about self-testing kits or HIV testing in general) and of the number of text messages (3 versus 1) on HIV testing, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>We also looked at differences in clinic contact for any reason (i.e., for HIV testing or some other service) between the three groups to see if the text messages brought more clients to the clinic even if some chose not to test for HIV.</description>

    <description>We also looked at whether the differences in HIV testing by study arm were modified by HIV testing history (whether the client had an HIV test at a North Star Alliance clinic in the past year).</description>

    <description>The primary intervention consisted of a text message informing participants that HIV self-test kits were available at all North Star Alliance clinics in Kenya. The message was sent three times, one week apart, first in Kiswahili, then in English and then again in Kiswahili, and read: &quot;You can now self-test at home or in the clinic for HIV using a new test kit available from all North Star Alliance clinics in Kenya. Your health, our priority.&quot;</description>
