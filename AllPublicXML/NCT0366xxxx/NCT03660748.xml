  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, uncontrolled pilot study of 20 participants; each group
      will receive a different dose of MET-3. Each group will have 4-6 females, 4-6 participants
      with BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m² and the remainder with BMI 35-39.9 kg/m.
