    <textblock>
      500 patients will be prospectively recruited to undergo a fast breast MRI examination. The
      women will be recruited for the study will meet the following criteria: 1. status post
      primary breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy 3 years prior to recruitment
      2. negative DBT examination six months prior to recruitment 3. all breast densities 4.
      clinically asymptomatic - no palpable masses, focalthickening, or clinically significant
      discharge We will identify these patients EPIC database utilizing the date of their last
      mammogram. The patients will be sent a letter explaining the study and the opportunity to
      enroll in the study. Interested patients may contact our research coordinators by the phone
      number provided in the letter. The study recruitment information will also be shared with
      referring physicians. Physicians may also directly refer patients to the study.

    <textblock>
      Women treated for primary breast cancer who undergo breast conservation therapy face an
      increased risk of developing a second breast cancer in the ipsilateral and the contralateral
      breast. Although mammographic screening is recommended annually, the sensitivity of
      mammography is limited in these patients due to the post treatment changes from previous
      surgery and radiation. We propose supplemental screening with an abbreviated form of breast
      MRI (&quot;fast MRI&quot;) examination in addition to mammographic screening, in order to study whether
      we can detect subclinical disease that may not be detected on mammography or on physical
      examination. Several tumor characteristics correlate with overall survival such as the extent
      of local recurrence and the size of the local recurrence, with larger extent and increased
      size of local recurrence correlating with adverse survival. In addition, the shorter time
      interval to the ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence from completion of treatment, is
      associated with increased risk of developing distant metastasis and breast cancer mortality.
      We will assess additional cancer detection with fast MRI after negative mammography in the
      ipsilateral as well as the contralateral breast. The goal of the supplemental screening with
      fast breast MRI would be to detectsubclinical disease not detected on mammography and thus
      improve patient outcomes.
