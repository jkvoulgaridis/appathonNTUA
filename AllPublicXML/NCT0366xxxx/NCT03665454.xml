  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug
      PF-06412562 compared to the current medical standard of care medication for Parkinson's
      disease, carbidopa/levodopa. This research also is being done to find out if the
      investigational drug PF-06412562 can help improve the motor (movement) function, alertness,
      and cognitive (thinking) skills of people who are considered to be in the advanced-stage of
      Parkinson's disease. In this study, PF06412562 is 'investigational,' which means that it is
      experimental and has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but can
      be used in clinical research studies such as this one.

      The investigators are conducting a randomized, double-blind, carbidopa/levodopa-controlled
      crossover safety, tolerability, and efficacy study of the investigational compound,
      PF-06412562, in advanced Parkinson's patients. The primary purpose of this study is to test
      the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug PF-06412562 compared to the current
      medical standard of care medication for Parkinson's disease, carbidopa/levodopa, in these
      patients. This secondary purpose of this research is to find out if the investigational drug
      PF-06412562 can help improve the motor (movement) function, alertness, and cognitive
      (thinking) skills of people who are considered to be in the advanced-stage of Parkinson's
      disease. This study will inform the field as to whether PF-06412562 is safe and
      well-tolerated in advanced Parkinson's patients, and also may provide preliminary data on its
      efficacy in several domains.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will participate in study for 2 consecutive weeks. Days 2-3 of Week 1, they will be blindly and randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms (study drug PF-06412562 or standard of care carbidopa/levodopa). Whichever treatment arm they did not receive during Week 1, they will receive during Days 2-3 of Week 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Investigational Drug Services, which is the investigational drug pharmacy at Hershey Medical Center, will be preparing and dispensing the drug. They will be the only party that is unblinded. Pfizer will provide placebo pills that are identical in appearance to the PF-06412562 study drug. The standard of care treatment, carbidopa/levodopa, is different in appearance to PF-06412562 and its corresponding matching placebo. In order to blind for this, Investigational Drug Services will encapsulate the carbidopa/levodopa pills. Thus, subjects may receive either an encapsulated carbidopa/levodopa pill or an empty non-active capsule, depending on the treatment arm and dosing they are scheduled to receive.</masking_description>
