  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects upwards of 800,000 Americans every year and has an enormous impact on the
      well-being of the American Veteran population with 6,000 new stroke admissions every year.
      Many of these stroke survivors are living with walking disabilities. Gait problems result in
      inability to function independently, high risk of falls and poor quality of life.
      Unfortunately, current gait rehabilitation treatments are limited and many stroke survivors
      do not achieve full recovery. Therefore, it is critical to develop new approaches to enhance
      gait rehabilitation methods. The investigators propose to evaluate a brain stimulation
      treatment called transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) that can be added to physical
      therapy. tDCS has been applied for arm rehabilitation after stroke with positive results, but
      gait-related investigations are lacking. The investigators will test whether simultaneous
      tDCS and gait training produces greater improvement in walking abilities than gait training
      alone. Adjunct tDCS therapy may improve outcomes, and reduce cost of both rehabilitation and
      post-stroke care.

      Current rehabilitation methods fail to restore normal gait for many stroke survivors leading
      to dependence on others, recurrent falls, limitations in community ambulation and poor
      quality of life. The main objective of this study is to test both efficacy and
      neurophysiological mechanisms of a novel approach to treat persistent gait deficits after
      stroke with a combination of simultaneous non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and gait training. The investigators will enroll chronic
      stroke subjects (&gt;6 months) with gait deficits. Subjects will be randomized to 10 sessions of
      either active tDCS+gait training or sham tDCS+gait training. Gait training will be
      accomplished in the treadmill-based Virtual Reality environment targeting longer single limb
      stance with the paretic limb. The primary outcome measure will be both gait speed and single
      limb stance duration. Other outcome measures will assess various components of gait-related
      functional domains. The study will also characterize neuroplastic brain changes in response
      to bihemispheric tDCS combined with gait training based on corticospinal excitability using
      motor evoked potentials and functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI).
