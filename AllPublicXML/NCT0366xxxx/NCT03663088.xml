  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In North America, children and adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) are rarely referred
      for a rehabilitation program whereas the European guidelines stated that scientific evidences
      concerning scoliosis specific physiotherapy exercises were strong enough to recommend the use
      of these exercises at an early stage. The objectives of this pilot study is to assess
      feasibility of conducting a larger randomized control trial (RCT) on the effect of global
      postural re-education (GPR) on scoliosis progression (Cobb angle) and posture, back pain and
      participation and to assess the equivalence of two groups of GPR interventions. A convenience
      sample of 60 adolescents with IS (Cobb angle 15ยบ-50ยบ, Risser sign โค3) will be recruited at
      CHU Sainte-Justine. Participants will be randomly allocated to GPR-A (individual sessions
      once a week) or GPR-B (individual sessions once per two weeks alternately with class
      exercises once per two weeks) for 6 months. After 6 months, groups will be interchanged for
      another 6 months. Feasibility outcomes will be recruitment rate, consent rate, completion
      rate and adherence to treatment at 12 months. The primary outcome of the effect of GPR will
      be the Cobb angle. Secondary outcomes will be: posture, back pain and participation at 6 and
      12 months. Statistical analyses: For feasibility, percentage of eligible patients recruited,
      percentage of recruited patients who completed the trial and adherence to treatment will be
      calculated. For the preliminary effects of GPR, linear mixed-models will be used to assess
      differences in groups' changes from baseline, to 6 and 12-month while adjusting for
      covariates (age, Risser, adherence). Separate analyses will be conducted for each outcome.

    <description>Adherence with GPR treatment will be measured by the physiotherapists using the validated 3-item Sport Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale (SIRAS, were total score varies from 3 (low adherence) to 15 (high adherence)). We will also compute presence/absence to therapy and we will use a patient/parent logbook for home exercises. Good adherence (compliance) to treatment will be achieved if a participant has a score of at least 12 out of 15 on the SIRAS 80 % of the treatment sessions, is present to therapy 80% of the sessions and completes home exercises 80% of the time.</description>
