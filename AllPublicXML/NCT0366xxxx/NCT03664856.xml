  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The law of February 2nd 2016, known as Claeys-Leonetti, reformed the legislation of the end
      of life. It establishes in particular a right of the patient to deep and continuous sedation,
      makes advance directives binding but refuses access to euthanasia. It states that artificial
      hydration and nutrition are treatments and not cares, which means that they can be stopped
      once they are deemed unnecessary, disproportionate or have no other effect than artificial
      maintenance of life.

      While a number of personalities from all walks of life were heard during the parliamentary
      debate, it was found that patients were not asked about main issues under discussion.
      Therefore, the investigators found it useful to collect their opinions in the context of
      individual interviews.

      A feasibility study was carried out among 40 patients, which demonstrated the feasibility of
      such project. This study is the subject of an article which is currently submitted to the BMC
      Palliative Care Journal.

      The main objective is to contribute to the elaboration of the legislation on the end of life,
      to its adaptation to the wishes of the patients. Patients with cancer and palliative care are
      directly affected by the legislation on end-of-life, and it seems legitimate that these
      legislative provisions correspond to their expectations. The aims also to help caregivers to
      act in accordance with their wishes.

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire of life quality (QLQ) is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of palliative (PAL) cancer care patients.
It is a self-questionnaire, to determine the quality of life of the patient. It contains 14 items from 1 to 4. A 15th item, from 1 to 7, gives an overall score corresponding to the quality of life that the patient feels he has.
From a minimal score (15) representing the worst quality of life until the maximal score (63) representing the best quality of life.</description>
