  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regulatory effects of some neuropeptides substance-P (SP), neurokinin-A (NKA), calcitonin
      gene-linked peptide (CGRP) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) )on inflammatory responses in periodontal
      disease has been described; however, the impact of neuropeptide levels are not clearly
      defined in healthy and diseased peri-implant tissues.ın order to evaluate the situation,
      thirty-nine implants that have been loaded over the past 12 months and their symmetrically
      matching teeth were evaluated using a split-mouth study design. Clinical periodontal
      examinations included the Silness-Löe plaque index, Löe-Silness gingival index, bleeding on
      probing, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level parameters were determined.
      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)/Periimplant sulcular fluid (PISF) samples were collected, and
      the levels of the neuropeptides were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      Correlations between GCF/PISF neuropeptide levels and the clinical examination parameters
      were evaluated in the peri-implant/periodontal soft tissues.

        implants were recruited for the present study. The same implant system was utilized for the
        treatments and the clinical treatment procedures were completed by the same two clinicians
        at the Ondokuz Mayis University Dental Faculty between 2011 and 2013.
