      To compare mechanic and thermic stability of pericardium fixated either with 0.6%

      Autologous pericardium for aortic valve reconstruction is treated with 0.6% glutaraldehyde
      for 10 minutes to improve stability (OKAZI technique).

      This study investigates whether treatment with 0.6% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes improves
      mechanic and thermic stability of autologous pericardial tissue. Autologous pericardium
      remaining after aortic valve reconstruction surgery is used.

      To investigate 10 versus 20 minutes treatment of removed original aortic valve tissue with
      glutaraldehyde as a reference.

    <time_frame>4 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>mechanical tests include the use of a universal test machine (MTS Bionix, Department of Bioengineering of Universitaetsspital Basel) for:
uniaxial ultimate tensile strength (UTS) test;
cyclical tensile stretching of the tissue in order to investigate its viscoelastic properties</description>

    <measure>thermic stability by using constant force at linearly increasing temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>constant force at linearly increasing temperature: Thermal stability tests will be conducted on 20 x 4 mm stripes by the imposition of a constant load (approximately 1N) submerged in a saline-solution bath. The temperature of the bath will be increased at a rate of approximately 2.5-5 °C/min, and the sample cross-section will be measured by means of a high-resolution camera (Canon EOS, Japan)</description>

      Leftover tissues from the OZAKI procedure (excess of pericardium and calcified aortic valve
      leaflets) will be fixed in glutaraldehyde in the operation room and stored in sterile tubes
      in Phosphate Buffered Saline(PBS) and transferred at room temperature to the lab where it
      will be stored in a lab fridge at 4°C.
