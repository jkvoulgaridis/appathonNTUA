  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease, which cases the death of
      neurons controlling the voluntary muscles. The death of motor neurons leads eventually to
      muscle weakness and muscle atrophy and as a consequence thereof, ALS patients die in average
      within three years after symptom onset due to respiratory failure.

      No cure for ALS is currently known, and the medical diagnosis and clinical treatment are
      impeded by the lack of reliable diagnostic tools for objective disease assessment, and by the
      limited insight in disease pathophysiology since the underlying disease mechanisms still have
      not been fully elucidated.

      An unbalance in the concentrations of GABA and glutamate, the most important inhibitory and
      excitatory brain metabolites, is suggested to play a role in the disease mechanisms of ALS.
      By applying Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), a magnetic resonance method which allows
      for quantification of brain metabolites, GABA and glutamate concentration can be quantified
      and thus hopefully elucidate their role in ALS disease mechanism.

      Threshold Tracking Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TT-TMS) studies carried out by a single
      research group have demonstrated cortical hyperexcitability (a physiology state in which
      neurons in the cerebral cortex are easier activated) as an early feature in ALS patients. For
      this reason, TT-TMS was suggested as a biomarker of ALS by the research group. However, to be
      able to suggest a test as a biomarker, one must show the test is reliable and reproducible.

      The objectives of this study are therefore: to explore the pathophysiology of ALS by
      investigating the interaction between neuronal networks as assessed by TT-TMS and
      conventional TMS and MRS, and to investigate the reliability and reproducibility of TT-TMS.
      The aim is to examine the utility of TT-TMS and MRS as diagnostic tools for objective
      detection of ALS in the early disease stage.

      The study will include 60 participants in total, subdivided into two groups: 30 healthy
      participants and 30 patients with clinical suspicion of motor neuron disease or ALS. Each
      participant will undergo examination with TMS and MRS, the primary outcomes will be compared
      between the two groups and the results from the TMS examinations and the MRS-scans will be
      correlated.
