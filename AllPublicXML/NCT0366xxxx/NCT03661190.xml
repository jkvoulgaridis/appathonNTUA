  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The START study will investigate the impact of playing a Grammatical Reasoning brain training
      task on overall brain function (cognition) and day-to-day function in people over 50.

      The study builds on existing work that has shown very promising results with brain training
      approaches in older adults. There is good evidence that playing brain training games leads to
      improvements in brain functions including memory and reasoning. There is also a suggestion
      that regular involvement in brain training games might help reduce the risk of cognitive
      decline and dementia later in life. It appears that reasoning, or problem-solving, is
      particularly important as it is one of the first abilities to decline with age. This study
      will use this evidence to target reasoning in a specific brain training task. It will also
      explore the potential role of genetic factors in how people perform in the task.

      The study will compare the impact of a Grammatical Reasoning Task (START) with a control task
      consisting of simple picture-matching. Over 7000 participants will be randomly allocated to
      either START or the control and will be asked to play the task as often as they wish for a
      period of six weeks. Both tasks will be delivered entirely online so people will access the
      study from home on their computers. This will be achieved through our dedicated online
      research platform, PROTECT, which hosts a cohort of over 20,000 older adults who have
      provided DNA samples as part of a longitudinal study.

      This study will measure the impact of the training on cognition and Instrumental Activities
      of Daily Living. Assessments will be completed online at baseline, two/six weeks and six
      months. Overall, this study aims to generate exciting new data about how brain training could
      be included in guidance on healthy ageing.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be a composite measure of cognitive function, created through a combined score of each of the measures described below. The individual measures will be included as discrete secondary outcome measures. All outcome measures will be completed online. They are sensitive to change in cognition, and validated for use in older adults to detect early changes in cognition.</description>
