    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is characterized by diffuse pain around the knee joint.
      This presence of pain is the most common manifestation in sports medicine among adults and
      young people. Women are more likely to develop PFPS. Among the young adult population, it is
      estimated that 13% of the women are affected by PFPS. There is a consensus among clinicians
      that PFPS etiology is multifactorial, including local factors (structures present or acting
      directly on the patellofemoral joint) and nonlocal factors [extrinsic to the patellofemoral
      joint, including proximal factors (hip, trunk and pelvis), and distal factors (ankle and
      foot)]. PFPS is not a degenerative syndrome, and conservative treatment offers good results.
      However, the most appropriate therapeutic approach is still unclear, and the rate of
      nonresponders to treatment is high. One of the possible explanations for failure of the
      therapeutic intervention is that the triggering mechanisms of PFPS are not the same for all
      subjects, and probably some patients cannot be reached by standard treatment. The traditional
      intervention model focuses on the strengthening of the knee extensor muscles, but recent
      literature has pointed out that multi-articular treatment models (i.e., exercises for the
      proximal or distal factors, in addition to exercises for the quadriceps) have shown better
      results. It is believed that the elaboration of treatment protocols based on the PFPS
      etiological factors, combining local and non-local factors, present greater responsiveness
      and results retention, thus reducing treatment failure. Based on this, and due to the lack of
      experimental studies that aimed to compare the effects of a multi-articular intervention
      protocol on specific subgroups in women affected by PFPS, this study aims to evaluate the
      effects of two multi-articular intervention protocols based on exercises (1) for the proximal
      and local factors versus (2) for the distal and local factors on the clinical, functional and
      neuromechanical outcomes of young women with PFPS. Participants of the PFPS group will be
      submitted to one of two intervention models for an 12-week rehabilitation program. Model 1
      will be composed of exercises focusing on local and proximal PFPS factors, and Model 2 will
      be composed of exercises focused on the local and distal factors.

      Participants will be divided into 2 groups (control group: n=15 and PFPS group, n=60).
      Participants of the PFPS group will be classified according to their PFPS etiological
      factors, and as a function of changes at proximal or distal factors. Participants' inclusion
      in the study will be done based on their anamnesis, clinical tests, functional tests and
      strength measures. Participants will be recruited primarily at the School of Physical
      Education, Physical Therapy and Dance of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).
      The PFPS group will be submitted to one of two intervention models based on physical
      exercises, with an 12-week duration, and 2 sessions per week. Model 1 will be composed of
      exercises focusing on local and proximal factors, and Model 2 will be composed of exercises
      focused on the PFPS local and distal factors. Only the PFPS group will receive the
      intervention program, and every intervention model will have 2 participants' groups (group
      with proximal factors and group with local factors). The allocation of each participant's
      intervention model will be randomized. All participants will be submitted to the following
      evaluations: (1) anthropometric measurements (mass, height and thigh length), (2) clinical
      tests (Compression Test and Kujala Questionnaire), (3) single leg squat (kinematic analysis),
      (4) muscle mechanical properties of the knee extensors, external hip rotators, hip extensors,
      hip abductors, ankle plantar and dorsal flexors, foot pronators and supinators [evaluated
      with a manual (Microfet 2) or isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3 Pro)], (5) myoelectric
      properties [evaluated by electromyography (Delsys system)], (6) drop landing test (kinematic
      analysis), (7) patellofemoral cartilage thickness (evaluated by ultrasonography), and (8)
      muscle architecture of the knee extensors, external hip rotators, hip extensors, hip
      abductors, ankle plantar and dorsal flexors, and foot pronators and supinators (evaluated by
      ultrasonography
