      The purpose of the study is to determine the survivorship of robotic-arm assisted MCK medial
      onlay unicompartmental knee arthroplasty implants at two, five, and ten year follow up. Study
      participants will also be asked about their level of satisfaction with their knee function
      following their robotic-arm assisted Unicompartmental Arthroplasty.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients over 21 years of age who underwent primary robotic-arm assisted
             unicompartmental arthroplasty and received a medial MCK onlay implant and are at least
             24 months post-operative.

          -  Patient has signed an IRB approved Informed Consent Form or with IRB approved waiver
             of written consent, patient has verbally consented to study participations.

          -  Patient willing to comply with follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient will be excluded from participation in the study if they are cognitively
             unable to answer questions related to their index procedure and health related quality
             of life forms.

          -  Patient had active infection

          -  Medial MCK onlay implants were implanted without bone cement

          -  Patients did not have sufficient bone stock to allow for insertion and fixation of
             components

          -  Patient did not have sufficient soft tissue integrity to allow for stability

          -  Patient had a neurological or muscular deformity that did not allow for control of the
             knee.
