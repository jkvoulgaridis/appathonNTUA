    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate if up to two injections of plerixafor represent
      a safe and effective strategy to mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ hematopoietic stem
      progenitor cells (HSPC) for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in sickle
      cell disease (SCD) patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative option for sickle
      cell disease (SCD) patients but its use is significantly limited by the lack of compatible
      donors. Gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation
      represents an alternative approach but requires the collection of significant numbers of
      cells. Severe adverse events have been observed in SCD patients after mobilization using the
      standard agent granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and bone marrow harvesting is
      also associated with side effects. The use of a single administration of plerixafor has been
      suggested as an alternative mobilization strategy in SCD but may not mobilize sufficient
      number of HSC. In this study, our primary objective is to assess if up to two injections of
      plerixafor (starting dose level: 240 µg/kg/dose) are safe in SCD patients and can recruit
      enough blood stem cells needed for future gene therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Weight between 50 and 120 kg;

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥70%;

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of sickle cell disease with βS/βS or βS/β0 or βS/β+ genotype;

          -  Must have had one or more of the following events in the 2 year period preceding
             enrollment:

               -  History of ≥2 severe vaso-occlusive pain crises (VOC) (or at least two episodes
                  in the year preceding the setting up of regular transfusion protocol). A severe
                  VOC is defined as an episode of pain lasting more than 2 hours severe enough to
                  require care at a medical facility.

               -  History of ≥1 episodes of acute chest syndrome despite the institution of
                  supportive care measures (i.e. asthma therapy and/or hydroxyurea)

               -  Clinically significant neurological event (stroke) or any neurological deficit
                  lasting 24 hours. A stroke is defined as a sudden neurological change lasting
                  more than 24 hours that is accompanied by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging
                  (MRI) changes.
