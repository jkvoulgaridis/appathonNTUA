  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was attempted to investigate the efficiency of NK cells immunotherapy on non-small
      cell lung cancer with and without EGFR mutation, and evaluated response rate (RR) and the
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      Investigators will enrolle 100 patients who met the enrollment criteria. 50 patients were
      clinically confirmed EGFR mutation positive. They were divided into two groups (group A and
      group C according to if accepted NK therapy) in accordance with the principles of randomized.
      The rest 50 patients which were EGFR mutation negative were also divided into two groups
      (group B and group D) in accordance with the principles of randomized to be paired
      respectively with group A and group C. Comparison of lymphocyte number, serum tumor related
      biomarkers, circulating Tumor Cell (CTC), KPS and survival curves was carried out before
      after NK cell immunotherapy. The safety and short-term effects were evaluated followed by the
      median PDA, response rate assessment.

    <description>Based on the Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors (RECIST), the therapeutic effect was divided into complete response (CR), partial response (PR),stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD). Investigators calculated the sum area of all tumors 3 months after NK treatment. The recent curative effect must have been maintainedat &gt;4 weeks; CR + PR denoted the effective response rate (RR).</description>

    <description>NK cells were generated in good manufacturing practice (GMP) condition. In brief, PBMCs were isolated from 50mL patient's blood with Ficoll-Hypaque(Morecell Biomedical Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Then the Human NK Cell Culture Kit (Cat. No.
MCF-004, Morecell Biomedical Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) and Serum-free Medium for NK Cells (MCM-002, Morecell Biomedical Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) was used for induction of NK cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three days before NK cell transfusion, the NK cells were sampled and sent to detect the NK cell quality.</description>
