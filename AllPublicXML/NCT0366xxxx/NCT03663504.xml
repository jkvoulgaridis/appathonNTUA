      The REaCT NSQIP will compare oral antibiotics vs. no antibiotics, which are two standards of
      care treatments for preoperative preparation of the bowel prior to colorectal surgery

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The divergence of clinical practice guidelines, in addition to observation from the large
      North American retrospective studies, suggest that surgeons and centers have not established
      a standard of care for the preoperative preparation of the bowel prior to colorectal surgery.
      Specifically, some centers are employing no preparation, others are administering a
      mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and oral antibiotics and still others are using oral
      antibiotics alone. Recently, the Canadian Society of Colorectal Surgeons was unable to come
      to a consensus when attempting to update their preoperative guidelines because of the lack of
      agreement on best practice (personal communication). This is an important yet controversial
      topic in colorectal surgery and a clinical trial comparing two standard of care therapies
      will impact current practice in Canada. The REaCT-NSQIP study compares post-operative
      surgical infectious complications, length of stay, incidence of C. difficile rates, patient
      quality of life and cost-effectiveness in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery
      with either no preparation or oral antibiotics. Data will be collected from the National
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and from patient quality of life questionnaires
      preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively

      In this study, it is hypothesized that it is the oral antibiotics, and not the MBP, that is
      responsible for the reduction in postoperative infectious surgical complications (deep or
      superficial surgical site infection (SSI)) in patients undergoing elective colorectal
      resections. This improvement in postoperative infectious complications is not anticipated to
      result in a clinically significant increase in postoperative C. difficile infections or
      antibiotic resistant hospital-acquired infections.

    <description>To evaluate the effects of oral antibiotics on patient quality of life by administering the SF-36 questionnaire, undertaken preoperatively and at 30 days postoperatively. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a 36-item, patient reported survey that is a measure of health status and commonly used in health economics. This SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A low score denounces a worse outcome compared to a higher score that denounces a better outcome. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effects of oral antibiotics on patient quality of life by administering the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, undertaken preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. The EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire consists of two sections; the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). There are 5 levels associated with it; no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The scale range of 1-5 is used for the 5 dimensions in the descriptive system where 1 is the best outcome and 5 is the worst outcome. The Visual Analogue scale records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' at the top and 'the worst health you can imagine' at the bottom. This ranges 0 being the worst outcome to 100 being the best outcome.</description>
