  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of preoperative assessment clinic on prognosis and economic results of
      patients with coexisting diseases, the investigators designed a prospective cohort study. The
      investigators will recruit 250 patients preparing to undergo a selective epigastrium surgery
      with coexisting medical diseases which need an anesthetic consultation. The patients will be
      randomly assigned into two groups. The intervention group will be seen in the preoperative
      clinic before hospitalization, while the control group will get anesthetic consultation after
      hospitalization without clinic service. No additional interventions will be given during and
      after surgery. The length of stay, hospitalization expense, postoperative complication rate
      and mortality rate of the two groups will be compared. The investigator assume that
      consultation in preoperative assessment clinic will improve the prognosis and decrease the
      hospitalization expenses.
