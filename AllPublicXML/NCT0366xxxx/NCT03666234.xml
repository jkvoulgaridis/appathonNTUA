      By mean of registry of newly diagnosed Chinese IPF patients from more than 15 sites, this
      study aims to build IPF prospective cohort, set up normative clinical database and a
      biological specimen bank, and examine the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed Chinese
      IPF patients, as well as the nature history, prognosis, comorbidities and complications of
      IPF patients in China, the current treatment pattern, burden of illness, and quality of life
      of Chinese IPF patients.

    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cause of death:
a. IPF-related: i. Respiratory failure: Pulmonary failure leads to impaired gas exchange, i.e. hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia ii. Acute exacerbation of IPF (as defined below) iii. Other aspects related to IPF (please specify); b. Concomitant conditions: i. Coronary heart disease ii. Cerebrovascular disease iii. Pneumonia/respiratory tract infection iv. Pulmonary embolism v. Pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure vi. Lung cancer; c. Other causes; d. Unknown.
Cause of death will be showed as categorical variable, and the counts and percentile ratios will be statistically counted.</description>

Death
Lung transplantation
Acute exacerbation
Require long-term oxygen therapy
Hospitalization for respiratory reasons
The unit of progression-free survival is day.</description>

    <measure>Description of the acute exacerbations in Chinese patients with IPF</measure>

    <description>Acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF)
Previous diagnosis or simultaneous diagnosis of IPF;
Symptoms generally manifest as dyspnea with acute exacerbations or progression within 1 month;
Chest CT shows new bilateral glass ground or solid shadows on the basis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP);
Exacerbations cannot be completely explained by heart failure or increased volume load.
The incidence of the acute exacerbation will be showed as percentage.</description>
