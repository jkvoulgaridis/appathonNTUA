  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot trial studies how well gemcitabine and nivolumab work in treating
      participants with small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body after
      other treatments have failed. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      second-line gemcitabine and nivolumab may work better in treating participants with small
      cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare response rate (RR) of gemcitabine and nivolumab (G+N) after 4 cycles (8 weeks)
      to historical controls treated with nivolumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare median overall survival (OS) of G+N to historical controls treated with
      nivolumab alone.

      II. To compare median progression-free survival (PFS) of G+N to historical controls treated
      with nivolumab alone.

      III. To evaluate for tolerability of G+N at each treatment cycle and then every 8 weeks after
      treatment is completed.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate immunophenotypic changes among lymphocytes (quantitative measurements of CD4
      and CD8 T-cells) with radiographic response and overall survival before treatment, after
      treatment and between 8-12 weeks after treatment.

      II. Among those patients with tumor mutation burden (TMB) status available, to describe the
      association between TMB (low, medium, or high) and RR, OS, and PFS.

      III. Assess the patient perspective of symptomatic adverse events using self-reported items
      from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, 6-10 weeks, and
      every 8 weeks thereafter.

Changes in T regulatory cell concentrations will be assessed in each arm. These measures will be compared longitudinally to examine whether changes in certain biomarkers are associated with participants who experience an objective response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed incurable SCLC and have
             had prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. High-grade neuroendocrine tumors
             that are suspected to be of bronchopulmonary origin can be enrolled if they have had
             prior treatment with a SCLC chemotherapy regimen (e.g. platinum plus etoposide).

          -  Patients should not be demonstrating end-organ damage due to rapid progression of
             disease based on the most recent assessment of the treating physician.

          -  Patients must have radiographically measurable metastatic disease by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL.

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL.

          -  Chemotherapy agents are known to be teratogenic, therefore women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)-approved informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously received either gemcitabine or an immune checkpoint
             inhibitor can be enrolled.

          -  Emergent need for palliative radiation.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of
             nonsmall cell lung cancer.

          -  History of allergic reaction to gemcitabine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects with chemotherapy. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
