  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients could experience physical limitations, cognitive symptoms, fatigue and pain,
      that could be perceived at diagnosis but may also occur during treatment, limiting the person
      from carrying out their activities of daily living, including work tasks. Return to work is a
      major goal, as it facilitates the patient's ability to deal with the disease and improve
      general health.

      At present, there is no path aimed at supporting cancer patients in the return to work
      process. Because of this, the investigators want to assess the feasibility of a
      multidisciplinary social-health care pathway aimed at manage the difficulties that cancer
      patients might perceive in the return to work process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To receive the support from the social-health care pathway, cancer survivors should go to an
      information desk service (called Informa Salute) located in the hospital. Here,
      sociodemographic and work-related data will be collected with the aim to organize the
      tailored social-health support to facilitate the return to work.

      The social-health care pathway created includes: the local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia
      and the local Order of Physicians, voluntary non-profit associations, vocational and
      educational training bodies, social cooperatives, one labor union and one chartered
      accountant enterprise.
