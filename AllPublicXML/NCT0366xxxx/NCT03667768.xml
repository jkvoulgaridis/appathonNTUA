  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this bi-center study was to evaluate the retention and caries-preventive effect of
      Atraumatioc Restorative Treatment (ART) sealants, using two glass ionomer cement (GIC) versus
      non-sealant on first permanent molars of schoolchildren. The null hypothesis is that there is
      no difference in the retention rates of the two GIC, as well as in caries prevention between
      sealants application and non-sealant. Four hundred and thirty-seven 6-to-8-year-old
      schoolchildren were selected in two cities in Brazil. They were randomly divided into two
      groups, according to the GIC used (Fuji IX or Maxxion). All children had their four first
      permanent molars included in the research and two molars were sealed with a GIC, while the
      other two molars remained unsealed. Clinical evaluations were performed up to 36 months by
      one independent examiner at each city.

    <description>The sealants retention was evaluated clinically using the criteria: 0) fully present sealant; 1) partially present sealant and 2) absent sealant [Oba AA, Dülgergil T, Sönmez IŞ, Doǧan S (2009) Comparison of Caries Prevention With Glass Ionomer and Composite Resin Fissure Sealants. J Formos Med Assoc 108:844-848]. Scores 0 and 1 were considered &quot;success,&quot; whereas score 2 was considered &quot;failure.&quot;</description>

    <description>The examiners evaluated the presence of caries according to ICDAS [Ismail AI, Sohn W, Tellez M, et al (2007) The International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS): An integrated system for measuring dental caries: Methods.

    <description>Two hand-mixed glass ionomer cements (GICs) available in the dental market were used, and they were mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions (powder/liquid ratio 1:1). The molars were cleaned with a toothbrush and wet cotton wool pellets. Isolation was performed with cotton wool rolls and the occlusal surface was conditioned with GIC liquid (20s), rinsed with wet cotton wool pellets and dried with dry cotton wool pellets. GIC was placed on the occlusal surface and pressed into the pits and fissures using the press-finger technique. The excess of material was removed and the occlusion checked and adjusted. Sealant was protected with a new layer of petroleum jelly and the children were instructed not to eat for at least one hour. Children received instructions on how to brush their teeth (1,000-ppm fluoridated dentifrice), as well as advices regarding diet and information about dental caries was given by a dental assistant and those instructions were repeated every 6 months.</description>
