      To describe the design, methodology and baseline characteristics of the Shanghai Cohort study
      of Diabetic Eye disease (SCODE) study, a community-based study to determine the prevalence
      and impact of diabetic eye disease, especially diabetic retinopathy (DR), in adults with
      diabetes living in Shanghai.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Shanghai Cohort study of Diabetic Eye disease (SCODE) was a three-year community-based
      study to carry out a regular ocular health screening and epidemiological analysis for
      diabetic eye disease in the approximately 8,000 middle-aged and elderly people with diabetes
      in Shanghai. Through this study, we hope to understand the prevalence, epidemic trend and the
      features of risk factors distribution on diabetic eye disease, especially on DR.

      Meanwhile, our aims also included estimating the ocular fundus changes and visual impairment
      associated with different grade of DR. Furthermore, the aim of the present study was to
      investigate the association between serum and urine biochemical parameters and DR.

        All the enrolled participants got a yearly examination of diabetic eye disease for three
        years. Considering that the prevalence of DR gradually increases with age, the target
        population included adults with diabetes aged 35 years and above under archives management,
        residing in Shanghai. And the study participants were expected to be freely mobile,
        clear-thinking, and capable of cooperating to complete the ophthalmic examinations.
