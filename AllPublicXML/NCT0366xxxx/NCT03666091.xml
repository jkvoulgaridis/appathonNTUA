  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The French Society of Rheumatology initiated a large national multicenter, longitudinal and
      prospective cohort, ESPOIR, in order to set up databases to allow various investigations on
      diagnosis, prognostic markers, epidemiology, pathogenesis and medico-economic factors in the
      field of early arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

      The primary objective is to set-up a multicentre cohort of early arthritis (less than 6
      months) in France that could serve as a database to studies of various natures.

      Specific objectives are in the following domains:

        -  diagnosis: to help determine among clinical, biological, radiographic and immunogenetics
           those parameters allowing for the earliest diagnosis classification as possible, in
           order to target early therapy;

        -  prognosis: to identify early those patients at risk of severe disease by investigating
           among clinical, biological, genetic and sociologic factors;

        -  medico-economic: to identify the costs and their determinants at various disease stage;

        -  pathologic: to collect a databank of sera, DNA, RNA to allow for studies of
           transcriptomes and other genomics.

      Secondary objectives are twofold:

        -  to monitor adverse events, particularly rare drug adverse events, in collaboration with
           other international studies

        -  to allow access to the data collected in this cohort study in order to facilitate new
           projects submitted to and approved by the scientific committee.

      All patients were referred to each regional center every 6 months during the first 2 years,
      then every year. Procedures were set up to avoid patients lost to followup as much as
      possible. At baseline and at each visit, we recorded data for a set of clinical and
      biological variables recommended for the management of early arthritis. At each visit,
      rheumatoid arthritis was classified according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology
      (ACR) criteria and retrospectively to the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      criteria.

      At each visit, patients completed function and quality-of-life self-administered
      questionnaires including the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI),
      Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales version 2 short form, a medico economic questionnaire,
      and globally assessed disease, pain at rest and pain during motion on a visual analog scale
      (VAS). Patients underwent radiographs of the hand and wrist (face) and foot (face and
      oblique). Radiographs were stored in the radiological coordinating center (Brest) and then
      were evaluated by the van der Heijde-modified Sharp score. Serum, DNA, urine, were collected
      at baseline. Serum and urine were also obtained at each follow-up visit. They were then sent
      and stored in adequate and definite conditions in the biological coordinating centre
      (Paris-Bichat).

    <description>Evaluation by Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). The following categories are assessed by the HAQ-DI: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, common daily activities. The patients report the amount of difficulty they have in performing some of these activities. Each question asks on a scale ranging from 0 to 3. Increasing scores indicate worse functioning with 0 indicating no functional impairment and 3 indicating complete impairment.</description>

    <description>Evaluation by EUROQOL five dimensions three levels (EQ-5D-3L). The EQ-5D-3L essentially consists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale (0-100) where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>

    <description>Evaluation by MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (MOS-SF-36) The MOS-SF-36 taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. Each dimension has a scale of 0 to 100. A low score reflects a poor quality of life.</description>

There are 26 items, including upper-extremity functioning, lower-extremity functioning, affect, symptoms, social interaction, and role. Scores for the different domains are summed and can then be converted to a range of 0-10. Higher scores indicate poorer health.</description>

    <description>Structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components.The SHS method evaluates, in each hand, 16 areas for erosions and 15 areas for JSN, and, in each foot, 6 areas for erosions and 6 areas for JSN. The erosion score per hand joint can range from 0 to 5. JSN and joint subluxation or luxation are combined in a single score, from 0 to 4. The maximal score for erosion and JSN are 160 and 120, respectively, for the hands and 120 and 48, respectively, for the feet. The maximal total SHS is 448.</description>
