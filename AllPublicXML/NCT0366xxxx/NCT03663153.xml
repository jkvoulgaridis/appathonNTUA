    <textblock>
      Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women worldwide. Semaphorin4C (SEMA4C) has
      previously been identified as a highly expressed protein by breast cancer-associated
      lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). The objective of this study is to investigate SEMA4C's
      potential role as an early relapse biomarker in breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women worldwide, with approximately 1.68
      million new cases, and 0.52 million deaths, annually. Meanwhile the incidence of breast
      cancer continues to increase. Although regular clinical examination, mammography,
      ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging can detect some recurrence patients, the lack
      of robust biomarkers for monitoring of anti-tumor therapies and detection of recurrence
      reduce the treatment effectiveness of current strategies for breast cancer.

      Semaphorin4C (SEMA4C) has been previously identified as a highly expressed protein by breast
      cancer-associated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) using in situ laser capture
      microdissection of lymphatic vessels, followed by cDNA microarray analysis. Moreover,
      membrane-bound SEMA4C is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) to release a soluble form
      of this protein. The study is undertaken to explore SEMA4C's potential role as an early
      relapse biomarker in breast cancer.
