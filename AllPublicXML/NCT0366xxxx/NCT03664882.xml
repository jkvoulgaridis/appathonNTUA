      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the aggravation of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms in the
           presence of pollutants is observed using an Environmental Exposure Unit.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of fexofenadine hydrochloride in subjects suffering from
           seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms aggravated in the presence of diesel exhaust
           particulates.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of a single dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Males or females between the ages of 18 and 65 suffering from seasonal allergic
             rhinitis provoked by ragweed pollen.

          -  Having a 2-year history of seasonal allergic rhinitis with positive skin prick test to
             ragweed allergen at screening with a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than that
             produced by the negative control.

          -  Subjects with antecedents of allergic seasonal allergic rhinitis symptom aggravation
             when exposed to pollen and air pollutants (i.e., cleaning products, diesel, paints).

          -  Subjects having a total nasal symptom score ≥3 in Period 1 (Visit 2).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  History of anaphylaxis to ragweed pollen.

          -  History of asthma. Mild asthmatics treated only with pro re nata short-acting
             beta2-agonists, 2 doses or less per week can be enrolled.

          -  History of chronic sinusitis.

          -  History of systemic disease affecting the immune system.

          -  Evidence of any active or suspected bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infections
             within 30 days prior to allergen challenge.

          -  Any history of Grade 4 anaphylaxis due to any cause as defined by the Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event grading criteria (&quot;Life threatening
             consequences: urgent intervention indicated&quot;).

          -  Presence or history of drug hypersensitivity to fexofenadine.

          -  Subjects receiving build-up injections of pollen allergen immunotherapy (those on
             stable maintenance dosing can be included).

          -  Subjects taking any forbidden treatments/nutriments.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
