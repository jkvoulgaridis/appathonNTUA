    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To measurement by number of patient performing correct exercise has 3 exercise 10 steps and number of patient performing incorrect exercise has 3 exercise 10 steps. to compare the accuracy when osteoarthritis knee patients do rehabilitation using mobile application actuated rehabilitation exercise guidance and routine rehabilitation exercise guidance.If the patient is able to perform at least 8 times (80%), the patient will be define as corrected physical therapy, We compare the correction of physical therapy between the groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction of rehabilitation method</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the satisfaction of rehabilitation method after rehabilitation program of physical therapy by questionnaire. The satisfaction score has 5 point.
The 1 point mean the least satisfaction of patient to the method. The 2 point mean the less satisfaction of patient to the method. The 3 point mean the moderate satisfaction of patient to the method. The 4 point mean the much satisfaction of patient to the method. The 5 point mean the most satisfaction of patient to the method.</description>
