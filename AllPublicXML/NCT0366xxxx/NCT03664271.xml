  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to increase families' understanding of eczema and improve
      eczema management in the primary care setting. The investigators plan to create an
      educational video for families providing general information about eczema as well as
      instructions about good skincare management and common treatments. The investigators will
      conduct a randomized controlled trial of the plan in the primary care clinic at Boston
      Children's Hospital. Specifically, the investigators aim to (1) decrease eczema severity (2)
      improve patient and family quality of life (QOL) and (3) increase parental knowledge about
      eczema and eczema management.

    <time_frame>3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>change in caregiver knowledge pre-post as assessed by a questionnaire. This is not a standardized tool, but rather a series of 22 questions about caregiver comfort and understanding of eczema. Some responses use a likert scale format, while others are multiple choice questions. There are 8 multiple choice questions, each of which has one right answer. Those can be totaled to determine percentage correct.</description>
