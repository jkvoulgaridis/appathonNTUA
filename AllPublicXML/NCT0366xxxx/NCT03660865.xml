  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate, for the visual correction of aphakia, the
      safety and effectiveness of the RxSight Light Adjustable Lens (LAL) and Light Delivery Device
      (LDD) to reduce postoperative refractive error and improve uncorrected distance visual acuity
      in eyes with prior corneal refractive surgery. A control group consisting of fellow eyes
      implanted with a commercially available monofocal IOL will be used to compare the safety and
      effectiveness of the LAL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must sign a written Informed Consent form and be willing to undergo cataract surgery
             for the bilateral implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL).

          -  Between the ages of 40 and 80 inclusive on the day the cataract surgery is performed.

          -  History of Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), Photorefractive Keratectomy
             (PRK), Laser-Assisted Subepithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK), Epi-LASIK, or Epi-LASEK
             more than 1 year prior in both eyes.

          -  Cataract causing reduction in best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) to a level
             of 20/40 or worse with or without a glare source in both eyes.

          -  Willing and able to comply with the requirements for study specific procedures and
             visits.

          -  Able to complete a written questionnaire in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of Intacs, RK, CK, AK, Phakic IOL (ICL), Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE),
             or Corneal Inlay in either eye.

          -  Pre-existing macular disease in either eye.

          -  Patients with sufficiently dense cataracts that preclude examination of the macula in
             either eye.

          -  History of uveitis in either eye.

          -  Evidence of ectasia in either eye.

          -  Previous intraocular surgery in either eye. Eyes with previous pterygium excision are
             permitted as long as the pterygium did not extend more than 2mm onto the cornea from
             the limbus.

          -  Subjects taking systemic medication that may increase sensitivity to UV light such as
             tetracycline, doxycycline, psoralens, amiodarone, phenothiazines, chloroquine,
             hydrochlorothiazide, hypericin, ketoprofen, piroxicam, lomefloxacin, and methoxsalen.
             LDD treatment in patients taking such medications may lead to irreversible phototoxic
             damage to the eye. This is only a partial list of photosensitizing medications. Please
             evaluate all medications that the patient is taking for this effect prior to
             consideration for implantation.

          -  Subjects taking a systemic medication that is considered toxic to the retina such as
             tamoxifen.

          -  History of ocular herpes simplex virus in either eye.
