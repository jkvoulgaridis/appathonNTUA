  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine the impact of three different types of
      psychosocial support delivered by mental health professionals to pre-operative joint
      replacement patients. This study will examine the differential effects of brief mindfulness
      training, hypnostic suggestion, and cognitive behavioral pain psychoeducation for
      pre-operative patients, with a supplemental nonrandomized usual care comparison group.

    <measure>Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to and following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most intense pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>Pain Unpleasantness Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to and following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most unpleasant pain imaginable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Medication Desire Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to and following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no desire for pain medication and 10 representing a strong desire for pain medication.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to and following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no anxiety and 10 representing very anxious.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Functioning Item Bank, v2.0</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 6 weeks prioir to surgery and at the 6-week outpatient follow-up appointment.</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS physical functioning computer assisted test draws from a bank of 123 items all scored on a 5 point Likert scale.
T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A high score better physical functioning.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately prior to and following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Three Likert scale item ranging from 0-30, with 0 indicating no nondual awareness and 10 representing complete nondual awareness. Items can also be used individually. Item one is a single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no relational unity and 10 representing complete relational unity. Item two is a single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no annihilational unity and 10 representing complete annihilational unity. Item three is a single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no bliss and 10 representing complete bliss.</description>
