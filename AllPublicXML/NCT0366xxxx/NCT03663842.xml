      Objectives: To analyse the effects of sciatic neural mobilisation, in combination to the
      treatment of the surrounding structures, on pain and disability. Secondly, to investigate
      baseline characteristics that may be associated with improvements in pain and lumbar
      disability. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica were treated
      with neural mobilization, joint mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. Pain intensity and
      lumbar disability were assessed at baseline and after treatment using a Numerical Rating
      Scale (0-10) and the Oswestry Disability Index (0-100), respectively. The pre- and
      post-intervention data were compared.

    <description>Assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).It consists of 10 items addressing different aspects of disability. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing greater disability. The sum of the item scores is divided by the total possible score (50 if all sections are completed), and the resulting total is multiplied by 100 to be described as a percentage score.</description>
