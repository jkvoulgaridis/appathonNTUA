      A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) using a cross-over (repeated
      measures) design to evaluate safety and efficacy of three foam wound dressings in the local
      management of chronic wounds.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in an outpatient setting of an academic clinical center over a
      total period of four weeks (28 days, -1/+2).

      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate and compare three different foam dressings in the local
      management of chronic wounds (i.e. venous leg ulcers (VLUs) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs))
      in an outpatient setting. A bordered, five-layer, flexible foam dressing with soft silicone
      adhesive technology will be evaluated versus a hydropolymer, adhesive foam island dressing
      and a multi-layered, hydrocellular foam dressing with silicone adhesive, within three focus
      areas; efficacy and safety of the dressings, participant-centric outcomes and health economic
      evaluation.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective RCT using a crossover design to evaluate safety and efficacy. The study will be conducted in an outpatient setting of an academic clinical center. There will be two participant groups: those with VLU and those with DFU. Approximately 50% of the participants will be in the VLU group and 50% of the participants in the DFU group. Treatment sequence will be randomized so that a fair distribution is achieved. Each participant will receive a 2-week treatment with one of the three dressings followed by a 2-week treatment period with a second dressing (i.e. each participant will receive treatment with two different dressings, either the Bordered Five-Layer Foam Dressing and the Hydropolymer Foam Dressing, or the Bordered Five-Layer Foam Dressing and the Hydrocellular Multi-Layer Foam Dressing) using a cross-over (repeated measures) design, with a total of four study arms.</intervention_model_description>
