    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if Hylenex recombinant leads to changes in the insulin
      time-action profiles and glucose responses when preadministered in the setting of continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared to CSII without Hylenex recombinant (sham
      injection).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a recognized need for more rapid insulin action than is available from current
      rapid-acting analog products. In addition, current products have inconstant absorption and
      action profiles over the course of infusion set life. Previous human studies of prandial
      insulin preparations have used co-mixtures of rHuPH20 (study drug) with insulin delivered to
      study participants by subcutaneous injection and have demonstrated acceleration of insulin
      absorption and action. CSII has been used clinically for the treatment of diabetes over the
      last three decades, and a previous study using a co-mixture of rHuPH20 during CSII showed
      that the combination resulted in a more consistent and ultrafast profile of insulin
      absorption and action across infusion set use as compared to rapid analog insulin alone.

    <description>Time to reduction is reported as the maximum time it took for any participant receiving each treatment sequence to achieve a reduction in plasma glucose by 80 mg/dL. During the course of the study, it became difficult to establish a stable hyperglycemic plateau with a target glucose level of 220 mg/dL, even after adjusting several operational parameters. The study was stopped early, prior to enrolling the planned 24 participants for Part 2. Thus, analysis for this endpoint was not conducted. Raw data (as a maximum) are reported.</description>

        <description>Time to reduction is reported as the maximum time it took for any participant receiving each treatment sequence to achieve a reduction in plasma glucose by 80 mg/dL. During the course of the study, it became difficult to establish a stable hyperglycemic plateau with a target glucose level of 220 mg/dL, even after adjusting several operational parameters. The study was stopped early, prior to enrolling the planned 24 participants for Part 2. Thus, analysis for this endpoint was not conducted. Raw data (as a maximum) are reported.</description>
