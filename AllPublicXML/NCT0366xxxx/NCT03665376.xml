  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of ERAS is to enhance the recovery of patients, and this has secondary effects,
      such reduced length of hospital stay, minimal postoperative complications and lessen
      readmission rates. ERAS protocols have been shown to be feasible and safe across the world.
      Although it has been shown to be effective in the developed settings and can potentially
      reduce the length of hospital stay, and the cost of healthcare in the perioperative period.
      The multimodal program of ERAS has been less implemented in the low and middle income African
      countries. Studies done outside Uganda (Egypt and South Africa) have demonstrated that ERAS
      program can be feasible and yields favorable outcomes in patients.

      The efficacy of ERAS has been demonstrated in resource rich settings but limited evidence is
      available from resource poor settings. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility
      and test efficacy of ERAS in reducing length of post-operative hospital stay and the
      incidence of postoperative complications compared to the standard of care as the control
      group.

      33 participants above 18 years of age, undergoing laparotomy, were randomly assigned to an
      intervention (ERAS) arm or to a control (standard surgical care) arm at Mbarara Regional
      Referral Hospital in Uganda. The ERAS and the control arm had 16 and 17 patients
      respectively, followed-up 14 days after surgery.

      Patients in the ERAS arm had 2.4 days (SD 0.7) of post-operative hospital stay shorter than
      those in the control arm, p=0.0025 (4.1±0.2 vs 6.5±0.6 respectively). 18.8% of patients in
      the control arm developed post-operative complications compared to 5.9% in the ERAS arm
      (Statistical insignificance, p=0.34). ERAS patients passed flatus eight hours earlier than
      patients in the control arm, and mobilisation out of bed happened 12 hours earlier in the
      ERAS group p value=0.4.

      ERAS is feasible at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, and it leads to reduced hospital stay
      duration but not post-operative complications in laparotomy cases.

    <description>Preoperative: No carbohydrate drink loads, no antithrombotic prophylaxis; Mechanical bowel preparation as needed; Spinal anaesthesia, fluid therapy and antibiotherapy done according to standard hospital practice. The urinary catheter and drains were removed at the discretion of the surgeon. Postoperative: Enteral feeding delayed by the auscultation of bowel sounds. The standard hospital practices involve keeping active the nasogastric tube, fasting patients postoperative, strict bed rest… Pain control was managed with medication of choice by surgeon and anesthesiologist.</description>
