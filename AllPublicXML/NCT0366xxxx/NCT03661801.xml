  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively asses established biomarkers in the diagnosis
      and prognosis of patients and will include assessment of a number of biomarkers, genomics and
      proteomics.

      A prospective observation study examining the clinical utility of novel pleural fluid, biopsy
      and serum biomarkers for the investigation of pleural effusions (INVEST). The INVEST study
      will collect blood, pleural fluid and tissue samples from donors, allowing the opportunity to
      apply several novel blood and pleural fluid tests with interpretation of results in the
      context of clinical data and diagnostic suspicion. Through the prospective application of
      multiple tests, we aim to validate the sensitivity and specificity of existing biomarkers and
      identify novel markers that aid in the diagnostic pathway of pleural diseases. Because
      samples and data will be stored for future use, many other different tests, methods and
      techniques may be used in the future to provide information that we cannot foresee.

    <description>All study samples will be analysed with specific laboratory based techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA, or luminex assay.
- Existing biomarkers will be prospectively evaluated based on the underlying disease:
Mesothelin
Procalcitonin
Brain natriuretic peptide
Fibulin
Osteopontin
ADA
additional markers will be included on the panel depending on the patient's underlying disease this could include inflammatory markers, cancer related peptides and immune cell profiling.
The above tests have been demonstrated in the BTS Guidelines in pleural disease entitled &quot;Investigation of a unilateral pleural effusion in adults&quot; to have utility in the diagnosis of infectious, malignant, tuberculous and heart failure related effusion.
Samples will also be processed for the identification of novel markers with diagnostic or therapeutic importance. Specific cell population will be measured with flow cytometry to detect the immune response of different</description>

      For patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion or thickening, an extra 10ml blood and 10 ml
      fluid will be taken for study purposes when these samples are collected for clinical
      purposes. For these patients undergoing pleural biopsy, as part of their clinical care, an
      extra sample will be taken for the trial. For patients with suspected lung cancer, one extra
      biopsy sample will be taken when the participants have their diagnostic bronchoscopic biopsy

        This is a prospective single centre study looking to recruit 300 participants to help
        prospectively evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of known diagnostic biomarkers and
        discover novel biomarkers in pleural diseases. Patients aged 18 or over, requiring
        investigation and/or management of any undiagnosed pleural effusion or pleural thickening
        will be approached about the study within Oxford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.
