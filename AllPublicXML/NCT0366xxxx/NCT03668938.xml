  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous study that involved the intervention of the occupational therapist (OT) on complex
      patients both in hospital and at home showed the effectiveness of OT during hospitalization.
      The effectiveness was not demonstrated in the post-discharge phase. Now, the investigators
      presented a RCT to compare the levels of social reintegration between the intervention group
      and control group. The hypothesis is that the intervention group obtains a higher and
      clinically relevant level of social reintegration compared to the group treated with the
      usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the previous study, the intervention group achieved higher gains in the return to normal
      life than in the control group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.
      Because of this, a new study was implemented with the correct sample size, defined through
      the previous study. In addition, the post-discharge phase the COPM was administered to define
      new objectives relating mainly to productivity and leisure time areas. Finally, the
      investigators have indentified some territorial services with the aim to create tailored
      paths/interventions for patients to promote social reintegration.
