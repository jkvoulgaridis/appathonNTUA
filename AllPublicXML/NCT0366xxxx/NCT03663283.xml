  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if peripheral nerve block with liposomal
      bupivacaine in combination with standard bupivacaine will prolong the duration of block,
      improve pain scores, and decrease opioid utilization in the post-operative period when
      compared to peripheral nerve block with standard bupivacaine alone.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes in
      patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (anatomic and reverse) who receive a
      peripheral nerve block with liposomal bupivacaine in combination with standard bupivacaine
      versus standard bupivacaine alone. Once consent is obtained, baseline characteristics will be
      recorded and patients will be randomized to intervention or control. Following surgery,
      patients will be followed until their 3-week post-operative visit. The primary outcome
      measure will be the mean difference in patient pain scores over the first 72 hours
      post-operatively between two groups. Secondary outcomes will include: (1) Total opioid
      consumption (as measured utilizing morphine intravenous equivalents) in first 72 hours and at
      3 weeks (2) Patient perceived duration of block determined as the time patient perceives
      complete resolution of block (3) Patient satisfaction with pain control at 72 hours, 3 weeks
      post-operatively and patient reported outcome measures (SANE, SST, ASES, VR-12) at 3 weeks
      post-operatively.

    <masking_description>The pharmacist will prepare, and dispense the medication sequentially. Medication syringes will be blinded utilizing black tape. Patients, care team in recovery, study team members collecting and recording data, and statisticians will be blinded to randomization assignment. All patients will be documented in EMR as receiving liposomal bupivacaine to ensure the blind is maintained and to ensure that safety features in the EMR for all patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine are activated. Further, all additional standard precautionary measures (e.g. wrist band) will be similarly implemented for both patient groups.</masking_description>
