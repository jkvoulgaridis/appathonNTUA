  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discrimination between cardiac and non-cardiac causes of dyspnea can be challenging, causing
      excessive delay before adequate therapy. In clinical practice lung ultrasound (LUS) is
      becoming an easy and reliable noninvasive tool for the evaluation of dyspnea and can shorten
      the time to diagnosis .However the reproductibility of this test was not extensively studied.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter-observer reproducibility of LUS performed by
      ED residents in the evaluation of cardiac causes of acute dyspnea.

      Patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea will be prospectively enrolled in this
      study. In each patient, LUS was performed by two ED residents blinded to clinical diagnoses.

      AHF was determined on the base of clinical exam, chest x-ray , brain natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) and echocardiographic findings.

      A patient lung comet score (LCS) was obtained by summing the number of comets in each of the
      scanned spaces.

      Then the probability of AHF was defined as :

      low probability (LCS&lt;15) intermediate probability (15 &lt;LCS&lt;30), and high probability (LCS&gt;30
      ).
