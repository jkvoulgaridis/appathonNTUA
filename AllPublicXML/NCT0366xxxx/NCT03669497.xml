    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional phase I/II study which will be done at Tata Medical
      Centre, Kolkata. Total 30 eligible female patients, ≥18 years of age, with locally advance
      invasive carcinoma of breast, not amenable to curative surgery of metastatic breast cancer,
      planned for palliative loco regional radiotherapy will be enrolled in the study amongst which
      patients with left sided breast cancer (at least 10) will be recruited to study the
      feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing. Once consented, all
      patients will have regional baseline PET-CT scan of breast and tissue biopsy along with blood
      sampling done before studying radiotherapy. Planning Ct scan will then be taken, with
      standard planning CT scan for right breast cancers with implementation voluntary breath hold
      technique for the left breast disease. All patients will be treated with hypo-fractionated
      radiotherapy with schedule of 26Gy on 5 Fractions over 1 week with 6Gy simultaneously
      integrated boost with incorporation of breath hold technique for left breast disease. All
      patients will be assessed weekly during course of radiotherapy. The toxicity will be assessed
      using CTCAE version 4 and LENT SOMA toxicity criteria and the impact of the hypo-fractionated
      breast radiotherapy schedule on quality of life in advanced incurable breast cancer patients
      using FACT B scores PHQ4 questionnaire will also be assessed during treatment and follow-ups
      tissue bio0psy will be taken after 2 hours of completion of 1 st and last fraction of
      radiotherapy and biobanked for future radiobiological tests. Response evaluation will be done
      clinically and by regional PET CT scan using PERSIST criteria in 3 months after completion of
      radiotherapy. After completion of treatment, patient will initially be followed up every
      month for 1 st three months thereby 3 monthly for 2 years and 6 monthly for next 3 years.
