  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually emphasize a behavioural
      approach called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). In this treatment, patients are
      encouraged to face their fears repeatedly and for extended periods of time, with the help and
      support of a caring therapist. Although this is an approach that has been shown to work, many
      patients find the treatment to be difficult; some even refuse the treatment, or drop out
      before improvements are seen. The investigators have been working to develop an alternate
      approach which is just as effective as ERP, but which the investigators think will be much
      more acceptable to those who seek help for their OCD. This study will compare the traditional
      behavioural approach, with the newer cognitively-based approach. The investigators expect
      that the two treatments will both reduce the symptoms and distress of people with OCD, but
      that this newer cognitive therapy will have fewer people who refuse or drop out of the
      treatment, and will be rated as more acceptable. This research will have important
      implications not only for those struggling with OCD, but also for other anxiety-related
      problems where behavioural approaches are typically recommended, including posttraumatic
      stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and other problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a serious and often severe mental disorder and one of
      the leading causes of disability worldwide. Effective psychological interventions for OCD
      exist, but the prevailing option (Exposure and Response Prevention; ERP) has changed very
      little since it was established in the 1960's; moreover, it is associated with unacceptably
      high numbers of individuals who drop out from, or refuse the treatment altogether. This is
      largely because ERP is a difficult treatment, wherein individuals face their fears with
      increasing difficulty over time. Just as with the development from early chemotherapy and HIV
      agents, which were effective, but associated with serious and often severe side effects, it
      is now time to enhance the acceptability of psychological treatments for OCD.

      A novel cognitive therapy (CT) approach is likely to be just as effective as ERP, but
      markedly more acceptable to those who need it. Although CT for OCD is as effective as ERP,
      previously tested CTs have failed to incorporate recent experimental research, novel
      cognitive targets or enhancements to acceptability. Indeed, the investigators recent work on
      treatment acceptability promises to increase the number of individuals who can fully and
      successfully engage with the treatment.

      The purpose of this research is to enhance the acceptability of cognitive-behavioural
      treatments for OCD; the investigators aim to accomplish this via a randomized controlled
      trial comparing traditional ERP against the investigators' novel CT approach. Although the
      investigators expect both treatments to be effective, the primary hypothesis is that CT will
      be significantly more acceptable to participants than ERP; this will be assessed by the
      relative numbers of treatment refusers and dropouts, as well as by participant ratings of
      treatment acceptability.

    <time_frame>Through study completion (week 3; week 6; one week post therapy; 6 month follow-up; 12 month follow-up).</time_frame>
    <description>The TAAS is a validated 10-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess treatment acceptability and anticipated adherence in response to a given treatment for anxiety and related problems. It is intended to be administered to potential treatment recipients after they have received information about the treatment. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 Disagree strongly; 7 Agree strongly) to assess the degree to which participants agree with a variety of statements about a given treatment. Total scores are obtained by summing across all items after negatively worded items (3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10) have been reverse-scored. Scores may range from 10 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater acceptability of treatment and greater anticipated ability to adhere to it.</description>

    <description>The VOCI is a 55-item self-report scale designed to assess obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. It includes six subscales assessing various symptoms associated with OCD: checking; contamination; obsessions; just right; indecisiveness; and hoarding. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 Not at all; 4 Very much), with higher scores indicating higher symptom severity.</description>

    <description>A semi structured diagnostic interview for anxiety disorders and selected other problems (e.g., depression, substance-related disorders).

    <description>This 10-item clinician-administered validated measure consists of two subscales, which assess the severity of participants' obsessions and compulsions and monitors symptom improvement during treatment. Subscale scores are summed with a range from 0 (no symptoms) to 40 (severe OCD), with a score less than 8 considered as subclinical symptomatology, over 16 as clinically significant symptoms, and over 24 as moderate to severe OCD.</description>
