    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nanoparticle albumin-bound
      rapamycin and how well it works when given together with pazopanib hydrochloride in treating
      participants with nonadipocytic soft tissue sarcomas that has spread to other places in the
      body (advanced). Nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin and pazopanib hydrochloride may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin
      followed by a phase II study.

      Participants receive ABI-009 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and pazopanib hydrochloride
      orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days until unequivocal clinical
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until in the opinion of the investigator the
      patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at the patient's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 12
      weeks.

             combination cytotoxic therapies). Neo-adjuvant/adjuvant/maintenance treatments are not
             included for this criterion.

          -  Last dose of prior therapy must have been completed a minimum of 14 days prior to
             start of protocol therapy. All ongoing toxicities related to prior therapy must be
             resolved or grade 1 (except alopecia).

             * NOTE: Toxicities from prior therapy that have resolved with sequalae (e.g.
             hypothyroidism) and are asymptomatic or well-controlled are not exclusionary.

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; upper limit of normal (ULN) mg/dL (Subjects with known Gilbert's
             syndrome and a total bilirubin =&lt; 3 mg/dl are permitted to enroll to phase 2/expansion

                  gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) result at screening and agree to ongoing pregnancy
                  testing during the course of the study, and at the end of study treatment. A
                  highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low
                  failure rate (that is, &lt; 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly, such
                  as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine
                  contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.

               -  Male patients must practice abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual
                  contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while

             days (including radiotherapy and/or surgery) prior to start of treatment in this study
             and should not be receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy for the CNS metastases.

          -  Subjects with hemoptysis, central nervous system hemorrhage or gastrointestinal
