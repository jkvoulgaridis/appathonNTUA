      An open label, randomized, two-period, crossover, study to compare the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of single dose Dexamethasone and Betamethasone administered orally and
      intramuscularly in 48 healthy, adult, female subjects under fasting conditions. This study is
      being conducted in Bangalore, India.
