  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SIED) and the Italian Association of
      Gastroenterologists and Hospital Digestive Endoscopists (AIGO) want to develop an effective
      training program for endoscopists to improve the quality of colonoscopies through careful
      evaluation of quality indicators and how they can be improved with an appropriate educational
      program. Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the variation of &quot;Polyp Detection
      Rate (PDR) and Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR)&quot; obtained by operators at high and low volume of
      colonoscopy before and after a training period. Secondary objectives are to compare high and
      low volume endoscopists' performance before and after training comparing by evaluation of
      withdrawal time; Number polyps / patient and Number adenomas / patient; the percentage and
      time of intubation of the cecum, ; patient's pain perception based on the Nurse Assessed
      Patient Comfort Score (NAPCOMS) scale. The study is structured as follow:

        -  A first phase when all endoscopists collect the results of 200 colonoscopies in an
           electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) is formed(maximum enrollment period 4 months).

        -  A second phase of training through an e-platform in which the endoscopists are offered
           with an online refresh reviewing the international standard parameters to perform a
           quality colonoscopy. Once the final training exam have been passed, the endoscopist will
           be able to access the third phase

        -  A third phase in which the endoscopists will collect prospectively the colonoscopies
           they perform in an eCRF (maximum enrollment period 4 months).

    <description>evaluate tolerability of colonoscopy. NAPCOMS includes 3 domains: pain, sedation, and a global subjective assessment of tolerability. The pain domain is defined by using the dimensions of intensity (0. None or minimal; 1 mild; 2. Moderate; 3 severe), frequency (0. None; 1. Few 1 or 2 episodes; 2. Several times (3-4 episodes); 3. Frequent); and duration (0. None; 1 short duration; 2 Moderate duration; 3 Long duration).
Sedation is rated according to level of consciousness ranging from 0 (wide awake) to 3 (unconscious), whereas the global tolerability score is rated from 0 (very well tolerated) to 3 (poorly tolerated). The overall NAPCOMS was defined as the sum of the severity, frequency, and duration of pain domains. Level of sedation and overall global tolerability ratings were assessed separately A NAPCOMS of 6 or greater corresponded with a patient rating of moderate to severe discomfort.</description>
