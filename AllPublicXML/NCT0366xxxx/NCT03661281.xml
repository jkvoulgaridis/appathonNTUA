  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine function following simulated thumb metacarpophalangeal (MP) and
      thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint fusion. The investigators want to determine the functional
      limitation created by MP and IP joint fusion. 20-30 volunteers will be fitted for custom
      molded orthoplast splints immobilizing either the MP or IP joint. The volunteers will then be
      taken through multiple tests including lateral pinch strength, tip pinch, grip strength,
      grooved pegboard test time, and Jebson Taylor test. Each patient will be tested without a
      splint, with their MP joint immobilized and with their IP joint immobilized. The results of
      this study can be used for patient education before surgery in order to help them make
      informed decisions as well as manage expectations. It can also serve as a decision aid in
      pinch restoration in the context of ulnar nerve palsy.

    <description>Subjects will have their thumb immobilized in 2 prefabricated wrist splints to simulate 2 different fusion positions tested: one splint to simulate the MCP fusion and one to represent the IP fusion. Patients will complete hand function tests in each of the splints to evaluate hand function.</description>
