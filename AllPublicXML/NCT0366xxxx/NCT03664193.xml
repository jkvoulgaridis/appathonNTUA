  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate SBRT is a standard of care treatment for prostate cancer that has not spread to
      distant metastatic sites. Radiation is delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles in 5
      treatment sessions (fractions). Doses ranging from 35-45 Gy in 5 fractions have demonstrated
      good outcomes with acceptable toxicity. In this initial study, MRI guided treatment planning
      and delivery will be used to deliver 7 Gy to the entire prostate and seminal vesicles, with a
      selective boost of additional 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2 Gy per fraction for total dose of 37.5, 40,
      42.5 or 45 Gy to biopsy proven lesions, defined using MRI.

      42.5 or 45 Gy to biopsy proven lesions, defined using MRI.

      Hypothesis: MRI-guided treatment planning and delivery can selectively target high-risk
      prostate nodules and deliver a higher radiation dose, to achieve maximal local control
      without increasing treatment toxicity

    <intervention_model_description>Male patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria below, and electing to undergo definitive radiation treatment with SBRT, will be eligible for participation in this study. Patients will receive 35 Gy in five fractions, in addition, patients will receive a simultaneous integrated boost from 0.5-2 Gy per fx for total dose 37.5, 40, 42.5 or 45 Gy. Patients will also have an option to have a rectal balloon or a rectal spacer prior to receiving radiation therapy. Gastrointestinal/genitourinary toxicities will be assessed at every visit, including quality of life questionnaires and EPIC scores will be assessed at the one month follow up visits.</intervention_model_description>
