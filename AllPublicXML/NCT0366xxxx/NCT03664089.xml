  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) portends an immediate, increased risk for Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM). The increased risk associated with having GDM is compounded by excess weight
      retention. Therefore, the weeks and months immediately after a GDM-complicated pregnancy
      present an optimal window to initiate lifestyle changes to prevent or delay T2DM. The
      long-term goal is to prevent T2DM among women with GDM. This study's objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy of a novel, yet simple, activity-boosting intervention on weight loss among
      women with GDM.

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) portends an immediate, increased risk for Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM). The increased risk associated with having GDM is compounded by excess weight
      retention, a common issue after any pregnancy. Considering excess weight is the best
      predictor of developing T2DM, the weeks and months immediately after a GDM-complicated
      pregnancy present an optimal window to initiate lifestyle changes to prevent or delay T2DM.
      The long-term goal is to prevent T2DM among women with GDM. This study's objective is to
      evaluate the efficacy of a novel, yet simple, activity-boosting intervention on weight loss
      among women with GDM in a parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial (n=80 women/arm,
      N=160). The intervention uses ankle weights (2.5 pounds [1.1 kg]) worn on each ankle during
      routine daily activities (e.g., cleaning, cooking, child care) to increase energy
      expenditure. The central hypothesis, based on existing literature and preliminary data, is
      that postpartum women with GDM will adopt an intervention that requires minimal additional
      time outside of their daily activities. We anticipate that this will result in additional
      weight loss that is clinically significant when compared with controls who only receive
      standard information on recommended physical activity. The rationale for the proposed
      research is that once an intervention that both improves T2DM factors and is easily adopted
      by women with GDM is known, early intervention specific to this restricted timeframe can be
      implemented.
