  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) following single subcutaneous (SC) injection of pembrolizumab Dose A
      versus pembrolizumab Dose C in adults with advanced melanoma. Additionally, the safety and
      tolerability of pembrolizumab SC injections will be assessed. And, finally, the efficacy of
      pembrolizumab intravenous (IV) infusion administration will be assessed.
