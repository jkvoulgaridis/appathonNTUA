  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population in rural Alaska, which is predominately Alaska Native, experiences a
      disproportionately high burden of hearing loss compared to the general US population. The
      impact of untreated hearing loss in early childhood is tremendous and has grave implications
      for school achievement. Preschool children with hearing loss experience speech and language
      delays and are less likely to be ready for kindergarten than their normal-hearing peers.
      Early identification and treatment can reverse these ill effects. Importantly, the majority
      of hearing loss in this age group in rural Alaska is infection-mediated, arising from acute
      and chronic otitis media that is treatable.

      In response, preschool hearing screening is federally mandated at all Head Start centers
      across the country. In accordance with this mandate, hearing screening is already performed
      by the three organizations that offer early childhood education in the Norton Sound region:
      Kawerak Inc, RurAL CAP, and Bering Strait School District.

      While the concept of screening in this age group is well established nationally, what is less
      well understood is the optimal screening protocol for preschool children. There is little
      evidence evaluating sensitivity and specificity of different screening protocols in this age
      group. Further, loss to follow up in the referral stage is a problem in preschool hearing
      screening just as it is in school hearing screening.

      Alaska has already developed innovative strategies to address hearing loss. A network of
      village health clinics staffed by community health aides provide local care, and telemedicine
      has been adopted in over 250 village clinics statewide. Despite being widely available,
      telemedicine has not yet been used to speed up the referral process for preventive services
      such as hearing screening.

      Norton Sound Health Corporation has partnered with Duke and Johns Hopkins Universities to
      evaluate hearing screening and referral processes in early childhood education in the Norton
      Sound region of northwest Alaska. Preschool children will receive screening from the
      preschool and a new mHealth screening protocol. These will be compared against a benchmark
      audiometric assessment to determine sensitivity and specificity. Communities will then be
      randomized to continue the current primary care referral process or to adopt telemedicine
      referral. The primary outcome will be time to ICD-10 ear/hearing diagnosis. Secondary
      outcomes will include sensitivity and specificity of screening protocols and prevalence of
      hearing loss. The goal of this study is to evaluate the optimal screening and referral
      strategy for preschool children in rural Alaska.

    <masking_description>The randomization assignments will be kept confidential within the study team until hearing screening day, when masking the referral process assignment to participants will no longer be possible. All outcome assessors, including audiologists and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons reading telemedicine consults within the Alaska Native healthcare system and study team members performing medical record abstraction, will be masked to intervention allocation throughout the trial. Study team members who read telemedicine consults as a part of their clinical responsibilities will abstain from reading any study-related consults. The results of the preschool screen, mHealth screen, and audiometric assessments will also be masked, such that study team members performing the mHealth screen or audiometric assessment will be masked to the other results.</masking_description>

    <description>In communities randomized to the current primary care process, families will be notified if their children refer hearing screening in exactly the same method each preschool had been using previously. This process involves a letter home to the parents, either sent with the child or by mail, requesting that the parent/caregiver bring the child to village health clinic for an evaluation. Per current practice, most preschools also give the list of referred children to the Norton Sound Audiology Department, whose staff then reaches out to families to schedule appointments during the next available audiology clinic.</description>

Participating children who refer screening will be transported to clinic for their appointment with adult chaperones. Parent participation will be required unless parents direct otherwise. Nonparticipating children in communities assigned to the expedited telemedicine intervention arm will receive standard referral following the current school primary care referral process.</description>
