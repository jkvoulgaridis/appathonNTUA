  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effects of early endovenous glue ablation on ulcer healing in
      patients with chronic venous ulceration. Half the patients are randomized to receive early
      endovenous ablation (within 2 weeks) and a half to standard care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To get the venous leg ulcer to heal, the current best treatment is to wear a multi-component
      compression bandage, with which about 60% of these ulcers will heal within 24 weeks. There is
      evidence that treatment of the varicose veins by surgery will prevent the ulcer from
      returning after it has healed. Recent studies have suggested that newer techniques of
      treating varicose veins, such as sclerotherapy, laser or radiofrequency in an outpatient
      setting may help the ulcers to heal more quickly and reduce the chance of the ulcer
      recurrence. The aim of this study is to see whether early treatment of varicose veins using
      endovenous glue embolization helps with healing.
