  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to extend our previous research to longitudinally examine the effectiveness of
      intervention programs (FCIP and UCP) for VLBW preterm children in Taiwan at seven years of
      age. Gender and maternal education level matched term children will also be included to serve
      as the reference group for comparison of developmental outcomes. The intervention had been
      delivered from birth to one year of corrected age in the previous study. Effectiveness
      examined will include child and parent outcomes. Primary outcome refers to measures of child
      neurobehavioral and neurophysiological functions. Neurobehavioral assessment includes
      cognitive, motor and behavioral measurement. Neurophysiological assessment refers to
      electroencephalogram/event-related potential examination and cognition/motor dual tasks that
      will be used to investigate the neurological pathways underlying the effective intervention.
      Secondary outcomes refer to child growth and health, and the quality of parenting measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm children present more cognitive impairments, psychological and behavioral problems,
      motor and coordination impairments than their term counterparts. These impairments may cause
      the difficulties of learning and adaptation at the school age when facing multiple and
      complicate environmental stimulations in preterm children. Accumulating data on early
      intervention for preterm infants in Eastern and Western countries have demonstrated short- to
      medium-term benefits on enhancing child neurodevelopment outcomes. However, rare studies have
      examined the effectiveness of early intervention for preterm infants and its underlying
      neural mechanism. To meet the contemporary concept of family centered care, we have developed
      a family-centered intervention program (FCIP) for preterm infants with very low birth weight
      (VLBW, birth weight &lt;1,500 g) in Taiwan and have found short-term developmental benefit with
      respect to a usual care program (UCP) via a multi-centered, randomized controlled trial.
      Therefore, this three-year project is aimed to continuously follow-up the effectiveness of
      FCIP on child and parent outcomes in VLBW preterm infants at school age. A total of 275 VLBW
      preterm children (269 participants and 6 pilots) who had participated in our previous
      randomized controlled study and 45 term children will be assessed growth, health,
      neurobehavioral functions (cognition, language, motor and behaviors), electroencephalography
      and event-related potentials (in the resting state, cognitive inhibitory control and working
      memory procedures) and cognition/motor dual tasks at 7 years of age. Parents will be assessed
      for stress using the Parenting Stress Index/Long Form and quality of life with the World
      Health Organization Quality of Life- Brief Taiwan Version. The effect of early intervention
      for preterm children from the neonatal period to school age will provide important
      information to help medical professionals and public policy makers design effective
      intervention for Taiwanese preterm children. The continuous neurophysiological and
      neurobehavioral data are crucial for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms
      underlying neurobehavioral changes following intervention.

    <measure>Child: Neurodevelopment- The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSIR-IV) measures cognitive development of children aged from 6 years to 16 years and 11 months old. The test structure of WPPSIR-IV includes 14 subscales and several levels of interpretation: verbal comprehension index, perceptual reasoning index, working memory index, processing speed index and full scale intelligence quotient. The scaled score of each subscale ranges from 1 to 19. The total scaled score is the sum of the subscale scores ranging from 10 to 190. The full scale intelligence quotient will be converted from the total scaled score with a higher value indicating a better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Assessment Battery for Children- 2nd Edition examines the motor performance in children aged 3 years to 16 years and 11 months. The assessment contains eight items that measure a child's performance of age-appropriate tasks in the aspects of manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance. The scaled score of each subscale ranges from 1 to 19. The total score is the sum of the raw scores of the subscales and can be converted to scaled score, ranging from 10 to 190, and percentile. A higher score indicates a better performance.</description>
