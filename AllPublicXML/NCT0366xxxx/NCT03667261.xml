  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First and second molar locations present major challenges when immediate implant placement is
      planned due to large extraction sockets that are difficult to seal without mucoperiosteal
      flap reflection which is less comfortable to patient and also crestal socket morphology not
      amenable to standard healing abutment which have circular shape and the possibility of high
      occlusal forces during function with complete provisional crown.Immediate implant placement
      without sealing socket abutment has several drawbacks, such as collapse of existing soft
      tissue and also it needs second stage surgery which is less comfortable to patient and chair
      time consuming for the operator.

      The anatomical changes that occur with the alveolar ridge after the loss of tooth can be a
      challenge to redevelop during the restorative process. The preservation of the soft tissue
      level from the time of extraction may optimize the final prosthetic outcome. One technique
      that can be used to achieve ideal tissue form is immediate dental implant placement with a
      custom-healing abutment.

      Immediate implant placement followed by immediate provisional restoration of single sites is
      a protocol used to replace a failing tooth. This technique may benefit patients with a thin
      periodontal biotype. Another benefit is the simplification of the final restorative
      procedure. Pre-fabricated healing abutments are circular in shape. Attempts at molding the
      tissue from a small opening above the implant to a contour similar to the missing tooth can
      take time. The preserved tissue profile can be easily duplicated in the impression process
      and allow for an accurate fabrication of a restoration in harmony with ideal tissue
      architecture at the day of insertion.

      This form of maintenance of the supporting gingival tissue has been demonstrated to be
      beneficial using immediate pontics for tooth replacement. Preservation of form, rather than
      re-creation, is achieved with the extension of the pontic into the subgingival zone with a
      contour replicating that of the extracted tooth. Concepts from immediate pontics have been
      applied to immediate dental implants with a similar goal. This is achieved with either a
      custom healing abutment or a complete provisional crown. The use of a custom-healing abutment
      is recommended in patients who have a deep anterior bite, who present with signs of bruxism,
      or who have a malocclusion that is not conducive to the protection of an immediate
      restoration.

    <description>The PES comprises the following five variables: mesial papilla, distal papilla, curvature of the facial mucosa, level of the facial mucosa, and root convexity/soft tissue, color and texture at the facial aspect of the site. Using a 0-1-2 scoring system, 0 being the lowest, 2 being the highest value, the maximum achievable PES is 14 at time of surgery and at the time of final prothesis.
All ten parameters are assessed by direct comparison with the contralateral tooth and a score of 2, 1, or 0 is assigned to all ten parameters. Thus, a maximum total PES of 10 can be reached which represents the optimum condition of the soft tissues of the rehabilitated site compared to the characteristics of the contralateral natural tooth.</description>

    <description>Sealing Socket Abutment (SSA) serves as a mechanical barrier to isolate the grafted area, stabilize the clot and contain the graft material, and seal the socket from foreign contaminants and also minimizing the risk of premature loading of the implant during healing. By preparing an SSA fabricated to follow the transmucosal contours of the natural tooth, the grafted area can be sealed and separated from the growth of soft tissue without the use of a membrane or releasing incisions</description>
