      The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of apatinib combined with S-1
      on advanced pancreatic cancer patients after failure of first-line chemotherapy.

      1. To observe the curative efficacy of apatinib and S-1 on patients by analyzing the data
           of overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), the rate of
           progression free survival (PFS), levels of CA19-9 and VEGFR in serum [Time Frame:
           Evaluation at 2 month intervals through study completion from the date of study entry
           until the date of progression, up to 1 year].

        2. To observe any adverse events, including abnormal clinical symptoms and vital signs,
           abnormal laboratory examinations, and to record the clinical features, severity,
           occurrence time, duration, management and prognosis of all subjects during the clinical
           study, and to determine the correlation between these adverse events and the
           experimental drugs. . The safety of drugs used in advanced pancreatic cancer was
           evaluated by CTCAE v4.0
