      The aim of this study was to compare of the effects of different fixation methods on
      deepithelialized gingival graft wound healing. Laser doppler flowmetry method was used to
      determine for blood perfusion changes. 40 patients were devided into two groups randomly and
      deepithelialized gingival graft procedure was performed and healings were evaluated by laser
      doppler flowmetry.

      This study evaluates the effects of different fixation methods on the early healing period of
      deepithelialized gingival grafts placed for non‐root coverage gingival augmentation by laser
      Doppler flowmetry Forty patients were assigned to study groups: 1)test : tissue adhesive or
      2) control group: suture. Forty patients completed the study. Blood perfusion in the
      recipient site was measured by laser doppler flowmetry on the day of surgery and at 3 and 7
      days after surgery. Quality of life and pain at recipient sites were also investigated.

    <description>In this evaluations, we did not evaluate the total range we used subscale pain evaluation by visual analog scale. visual analog scale consisted of 10 units,in combination with a graphic rating scale.On the visual analog scale,the left and right end of the graphic represented the absence of pain (minimum 0)(score 0) and the most severe pain (maximum 10) (score 10),respectively. Patients were warned to complete the visual analog scale taking into consideration the intensity of their pain in the previous 24 hours on all recall days</description>
