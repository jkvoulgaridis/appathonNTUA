  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to identify common pharmacogenetic biomarkers predisposing children with
      cancer to develop hepatic VOD during their cancer treatment including HSCT. The impact of VOD
      occurrence and significant biomarkers will also be evaluated on outcome at day 100 and one
      year after HSCT. It should help to highlight factors that can contribute to the initiation of
      hepatic VOD.

      Understanding mechanisms of this toxicity and to know individual parameters of disease
      susceptibility becomes an important issue in the care of these children. The ultimate goal of
      research in this area would be to develop a personalized predictive medicine and, hopefully,
      prevent the occurrence of VOD from a therapeutic adaptation to each patient according to his
      pharmacogenetic profile (adapted prophylaxis, dose adjustment, drug combinations ...). A
      prospective identification of patients at risk of hepatic VOD will increase the safe use of
      anticancer.

    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) in children with cancer is source of
      veno-occlusive disease (VOD). This complication is unpredictable and serious by involving the
      vital prognosis of the child. In addition, this complication may affect the patient's quality
      of life and have serious long-term sequelae. The incidence varies from 15 to 60% and the
      mortality is greater than 60% after severe VOD. The risk factors of occurrence of these
      complications are, to date, unknown except for a susceptibility to some therapeutic
      (busulfan, radiotherapy ...). Pharmacogenetic aspects of hepatic VOD susceptibility are
      supposed and targeted screening supported this hypothesis. But pharmacogenetic predisposition
      to VOD was never explored with as many polymorphisms and considering the whole exome.
