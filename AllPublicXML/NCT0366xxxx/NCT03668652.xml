      The FARP randomized control study will compare focal ablation of prostate using High
      Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) applied by FocalOne® or TULSA® device versus Radical
      Prostatectomy (RP) in patients with unilateral, intermediate risk prostate cancer

    <description>Treatment failure in HIFU focal ablation arm is classified as the need for secondary whole gland treatment as radical prostatectomy or EBRT.
Treatment failure in radical prostatectomy arm is classified as PSA &gt; 0.2 and need for EBRT.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 36 months from the treatment date.</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-c30) for the evaluation of quality of life between focal ablation and radical prostatectomy will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Focal ablation failure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 36 months from the treatment date.</time_frame>
    <description>Focal ablation failure is classified as presence of clinically significant cancer on control MRI-3D TRUS image fusion guided biopsy in the treated prostate zone.
At least 2 targeted biopsy cores will be localized in the treatment zone. Prostate biopsy will be performed at 12 and 36 months from the treatment date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare short, medium and long term adverse events related to treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 36 months from the treatment date</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events will be registered prospectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic failure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 36 months from the treatment date.</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic failure is classified as diagnosis of clinically significant cancer localized outside of treatment zone in treated lobe and in any region of non- treated prostate lobe. MRI and systematic radom prostate biopsy form each prostate sextant will be performed and location of each biopsy trajectory will be registered using Trinity (Koelis) device. Prostate biopsy will be performed at 12 and 36 months from the treatment date.</description>
