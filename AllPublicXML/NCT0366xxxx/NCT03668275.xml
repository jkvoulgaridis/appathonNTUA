  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncological home-hospitalization might be a patient-centred, cost-effective approach to deal
      wiht the current challenges in cancer healthcare.

      The primary aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate patient-reported quality of life of
      patients receiving (partial) oncological home-hospitalization and to compare this outcome
      with patients receiving standard ambulatory hospital care.

      Secondary endpoints that will be evaluated and compared between both randomized groups are:
      Quality of life related endpoints (i.e. distress, depression &amp; anxiety and general
      health-related quality of life); Costs; Safety; patients' reported Satisfaction &amp; Preferences
      and Efficiency for the hospital day care unit.
