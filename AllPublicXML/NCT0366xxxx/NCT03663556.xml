  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are especially vulnerable to gut microbiota disruption and dysbiosis since
      their early gut microbiota is less abundant and diverse. Several factors may influence
      infants' microbiota such as mother's diet, mode of delivery, antibiotic exposure and type of
      feeding. The main goal of this observational study is to evaluate the impact of different
      types of feeding (breast milk, donor human milk and preterm formulas) on the intestinal
      microbiota of preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of
      Maternidade Alfredo da Costa (MAC). Furthermore, the influence of mode of delivery and the
      mother's diet, among others factors, on vertical microbiota transmission will be evaluated.
      After delivery, mothers will be asked to collect their own fecal samples and will be invited
      to complete a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Stool samples will be collected
      from premature infants every 7 days. DNA will be extracted from fecal samples and different
      bacterial genus and species will be analyzed.

      Meconium and the additional 3 fecal samples will be collected from preterm infants by the
      nursing team of MAC Neonatology Unit. Fecal samples will be collected every 7 days, during 21
      days, from diapers into sterile tubes. Mothers will be asked to collect their own fecal
      samples with an appropriate stool collection kit (EasySampler®) and will be invited to
      complete a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, previously validated for the
      Portuguese population.

      Infant-feeding profile (breast milk, donor human milk or formula) of preterm infants will be
      recorded every day to select the most representative (&gt;50 %) type of infant-feeding received
      during the 7 days prior to each fecal sample collection.

      Additionally, detailed clinical data will be collected during the preterm infant enrollment
      in the study. Personal clinical data includes sociodemographic information and clinical
      intrapartum and postpartum outcomes, such as newborn's weight, days of antibiotic exposure,
      number of total days of hospitalization and others outcomes related to the preterm clinical
      evolution.
