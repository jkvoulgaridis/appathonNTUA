      To explore the 2 year PFS of patients with stage III nasopharyngeal carcinoma of pretreatment
      EBV DNA&lt;4000 copy/ml treated with induction chemotherapy followed by reduced-dose radiation
      and cisplatin. The enrolled patients will receive 2 cycles of TPF regimen induction
      chemotherapy, if radiographic CR/PR and EBV DNA=0 after induction chemotherapy, the patients
      will be delivered by 60 Gy IMRT combined with 3 cycles of cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy.
      If radiographic SD/PD or EBV DNA&gt;0 after induction chemotherapy, the patients will receive a
      total of 70 Gy IMRT combined with 3 cycles of cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy.

      The included patients will be treated with 2 cycles of TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and
      60Gy IMRT combined with cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The TPF regimen is consist of
      paclitaxel liposome 135mg/m2 d1, cisplatin 25mg/m2d1-d3 and 5-Fu 3750mg/m2 civ120h, with a
      total of two cycles. Concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy is delivered with dose of 100mg/m2, a
      total of three cycles. The third cycle of cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy is allowed to be
      delivered within one week after IMRT finished.

    <description>QoL scores were assessed for each scale by using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTCQLQ-C30) before induction chemotherapy, before radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, at 3 months after radiotherapy, at 6 months after radiotherapy and 12 months after radiotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Change of EORTC quality of life questionnaire(QLQ) Head and Neck score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
    <description>QoL scores were assessed by using EORTC quality of life questionnaire(QLQ) Head and Neck. The QLQ-H&amp;N35 is composed of seven multi-item symptom scales (pain, swallowing, sensation, speech, eating from a social,perspective, social interactions, and sexuality) and 11 single-item symptom scales (teeth, opening mouth,dry mouth, sticky saliva, coughing, felt ill, pain medication use, nutritional supplementation, feeding tube requirement, weight loss, and weight gain). All of the scales and items ranged in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional or global QoL scale represents a relatively high/healthy level of functional or global QoL, whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high number of symptoms or problems.</description>
