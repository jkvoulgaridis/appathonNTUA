    <textblock>
      The SPD503-315 clinical program has studied the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this
      product in treating symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6-17 through
      short-term, placebo-controlled studies and long-termn, open-label studies. This study will
      more rigorously assess the long-term maintenance of efficacy using a placebo-controlled,
      randomised-withdrawal design. To date, all of the completed studies conducted as part of the
      SPD503 proigram have enrolled subjects from the US. This study is designed to evaluate the
      long-term maintenance of efficacy of SPD503 for the treatment of ADHD in children aged 6-17
      years in Europe, Australia, Canada and US.
