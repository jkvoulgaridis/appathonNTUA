  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the rituximab era, one-third of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients experience
      relapse/refractory disease after first-line anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy (IChemo).
      Optimal management remains an unmet medical need. The aim of this study was to report the
      outcomes of a cohort of refractory patients according to their patterns of refractoriness and
      the type of salvage option. The investigators performed a retrospective analysis, which
      included 104 DLBCL patients treated at Lyon Sud University Hospital (2002-2017) who presented
      with refractory disease. The investigators retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of a cohort
      of 104 refractory patients according to their patterns of refractoriness and the type of
      salvage option.
