  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new type of cancer vaccine called &quot;Personalized
      Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine&quot; as a possible treatment for advanced malignant tumor. The purpose
      of the clinical study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and partial efficacy of the
      personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced
      malignant cancer, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy for advanced
      pancreatic cancer patients.

      It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are
      specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to
      produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that
      these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the
      participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the
      future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time
      points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an
      immune response.
