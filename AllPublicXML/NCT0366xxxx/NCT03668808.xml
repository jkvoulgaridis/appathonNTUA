  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to compare insulin Degludec [TRESIBA® (insulin degludec
      injection)] with insulin Glargine U100 [Lantus® (insulin glargine injection)] to determine
      the basal insulin of choice for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who fly non-stop across
      multiple time zones. With the introduction of Degludec as basal insulin for T1D and the
      opportunity to vary time of injection between 8 and 40 hours, the use of Degludec as a basal
      insulin may make it easier for both people living with T1D and diabetologists to plan
      long-haul travel compared to the use of existing basal insulins when crossing multiple time
      zones.The study hypothesis is that once daily Degludec as the basal insulin will provide
      better glycemic control for people with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections who are
      traveling non-stop across multiple time zones than once daily Glargine U100.

      This study will be an open-label, single center, pilot study. Participants will be randomized
      to either Glargine U100 or Degludec as the basal insulin, then a 2 week break, and followed
      by a cross-over to the other insulin. Each study period will begin in Honolulu, Hawaii (HI)
      (airport code HNL) with a non-stop flight to Newark, New Jersey (NJ) (EWR) lasting
      approximately 10 hours with a 6 hour time difference between destinations. After up to 72
      hours in EWR, participants will return to Honolulu and spend up to 72 hours at that
      destination. Investigators plan to recruit 25 adults with established T1D currently being
      treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI).

             corticosteroids allowed).

          4. Proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment, according to the
             investigator.

          5. Pregnancy, breast-feeding, the intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate
             contraceptive measures.

             could interfere with the results of the trial.

          7. Mental incapacity, psychiatric disorder, unwillingness or language barriers precluding
             adequate understanding or cooperation, including subjects not able to read or write,
             and known or suspected abuse of alcohol, narcotics, or illicit drugs.

          8. Known or suspected allergy to any of the trial products or related products.
