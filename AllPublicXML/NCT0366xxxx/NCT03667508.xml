  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) and slow maxillary
      expansion (SME) in treating posterior crossbite using cone beam computed tomography.

      The study sample will consist of 32 patients who suffer from a skeletal posterior crossbite.
      The sample will be allocated randomly into two groups: RME group and SME group.

      The skeletal and dento-alveolar changes occurring after treatment will be assessed by using
      cone beam computed tomography(CBCT) radiographs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral or bilateral posterior crossbite (PXB) is a common malocclusion. In recent
      decades, RME has gained preference as the treatment of choice for PXB. However, the side
      effects, such as reported pain, relapse of the expansion, tipping of the molars, bone loss,
      gingival recession, and root resorption, have lead some clinicians to prefer SME.

      In this study the investigators will treat PXB using two techniques, RME and SME. Patients
      will be divided into two groups (a technique in each group) to evaluate the efficacy of each
      one using cone beam computed tomography.

      RME group: A Hyrax appliance modified as McNamara will be applied. SME group: A removable
      appliance with central expander will be applied. In order to evaluate the changes occurring,
      two CBCT radiography will be taken for every individual: first, before treatment, second,
      after three months of retention for RME group and one month of retention for SME group

    <description>This will be assessed using cone-beam computed tomography. The anterior maxillary expansion width is measured between RPyP-LPyP (RPyP: Right piriform point.

    <description>This will be assessed using cone-beam computed tomography. The posterior maxillary expansion width is measured between RPaFoP and LPaFoP (RPaFoP: Right palatine foramen point. The most posterior point of the right greater palatine foramen in the maxilla within the palatal cortex. LPaFoP: Analogue to RPaFOPr, left side.)</description>

    <description>This will be assessed using cone-beam computed tomography. The Pterygoid expansion width is measured between PtR and PtL on the images. (PtR. Pterygoideous right. The most caudal point of the apex of the right pterygoid process of the sphenoid. PtL. Pterygoideous left. Analogue to PtR, left side)</description>

    <time_frame>T0: one day before the commencement of treatment; T1: after the end of active treatment and a retention period (which is expected within 14-15 weeks in the rapid expansion group and within 16-20 weeks in the slow expansion group)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using cone-beam computed tomography. The inter-molar width is measured at molar cusps between the right and left teeth.</description>

    <measure>Change in molar tipping</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: one day before the commencement of treatment; T1: after the end of active treatment and a retention period (which is expected within 14-15 weeks in the rapid expansion group and within 16-20 weeks in the slow expansion group)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured in cone-beam computed tomography images. Molar tipping is defined as the difference between (AR-AL) and (CR-CL) CR:Cuspid right which is the mesio-palatal cusp tip of the right maxillary first molar, whereas CL: Cuspid left which is the mesiopalatal cusp tip of the left maxillary first molar.
AR: Apex right which is the apex of the palatal root of the right maxillary first molar, where as AL: Apex left which is the apex of the palatal root of the left maxillary first molar.</description>
