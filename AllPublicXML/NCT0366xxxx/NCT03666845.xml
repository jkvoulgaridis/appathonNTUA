    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study aimed to examine the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine in
      patients with chronic kidney disease after sciatic nerve block.

      Sciatic nerve block for foot and ankle surgery will be performed using ropivacaine under
      ultrasound-guidance, and arterial blood test will be taken for total plasma ropivacaine
      concentration at 2.5, 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes and 2, 6, 24 hours after sciatic nerve block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who need to renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis
