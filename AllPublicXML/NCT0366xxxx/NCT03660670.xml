  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Economic impact of cancer treatments is increasing for years: increase of number of patients
      (385 000 new occurrences in 2015), increase of life expectancies, chronicization of diseases
      and increase of therapeutic innovation costs.

      Oral anticancer drugs allow the ambulatory turn in oncologic treatments, avoid
      hospitalizations dues to injectable chemotherapies and improve patient autonomy. In real life
      situation, these drugs still remain linked to significant drug iatrogenic effects: prevalent
      adverse events and potentially serious ones, drugs interactions for one other patient,
      considered as major in 15-20% cases, and non-observance for 30-50% patients.

      The resultant care overconsumption and the high cost of new oral targeted therapies appear as
      a substantial financial charge to the Health related program. Securing oral chemotherapy and
      their good practice therefore represent a real economic challenge and lead health care
      professionals to develop town-hospital programs of ambulatory patient's follow-up under oral
      anticancer drug in response of third Cancer Plan.

      Benefice of such interventions are proved on observance, management of adverse events and
      drug interactions.

      However, the effectiveness of these programs has not been evaluated and no studies have been
      conducted in France.

      The Investigators propose here to carry out a medico-economic study of high level of proof of
      the ONCORAL program. This study will be the first evaluation of the effectiveness of a
      program for monitoring outpatient oral cancer patients versus usual care.

      The results of this study will contribute to the national reflection on the path of care of
      patients treated by oral chemotherapy, on the assessment of needs and the evolution of the
      supply of care and its financing.

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Score for Therapeutic care</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean scores in SAT-MED Q (Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire) scale will be calculated for each of the two groups. The Sat-Med Q is a self-questionnaire of seventeen questions grouped into six elements; effectiveness, side effects, comfort of use, the general opinion of the patient, evaluation of the effect of the treatment on the patient's daily life, as well as the quality of the follow-up and the information provided by the patients. The answers are expressed on a scale of 5 points. from &quot;No, not at all = 0 points&quot; to &quot;Yes, many = 4 points&quot;. Totaling the direct scores of the items yields a total composite score ranging between 0 and 68. The resultant total composite score can be transformed to a more intuitive and easier to understand metric with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100, using a mathematic expression.</description>

    <measure>Disease representation from patient</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total scores and in each dimension of the B-IPQ (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) scale will be calculated for each of the two groups. The Brief IPQ has nine items. All of the items except the causal question are rated using a 0-to- 10 response scale. Five of the items assess cognitive illness representations, two of the items assess emotional representations and one item assesses illness comprehensibility. Assessment of the causal representation is by an openended response item. A mixed repeated measures model will be realized to estimate its evolution. The link between variation in disease representations between inclusion and final assessment and adherence, dose-relative intensity, and quality of life will be tested using a multivariate linear regression model.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived social support</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This criterion is in the form of 4-level Likert scales, concerning 3 items (support of the person with whom the patient lives in a couple, support of family members, support of friends and relatives), and for each two-dimensional item (psychological support and material support). Each dimension of each item will be analyzed independently. At each measurement, the response will be compared to that given during the previous visit. A break in perceived support will be considered if the response goes from 3 &quot;a lot&quot; to 0 &quot;not at all&quot;, 1 &quot;a little&quot; or 2 &quot;moderately&quot;. At each time, the percentage of patients with perceived support disruption will be calculated for each item and dimension, in each of the two groups, and these percentages will be compared. An analysis of the factors influencing the occurrence of perceived support disruption will be performed using a multivariate linear regression model.</description>
