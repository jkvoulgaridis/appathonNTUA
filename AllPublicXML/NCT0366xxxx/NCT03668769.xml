      This trial studies how well a mobile smartphone application called Quitting Schedule works in
      helping participants to quit smoking. Quitting Schedule is based on WebCASSI, a
      computer-based initiative that offered state of-the-art smoking cessation treatment and
      counseling to MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) patients and served as a portal for
      non-patients to find information regarding smoking cessation advice and treatments. Quitting
      Schedule may help participants to quit smoking.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To adapt the internal algorithms of the scheduled reduced smoking approach in Computer
      Assisted Stop Smoking Intervention for the World Wide Web (WebCASSI) into a smartphone
      application (app): Quitting Schedule.

      II. Once the smartphone app is developed, a pretesting phase with smoker seeking care at
      MDACC Tobacco Treatment Program or another community service such as Equality Texas, Lesbian,
      Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Advisory Board of the City of Houston, Montrose
      Center, Avenue 360 and Lesbian Health Initiative will follow.

      III. To culturally and linguistically adapt Quitting Schedule app into Spanish language.

      IV. To implement a feasibility trial in IDC (Colombia), INCan (Mexico), and INEN (Peru).

      OUTLINE:

      AIM I: Participants follow an individually tailored gradual reduction of smoking schedule for
      5 weeks while MDACC eHealth adapts WebCASSI into a smartphone app: Quitting Schedule.

      AIM II: Participants pre-test the Quitting Schedule mobile smartphone app for 5 weeks.
