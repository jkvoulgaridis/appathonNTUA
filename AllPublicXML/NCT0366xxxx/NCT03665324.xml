  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) are the most common arrhythmias
      of the veteran athlete and have a major impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. Although
      moderate sports practice has been shown to decrease the occurrence of these arrhythmias, it
      has also been shown that very intense athletic activity is associated with an increased risk
      of developing atrial fibrillation. The pathophysiological mechanism is not clearly
      understood. However, it has already been shown that intensive sports practice leads to
      electrical and morphological atrial remodeling, which could be the cause of the occurrence of
      supraventricular arrhythmias for these athletes.

      For sedentary patients, two major tools predict the risk of the onset of supraventricular
      arrhythmia: the electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography (ETT),
      particularly with the study of atrial function by the analysis of myocardial deformities.

      No studies have tested these two tools for the evaluation of atrial remodeling of the veteran
      athlete to predict which ones are at risk of developing supraventricular arrhythmias.

      However, the identification of predictive factors would make it possible to identify at-risk
      athletes and thus provide them with adapted sporting practice advice and personalized
      follow-up.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between atrial remodeling assessed by
      ECG and ETT with the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmia by comparing an athlete group
      with supraventricular arrhythmia with a control group of healthy athletes.

    <description>Subjects will be retrospectively retrieved from the Sport Medicine Service of Rennes University Hospital database.
Medical data will then be collected from the athletes' medical records. The ECG present in the medical file will be reinterpreted to obtain the resting heart rate, the amplitude of the P wave, the morphology of the P wave and the duration of the PR space.
The data from the stress test will be found from reports in the medical records: resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, sustained peak load, arrhythmia during the test.
ETTs will be retrieved from the local server. They will be reinterpreted to collect anatomical and functional cardiac data necessary for the study.</description>
