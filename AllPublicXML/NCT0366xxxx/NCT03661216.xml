  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind study is to determine the effect of reducing oxalates in the
      diet of healthy volunteers by using Nephure, an oxalate-reducing enzyme, as compared to
      placebo.

    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the effect from Nephure in reducing dietary oxalate in healthy
      volunteers on a controlled diet as compared to placebo. Subjects are on a normal diet with
      controlled oxalate (750mg/day) and calcium (550mg/day) levels for 8 consecutive days. The
      study is a cross-over design with two four-day treatment periods. The study intends to
      determine level of reduction in urinary oxalate output as a measure of the effect of Nephure
      on dietary oxalate when ingested with a meal.
