  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arginine methylation mediated by protein arginine methyl-transferases (PRMTs) is an important
      post-translational modification of proteins involved in a diverse range of cellular
      processes. Misregulation and overexpression of PRMT1 (a type I PRMT) has been associated with
      a number of solid and hematopoietic cancers. GSK3368715 leads to inhibition of tumor cell
      growth across tumor types with cytotoxic response observed in lymphoma, acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and a subset of solid tumor cell lines. This study will assess the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), food effect and preliminary clinical activity
      of GSK33368715 in participants with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and selected solid tumors with
      frequent methyl-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficiency. The study will consist of two
      parts. In Part 1 (Dose Escalation) escalating doses of GSK3368715 will be evaluated and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be established in participants with selected solid
      relapsed/refractory tumors. Once a RP2D is identified, a food effect sub-study will be
      initiated to determine the effect of a high-fat, high calorie meal on the bioavailability of
      GSK3368715. In Part 2 (Dose Expansion), this RP2D will be further investigated in two
      expansion cohorts; participants with DLBCL (Expansion Cohort 2A) and relapsed/refractory
      solid tumors including pancreatic, bladder, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)(Expansion
      Cohort 2B). The study includes a screening period, an intervention period and follow up.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is considered to be a DLT if the event is considered by the investigator to be clinically relevant and attributed (definitely, probably or possibly) to the study intervention during the DLT window (first 21 days of intervention, except for Venous thromboembolism (VTE)) and meets DLT criteria for non-hematologic and hematologic Toxicities.</description>

             be measured directly by the size of the tumor or can be evaluated by other methods.
             Availability of a biopsy of the tumor tissue obtained at any time from the initial
             diagnosis to study entry. Although a fresh biopsy, which is obtained during screening,
             is preferred, archival tumor specimen is acceptable if it is not feasible to obtain a
             fresh biopsy. For participants in the PK/PD cohort, a fresh biopsy and consent for one
             on treatment biopsy are required for enrollment. Part 2 (Dose Expansion): Cohort 2A &amp;
             2B: The availability of archival tumor tissue, or willingness to undergo a fresh
             biopsy to determine MTAP status (any archival tumor specimen must have been obtained
             within 6 months prior to starting study drug unless approved by the study Medical
             Monitor). Local MTAP or Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) results are
             acceptable for enrollment, but must be confirmed through central laboratory testing.
             Cohort 2A: Histologically- or cytological-confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL; relapse or

             least 1 measurable site of disease according to the Lugano Classification. The site of
             disease must be greater than 1.5 centimeter (cm) in the long axis regardless of short
             axis measurement or greater than 1.0 cm in the short axis regardless of long axis
             measurement, and clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions. Cohort 2B:

             disease (PD1) monocloncal antibody and refused a second-line regimen despite being
             informed about the different therapeutic options and their specific clinical benefit

             participant needs to sign a specific consent form; at least 1 measurable tumor lesion
             per RECIST 1.1. Transitional cell carcinoma of the Urothelium: histologically or

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies; is not a woman of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) or is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is
             highly effective, with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent, during the intervention period
             and for at least 120 days, corresponding to the time needed to eliminate any study
             intervention(s) (example given [e.g.], 5 terminal half-lives) after the last dose of
             study intervention. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the
             contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. A WOCBP
             must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine as required by local
             regulations) within 7 days before the first dose of study intervention. The
             investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early
             undetected pregnancy. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to
             the following during the intervention period and for at least 100 days, corresponding

             either: Be abstinent from heterosexual or homosexual intercourse as their preferred
             and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to
             remain abstinent or must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below; agree
             to use a male condom and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to
             use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak when
             having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently
             pregnant; agree to use male condom when engaging in any activity that allows for
             passage of ejaculate to another person.
