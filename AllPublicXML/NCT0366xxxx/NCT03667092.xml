  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Midgut neuroendocrine tumours present an increasing incidence and poor survival at 5 years
      with limited therapeutic options for metastatic, non-operable cases. Lu-177 Dotatate,
      targeting somatostatin receptors, is an internal vectorized radiotherapy using Lu-177, an
      ideal radionuclide for peptide radionuclide therapy. In NETTER-1 phase III randomized
      clinical trial, Lu-177 Dotatate proved its superiority in increasing progression free
      survival for midgut neuroendocrine tumors. This study hypothesize that finding biomarkers of
      individual radio sensitivity for this type of internal vectorized therapy would allow
      treatment personalization. The protocol aim at studying transcript variations induced by this
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internal vectorized therapy using Lu-177 Dotatate (abbreviated peptide receptor radionuclide
      therapy) was recently shown to improve progression free survival and response in metastatic
      progressive midgut neuroendocrine tumors (NETTER-1 phase III trial).

      Lu-177 Dotatate is administered as a series of four consecutive intra veinous injections of
      an activity of 7.4 gigabequerel every 8 weeks.

      In order to identify potential biomarkers of radio sensitivity to Lu-177 Dotatate,
      investigators aim to study the stability of gene/miRNA transcripts in the absence of Lu-177
      Dotatate or at 6 months after treatment as well as the variations in transcript analysis
      after 2 Lu-177 Dotatate injections and at the end of the treatment.

      Transcript variation analysis will be confronted and correlated with peripheral blood
      pharmacokinetic studies aimed at calculating time activity curves and provide biodosimetry
      information; other correlations with imaging modalities assessment of dosimetry or disease
      response to treatment or toxicity effects induced by Lu-177 Dotatate will also be studied.
