  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the 5th most common cancer in Europe, with more than 151,000 new cases
      diagnosed in 2012 (4% of the total). Bladder cancer has the highest recurrence rate of any
      malignancy, often as high as 70% within 5 years of successful treatment. This high recurrence
      rate requires diligent and accurate monitoring as a means for early diagnosis and treatment.
      Considering the burden associated to repeated invasive cystoscopies, there is a need for
      robust but accurate tests for surveillance. In that prospect, urinary molecular tests have
      been developed although none were deemed adequate in the European clinical guidelines to
      replace cystoscopies. The Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor Assay is a qualitative in vitro
      diagnostic test designed to monitor for the recurrence of bladder cancer in patients
      previously diagnosed with this cancer. The test provides a fast and accurate result, is
      non-invasive and easy to perform. The aim of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of
      the Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor assay in detecting recurrences in comparison to cystoscopy
      in the follow-up of patients with low or intermediate risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
      (NMIBC).

    <description>The Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to monitor for the recurrence of bladder cancer in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer. It should be used in conjunction with other clinical measures to assess disease recurrence. The test provides a fast and accurate result, is non-invasive and easy to perform.The test utilizes a voided urine specimen and measures the level of five target mRNAs (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, UPK1B, ANXA10) by means of real-time, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).</description>
