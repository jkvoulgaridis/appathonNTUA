  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is a common complain of patients in respiratory clinic and its global
      prevalence was up to 9.6%. Persistent cough of unexplained origin is a significant health
      issue that occurs in up to 5% to 10% of patients seeking medical assistance for a chronic
      cough and from 0% to 46% of patients referred to specialty cough clinics. Previous studies
      showed that sputum prostaglandin D2( PGD2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations were
      significantly higher in chronic cough. And some research showed that Inhaled PGE2 /PGF2α
      /PGD2 / PGI2/ 6-oxo-PGF1a could induced cough. And PGE2 /PGF2α/PGI2/thromboxane A2 (TXA2)
      also increased the sensitivity of the cough reflex. All these five primary prostaglandins
      were synthesized though the metabolism of arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway.
      Indomethacin is a strong inhibitor of cyclooxygenase , which decrease the level of
      prostaglandins in airway. The investigator's preliminary study showed that indomethacin could
      relieve cough and improve cough sensitivity of some patients with refractory cough. Therefore
      this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were designed to investigate whether
      indomethacin can relive cough in patients with refractory cough and to explore the possible
      mechanism of indomethacin in improving cough in patients with refractory cough.
