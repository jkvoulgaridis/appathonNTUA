  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine a e-health resilience based program, JOOL, for chronic spine pain
      patients through the following aims:

      Aim 1: To test the effectiveness of a resilience based program known as JOOL Aim 2: To
      evaluate the characteristics of the participants most likely to benefit from this treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot RCT in which 150 patients with chronic spine pain will be randomized to one
      of two arms: (1) a group that downloads the JOOL mobile application resilience program; and
      (2) a control group.The primary outcome will be a change in physical function.
