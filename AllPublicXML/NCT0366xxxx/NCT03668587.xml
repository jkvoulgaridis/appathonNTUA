  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of NSTEMI in emergency departements represent 10% of the global activity. Since
      the the last European Society of Cardiology recommendation the use of an 1 hour rule-in and
      rule-out protocol is recommended combined with high-sensitivity troponin. But studies show 3%
      of the patients are false negative using this protocol. This study aims at analysing the
      feasibility of this protocol in an Emergency Departement and the security of this protocol if
      combined with a pre-troponin probability score.

    <textblock>
      Chest pain is a frequent reason for consultation in emergency departments. Among
      cardiological causes, quickly diagnosing NSTEMI optimize patient treatment. To do this, the
      European Society of Cardiology, proposed in 2015 an one hour rule-in rule out troponin dosage
      based protocol. These recommendations should allow a faster diagnosis of NSTEMI but also a
      rule-out of patients with a low to moderate clinical probability of coronary heart disease.
      It could also improve efficiency in emergency departements decreasing the length of stay for
      patient consulting for acute chest pain allowing use of medical and para medical time for
      other patients. But the studies on which thoserecommendations are based show up to 3% of
      false negative, which could lead to a higher mortality rate for those patients even if this
      issue hasn't been address yet. Furthermore, the tight schedule in which a blood sample need
      to be withdraw, analyzed and taken knowledge of by the doctor could be an obstacle to the
      feasibility of such protocol in emergency departments usually overwhelmed with patients. The
      aim of this monocentric prospective study is to assess how a pre-troponin clinical
      probability of NSTEMI allowing risk stratification could decrease the false negative rate of
      this protocol insuring safetiness in its use. The secondary objective is to assess the
      feasibility of such protocol in an emergency department with high patient flow.
