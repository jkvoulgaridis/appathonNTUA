      Elderly patients (≥ 60 years of age) are enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria are
      patients which have consented to take part in the study.

      Data such as age, ethnic, education, BMI, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure,
      hearing impairment, vision impairment, depression, sleep disorder, mobility, hemoglobin
      levels, glycemic and lipid profile, as well as comorbidities and drugs used were collected
      from the patients' medical records, laboratory tests and through examination by trained
      examiners.

      Cognition was determined through a combination of several psychiatric examinations using
      validated instruments namely - MiniCog, Clock Drawing Test, Three Word Recall, Alzheimer's
      Disease-8 Indonesia (AD-8 INA) Questionnaire and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
      (SPMSQ).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MiniCog</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on psychiatric examination using the Indonesian MiniCog Questionnaire to determine patient's cognitive status. A MiniCog result below 5 implies mild cognitive impairment, while a result below 3 implies dementia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clock Drawing Test (CDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on psychiatric examination using the Indonesian Clock Drawing Test to determine patient's cognitive status. A Clock Drawing Test score below 4 implies mild cognitive impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Three Word Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on psychiatric examination using the Indonesian Three Word Recall Test to determine patient's cognitive status with resulting score from 0-3. Zero means no words can be recalled by the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer Disease-8 Indonesia Questionnaire (AD-8 INA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on interviews with caretakers using the AD-8 INA Questionnaire to determine patient's cognitive status. An AD-8 INA score of 2 or more implies mild cognitive impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on psychiatric examination using the Indonesian SPMSQ to determine patient's cognitive status. An SPMSQ test in which the patient demonstrated more than 3 mistakes implies mild cognitive impairment, whereas a mistake of greater than 8 implies dementia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on physical examination using the Whispered Sound Test from 6 meters and tuning fork test as well as history of hearing impairment from medical records.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vision Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on physical examination using the Snellen Chart and history of vision impairment from medical records.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on glycemic profile results and history of diabetes from medical records. Patients are classified as diabetic in accordance to the Indonesian Society of Endocrinology and American Diabetic Association criteria.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on physical examination, Indonesian Validated Lequesne Index, Barthel Acitivities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL and history of arthritis or other pathologies affecting mobility from medical records.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on psychiatric examination, Indonesian Validated Geriatric Depression Scale and Medical Records. A score of 5-9 implies a likelihood of depression, while a score of greater than 10 implies depression.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on psychiatric examination, Indonesian Validated Insomnia Severity Index and Medical Records. A score of 8-14 implies mild insomnia, 15-21 intermediate insomnia and 22-28 severe insomnia.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hypertension</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
