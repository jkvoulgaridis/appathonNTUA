      Primary Objective:

      To determine the feasible dose range of Painkyl® required for Taiwanese population.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of Painkyl® by calculating squared mean of pain intensity difference
      at 30 minutes after taking Painkyl® (SPID30, an 11-point scale).

      To evaluate subjects' satisfaction by conducting global evaluation of medication performance
      (a 5-point categorical scale).

      To identify percentage of episodes requiring rescue medication during maintenance treatment
      period.

      To evaluate the safety data of Painkyl® for breakthrough pain.

      The primary endpoint was the feasible range of FBSF required for Taiwanese population. The
      secondary endpoints were the difference in pain intensity at 30 minutes (PID30) after FBSF
      administration, subjects' satisfaction, and the percentage of episodes requiring rescue
      medications.

      Pain intensity was determined using an 11-point numeric scale from 0=&quot;no pain&quot; to 10=&quot;worst
      pain.&quot; Patients were assessed with baseline pain as well as pain intensity at 30 minutes
      after dosing. The PID30 was obtained by baseline pain score minus score rated 30 minutes
      after dosing.

      Patient's satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point (poor, fair, good, very good, and
      excellent) categorical scale at 30 minutes after taking FBSF with the following question:
      &quot;What was your overall satisfaction with the medication?&quot; At each episode of BTP, subjects
      recorded whether a rescue medication was taken after administration of FBSF.

    <description>Time to &quot;optimal&quot; dose of an open-label study medication in the titration phase. During the dose titration period, subjects were administered with FBSF (Painkyl®) in a dose escalation manner until a treatment dose was identified (defined as an adequate relief of BTP observed for at least two consecutive episodes). All patient started with a dose of 200 μg and increased by 200 μg in each subsequent episode until an adequate pain relief with tolerable side effects was achieved.</description>

    <time_frame>During the efficacy phase, at each episode of breakthrough pain, 30 minutes after taking dose of study drug, at 0 and 10 minutes after taking dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>During the efficacy phase participants assessed their pain intensity at each breakthrough pain (BTP) episode at 0 and 30 minutes after taking dose using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 is &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. PID30 is calculated as the difference in pain intensity from time 0 to 30 minutes. A positive value is a decrease (improvement) of the pain; a ≥ 3-point difference is considered as clinically important.</description>

    <description>Participants assessed their subjects' satisfaction of treatment efficacy for treated BTP episodes at 30 minutes after taking dose of study drug. The validated, categorical 5-point Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) was used for this assessment and scored as follows: poor; fair; good; very good; excellent.</description>

    <description>After screening, eligible subjects were individually titrated to an adequate dose of FBSF (titration period) and continued on this dose as required to control their BTP throughout the maintenance period of the study.
During the dose titration period, subjects were administered with FBSF in a dose escalation manner until a treatment dose was identified (defined as an adequate relief of BTP observed for at least two consecutive episodes). All patient started with a dose of 200 μg and increased by 200 μg in each subsequent episode until an adequate pain relief with tolerable side effects was achieved. Doses above 1200 μg were not allowed.</description>

             site of inflammation);

          -  f. abnormal oral mucosa which will impede drug absorption;

          -  h. recent history or current evidence of alcohol or other drug substance (licit or
