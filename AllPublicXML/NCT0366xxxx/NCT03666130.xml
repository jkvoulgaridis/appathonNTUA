      This study aims to compare the two techniques of relieving nasal obstruction, and its
      efficacy in the relief of headache, hyposmia and post-nasal drip and nasal synechiae
      formation and /or other postoperative complications following each techniques of surgery.

      A straight septum is found not to be the dominant but the exception.

      A deviated septum can be asymptomatic or can cause functional and cosmetic abnormality. it
      also can become symptomatic at any age. Deviated nasal septum not only causes breathing
      difficulties but also causes improper aeration of para nasal sinuses leading to infection, so
      any functional or cosmetic disturbance caused by a deviated septum should be treated.
      Different surgeries have been proposed for the correction of deviated nasal septum.
      Initially, submucosal resection of septum was proposed but was later replaced by septoplasty
      .

      Septoplasty is the procedure of choice in nasal obstruction caused by septal deviation
      resistant to medical treatment. It also improves access to the medial meatus in sinus surgery
      and other nasal and sinus procedures, such as cosmetic rhinoplasty and functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery(FESS)

      Modern septoplasty techniques were initially described separately in the early twenties
      century by Killian and Freer. It is conventionally performed under direct visualization using
      a headlight and nasal speculum. However, this method has the drawbacks of relatively poor
      illumination and accessibility and no magnification, calling for a larger incision and
      elevation of larger flaps often on both sides of the septum. As a result, there are higher
      chances of over-resection and over manipulation. Endoscopic septoplasty has been commonly
      performed since the development of endonasal surgery and as as an alternative to the
      conventional technique. In this study the I investigators aim to compare the two techniques
      of relieving nasal obstruction, and its efficacy in the relief of headache, hyposmia and
      post-nasal drip and nasal synechiae formation following each techniques of surgery.
