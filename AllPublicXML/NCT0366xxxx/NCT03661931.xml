  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to conduct a preliminary validation study of the Diet
      Quality Photo Navigation (DQPN) method of dietary intake assessment. In 150 adults, dietary
      intake as estimated by the DQPN will be compared to dietary intake as estimated by a food
      frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and with blood levels of fatty acids, folic acid, and
      beta-carotene as biomarkers of dietary intake.

      The primary aim is to test thee principal hypotheses (n=150):

        1. There will be statistically significant correlations between blood levels of fatty
           acids/folate/beta-carotene and their corresponding levels of dietary intake as estimated
           by the DQPN.

        2. There will be statistically significant correlations between the DQPN and FFQ methods of
           dietary intake assessment. This includes individual dietary components as well as
           overall dietary quality and disease risk assessments.

        3. User experience surveys will demonstrate that the DQPN can be completed more quickly and
           more enjoyably than the FFQ.

      In addition, investigators will assess whether blood levels of fatty
      acids/folate/beta-carotene are similarly associated with the DQPN method and the FFQ method,
      and will measure the test-retest reliability of the DQPN method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical provider has ordered fasting Boston Heart Fatty Acid Balance and
             participation in the Boston Heart Lifestyle Program as part of clinical practice.

          -  Willing to fill out Food Frequency Questionnaire

          -  Willing to complete DQPN Diet IDTM (on-line), and to repeat that 1 week later

          -  Willing to complete user experience surveys about each dietary assessment method

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking fatty acid or vitamin supplements (such as fish oil capsules, or multivitamin
             tablets)

          -  Following a diet outside the capabilities of the DQPN cannot be included in this
             study. The vast majority of eating styles are within the assessment capabilities of
             the DQPN (Standard American, Low-fat, Mediterranean, Pescatarian, Flexitarian,
             Low-carb, DASH, AHA, TLC, MIND, Vegetarian, Vegan, Paleo, Southern).
