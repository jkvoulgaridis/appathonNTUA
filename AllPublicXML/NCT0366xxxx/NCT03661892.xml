    <textblock>
      In patients with cancer induced bone pain, addition of Syndros will improve pain relief and
      decrease opioid requirement.

      This a prospective single arm study enrolling patients with bone metastases from breast
      cancer who have been on opioid therapy for bone pain for at least 4 weeks. All patients start
      on Syndros at 4.2 mg po BID for 3 days, if tolerated without side effects the dose is
      increased to 8.4 mg QAM and 4.2 mg QPM for an additional 3 days. If the patient continues to
      tolerate the medication, the dose will be increased to 8.4 mg BID for the rest of the study
      period (total of 8wks). For patients who have side effects secondary to Sydnros, the dose
      will be decreased. Side effect assessment will be done by the research team 2 days after
      making the dose adjustment. If subject continues to have side effects, dose will be held
      until resolution of symptoms. If the study medicine is held for more than a week
      continuously, they will be taken off the study. In addition, they will have baseline blood
      and urine collected for biomarkers and also complete study related questionnaires (for
      secondary end points). They are also provided an opioid drug diary which they will take home
      during visit 1 to record their opioid pain medication use. Research staff will be calling
      patients on a weekly basis to reinforce opioid drug diary, assess for Syndros side effect,
      and adjust dose of Syndros. At the end of 8 weeks blood and urine is collected again and they
      will complete the study questionnaires.

    <description>To evaluate change in opiate pain medication use after addition of Syndros.Hypothesis: Syndros will decrease the opiate usage by at least 20% at the end of 8wks.
