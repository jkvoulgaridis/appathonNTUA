  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that use of VR combined with standard
      procedural education will result in less pre-procedural anxiety than standard procedural
      education alone among patients undergoing first-time cardiac catheterization. The VR
      technology being evaluated in this study will allow patients to experience a 3-D simulation
      of certain aspects of their upcoming procedure prior to the actual procedure date.
