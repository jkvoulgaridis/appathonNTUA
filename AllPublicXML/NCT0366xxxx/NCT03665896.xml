  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VivaSight™‐DLT is a new OLV (one lung ventilation) device that contains an embedded
      camera. Therefore, a potential advantage is the continuous assessment of DLT position through
      continuous monitoring of the camera. The embedded camera of VivaSight™‐DLT is positioned at
      the tracheal opening of the double lumen tube. It allows for continuous monitoring of the
      carina and bronchial tube placement.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if a double lumen tube (DLT) with an embedded video
      camera, the VivaSight DLT, can be used in similar fashion to the standard double lumen tube
      with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. More specifically, the investigators would like to know the
      difference in time to optimal position in the left bronchus between the VivaSight DLT and the
      standard DLT with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In addition, the investigators would like to know
      if the embedded camera on the VivaSight DLT provides a view that will allow for the optimum
      position of the DLT in the left bronchus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a prospective, randomized study in thoracic surgical patients
      undergoing one-lung ventilation where the patient will receive either the VivaSight DLT or
      standard left-sided DLT. Subjects will be selected and evaluated who are at least 18 years
      old, but no older than 90 years old.

      The investigators will compare the intubation time for the VivaSight™‐DLT with the intubation
      time for standard DLT. The intubation time parameters for the VivaSight™‐DLT are the passage
      of the tube through the vocal cords and the confirmation of proper tube positioning by the
      embedded camera. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is performed to reassess the proper tube
      positioning, however, this will not be counted for the intubation time in this group. For the
      standard DLT, the intubation time parameter begins similarly, on the passage of the tube
      through the vocal cords, but ends with the confirmation of the proper placement by fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy. In both groups, C-MAC blade is used to visualize the passage of the tube
      through the vocal cords. These intubation times will be tracked real-time in the operating
      room and will be based upon both observation as well as the verbal confirmation of the
      attending anesthesiologist.

      The intubation time must be within 5 minutes. The intubation time required more than 5
      minutes is considered as unsuccessful intubation.
