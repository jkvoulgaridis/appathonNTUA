  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-PD-1 therapy provides high response rates in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients who have
      relapsed or are refractory (R/R) to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and
      brentuximab vedotin (BV), but median progression free survival (PFS) is only one year. The
      efficacy of treatment following anti-PD-1 is not well known.

      In this context, the optimal treatment for patients who failed after anti-PD-1 therapy is an
      issue. To better assess their outcome, the investigators retrospectively analyzed the
      characteristics and outcome of patients from 14 LYSA (The Lymphoma Study Association) centers
      who lost response to anti-PD-1 therapy and received additional CT.

        The initial diagnosis of classical HL was established from biopsies in accordance with the
        2008 World Health Organization classification14. We retrospectively analyzed 30 R/R
        classical HL patients from 14 LYSA centers who received anti-PD-1 therapy as part of a
        clinical trial (n=4), from an off-label program authorization for temporary use (ATU) from
        the French medical drug agency (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament, ANSM) (n=22),
        from the Belgian national system for the reimbursement of health care (Institut National
        d'Assurance Maladie Invalidité, INAMI) (n=4).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status from 0 to 2

          -  Patients must be have received: at least 2 prior regimens and have received or be
             ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and must have received prior BV, and at

          -  Patients must have inadequate response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy (progressive disease
