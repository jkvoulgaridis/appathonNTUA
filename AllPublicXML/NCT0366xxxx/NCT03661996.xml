  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single injection (per knee), 8-week study to evaluate the comfort and
      ease of use of 5 different treatment regimens, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a
      single intra-articular (IA) injection, in one or both knees, of 1.0 mg of CNTX-4975-05 in
      subjects with chronic, moderate-to-severe knee OA pain. Procedural pain associated with IA
      injection of the investigational product, CNTX-4975-05, will be controlled primarily through
      adjunct controlled joint cooling and secondarily by pre-medication with IA lidocaine.

          -  Male or female subjects between 40 and 95 years of age (inclusive)

          -  Confirmation of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee: radiography of both knees using
             standard standing films (scored by the investigator) or using the fixed flexion
             method, taken during the Screening Visit of CNTX-4975i-OA-301 or CNTX-4975i-OA-304.

             diagnostic criteria

          -  For subjects for monoarticular knee injection, the index knee must have moderate to
             severe pain at screening associated with OA, which must be stable for a minimum of 6
             months prior to Screening, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Body mass index ≤45 kg/m^2.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Joint replacement surgery of the index knee at any time, or open surgery of the index
             knee in the past 24 months. Joint replacement of the contralateral knee is permitted

          -  Prior arthroscopic surgery of the index knee within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Any painful conditions of the index knee due to joint disease other than OA. Radicular
             or referred pain involving the index knee or from joint disease other than OA
             involving the index knee, such as, but not restricted to chondromalacia patellae,
             inflammatory disease, metabolic diseases, gout/pseudogout, hemochromatosis,
             acromegaly, etc.

          -  Periarticular pain from any cause, including referred pain, bursitis, tendonitis, soft
             tissue tenderness, or subacute/acute pain from injury.

          -  Other chronic pain anywhere in the body that requires the use of chronic analgesic
             medications, including, but not limited to, local painful areas, myofascial pain
             syndromes, fibromyalgia, genetic, metabolic abnormalities, hematologic, or neuropathic
             pain.
