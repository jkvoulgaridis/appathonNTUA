      Aim: To examine the effect of a brief theory-based health promotion intervention delivered in
      the community on health behaviour and diabetes-related risk factors among Danish adults at
      high risk of diabetes.

      Methods: A randomised trial was conducted among 127 individuals aged 28 to 70 with fasting
      plasma glucose: 6.1-6.9 mmol/l and/or HbA1c : 6.0-&lt;6.5% (42- &lt; 48 mmol/mol) recruited from
      general practice in Holstebro, Denmark. Participants were randomised to a control group or to
      receive the intervention delivered over four 2 h group sessions during five weeks, and two
      further sessions after one and six months. Questionnaire data and clinical measures were
      collected at baseline, three months and one year after intervention.

    <description>Participants in the intervention group received the offer of four 2h group sessions during five weeks, and two further sessions after one and six months. The attendance rates of the sessions were 95%, 88%, 87%, 73%, 67% and 51%, respectively. The course was delivered by health care staff in the Holstebro Health Care Centre, including a dietitian and an occupational therapist, both with health pedagogic competences. It was delivered to seven intervention groups, which varied in size from 5 to 15 participants.</description>
