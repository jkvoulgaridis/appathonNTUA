  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the increase of
      soft tissue thickness around single implants installed in maxillary esthetic area with the
      use of Leucocyte-Platelet rich Fibrin (L-PRF) membranes. The sample is of 42 individuals,
      where the control group (n = 21) will receive single implant placement only, while the test
      group will receive single implant placement with L-PRF membranes.

    <textblock>
      The greatest challenge in implantology is to achieve a satisfactory esthetic result. A new
      platelet concentrate protocol, named Leucocyte and platelet-rich Fibrin (L-PRF), has been
      developed in France. Research has shown positive results using L-PRF during implant
      placement, as improving soft tissue healing and bone formation, leading to higher esthetic
      level and greater implant stability. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the use of PRF
      associated to implant placement in esthetic area presents superior aesthetic result and soft
      tissue thickness increase when compared to implant placement without graft. Forty-two
      patients requiring single implant placement in the esthetic area of the maxilla will be
      randomly divided into test group (implant + L-PRF) and control group (implant without graft).
      Surgical procedures will be performed by a single operator. The rates of soft tissue
      thickness, esthetic and comfort will be evaluated at baseline and 3 months after the
      procedure.

    <measure>Gain of peri-implant soft tissue thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>A single investigator, who is not the operator, is responsible for the measurements of the patients. The examiner will be judged calibrated. The calibration will be made by examination of soft tissue thickness of 5 patients, twice, in a range of 48 hours. The correlation test will be used to verify the reproducibility of intra-examining measures, with a maximum value of 0.8. To ensure that the measures at baseline and postoperative evaluation will be performed at the same place, we will use a stent, made of condensation silicone (Optosil - Heraeus Kulzer), so as to cover the edentulous region and the regions of interest described by Zeltner et al. (2017). During measurements of soft tissue thickness, the stent will be used so that the tissue perforation site will be standardized, according to a marking on its surface. An endodontic spacer will be used for tissue perforation, and the thickness will be evaluated using a digital caliper.</description>

    <description>The patient's blood will be collected and the tubes (4) will be inserted into a tabletop centrifuge (Kasvi). Using a 2500rpm for 12 minutes protocol, the leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin clot will be prepared using a kit consisting of a perforated metal box where the clots will be positioned and covered by a metal plaque. The pressure exerted on the clot will lead to the formation of L-PRF membranes, which will be used to cover the ridge after placement of the implant. Then, the flap will be sutured.</description>
