  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to characterize the relation between skeletal muscle mitochondrial
      metabolism and muscle health in elderly, physically compromised humans. To study this
      relation, we will perform a cross-sectional study in well-defined, distinct subject groups.
      Thus, to obtain insight in the relation between mitochondrial health and muscle function, we
      will not only compare subjects that differ in mitochondrial function (based on physical
      activity) but also select for subjects with high- versus low muscle function.

      Aging is associated with a decline of mitochondrial and skeletal muscle volume, -quality and
      -function. If a causal link exists between the loss of mitochondrial function and muscle
      health is unknown, however, both appear with advancing age and are associated with the loss
      of functional capacity, which increases comorbidities and annual healthcare costs. We aim to
      test the hypothesis that a compromised muscle function in sedentary elderly is related to an
      impaired mitochondrial health. A detailed characterization of mitochondrial metabolism and
      muscle function is performed in well-defined, (physically compromised) elderly humans, in a
      cross-sectional design. To obtain insight in the relation between mitochondrial health and
      muscle function, we will not only compare elderly subjects that differ in mitochondrial
      function (based on physical activity) but also select for elderly subjects with high versus
      low muscle physical function. Healthy, young (20-30 years,) individuals with normal physical
      activity levels will be included as absolute controls.
