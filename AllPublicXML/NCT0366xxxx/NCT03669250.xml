  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 period cross-over study to evaluate
      CVN058 target engagement by measuring auditory evoked potential mismatch negativity (MMN)
      downstream to 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3) as a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker.

      Male and female subjects with schizophrenia, age 18 to 50 years old, inclusive, will be
      randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences (Table 2.a) to receive 1 of 3 dose regimens in each
      period: a single oral administration of CVN058 (15 mg or 150 mg) or matching placebo. The
      sequence will determine the order in which a subject will take each of the 3 regimens.
      Discontinued subjects may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor so that approximately
      20 completed subjects are available for analysis.

      The study includes three 1-day treatment periods, with a minimum of 7-day washout, maximum 10
      day washout (2 total washouts, after Periods 1 and 2) between periods, and a 7-10 day
      follow-up call post dosing of the last period. Subjects may be inpatients or outpatients at
      the discretion of the Investigator.
