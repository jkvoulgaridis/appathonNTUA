  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of efficacious research-based interventions for sexual and gender minority (SGM)
      older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, combined with the
      heightened risk of cognitive impairment in this population, presents a significant public
      health problem. SGM older adults are at elevated risk of social isolation and experience
      significant barriers to healthcare access. Existing interventions for older adults with
      dementia have been found to be effective for caregiving dyads. Yet SGM older adults, compared
      to heterosexuals, are significantly less likely to be married or to have biological family
      members to support them. A significant proportion of SGM older adults living with dementia
      have no caregiver or care network. The goal of the proposed research is to design and pilot
      test the cultural appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of an innovative
      translation of a personalized care network-RDAD (Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease)
      to support those living with dementia without a family caregiver, directly addressing unique
      SGM-specific risk factors.

      We will address the following aims:

      Aim 1. Develop a personalized care network-RDAD intervention suitable for SGM older adults
      living with dementia without caregivers.

      Aim 2. Implement a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 30 participants with 2
      arms (routine medical care vs. the personalized care network-RDAD approach) to assess the
      acceptability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of the intervention.
