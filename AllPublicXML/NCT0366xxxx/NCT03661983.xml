      This is a phase 3b/4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient trial to
      evaluate the long-term efficacy of oral aripiprazole in the treatment of pediatric subjects
      with Tourette's Disorder (TD). The trial consists of 3 distinct phases: a pretreatment phase,
      open-label stabilization phase, and a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a male or female child or adolescent, 6 to 17 years of age (inclusive)
             at the time of signing the informed consent/assent.

          -  The subject meets current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for TD, documented at screening
             and made by an adequately trained clinician, as confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for
             Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia - Present and Lifetime Version.

          -  The subject has a TTS ≥ 20 on the YGTSS at screening and baseline (Day 1).

          -  The subject, a caregiver, and the investigator must all agree that the presenting tic
             symptoms cause impairment in the subject's normal routines, which include academic
             achievement, occupational functioning, social activities, and/or relationships.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (all female subjects ≥ 12 years of age and all
             female subjects &lt; 12 years of age if menstruation has started) must have a negative
             pregnancy test and must not be pregnant or lactating.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative (eg, guardian or caregiver), in accordance with requirements of the
             trial site's institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) and
             local regulatory requirements, prior to the initiation of any protocol-required
             procedures. In addition, the subject, as required by the trial center's IRB/IEC, must
             provide informed assent at screening and as such must be able to understand that he or
             she can withdraw from the trial at any time.

          -  Ability, in the opinion of the principal investigator, of the subject and the
             subject's legally acceptable representative (eg, guardian) or caregiver(s) to
             understand the nature of the trial and follow protocol requirements, including the
             prescribed dosage regimens, tablet ingestion, and discontinuation of prohibited
             concomitant medications, to read and understand the written word in order to complete
             subject-reported outcomes measures, and to be reliably rated on assessment scales.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject presents with a clinical presentation and/or history that is consistent
             with another neurologic condition that may have accompanying abnormal movements. These
             include, but are not limited to, the following: Transient tic disorder; Huntington's
             disease; Parkinson's disease; Sydenham's chorea; Wilson's disease; Mental retardation;
             Pervasive developmental disorder; Tardive dyskinesia; Traumatic brain injury; Stroke;

          -  Subjects who receive psychostimulants for the treatment of attention-deficit
             hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and who have developed and/or had exacerbations of the
             tic disorder after the initiation of stimulant treatment. (Note that subjects with
             ADHD who are treated with psychostimulants and have not developed new tics or a
             worsening of their current tics can be included if all other enrollment obligations
             are met).

          -  The subject currently has a primary diagnosis that meets DSM-5 criteria for mood
             disorder.

          -  The subject has severe obsessive-compulsive disease, as evidenced by a Children's
             Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score &gt; 16.

             menstruation has started) who will not agree to practice 2 acceptable methods of birth
             control or who will not remain abstinent during the trial and for 30 or 90 days

          -  Subject requiring medication not allowed per protocol.

          -  Use of any cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers within 14

             by the central laboratory; Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 3 × ULN as defined by the
             central laboratory; Creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL; Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg;
             Corrected QT interval ≥ 450 msec (males) or ≥ 470 msec (females) using the corrected
