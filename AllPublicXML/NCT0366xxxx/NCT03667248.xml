    <textblock>
      This study is to analyse if the size of the valve can be determined with a preoperative CT
      scan of the heart in order to prepare the valve preoperatively to save time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe aortic stenosis undergo aortic valve replacement (AVR). One approach to
      reduce trauma and operation time is the implantation of a sutureless valve to reduce aortic
      cross-clamp time due to the missing necessity of suturing the valve. Until now, sizing of the
      valve was determined intraoperatively using the measuring devices provided by the product
      manufacturer. Due to the implantation mechanism, the valve has to be collapsed after
      determination of the size. This is consuming time and can seriously delay the procedure.

      This study is to analyse if the size of the valve can be determined with a preoperative CT
      scan of the heart in order to prepare the valve preoperatively to save time.
