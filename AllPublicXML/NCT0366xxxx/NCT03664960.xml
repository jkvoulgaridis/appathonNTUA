    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent.

          2. Completed Study AK002-003, defined as having received 4 infusions of study drug and
             followed through Day 113 (Â±3 days) in Study AK002-003 and willing to begin extended
             dosing on or about Day 113.

          3. Able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

          4. Female patients must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year or surgically
             sterile (tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 3
             months, or if of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to
             use dual methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual activity until the end of
             the study, or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer.

          5. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a
             highly effective method of contraception until the end of the study or for 120 days
             following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. All fertile men with
             female partners of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the
             Investigator immediately if they suspect their partner might be pregnant at any time
             during study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Poor tolerance to previous administration of AK002 in the opinion of the Investigator.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study drug.

          3. Any disease, condition (medical or surgical), or cardiac abnormality, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would place the patient at increased risk.

          4. Planned or expected vaccination with live attenuated vaccines during the treatment, or
             vaccination expected within 5 half-lives (4 months) of AK002 administration.

          5. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             participating in the study.

          6. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, makes
             the patient unsuitable for enrollment.
