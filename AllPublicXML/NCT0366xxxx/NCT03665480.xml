  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is konwn to have no significant effect on
      leukemia stem cells and has been widely used in the patients with agranulocytosis after
      chemotherapy. Minimal residual disease (MRD), an index for early treatment response, plays an
      important role in prognostic prediction. Numbers of data have shown MRD at day 14 after
      induction therapy significantly predicts prognosis. However, the retrospetive data from the
      investigators showed that patients with G-CSF treatment after induction had higher MRD at day
      14 but not significantly different at day 28, suggesting that G-CSF might work on the
      differenciation of hemapoetic stem cells and increase MRD levels at day 14. In this
      multicenter prospective randomized controlled study, the effect of G-CSF on MRD after
      induction therapy in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is evaluated.

      Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is konwn to have no significant effect on
      leukemia stem cells and has been widely used in the patients with agranulocytosis after
      chemotherapy. Minimal residual disease (MRD), an good index for early treatment response,
      plays an important role in prognostic prediction. Numbers of data have shown MRD at day 14
      after induction therapy significantly predicts prognosis. However, the retrospetive data from
      the investigators showed that patients with G-CSF treatment after induction had higher MRD at
      day 14 but not significantly different at day 28,suggesting that G-CSF might work on the
      differenciation of hemapoetic stem cells and increase MRD level at day 14. In this
      multicenter prospective study, the investigators randomizedly divide all participants with
      newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) into G-CSF treatment group and G-SCF-free group.
      In G-CSF treatment group, all participants are treated with G-CSF at the dose of 5ug/kg pre
      day until neutrophil higher than 0.5 g/L or 14 days from day three after induction therapy.
      MRD is monitored at day 14 and 28 with flow cytometry and quantity PCR if a fusion gene is
      available in both G-CSF treatment and G-CSF-free groups. Comparision of the difference of MRD
      levels between the two groups is performed to evaluate the effect of G-CSF on MRD.
