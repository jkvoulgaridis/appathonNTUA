    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Autism Behavior Inventory (ABI) Core Domain Score to Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the ABI core domain score will be reported. ABI is a 62-item questionnaire completed on a web/mobile application or on paper. It is part of the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE), a research tool that tracks outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Each ABI item is answered on 1 of 2 possible dimensions, quality (how well a person carries out a particular behavior) or frequency (how often a particular behavior occurs). Each item is rated on a scale of 0-3 (never to very often [frequency] or not at all to without help [quality]). The ABI Core Domain Score is calculated as the sum of the scores in the Social Communication Domain and the Repetitive/Restrictive Behavior Domain divided by the total number of items in these 2 domains.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the ABC subscales will be reported. The ABC is a 58-item behavior rating scale used to measure behavior problems across 5 subscales: Irritability, Lethargy (Social Withdrawal), Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech.

There are 14 items across each of the 5 domains (social communication, restrictive behaviors, mood and anxiety, self regulation and challenging behavior). The clinician rates the severity of behaviors and level of impairment on a scale of 1 (none) to 7 (very severe).</description>
