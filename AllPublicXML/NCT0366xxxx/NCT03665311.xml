      Objective: The primary aim of this 60 patient feasibility trial is to determine if, for
      critically ill patients treated with SLED for AKI, randomization to receive albumin (25%)
      boluses versus normal saline placebo boluses is feasible, with respect to the recruitment
      rate, blinding and adherence to the protocol.

      Background: Intravenous albumin (25%) boluses are frequently given to critically ill patients
      during slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) treatments for acute kidney injury (AKI). The
      intention of giving albumin during SLED is to stabilize the blood pressure to permit more
      aggressive overall fluid removal with ultrafiltration; however, there is little evidence to
      support this expensive practice.

      Objective: The primary aim of this feasibility trial is to determine if, for critically ill
      patients treated with SLED for AKI, randomization to receive albumin (25%) boluses versus
      normal saline placebo boluses is feasible, with respect to the recruitment rate, blinding and
      adherence to the protocol.

      The results of this feasibility trial will help us to plan and carry out a multicentre pilot
      trial comparing the efficacy of the interventions in achieving fluid removal in critically
      ill patients with AKI on SLED.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Setting: The mixed
      medical-surgical intensive care units of a Canadian tertiary care hospital.

      Study Population: 60 patients with AKI requiring treatment with SLED (by definition, Kidney
      Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 3 AKI). Intervention: Participants will be
      randomized to receive either albumin (25%) boluses or normal saline placebo boluses during
      their SLED treatments.
