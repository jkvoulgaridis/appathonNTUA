      A phase 1, non-randomised, multicentre, model-based dose escalation trial. This trial will
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of
      ascending doses of combined therapy with ATR inhibitor (AZD6738) and gemcitabine, in
      participants with advanced solid tumours, followed by an expansion phase in participants with
      advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
