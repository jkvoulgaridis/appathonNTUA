  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the social capital intervention versus
      a general health promotion intervention (Health for Life; H4L) among groups of Young black
      men who have sex with men (YBMSM) and to measure the social capital and engagement in care
      with the HIV-positive YBMSM at 3 and 9 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) have high rates of HIV infection, and are also
      at risk for falling out of clinical care. Social capital, which refers to the resources in a
      person's social network, has been shown to be beneficial for people living with HIV in other
      places. The study wants to understand and build upon social capital in the YBMSM population
      in Atlanta, with the goal of ultimately improving HIV-related outcomes for these youth.

      To achieve this study is conducted in 3 phases. In Phase I, study will conduct interviews
      with YBMSM and community leaders to get advice about developing a social capital intervention
      that will improve social capital. Phase II is a randomized controlled trial of groups of
      YBMSM implementing the social capital intervention versus groups of YBMSM receiving a general
      health promotion intervention (Health for Life; H4L). This is followed by Phase III which is
      mainly to measure the social capital and engagement in care with the HIV-positive YBMSM at 3
      and 9 month timepoints.

      The study plan to enroll 180 total participants (120 in the randomized controlled trial and
      60 in preliminary interviews) over the four year study period.

    <measure>Change in Modified Social Capital Scale (MSCS) between the social capital intervention group and group-based health promotion intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months after beginning intervention, 10 months after beginning intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Social Capital Scale (MSCS) is an In-Depth Interview Guide that asks questions about social capital and engagement in care. The scale is recently modified, pilot tested, and validated Chen's Social Capital Scale. The instrument contained 10 composite items based on 42 items for assessing personally owned social capital, including bonding and bridging capitals. The questionnaire is a open ended questionnaire with probe questions. The scale contains subscales for bonding and bridging capital, and it also contains items that specify sources (including family, friends, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations) and types of support (e.g. emotional support, instrumental support and informational support). The data will be transcribed verbatim by a professional business transcription service. Thematic analysis using a combination of inductive and deductive coding will be conducted to analyze the score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in viral load suppression measured as copies/ml at baseline, post-intervention 3 months and 9 months between the social capital intervention group and group-based health promotion intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months and 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Viral load values will be extracted from the participants' electronic medical records (EMR). Viral load refers to the number of viral particles found in each millilitre of blood. Viral load tests measure the amount of HIV's genetic material in a blood sample. The results of a viral load test are described as the number of copies of HIV RNA in a millilitre of blood. The viral load test should consistently detect and measure virus levels down to 50 copies/mL, have a high specificity and provide reproducible results. The technologies used are advanced and very sensitive for measuring the amount of HIV genetic material present in the blood.</description>

    <description>Retention in Care will be measured by determining receiving two or more cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) tests. This information will be gathered from subject's electronic medical record</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in Care will be measured by determining participation in continuous care, that is, at least two or more routine HIV visits at least three months apart. This information will be gathered from subject's electronic medical record</description>

    <description>The social capital intervention will focus on developing skills and group-work that culminate in participant-derived photovoice projects. Each group of YBMSM will be encouraged to complete a 30 day photovoice challenge. The 30 day challenge is based on a prior community action project done as a part of our Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR)-funded research, which was a Photovoice project conducted by Dr. Hussen. Photovoice is a participatory action research methodology in which groups of individuals from a population of interest are given cameras to document events, people and places of significance in their lives.</description>
