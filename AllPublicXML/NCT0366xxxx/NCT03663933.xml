  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Blood stem cells in the bone marrow make all the cells to normally defend a body against
      disease. Allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is when these stem cells are transferred from
      one person to another. Researchers think this treatment can provide a new, healthy immune
      system to correct T-cell problems in some people.

      Objective:

      To see if allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant is safe and effective in treating people
      with T-cell problems.

      Eligibility:

      Donors: Healthy people ages 4 and older

      Recipients: People the same age with abnormal T-cell function causing health problems

      Design:

      All participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, heart, and urine tests

      Donors will also have an electrocardiogram and chest x-ray. They may have veins tested or a
      pre-anesthesia test.

      Recipients will also have lung tests.

      Some participants will have scans and/or bone marrow collected by needle in the hip bones.

      Donors will learn about medicines and activities to avoid and repeat some screening tests.

      Some donors will stay in the hospital overnight and have bone marrow collected with
      anesthesia.

      Other donors will get shots for several days to stimulate cells. They will have blood removed
      by plastic tube (IV) in an arm vein. A machine will remove stem cells and return the rest of
      the blood to the other arm.

      Recipients will have:

        -  More bone marrow and a small fragment of bone removed

        -  Dental, diet, and social worker consultations

        -  Scans

        -  Chemotherapy and antibody therapy for 2 weeks

        -  Catheter inserted in a chest or neck vein to receive donor stem cells

        -  A hospital stay for several weeks with more medicines and procedures

        -  Multiple follow-up visits...

      Background:

        -  Disorders of T-cell proliferation and/or dysregulation (TCP/D) can lead to T-cell
           lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmunity, infection, and aberrant immune activation
           with resulting organ dysfunction, morbidity, and mortality.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure disorders
           of TCP/D.

        -  Subjects with TCP/D may be at higher risk for graft rejection and/or disease relapse.

      Primary Objective:

      - Separately by arm: To estimate the percentage of recipients with &gt;50% donor T cell
      chimerism and graft-failure free survival at day +180 post-HCT

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 4 years

        -  TCP/D deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant HCT that meets at least one of
           the criteria below:

             -  Identified germline T-cell activating mutation in the PI3k pathway

             -  Identified ADA2 deficiency (biallelic mutations in CECR1 (ADA2) and/or
                phenotypically with low ADA2 level) leading to neutropenia requiring chronic GCSF
                therapy or to transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia

             -  T-cell infiltration of liver, spleen, lymph nodes, marrow, lungs, gut, or other
                organs by T cells, as evidenced by laboratory, radiographic, and/or anatomic
                pathology evaluation, resulting in organ dysfunction and/or organomegaly

             -  Latent herpesvirus infection in T lymphocytes

             -  History of or active evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

             -  Recurrent or prolonged fevers attributed to immune dysregulation

             -  T-cell population in blood and/or marrow with immunophenotype of large granular
                lymphocytes (LGL), with or without clonality or lymphocytosis

             -  T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in the setting of an underlying immune defect

             -  Immune-mediated cytopenias of one lineage requiring transfusion or GCSF support or
                of 2 or 3 lineages with or without transfusion or support

             -  Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)

        -  At least one potentially suitable 7-8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an
           HLA-haploidentical related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  HIV negative

        -  Disease status: Subjects with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation
           if possible, although the aggressive nature of many of these diseases necessitates the
           potential need to enroll subjects onto study and treat with standard therapies before
           proceeding to protocol therapy (HCT)

      Design:

        -  There will be two arms that vary in conditioning intensity - an immunosuppression-only
           conditioning (IOC) arm for high-risk subjects and a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
           arm.

        -  IOC arm: equine anti-thymocyte globulin (e-ATG) 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13,
           pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily on
           days -9 through -2

        -  RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days
           -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV,
           pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2.

           -- Subjects will be assigned to the IOC arm if there is significant end-organ
           dysfunction present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan
           would likely be associated with intolerable or life-threatening toxicities for the
           subject. Subjects will also be assigned to the IOC arm if they possess a DNA repair
           defect, telomere maintenance defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome that
           necessitates limiting chemotherapy as much as possible to prevent future cancer risk.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cells are the preferred graft source, although bone marrow is
           permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis:

             -  PTCy on days +3 and +4 (50 mg/kg/day on RIC arm and 25 mg/kg/day on the IOC arm,
                with the option of 25 mg/kg/day on the RIC arm), tacrolimus on days +5 through +90,
                and MMF on days +5 through +25.

                  Calculations will be based on the USA- ITS-NIH reference.

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert s syndrome or
                  hemolysis) for subjects receiving RIC and bilirubin greater than or equal to 5.0

                  arm if evaluated by a hepatologist who deems the liver function test
                  abnormalities to be potentially reversible with HCT.

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2,
                  calculated using eGRF in the clinical lab for adults and the Schwartz formula for
                  pediatric subjects, if eGFR not reported by the clinical lab.

          -  Adequate central venous access potential

          -  Karnofsky (adults) or Lansky (children) performance status of greater than or equal to
             50% or ECOG performance status of 2 or less for the RIC arm and greater than or equal
             to 30% or ECOG performance status of 3 or less for the IOC arm

             a written informed consent document

          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful
             to a fetus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for at least one year post-allo HCT. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in the study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Disease status: Subjects with lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD), LGL, HLH, or other
             TCP/D disorders requiring standard therapies to prepare for HCT should be referred in
             remission if possible. However, these diseases are often aggressive and require swift
             evaluation for HCT while concurrently attempting to establish disease control through
             the administration of standard therapies. If ongoing therapy for the underlying
             disease outside of the NIH is not in the best interest of the subject according to the
             clinical judgment of the PI, then the subject may receive standard treatment for
             his/her underlying TCP/D disorder as a bridge to HCT on this protocol, prior to
             starting the research phase of the study. If it becomes apparent that the subject will
             not be able to proceed to HCT, then he/she must come off study. Subjects receiving
             standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits,
             alternatives to the proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same
             treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of
             virus- specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation
             prior to allo HCT.

          -  Prohibitive allergy to a study drug or to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition of the agents (e-ATG, steroids, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, pentostatin,
             tacrolimus, MMF, G-CSF) used in the study.

          -  Active psychiatric disorder which is deemed by the PI to have significant risk of
             compromising compliance with the transplant protocol or which does not allow for
             appropriate informed consent

          -  HIV positive or other acquired immunodeficiency that, as determined by the PI,
             interferes with the assessment of TCP/D severity and/or the attribution of clinical
             manifestations of immunodeficiency to a disorder of TCP/D.

          -  MagT1 mutation and active need to take anti-platelet agents and/or therapeutic anti-
             coagulation that cannot be interrupted during aplasia

        INCLUSION CRITERIA RELATED DONOR

          -  Age greater than or equal to 4 years

          -  Related donor deemed suitable and eligible, and willing to donate, per clinical
             evaluations who are additionally willing to donate blood, urine, and marrow specimens
             for research. Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing Standard
             Policies and Procedures for determination of eligibility and suitability for clinical
             donation. Note that participation in this study is offered to all related donors, but
             is not required for clinical donation, so it is possible that not all related donors
             will enroll onto this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RELATED DONOR:

        -None

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:

        -Unrelated donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and
        Procedures, available at: http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-
        transplant-network/Standards/, except for the additional requirement of EBV serostatus
        testing for clinical purposes of donor selection. Note that participation in this study is
        offered to all unrelated donors but not required for clinical donation, so it is possible
        that not all unrelated donors will enroll on this study. Unrelated donors only enroll if
        they contribute research specimens, which is optional.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:

        -Unrelated donors: failure to qualify as a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donor per
        current NMDP Standards, available at:
        http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplant-network/Standards/. Exceptions to donor
        eligibility (e.g. foreign travel, tattoos) do not automatically exclude the donor and will
        be reviewed by the PI.
