  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The descriptive purpose of this study is to characterize clinical and nonclinical factors of
      participants with CD, participant flow and visits to other specialists in the hospitals of
      the healthcare network of the Autonomous Community of Madrid with implementation of
      electronic medical records. The clinical and nonclinical factors include: demographic and
      baseline clinical characteristics, lifestyle, relapses, complications, day hospital visits,
      surgery, presence of complications such as perianal fistulas and complex perianal fistulas.
      The predictive purpose of this study is to develop a statistical predictive model with the
      information obtained from the descriptive purpose, in the hospitals of the healthcare network
      of the Autonomous Community of Madrid, capable of assigning any participant diagnosed with CD
      a probability of reaching a prototypical clinical condition or a probability of experiencing
      certain clinical complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and non-interventional study of participants with CD. The study will
      collect data from electronic medical records (EMRs) of the participants in the hospitals of
      the healthcare network of the Autonomous Community of Madrid with implementation of EMRs and
      will describe the determining factors and develop a statistical model for predicting likely
      outcomes in participants with CD. This study will conduct an additional substudy to evaluate
      the performance of the system through a human assessment to be performed by the clinical
      experts at each participating site.

      The study will have a retrospective data collection from EMRs of the participants referring
      to last 5 years.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational cohort.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain. The overall time for data collection in
      the study will be approximately 5 years.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
