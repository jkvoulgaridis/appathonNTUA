  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, the investigators aim to study the familial aggregation of REM sleep
      behavior disorder (RBD) and compare the differences in major biomarkers of neurodegeneration,
      including percentage of EMG activity during REM sleep, cognitive functions, autonomic
      dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders, between unaffected first degree relatives of RBD
      cases and non-RBD controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by abnormal behavioral
      manifestations during REM sleep. Previous case-control studies and prospective studies have
      documented the progression of Î±-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration in relation to RBD and have
      identified some biomarkers of predicting neurodegeneration in patients with iRBD, such as
      olfactory dysfunction, color vision deficit, autonomic dysfunction, tonic EMG activity during
      REM sleep, and psychiatric disorder. However, these biomarkers might precede the onset of
      RBD, as a result, searching for biomarkers for the neurodegeneration before RBD onset is
      helpful to map the progression of neurodegeneration. In this regard, the investigators aim to
      study the familial aggregation of RBD and its core features, and compare the differences in
      major biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including percentage of EMG activity during REM sleep,
      cognitive functions, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders, between unaffected
      first degree relatives of RBD cases and non-RBD controls.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of REM-related EMG activity (REMREEA)</measure>
    <time_frame>one night (8 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of REM-related EMG activity (REMREEA) is the most reliable and valid marker in differentiating patients with RBD from normal controls. Basically, the REMREEA include two components, namely phasic EMG activity and tonic EMG activity, respectively. The phasic EMG events were defined as any burst of EMG activity lasting 0.1 to 5 sec with amplitude &gt; 4 times the background EMG activity and will be score on the basis of 3-second mini-epoch during REM sleep. Each 30-sec epoch during REM sleep was scored as tonic or atonic depending on whether tonic chin EMG activity was present for more or less than 50% of the epoch. The total EMG activity was presented as the percentage of REM related EMG activity (REMREEA) with the percentage of tonic EMG activity plus the percentage of phasic EMG activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Significant motor activity</measure>
    <time_frame>one night (8 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Significant motor activity were recorded by video-polysomnography. The motor analysis will be scored according to the previously established method. In view of the potential problem in inter-rater reliability in those mild motor activities, we will only include those complex activities and vocalizations in the analyses. It has been shown that there are large differences in the significant motor activities between patients with RBD and normal controls. In view of the relatively high night-to-night variability and low inter-rater reliability in scoring motor activity, it will be considered as secondary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Other biomarkers of RBD in the first degree relatives of RBD patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Previous studies have also confirmed that RBD patients present with autonomic dysfunction, olfactory dysfunction, color vision deficit, neurocognitive function, and a higher rate of psychiatric disorders, these markers will also be considered as secondary biomarkers and will be compared in the first degree relatives of between patients and controls.</description>

        We established a case-control cohort of RBD with regular follow-ups and we have now
        accumulated over 280 RBD cases and age-sex matched controls. Proband of RBD and non-RBD
        controls will be recruited from this cohort. The control probands were initially recruited
        from the community and clinical samples (those with other sleep disorders such as
        obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) that did not have RBD as confirmed by clinical and vPSG
        assessments.
