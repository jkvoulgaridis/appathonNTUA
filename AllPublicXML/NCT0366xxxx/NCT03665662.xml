      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of intra-procedure music intervention on
      procedural anxiety, physiological stress and sedation requirements in patients undergoing
      moderate sedation procedures. Study participants will be randomly assigned into two groups:
      1. Control - standard care without music intervention. 2. Intervention - standard of care
      plus music intervention. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire will be provided
      pre, intra and post procedure to all subjects in addition to an exit survey.
