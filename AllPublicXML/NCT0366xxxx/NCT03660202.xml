      The FUTURE-III study is a confirmative clinical trial for Sirolimus Target Eluting
      Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (Firesorb) after the feasibility and safety of the device has
      been preliminary confirmed in a small-scale First-in-Man clinical trial.

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm trial in patients with coronary artery
      disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in separate epicardial
      vessels. The goal is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Firesorb to support the
      approval of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for this product.All subjects
      will undergo clinical follow-up at 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and
      5-year post-index procedure. A total of 1200 subjects will be recruited, including 96 with
      long lesion (the scaffold to be used with a length of 33mm or 38mm) and 215 in the
      experimantal group of FUTURE-II clinical trial.
