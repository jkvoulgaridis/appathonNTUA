  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This small pilot study will enroll children ages 5-12 years of age with disruptive behavior
      problems at school. These children and their families will be offered an enhanced model of
      primary care, which includes pre-visit record review, standardized content of primary care
      visits, post-visit care coordination by the primary care team, and coordination of services
      between the primary care team and the school. We hypothesize that children receiving this
      enhanced model of care will achieve better behavioral outcomes at both school and home.
