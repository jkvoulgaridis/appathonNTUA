  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label study, which will examine the effect of dupilumab on
      quality of life in atopic dermatitis (AD). Thirty patients with moderate to severe AD will
      receive dupilumab for a treatment period of 52 weeks (i.e. last injection on week 48).
      Improvement in patient quality of life after 52 weeks of treatment with dupilumab will be
      evaluated using validated dermatologic and non-dermatologic psychometric instruments. The
      primary endpoint is the improvement in quality of life measured by change in Psychological
      General Well-Being scale (PGWB) at Week 16 from baseline. Additionally, patients will be
      given a video recording device to document their experience with the study drug at home.
      Video footage of patient experiences will be compiled at the end of the study. The compiled
      video footage will subsequently be watched and analyzed to further understand the experiences
      of atopic dermatitis patients, and how undergoing dupilumab treatment alters these patients'
      experiences and attitudes with their skin disease.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the improvement in quality of life measured by change in Psychological General Well-Being scale (PGWB) at Week 16 from baseline. It is a self-reported, 22 item questionnaire, scored 0-5 and summed. PGWB will be administered at every study visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale (WPAI:SHP)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in work productivity measured by change in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale (WPAI) at Week 16 from baseline. It measures the effect of health and symptom severity on work productivity and nonwork activities by assessing absenteeism, presenteeism, and impairment of daily activities. There are 6 questions, each with unique answers. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages (0-100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Scoring equations:
Percent work time missed due to problem: Q2/(Q2+Q4)
Percent impairment while working due to problem: Q5/10
Percent overall work impairment due to problem:
Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4)))x(Q5/10)]
Percent activity impairment due to problem: Q6/10</description>

    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in quality of life measured by change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16 from baseline. It is a 10 item questionnaire with a final score calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of patient satisfaction with treatment measured by change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at Week 16 from baseline. TSQM is a 14-item questionnaire with 4 domains: effectiveness, convenience, global satisfaction, and side effects. Item scores are summed to give four domain scores, which are in turn transformed to a scale of 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Itch Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in itch scores using numerical rating scales at Week 16 from baseline. This is a 0-10 scale with 0 equaling No itch, and 10 being Worst imaginable itch. Patients will circle number that describes the itch experienced from atopic dermatitis.</description>

    <measure>Pain Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in pain scores using numerical rating scales at Week 16 from baseline. This is a 0-10 numerical scale with 10 as the worst imaginable itch. Patients circle the number that best describes the pain experienced from atopic dermatitis.</description>

    <measure>PSQI</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) at Week 16 from baseline. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
