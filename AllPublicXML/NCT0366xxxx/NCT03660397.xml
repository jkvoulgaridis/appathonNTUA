  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in
      uncontrolled hypertension or resistant hypertension. Surgery and and medicine are the main
      treatment for primary aldosteronism(PA) by the current guidelines. However, only a small part
      of patients with PA meet the surgical criteria, and most of patients with uncontrolled
      hypertension and activation of RAAS have to take spironolactone or other antihypertensive
      drugs for long time. On the other side, long-term inhibition of aldosterone receptor may
      cause hyperkalemia, male breast hyperplasia and other adverse reactions. Moreover,
      hyperaldosterone is still not corrected by spironolactone, which causes extensive
      cerebrovascular damages even though blood pressure and blood potassium had been normalized.

      With the development of adrenal vein sampling and adrenal ablation, selective arterial
      ablation of adrenal gland(AAA) was observed with significant decrease of blood aldosterone
      and blood pressure in patients with PA, which made it promising that uncontrolled
      hypertension could be relieved by selective AAA.
