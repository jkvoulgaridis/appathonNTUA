  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of
      intravitreal bevacizumab (Lumiere®) in the single-dose form, for the treatment of patients
      with wet AMD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is the main cause of severe vision loss in patients over 65
      years of age. There is solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in the
      treatment of wet AMD. However, it has not been registered for such indication yet.

      In response to the need for a proper adaptation, Lumiere® has been developed in a
      single-dose, sterile dosage containing bevacizumab 5 mg/vial in 0.2 mL injectable solution.

      This adaptation is intended to assure intravitreal administration avoiding the risk of
      contamination and potential adverse consequences, such as endophthalmitis and blindness,
      associated to reutilization or repackaging of bevacizumab vials for oncological use.

    <description>The first three doses of bevacizumab (Lumiere®) were administered via intravitreal injection on a monthly basis. A safety evaluation was conducted in the first month. Following the first three doses, continuation of the treatment (up to 6 doses) was decided according to response.</description>
