  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative arthritis is a common disease in the elderly , in recent years, there are young
      trends, the symptoms often cause great pain in the elderly, associated with lower physical
      exercise caused by decreased muscle mass, functional fitness performance Is also poor,
      affecting the ability of elderly people to live independently. Therefore, this study mainly
      explores whether the intervention of tai chi can improve the functional fitness of the
      elderly and reduce the pain index of the elderly. The study was designed to take the sample,
      which was divided into experimental group and control group. It was expected to receive 100
      people. The subjects were asked to use the basic information, Karnofsky scale, The functional
      fitness test, the exercise conscious scale and the WOMAC pain scale were used as the research
      tools. The SPSS system was used to analyze whether the functional fitness index and the pain
      index were significantly different before and after exercise intervention. Whether the
      exercise intervention has an effect on the elderly.
