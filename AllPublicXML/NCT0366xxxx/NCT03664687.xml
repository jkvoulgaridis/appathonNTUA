    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients are at an increased risk of recurrence in bone and bone density loss
      (osteopenia/osteoporosis) and consequently fragility fractures due to: age, systemic therapy
      with aromatase inhibitors, and premature induction of menopause by chemotherapy or ovarian
      ablation. Bone is the most common site of breast cancer recurrence. The use of bone modifying
      agents, such as Zoledronate may reduce the risk of bone metastases and fragility fractures.
      Despite the widespread use of adjuvant Zoledronate, it is not known what the optimal number
      of infusions is to reduce the risk of bone metastases and the risk of fragility fractures.
      Indeed, the recent CCO and ASCO Practice Guideline, 'Bottom line recommendations'
      specifically states, &quot;More research is recommended comparing different bone-modifying agents,
      doses, dosing intervals, and durations.&quot; In the metastatic setting, for nearly 2 decades
      biphosphonates (i.e. Zoledronate) have been given to patients every 3-4 weeks. This dosing
      interval was selected based on convenience of co-administration with standard anti-cancer
      agents and not on the long biological effect of these agents on osteoclasts, the cells
      responsible for excess bone breakdown. Furthermore, in the bone density preservation setting,
      despite the usual administration of Zoledronate once a year a single dose of Zoledronate was
      associated with a sustained increase in bone mineral density 5 years later. A recent
      systematic review in the adjuvant setting, showed that BTA at any particular dose or route of
      administration showed superiority over the other. In other words, the lowest dose appears to
      be just as good as the highest dose. This study will compare the single dose of Zoledronate
      to Zoledronate given every 6 months for 3 years. The primary outcome for this study will be
      feasibility of conducting this trial. The secondary outcome will assess bone-metastasis risk,
      fragility rates, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.

      In this study it is hypothesized that a single dose of Zoledronate will be non-inferior to
      every 6 months in terms of bone-metastasis free survival, time to first bone metastasis and
      fragility fractures. It is also hypothesized that a single dose of Zoledronate will have less
      toxicities associated with Zoledronate compared to every 6 months.

    <measure>Direct Estimation of Health Utility Values</measure>

    <description>To evaluate patient quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, undertaken at the first Zoledronate treatment and either every year (Arm A) or every 6 months (Arm B) for 3 years. The EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire consists of two sections; the descriptive system and the visual analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and has 5 levels associated with it (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). The scale range of 1-5 is used for the 5 dimensions where 1 is the best outcome and 5 is the worst outcome. The Visual Analogue scale records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' at the top and 'the worst health you can imagine' at the bottom. This ranges 0-100 with 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome.</description>

             months

          -  Serum creatinine greater than 30 ml/min and corrected serum calcium equal or greater
             than 2 mmol/l within 4 weeks before first zoledronate infusion

          -  Age equal or greater than 18 years

          -  Able to provide written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  History of osteonecrosis of the jaw

          -  Known hypersensitivity to trial drug or hypersensitivity to any other component of the
             trial drug (e.g. fructose)

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the trial protocol

          -  Pregnancy or risk of pregnancy (this includes participants that are not willing to
             practice active contraception for the duration of the study)* *Women/men of child
             bearing potential must have agreed to use two effective contraceptive methods while on
             study. A women is considered to be of 'childbearing potential' if she has had menses
             at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine
             contraceptive methods. 'effective contraception' also includes heterosexual celibacy
             and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy
             prevention) defined as complete hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral
             tubal ligation, or vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a
             previously celibate participant chooses to become heterosexually active during the
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, she is responsible
             for beginning contraceptive measures. Examples of effective methods of contraception:
             Male condom plus spermicide; Cap plus spermicide; Diaphragm plus spermicide;
             intrauterine device (Copper T, Progesterone T; Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine
             system (i.e. Mirena); hormonal methods (implants, hormonal shot or injection, combined
             pill, minipill, patch).
