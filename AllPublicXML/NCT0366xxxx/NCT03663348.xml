  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takotsubo syndrome is a condition which mimics acute myocardial infarction, and is diagnosed
      in 1.5% to 2.2% of patients referred to hospital with suspected acute coronary syndrome. It
      is also known as broken heart syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy and
      apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, among other names. The pathogenesis of this disorder is not
      well understood. Possible mechanisms include catecholamine excess, coronary artery spasm,
      microvascular dysfunction, among others. This is a multicenter, nation-wide, observational
      study of patients who were previously diagnosed with takotsubo syndrome. The investigators
      aim to use this registry to help plan and carry out further studies and to improve
      understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of this syndrome. In addition participants
      will be followed for events, and to monitor quality of life and stress.

      Patients are eligible to participate if they are aged 18 years or older and carry a physician
      confirmed diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome. Patients with a history of takotsubo syndrome will
      be identified via physician referral, Epic search and patient self-referral. Patients may
      register directly through our registry website at www.nyulmc.org/brokenheartstudy or via
      direct contact with the study team via e-mail or telephone. Following completion of a
      research authorization form and collection of medical records, study team will confirm the
      diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome. Data will be collected including contact information,
      medical history, data on the takotsubo event(s) including physician records and all relevant
      imaging. Participants will also be asked quality of life questionnaires and will be followed
      every 4 months for events.
