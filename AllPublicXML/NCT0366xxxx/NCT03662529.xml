  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an internal program effectiveness evaluation of the effects of a four-session
      weekly individualized cognitive therapy program (called the &quot;Mind Freedom Plan&quot; (MFP)) on
      substance use outcomes and substance abuse treatment retention in Veterans admitted to an
      intensive outpatient treatment program for substance abuse at the Richmond Veterans
      Administration Medical Center (RICVAMC). Substance use and treatment retention metrics of
      MFP-assigned Veterans were compared with those of Veterans assigned to typical
      case-management-oriented weekly individual sessions.

      This study was funded and launched as an internal program evaluation regarding the effects of
      a four-session weekly individualized cognitive therapy program called the &quot;Mind Freedom Plan&quot;
      (MFP) on substance use outcomes, impulsivity, and substance abuse treatment retention in
      veterans admitted to the intensive outpatient (treatment) program (IOP) for substance abuse
      at the Richmond Virginia Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center
      (RICVAMC). Substance use and treatment retention outcomes were compared between veterans
      randomly assigned to the MFP versus treatment as usual (TAU), which consisted of typical
      case-management-oriented weekly individual sessions. Veteran participants were approached and
      consented within a week of admission to the RICVAMC IOP and randomly assigned to either an
      MFP or TAU practitioner. Assignment was constrained by practitioner new-patient availability
      in order to place veterans into individualized care sessions as soon as possible.

      Participants completed self-reported and interview-based mood, personality and addiction
      severity assessments at study entry. After one month, participants were reassessed with
      psychometric symptomatology questionnaires, and also completed a 60-minute neurobehavioral
      testing session in a follow-up appointment. Subjects completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive
      Function System (DKEFS) Tower Test of planning ability, along with a delay-discounting
      decision-making task, a stop-signal task, and a go-nogo behavior inhibition task that used
      emotional and expressionless faces as stimuli.

    <description>Mean difference in Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Tower Subtest total score at 4-week follow up with MFP vs TAU. The D-KEFS Tower Test is a cognitive test for executive functioning, planning, and problem-solving ability. During the D-KEFS Tower Test, participants are instructed to create towers using discs and a set of pegs that correspond to a model. D-KEFS Tower Test total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating a better performance on the tower building task.</description>

The QoLI is a 32-item self-report instrument that assesses positive mental health, wellbeing, and happiness using an overall score across 16 life domains (e.g., health, work). Participants rate how important each domain is (0-2 scale) and how satisfied they are with this area of their life (7-point scale). QoLI satisfaction scores are weighted based on importance rating in order to create a total score.</description>

    <description>The Four-Session Mind Freedom Plan (MFP) is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based, client-centered, manualized individual therapy that functions as part of intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment. The MFP model is based on efficacious brief interventions, with content and format driven from military veteran feedback. The four 60-minute MFP sessions were one-on-one private consultations with a therapist that were focused on identifying and changing unhealthy thinking and behavioral patterns as core elements of CBT, but with an emphasis on problem-solving, coping skills, goal setting, and psychosocial functioning. At each session, structured worksheets were utilized and homework was assigned to facilitate this CBT-based skill building.</description>

    <description>The four 50-minute TAU sessions were one-on-one individual therapy sessions. Therapy was mostly supportive therapy with an emphasis problem solving on increasing veteran motivation. A discussion of the antecedents to relapse would take place if a relapse occurred and coping skills were discussed and reviewed. Veterans were also connected with community-level psychosocial supports as appropriate.</description>
