  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute
      leukemia, but relapse is the most common problem affecting long-term survivors of allo-HSCT.
      Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of
      chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or combination therapy. In this prospective
      randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of hypomethylating agents (HMA) + DLI
      and DLI preemptive therapy based on minimal residual disease in acute leukemia undergoing
      allo-HSCT are evaluated.

      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute
      leukemia, but relapse is the most common problem affecting long-term survivors of allo-HSCT.
      Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of
      chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or combination therapy. One method of solving
      relapse is to intervene before hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal
      residual disease (MRD) . DLI is an effective post-transplantation therapy based on MRD for
      relapse. Whether combination of hypomethylating agents (HMA) and DLI could improve outcomes
      remains unclear. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of
      HMA+DLI and DLI preemptive therapy based on minimal residual disease in acute leukemia
      undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.

    <description>For AL patients who achieved CR at pre-transplantation undergoing allo-HSCT, DLI was not given and immunosuppressant were withdrawn if patients were MRD persistently negative. MRD status were monitored every 30 days. If patients were MRD negative by Day+30 post-transplantation, MRD status would be continued to be monitored by Day+60. If patients were MRD positive by Day+30 post-transplantation, immunosuppressant were withdrawn. If MRD were persistently positive until Day+60 or MRD changed from negative by Day+30 to positive by Day +60 post-transplantation, HMA and DLI were given. DLI was given 48 hours after administration of HMA. DLI was given monthly until GVHD occurred or MRD became negative or a total of four times. If MRD changed from positive by Day+30 to negative by Day+60 post-transplantation, MRD status would be continued to be monitored by Day+90 post-transplantation. If patients were MRD positive by Day+90 post-transplantation, HMA and DLI were given as shown above.</description>
