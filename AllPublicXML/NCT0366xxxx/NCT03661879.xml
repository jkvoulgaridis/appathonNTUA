  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is testing a new medicine for weight control in people with overweight or obesity.
      The aim of the study is to find out how safe the study medicine is and how it works in the
      body. Participants will either get NNC9204-1706 (the new study medicine) or placebo (a dummy
      medicine) - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. NNC9204-1706 is a new
      medicine which cannot be prescribed by doctors. Participants will get an injection under the
      skin of participants' stomach each morning for 10 weeks. A medical tool called NovoPen®4 will
      be used for the injection. Participants must change the part of the pen including the
      medicine (the cartridge) each day. The study will last for about 16 weeks. Participants will
      have at least 17 clinic visits and 10 phone calls with the study doctor. At certain times
      during the study, participants will have blood drawn and 3 different kinds of heart tests
      (electrocardiograms). Study doctor will ask participants to answer mental health surveys.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed
             consent.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 39.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) at screening.
             Overweight should be due to excess adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator.

             sterilised) and is sexually active with male partner(s) who are not surgically
             sterilised (vasectomy) or who is not using highly effective contraceptive methods
             (Pearl Index less than 1%) combined with a highly effective method of contraception
             for their male partner(s) (e.g. condom with spermicide), or are pregnant,
             breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant.
