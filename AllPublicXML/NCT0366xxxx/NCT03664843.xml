      Conduct a prospective study in multicenter to confirm the value of circulating tumor DNA in
      longitudinal monitoring of stage III-IV lung cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two phases, the first stage is the exploratory stage of blood
      collection point which is the appropriate effective time after chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
      targeted therapy. The second phase, which is the expansion of the first phase, is to
      determine the precise leading time of ctDNA relative to tumor biomarkers or image evaluation
      in determining the efficacy of advanced NSCLC cancer therapy. Both stages were divided into
      three subgroups: the chemotherapy group, the radiotherapy group, and the targeted therapy
      group.
