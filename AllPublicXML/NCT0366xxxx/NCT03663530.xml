  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary findings from the investigators' lab suggest that circadian misalignment,
      occurring when meals and sleep are mistimed from one another, alters resting state neuronal
      processing in areas relevant to food reward and interoception; supporting a role of sleep and
      meal misalignment, on energy balance regulation. No study has been done to disentangle the
      effects of sleep and meal timing on body weight regulation, independent of sleep duration.
      This study will provide information to guide messaging related to timing of meals and sleep
      that can be translated to individuals whose sleep follows unconventional times, such as shift
      workers and those with jetlag and social jetlag.

      The proposed study will test whether the misalignment of eating occasions to the sleep period
      influences health markers. The goal of the proposed study is to determine whether eating out
      of synchrony with sleep influences risk of chronic diseases. The proposed study has both
      mechanistic and translational objectives. First, the investigators will test whether eating
      late in the day will influence energy balance (hormones, energy expenditure, nutritional
      intakes). Next, they will observe how misaligned meals, relative to aligned meals, influence
      behavior. Overweight men and women will be recruited to participate in a 2-phase, crossover
      study, with constant sleep periods. Phases will only differ in the alignment of meals to the
      sleep period: aligned = meals starting 1 h after awakening; misaligned = meals starting 5 h
      after awakening. Mechanistic aims will be addressed from measurements taken after 3 and 14 d
      of the intervention. The translational aim will be addressed after a 4 wk free-living period
      following the prescribed meal times for each phase. This proposed study, which will
      manipulate meal timing, without affecting total sleep time, is important because it will
      provide information on the mechanism by which circadian misalignment influences health. As
      such, the proposed study will be a stepping-stone in the establishment of lifestyle
      recommendations or therapies to personalize chronotype to reduce the risk of chronic
      diseases.

    <ipd_description>Data from this study will be available for sharing with other investigators. Data sharing requests should be made in writing and sent directly to the investigator(s) who generated the data. The purposes for using shared data should be stated in the request, and the data can only be used for research purposes. Data sharing agreements should be developed and accepted by both parties before data sharing takes place. Protecting the rights and privacy of human subjects and maintaining the study participants' confidentiality will be the first priority of our data sharing plan. We plan to follow the HIPAA privacy rule for de-identification of a dataset before transferring data.</ipd_description>
