  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of immunity in the development of cancers, and the associated escape mechanisms,
      have attracted renewed interest since the publication of tests testing immunological
      checkpoint inhibitors. One of the steps in the probably least studied immunological response
      is the penetration of immunocompetent cells within the tumor across the vascular barrier.
      This infiltration is suggested as a prognostic and predictive marker of treatment response,
      particularly in triple negative HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2)
      overexpressing breast cancers. The methods of evaluating these infiltrates are complex and
      have been the subject of recommendations.

      A better understanding of the mechanisms of infiltration of immunity cells within tumors will
      certainly help to better understand the impact of cancer treatments and develop new
      therapeutic strategies.

      It is this issue of vascular endothelium that Dr. Soncin's team is developing as part of an
      INCa (Institut National du cancer) project. The egfl7 / VE-statin (vascular
      endothelial-statin) gene is thought to be involved in transendothelial passage of immune
      cells from vascular lumen to tumor. Its expression has already been studied in a series of
      breast cancers. Other markers of endothelial activation are currently being identified.

      The main objective of this project will be to better understand the behavior of the
      endothelium in a population of breast cancer where the infiltrate in immune cells is
      precisely likely to play a leading role. This retrospective cohort of 250 to 300 cases
      treated with adjuvant and neoadjuvant will be immunologically characterized using the
      recommendations of Salgado et al. that a multicentric team of pathologists will take
      ownership. This evaluation will be counter-appraised.

      Once our cohort is immunologically characterized, our project will focus on better
      understanding the endothelial mechanisms involved: which cells? immunophenotyping of immunity
      cells. By which vessels? (measurement of densities in blood and lymphatic vessels, density in
      HEV). By what mechanisms? Do the actors identified in vitro within the Inca project have an
      in vivo translation

    <description>The expression of the genes (egfl7, SetD5, other genes and microRNAs) will be evaluated quantitatively by RT-PCR. The amount of RNA obtained corresponds to a relative amount of RNA relative to the amount of RNA measured in a sample used as a reference.
A semi-quantitative evaluation will also be carried out by in situ hybridization techniques and immunohistochemistry of endothelial expression of endothelial activation regulation markers: 0+ no labeled vessels, 1+ &lt;30% of labeled vessels, 2+ between 30 and 60% of marked vessels, 3+&gt; 60% of marked vessels The lymphocyte infiltration will be evaluated by measuring the ratio between the surface infiltrated by mononuclear cells and the tumor surface (for intratumoral TILS) or stromal (for total stromal TILS). The analysis will be done on H &amp; E slides and the data will be expressed as a percentage.</description>
