      The overarching goal of this project is the elimination of two neglected tropical diseases
      (NTD):

      soil-transmitted helminthiasis and rabies. The specific objective of this pilot study was:

      To determine whether the integrated delivery platform improved the cost-effectiveness and
      coverage of MDA targeting STH and rabies;

      The investigators integrated two public health initiatives: 1) a mass drug administration
      (MDA) effort to eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTD) caused by soil-transmitted
      helminths (STH), with 2) a community-valued mass dog rabies vaccination (MDRV) intervention
      to eliminate human and animal rabies, also a priority NTD of the World Health Organisation.
      The goal of MDA efforts targeting STH is to reduce worm burdens to very low levels below
      which self-sustaining transmission, and the public health consequences of STH, cease.
      Existing school-based delivery programs fail to reach all affected age groups, however, which
      results in ineffective coverage levels and persistence of STH. The goal of MDRV is to
      immunize 70% of dog populations, after which canine-mediated rabies is eliminated. MDRV
      programs are typically very popular, with all human age groups participating. The objectives
      of this project were to determine whether supplementing a strictly school-based MDA NTD
      control program with a community-wide strategy that is coupled to an MDRV program will result
      in a synergism that (a) improves coverage, reach and cost-effective delivery of MDA targeting
      STH and (b) improves coverage and cost-effective delivery of dog vaccination. To achieve
      this, research activities, comprised of post-intervention household questionnaire surveys,
      were carried out. In addition detailed cost data was collected.

    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in the Ngorongoro District, Tanzania inhabited by semi-nomadic
      Maasai people. The remote area was chosen because MDRV and MDA are carried out annually in
      the region as separate programs. The MDA program delivers twice yearly deworming treatment to
      every primary school and is coordinated by the District Medical Office (DMO). The MDRV
      program vaccinates dogs annually and is coordinated by the District Veterinary Office. The
      MDA and MDRV carried out in this study constituted one cycle of the established MDA and MDRV
      in the target villages. The study took place between February and October 2016, however
      activities were suspended during the rainy season to avoid inclement weather from affecting
      participation.

      The study focused on 24 villages. The target villages were located within the eight wards
      immediately surrounding the district's administrative centre and were selected through
      convenience. Each of the 24 villages were randomly assigned to one of three arms: i) Arm A (n
      = 8) received both MDA and MDRV; ii) Arm B (n = 8) received MDA only; iii) Arm C (n = 8)
      received MDRV only. All villages were equally likely to be assigned to each arm. As per the
      established MDA and MDRV programs, a nurse from the DMO and two village-based community
      health workers carried out the MDA whilst a rabies field team (a veterinarian, two field
      staff and a ward-based person) delivered the MRDV. STH and / or rabies awareness information
      was provided to respondents in the form of verbal disease avoidance advice.

      Villages in this region cover a large area, and all are divided into sub-village units. Each
      intervention ('event') was delivered at the level of the sub-village using a 'central-point'
      strategy, which required villagers to travel from their homes to the central-point event to
      receive treatment. Village leaders estimated that hosting each sub-village event for one day
      would provide sufficient time for villagers to attend. Consequently each event was scheduled
      to last for one day, and the number of days the team(s) spent in each village equalled the
      number of sub-villages.

      Arm A events comprised an MDA and a MDRV clinic hosted concurrently, while Arm B and Arm C
      events comprised only one clinic (MDA or MDRV, respectively). For Arm A villages, the MDA and
      MDRV delivery teams travelled together in one vehicle and set up the clinics close to each
      other. For Arm B and C villages, the MDA and MDRV teams travelled separately.

      In order to allow comparison of the MDA with school-based delivery (second objective) the
      events were all hosted during the school term. In sub-villages with a primary school, the
      clinics were positioned outside the school grounds, whilst in sub-villages that did not have
      a primary school the clinics were located in a central location.

      To inform each community of the event, a village-wide meeting was convened one week before.
      Key information provided at the meeting included STH and / or rabies awareness information
      and the importance of controlling these conditions through MDA and MDRV, the date of each
      clinic, that treatment would be given free of charge, and that people and dogs of all ages
      were invited to attend. On the Sunday prior to a village event, a motorbike rider with a
      loudspeaker drove around each village announcing the event details. Additionally the DMO
      informed the head teacher of each primary school of the date that the event would be convened
      outside of the school grounds. At 0830 hours the clinic(s) would be set up in the
      predetermined location and the treatment teams would wait for villagers to arrive. People
      coming to the MDA clinic were registered and research data collected. Following this,
      children between 12 and 59 months were given an oral dose of mebendazole (500mg) and vitamin
      A (100,000 IU), whilst people over 59 months were given an oral dose of albendazole (400mg).
      Following arrival and registration at the MDRV clinics, dogs were vaccinated (Nobivac
      RabiesÂ®, MSD Animal Health, Boxmeer, Netherlands), a collar placed around the neck and
      water-soluble purple coloured paint was applied to both flanks. People attending the combined
      clinic (Arm A) who had also brought dogs were instructed to visit the MDRV clinic after
      receiving deworming treatment. The events ended at 1630 hours.

      Household participation and coverage - community perceptions and knowledge:

      A post-intervention household questionnaire survey (HQS) targeting 30 randomly selected
      households per village (stratified across sub-villages) was carried out within one week of
      each intervention to determine the proportion of households, people and dogs that attended
      the clinics. No households declined to participate, however if the family were not at home
      the team moved onto the next household.

      Coverage of school-aged children and others:

      To calculate the percentage of treated primary school age children (7 - 13 years) that were
      enrolled or not in school, or were attending or not attending school on the day of the
      clinic, every person treated was asked whether they were enrolled and attending primary
      school that day and, if they attended primary school, which primary school they attended.
      Every participant was also asked their age, which allowed analysis of other age groups
      treated.

      Chi squared tests were used to determine whether household participation and coverage were
      impacted by delivery strategy. A logistic regression model (logit family) was used to
      determine whether the proportion of children enrolled in primary school in each village was
      dependent on the presence of a school.

      Comparison with the national school-based deworming program:

      To determine whether delivery strategy and clinic location (outside of school grounds with
      the whole community invited (this study) or within the schools with treatment given only to
      enrolled school children (NSDP)) impacted the number of school children that received
      deworming treatment, a paired comparison at ten village primary schools was made. To allow
      comparison, the number of primary school children treated in the previous NSDP round of
      deworming treatment was obtained for each of the ten schools from the Ngorongoro District NTD
      Coordinator and compared with the number of registered children treated in this study in the
      same schools.

      A generalized linear mixed model, with 'school name' as a random effect, was used to compare
      the proportion of primary school children treated by the NSDP and this study in each
      comparison school.

      Administration and delivery costs:

      Clinic administration and delivery (A&amp;D) costs were collected for all 24 villages, including
      variable costs (per dose delivered, by dose type) and fixed costs (per clinic, by clinic
      type). Expense categories included: Advertising, Equipment, Incentive payments to village
      leaders, Labour Costs (team salaries and wage labour for local help), Living (lodging)
      Allowance, Per Diem for the team, Meeting Costs, Vehicle Fuel, Repairs and Service,
      Communication (telephone credits), and Other. Other included a variety of miscellaneous costs
      that do not fit under any other category, such as incidental taxi and transportation costs
      and team health treatment. Costs attributable to research-related activities were not
      included in A&amp;D costs. Indirect costs (time, foregone opportunities) borne by households to
      attend the event (described above) were not included in A&amp;D costs. For accounting purposes,
      fixed costs not attributable to a specific clinic type were allocated equally across all
      events. Fixed costs attributable to either MDRV or MDA were attributed equally across all
      rabies or deworming events, respectively. Because there were two clinics for each Arm A
      event, the unattributable fixed cost per clinic was half that of Arm B and C. Variable costs
      per clinic were calculated as per-dose purchase costs multiplied by the number of doses
      delivered. Per-dose purchase costs were $0.021 (44 Tanzanian Shillings [Tsh]) per deworming
      dose and $0.26 (520 Tsh) per rabies vaccination. The exchange rate for cost calculations was
      2,100 Tsh per U.S. Dollar, approximately the exchange rate that prevailed from mid-2015
      through 2016.

      The average cost per dose (A&amp;D) was calculated in two ways. Method 1 calculates the total
      cost over all clinics (by clinic type and Arm) divided by the total number of doses delivered
      (by clinic type and Arm), and represents the aggregate cost per dose for a given clinic
      category. Method 2 calculates cost per dose on a per clinic basis, and then averages over all
      clinics. Both methods provide valid measures of cost per dose (A&amp;D), but provide different
      estimates, because the average of a ratio (Method 2) is not equivalent to the ratio of
      averages or totals (Method 1). Method 1 is useful as an aggregate measure over all clinics,
      but cannot be used to test for statistical differences across clinic categories because it is
      not calculated on a per clinic basis. Method 2 allows testing for statistical differences
      across clinic types, but represents a summary statistic for clinic-level cost per dose
      measure rather than an aggregate measure.

      Two-sample parametric and non-parametric tests were used to test for differences in cost per
      dose between Arms A and B, and Arms A and C.

      Travel time to attend clinics:

      To understand which mode of transport was most commonly used, respondents were asked how they
      travelled to the clinic (foot, carried (e.g. infants), bike, car, etc.). To estimate the mean
      time (t Ì_1) a respondent took attending a combined or single event, respondents were asked
      how long it took in minutes to reach the events. In addition, the mean amount of time a
      respondent spent at a clinic (t Ì_2) and, for the integrated delivery (Arm A) the mean time
      spent travelling between the two clinics (t Ì_3), was measured. These estimates were then
      used to compare the overall time spent attending single and integrated events. To estimate
      the overall time a respondent spent attending a single clinic (Arm B or C, or Arm A if no dog
      was brought for vaccination) (T_s) we multiplied the mean travel time by two (for the out and
      return journey) and added the mean time spent at a clinic:

      T_s=(t Ì_1 Ã 2)+ t Ì_2.

      To estimate the mean time a respondent spent attending a combined clinic (Arm A) (T_c ) we
      multiplied the mean travel time by two and added the mean time spent at a clinic (multiplied
      by two for deworming and dog vaccination) and the time spent travelling between the two
      clinics:

      T_c=(t Ì_1Ã 2)+(t Ì_2Ã 2)+ t Ì_3.
