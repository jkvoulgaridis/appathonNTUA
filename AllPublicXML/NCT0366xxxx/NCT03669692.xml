  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include filling, emptying or post-voiding state
      alterations; producing symptomatology depending of the underline mechanism. Benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common underlying disease, which increases with age and
      significantly affects men over 50 years. There are currently no prevention or curative
      treatment guidelines, as their pathophysiological mechanism is not exactly known. Several
      factors have been implicated, such as hormones, aging, lifestyle or diet.

      BPH is associated with metabolic disorders, the basis of which is insulin resistance and its
      associated pathologies: diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.
      Patients without these metabolic signs have a lower incidence of BPH and / or LUTS. Insulin
      resistance (IR) is associated with greater proliferation and a reduction of cellular
      apoptosis at the prostate level; leading to an increase in prostate volume or symptoms.
      Likewise, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance, both in favor of sympathetic
      (emptying symptoms) or parasympathetic (filling symptoms), influences LUTS. SNA activity can
      be measured non-invasively, repetitively and effectively by measuring the heart rate
      variability (HRV).

      Caloric restriction with optimal nutrition (CRON, hereinafter only CR) is the most
      physiologically adapted nutritional alternative to our ancestral needs and has been shown in
      humans to reduce insulin resistance and associated pathologies. It has also been observed
      that CR improves the balance of the SNA and allows to improve LUTS.

      Proliferation inhibition and prostatic apoptosis induction, mediated through CR, by
      insulin-IGF-1 axis reduction and mTOR metabolic pathways inhibition, are the central axis of
      this project. CR will be used to reduce insulin resistance, IGF expression and inhibition of
      the PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway, to reduce prostate cell proliferation and promote prostatic
      tissue apoptosis; in this way it will be possible to reduce its volume and improve the
      symptomatology.

      Additionally, CR will allow us to evaluate the potential benefits it has on certain metabolic
      diseases (diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, etc.), anthropometric values (BMI,
      abdominal perimeter and skin folds) and autonomic nervous system functionality (HRV) .
