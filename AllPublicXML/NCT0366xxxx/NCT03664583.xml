  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Living with diabetes and other chronic (ongoing) conditions is common in older adults. These
      individuals have poorer health and higher use of health services compared to older adults
      with diabetes alone. Programs that help older adults self-manage their diabetes and other
      health conditions benefit both individuals and the healthcare system. The McMaster University
      Aging, Community and Health Research Unit developed and tested a new patient-centered,
      community-based program (CPP) to improve the delivery and outcomes of care for older adults
      with diabetes and other chronic conditions. This 6-month program was developed in partnership
      with patients, caregivers, primary and community care providers and researchers. The program
      is delivered by nurses, dietitians and community providers. It involves in-home visits by
      nurses and dietitians, monthly group wellness sessions at community centers, and monthly team
      meetings. Wellness sessions include exercise, education, shared meals, and social support.
      Caregivers are invited to be active participants along with patients. The program was
      successfully implemented in Ontario and Alberta. Participants who received the program had
      better quality of life, self-management, and mental health at no additional cost from a
      societal perspective compared to those receiving usual care. To determine how the program can
      best help people, more testing is needed with different communities and groups of people. We
      will partner with primary healthcare teams (e.g., family doctors' offices) in three provinces
      to adapt and test the program in a variety of real-world settings. We will assess how to best
      put this program into practice and measure outcomes important to patients and caregivers so
      study results are relevant to them. Study findings will guide the development of a plan for
      expanding the program to reach and benefit more older adults with diabetes and other chronic
      health conditions. Patients and caregivers will be involved as key partners in all aspects of
      the research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the implementation and effectiveness of the CPP
      intervention in new settings and populations to demonstrate widespread effectiveness and ways
      to adapt CPP for diverse population subgroups and primary care setting and community care
      contexts. Based on the investigator's previous work, we expect that the CPP intervention will
      result in a greater improvement in mental health and will be cost neutral relative to usual
      care because program costs will be offset by lower use of other health services. A
      cross-jurisdictional, multi-site implementation-effectiveness type II hybrid randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted. The trial will be conducted in two sites in each of
      Ontario, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island. Each of the six sites will involve a primary care
      setting and a community care organization. Study participants will be randomly assigned to
      the intervention or usual care group. Participants randomly assigned to the intervention
      group will be offered the 6-month CPP intervention in addition to their usual primary care
      services offered by their local diabetes education centre or primary care setting. The
      primary outcome of intervention effectiveness is patient mental health. Other health outcomes
      for patients and their caregivers will be assessed (e.g., depression, anxiety, use of health
      and social services etc.). Implementation will be examined in-detail through qualitative
      evaluations with providers, patients and caregivers. Engagement of patients and caregivers
      will occur in all stages of the research study. Qualitative evaluation of patients and
      caregivers as research partners will be conducted through annual evaluations. Patient, Public
      (e.g., caregivers, knowledge users) and Community (e.g., local providers/representatives)
      Research Partners will be engaged in the research study by way of the study's established
      governance structures: Community Advisory Boards, Patient Advisory Council, and Steering
      Committee. Qualitative evaluation of Patient, Public and Community Research Partners will be
      conducted to inform implementation of the CPP intervention at the local context and the
      potential for widespread implementation and scale-up. Both quantitative and qualitative
      evaluations will be used to interpret study findings, and in the development of scale-up
      plans.

    <measure>Change in Mental Health Using the Short-Form 12 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2) - Mental health component</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short-Form 12 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2) tool will be used to assess change in mental health. The tool consists of 12 questions that measure functional health and well-being from the participant's perspective. It provides scores for eight health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health), by which a psychometrically-based physical component summary and mental component summary can be calculated. Response options include the frequency of feeling a certain way or behaviour across 3 or 5 categories (e.g., 'all of the time'). Patients (and caregivers) will be evaluated for change in SF-12 - Mental health component. Total scale range: 0 - 100. Two items compose the mental health score with a range of 2 - 10. Higher scores represent a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Management Using the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) will be used to asses change in self-management. The SDSCA is a multidimensional measure of diabetes self-management with adequate internal and test-retest reliability, and evidence of validity and sensitivity to change. The revised SDSCA consists of 11 items that assess the following aspects of the diabetes regimen: (1) general and specific diet; (2) exercise; (3) blood-glucose testing; (4) foot care; and (5) smoking. Change in patient self-management will be evaluated using the SDSCA. Scale range: 0 - 71. Higher scores represent better self-management.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies on Depression 10-Item Scale (CES-D-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies on Depression 10-Item Scale (CES-D-10) will be used to assess change in depressive symptoms. This tool has been used in prior studies of older adults with mood disorders, has a high degree of reliability and validity, distinguishes between depressed and non-depressed people, and is a sensitive tool for measuring changes in depressive symptoms over time in psychiatric populations. Participants will be asked about the way they have felt or behaved in response to 10 statements such as 'I was happy'. Response options ask participants to select the frequency they have felt or behaved during the last week, ranging from 'rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)', 'some or a little of the time (1-2 days)', 'occasionally or moderate (3-4 days)', to 'most or all of the time (5-7 days)'. Patients and caregivers will be evaluated for change in depressive symptoms using CES-D-10. Scale range: 0 - 30. Higher scores represent more depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Level of Anxiety Using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) will be used to assess change in anxiety levels. The GAD-7 is a 7-item tool that asks about the type and frequency of being bothered by a list of problems. Response options include 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', or 'nearly every', over the last two weeks. Patients and caregivers will be evaluated for change in level of anxiety using GAD-7. Scale range: 0 - 21. Higher scores represent more anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mobility Using the Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB) tool will be used to assess change in mobility of patients. The SPPB is a tool that measures patients mobility and lower function through a series of tests including chair stands, balance tests, and a walk test. The total SPPB score is summed across the three tests. Patients will be evaluated for change in mobility using SPPB tool. Higher scores represent better physical function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity Using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) tool will be used to assess change in physical activity of patients. The PASE measures physical activity over the past 7 days. It asks about the type and frequency of physical activity across categories of light, moderate and strenuous physical activity. Patients will be evaluated for change in physical activity using the PASE tool. Higher scores represent better physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Strain Using the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI) will be used to assess change in caregiver strain. This tool will ask caregivers a list of 13 activities that they may have found to be difficult such as sleeping, physical strain, financial strain, personal plans, and work and family adjustments as a result of the caregiver role. Response options include 'yes' according to two levels, either 'yes, on a regular basis' or 'yes, sometimes', or alternatively, 'no'. Scale range: 0 - 26. Higher scores represent more strain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Service Use Using the Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory (HSSUI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory (HSSUI) will be used to asses change in service use of patients and caregivers. The HSSUI is a reliable and valid self-report questionnaire that measures the use of health and social services from a societal perspective. The HSSUI provides information on different categories of use including acute care service use such as emergency department visits and hospitalizations, use of nursing and allied health professionals, and visits to family doctors and specialists. As part of the HSSUI, diabetes and other medications, supplies and devices will also be assessed. Change in the use of health and social services will be assessed for patients and caregivers using the HSSUI. Only patients will additionally be assessed for change in medication use using the HSSUI.</description>
