  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Purpose: Shoulder injuries are commonly seen in overhead athletes due to the
      mechanism of the repetitive and high velocity movement. While the injury usually cost the
      lost of time in playing, making the decision of the time to return to play (RTP) is a
      critical issue that should be standardized and objective. However, current studies showed
      that the decision making of RTP is so complicated that there's lack of objective measurements
      especially for upper extremity injuries. So, investigating the usage of convenient and valid
      tools, functional performance assessments for assessing the ability to RTP is the main
      objective of this study.

      Objective: There are 2 objectives for this study: (1) to investigate the difference between
      RTP group and non-RTP in overhead athletes with shoulder injury; (2) to investigate the
      responsiveness of the functional performance assessment in return to play for overhead
      athletes with shoulder injury. Methods: Overhead athletes with shoulder injury or surgery
      which leads to temporary leaving to the sport within will be recruited in this study. The
      shoulder joint range of motion (flexion, extension, external/internal rotation, and
      abduction), shoulder muscle strength (flexors, abductors and external/internal rotators),
      patient-reported outcome (KJOC and DASH questionnaire) and functional performance assessments
      (FMS, YBT-UQ, CKCUEST, USSP and TPUT) will be assessed at 6 months after the athlete was
      injured or received surgery, and at the time point if the athletes successfully complete at
      least one formal game or practice game (RTP group). If the athlete doesn't return within 12
      months after injury or surgery, the assess will be done at the 12th month after injury or
      surgery. Significance and Contribution: This study is going to provide an objective
      measurement value of functional performance assessment in injured overhead athletes,
      determining whether the strength, endurance or power of the upper extremity is good enough to
      return to the sport that the athlete played before this injury. The result is also expected
      to have significant contribution in the area of sports medicine in return to play especially
      in overhead athletes, which has limited evidence providing specific criteria and objective
      measurement value previously.

    <description>patient reported outcome about the functional status of the shoulder The questionnaire is divided into 4 parts, the first part assesses the disability in daily activities, the second part assesses the severity of the symptom, the third and fourth part assesses the disability in working and playing sports or music instruments. The scale is from 1 to 5, which higher points indicates greater disability.
First and second part will be sum up and get the total score, which higher score indicates greater disability in arm, shoulder or hand region.
The third and fourth part will be assessed independently, and the score as well as higher scores indicates higher degree of disability in arm, shoulder, and hand region.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>patient reported outcome about the functional status of the shoulder This questionnaire contains 10 different items, which are about the performance during overhead sports competition. Each item score ranges from 0 to 10, which higher scores indicate better performance or less change or influence in their performance and each item will be sum up to get the total score. Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 100, and the higher the score, the better the functional status they were.</description>
