    <textblock>
      This study compare general anesthesia versus locoregional anesthesia for evacuation of
      chronic subdural hematoma. Half of participant will be operated under general anesthesia,
      while the other half will be operated under locoregional anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is the most common technique for this surgery. The local anesthesia is
      less common but it allows to obtain the same surgical result. This last technique being more
      recent little study compared these two techniques in terms of complications and postoperative
      consequences.

      The investigators will randomize patients into two groups (a general anesthesia group and a
      locoregional anesthesia group).

      General anesthesia provides complete immobility and optimal surgical comfort but is a source
      of multiple complications, especially in a population of polypathological and polymedicated
      elderly patients (which is the population affected by chronic subdural hematomas).

      Locoregional anesthesia requires special technical training, leads to complete analgesia of
      the surgical procedure but does not involve complete immobility of the patient, however this
      technique probably leads to less postoperative complications and allows a more early
      rehabilitation.
