  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the presented study was to assess the influence of Ketogenic (KD) and a
      carbohydrate diet with a low glycemic index (CHO-LGI) of a 4-week diet on physical and
      specific performance capacity, exercise metabolism, as well as concentrations of the selected
      biochemical blood markers in Crossfit- trained athletes, in a randomised and parallel trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of various dietary strategies, including the alternative ketogenic diet - recently
      popular among strength athletes, has not been unequivocally assessed in the high-intensity
      sport disciplines that Crossfit belongs to. There is also a lack of data in these disciplines
      about the potential longer adaptation of athletes to the very low carbohydrate intake
      resulting from the ketogenic diet and its impact in high-intensity Crossfit training.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of a 4-week KD and a
      CHO-LGI diet on physical and specific performance capacity, exercise metabolism, as well as
      concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in Crossfit- trained athletes, in a
      randomised and parallel trial.

    <description>Group consuming very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet model was energetically normalized (covered the estimated energy expenditure) and assumed coverage of the daily energy requirement up to 5% of energy from carbohydrates. Proteins were administered in the amount of 1.7 g per kilogram of body mass. The remaining energy needs were covered with fats (fats covered more than 75% of the daily energy requirement). Each of the subjects in this group received 10-day menus.</description>

    <description>Group consuming carbohydrate, low-glycemic index diet. The carbohydrate diet model with a low glycemic index was energetically normalized (covered the estimated energy expenditure) and assumed coverage of the daily energy requirement of 25% of fat. Proteins were administered in the amount of 1.7 g per kilogram of body mass. The remaining energy needs were covered with carbohydrates (carbohydrates covered about ~55% of the daily energy requirement). The glycemic index of individual meals as well as the daily diet was calculated in accordance with the appropriate recommendations. Each of the subjects in this group received 10-day menus.</description>
