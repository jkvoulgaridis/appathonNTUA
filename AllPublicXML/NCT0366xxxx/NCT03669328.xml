  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the analgesic and anti-nausea prevention techniques of the investigators
      justifies being evaluated regularly in order to adapt the management strategy to the
      specificities of each surgical act.

      A first evaluation took place in June 2016 and allowed to identify a category of patients
      (partial breast surgery with or without axillary gesture) not benefiting from an ideal
      algological management because justifying in 30% of the cases of a level 3 analgesic remedy
      in the postoperative recovery room. This use of morphine results in a significant incidence
      of postoperative nausea and prolonged recovery time before return home harmful to the
      patient.

      With their experience in locoregional anesthesia technique in complete breast surgery (total
      mastectomy) and aware of the effectiveness of this type of anesthesia on the management of
      immediate and chronic pain, the investigators have extended their indications of ALR to
      partial breast surgery in ambulatory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the anesthesia consultation, the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is
      evaluated by the Apfel score (Apfel CC, Anesthesiology 1999) and a preventive strategy
      correlated to this score is then determined. An order including anti-emetics and analgesics
      is given to the patient for the return home after the outpatient surgery.

      On the day of the outpatient surgery, patients receive in the operating room the prevention
      of PONV according to their level of risk (according to the recommendations of the Société
      Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation - SFAR 2008 and Guidelines 2014) and analgesics
      including a level II and NSAIDs (in the absence of contraindication).

      All patients underwent general anaesthesia with sufentanil and propofol. Mechanical
      ventilation was performed with laryngeal mask. A echoguided regional anesthesia was performed
      by injection of 20 ml of ropivacaine 3.75 mg/ml above and under the serratus muscle as
      described by Blanco and al (ref 3)&quot; In the postoperative recovery room, PONV is treated if
      necessary by an anti-emetic class different from those used in the block. In postoperative
      pain with EVA&gt; 3, morphine titration is performed as recommended.

      Patients are then monitored in an outpatient surgery unit until they have a home-based return
      capability assessed by the CHUNG score, including the level of pain (moderate and well
      relieved), the absence of persistent nausea, and the ability to ambulation.

      All outpatient surgery patients are called the day after their return home to ensure the
      absence of complications according to the regulatory procedure related to outpatient
      anesthesia.

      As part of this evaluation, information on the level of pain at rest and mobility, as well as
      the frequency of PONV are also recorded and this follow-up is repeated in D2 and D3 after the
      intervention.

      This information is then correlated with the type of anesthesia performed, the surgical
      procedure as well as the analgesic strategy (ALR) and the antinausea strategy performed.

    <description>Pain level in post-operative room measured by Simple Verbal Evaluation. The simple verbal scale or Keele scale has 5 qualifiers to describe the intensity of the pain, each descriptor is associated with a numerical value. 0 = no pain, 1 = poor, 2 = moderate, 3 = intense, 4 = atrocious.
The goal of management is to achieve pain values below 3 (low to moderate).</description>

    <description>The risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is evaluated by the Apfel score and a preventive strategy correlated to this score is then determined. An order including anti-emetics and analgesics is given to the patient for the return home after the outpatient surgery. The Apfel score includes four variables (Female sex, History of motion sickness or postoperative nausea and vomiting, Nonsmoker, Postoperative opioid treatment is planned) and assigns one point for each.</description>

        During the period from 01 to 30 June 2016, all patients admitted for ambulatory surgery
        under general anesthesia were included in this prospective &quot;before-after&quot; study.

        To have two perfectly comparable populations, we chose to reassess all patients in
        outpatient surgery combined, on the second period (18 to 5 July 2018), even if our changes
        of care only concerns breast.
