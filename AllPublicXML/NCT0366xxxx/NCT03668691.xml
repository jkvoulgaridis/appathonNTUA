        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients over 21 years of age who require a primary robotic-arm assisted
             unicompartmental knee arthroplasty or bicompartmental knee arthroplasty. These
             patients will have failed non-operative management of their joint disease and are
             candidates for partial joint replacement because of pain and stiffness that interferes
             with their performances or normal daily activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient had an active infection

          -  Onlay implants were implanted without bone cement

          -  Patient does not have enough bone stock to allow for insertion and fixation of the
             components

          -  Patient does not have sufficient soft tissue integrity to allow for stability

          -  Patient has a neurological or muscular deformity that did not allow for control of the
             knee

          -  Patient will be excluded from participation in the study if they are cognitively
             unable to answer study questions

          -  Pregnant women are excluded.
