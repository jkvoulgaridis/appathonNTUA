  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroscientific models of maladaptive aging emphasize the loss of sensorimotor stimulation
      and reduced modulatory capacities as core processes in the development of maladaptive plastic
      changes of the brain and subsequent cognitive and bodily decline as determinants of frailty
      and multimorbidity in old age. The investigators plan to analyze anatomical,
      neurophysiological, and neuropsychological correlates of maladaptive plasticity in frail
      persons and plan to test how innovative interventions that target maladaptive plasticity
      alter brain function and neurocognitive skills. There are novel interventions that have been
      shown to target the neurocognitive deficits and enhance plasticity in brain areas that are
      affected first in the progress of aging. Specifically, sensory training has been employed to
      enhance relevant input to the brain and to improve neuromodulatory function and has yielded
      high effect sizes. The investigators will perform proof of concept studies to examine the
      utility of sensorimotor training and examine the role of brain-derived neurotrophic growth
      factor to enhance brain plasticity and memory functions, as well as their transfer to other
      cognitive domains. The investigators will implement motivational enhancement strategies using
      virtual reality in these treatments that can further boost training effects and plasticity,
      but have not been employed in these treatments so far. Biomarkers for the remediation of
      maladaptive changes will involve neuropsychological assessments, brain imaging, brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and BDNF genotype. Thus, the investigators will be able to
      comprehensively characterize dysfunctional plasticity and the specific mechanisms of the
      interventions that are employed and investigate innovative clinical trials.
