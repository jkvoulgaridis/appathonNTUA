  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental involvement, both quantitative and qualitative, is fundamental for a good
      psycho-emotional development of the child. The lack of parental involvement and especially
      paternal involvement significantly promotes the occurrence of behavioral disorders in
      children and later, in adolescence, the onset of depressive symptomatology. On the other
      hand, parental involvement has a protective role in the occurrence of behavioral disorders
      and decreases the risk of suicide attempts in adolescence. The authors of these cohort
      studies agree on the need for research on the identification of factors determining paternal
      involvement in order to organize specific prevention actions and targeted interventions to
      promote the involvement of fathers in psychiatric care of their adolescents.

      The prevention of adolescent suicide attempts appears to be a real public health issue in
      Reunion Island with a suicide rate among under-35s twice as high as in Reunion than in
      metropolitan France.

      This work is a continuation of the guidelines of good practice of the High Authority of
      Health (HAS) which insist on the importance of &quot;supporting the parental function by health
      and public action&quot;.
