  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with stroke may experience sensory-motor deficit and/or neglect, with possible
      reduction in motor imagery ability (MI). To our knowledge, no study completely investigated
      MI ability in one individual whereas MI practice can be performed using visual or kinesthetic
      modalities (respectively visualizing with mind's eyes or imagining movement using sensation)
      and internal or external perspectives (performing action as spectator or as actor). This
      study aims to investigate MI ability in patients with stroke as compared to aged-matched
      healthy individuals. The investigators will assess explicit MI ability using 3 questionnaires
      (Movement Imagery Questionnaire-RS - MIQ-RS, Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20
      - KVIQ-20, Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2 - VMIQ-2) and 2 tests (imagined Time
      Up and Go - iTUG, imagined Box and Block test - iBBT). Outcome parameters will be i) the
      composite score of vividness measured for all tests using Likert scales, ii) the temporal
      equivalence between MI and Physical practice (PP - where MI/PP ratio equal to 1 indicate good
      MI ability and respect of temporal equivalence between MI and PP) and iii) the amplitude of
      electrodermal activity. The investigators will also study implicit MI ability using a hand
      laterality judgment task. Outcomes parameters will be response time (i.e. the duration to
      identify the hand laterality) and the percentage of correct responses.
