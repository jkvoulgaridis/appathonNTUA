  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine whether a currently licensed version of botulinum toxin
      (Dysport®) is effective for the treatment of pain that has developed and/or persisted for
      months or years around the scar of a previous surgical site, and whether this condition could
      be suitable for the testing of similar new medicines. The study will compare three different
      doses of Dysport® to see if there is benefit and/or a best dose for treating persistent
      post-surgery scar pain.

             (unrelated to the pain) that could interfere with pain assessments; other pre-existing
             pain syndromes, acute or chronic, that might impair the assessment of the scar pain.

          -  Any medical history of significance and/or inadequately controlled such as

             events, severe heart failure), pulmonary (e.g. uncontrolled asthma or emphysema),
             haematologic, (e.g. coagulopathy/bleeding disorders), neurological (e.g. swallowing
             problems, blurred or double vision, trouble saying words clearly (dysarthria),
             hoarseness or change or loss of voice (dysphonia)), liver disease (e.g. severe hepatic
             impairment), kidney disease (e.g. impaired renal function in subjects taking
             diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, or angiotensin II
             antagonists), endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic painful conditions or any other
