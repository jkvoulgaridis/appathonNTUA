      The purpose of this study is to describe pain relief in TTH with Neosaldina treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non-interventional and prospective study of healthy participants
      with episodic TTH who have already been treated with Neosaldina according to regular clinical
      practice. This study will assess the pain intensity and pain relief of TTH after the uptake
      of Neosaldina.

      This study will enroll approximately 317 participants. All participants will be enrolled into
      one observational group:

      â€¢ Neosaldina

      Investigators will assess participants from the time of enrolment through the completion of
      observation period up to 6 months. Each participant will be assessed up to 45 days after
      first dose. The data will be collected from medical charts and during routine follow up
      visits. The data from participants will be collected through a self-administered
      questionnaire using a mobile phone. All the participants will be instructed to insert the
      data in an application, downloaded in their phone whenever they will have an episode of TTH
      and use Neosaldina.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall duration of observation
      period in this study is approximately 6 months. Participants will be contacted by telephone
      on Days 15 and 30 for a follow up and will make a final visit on Day 45.

    <measure>Time-weighted sum of Pain Intensity Difference From 0 to 2 Hours Post-dose (SPID 0-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 (Baseline) up to 2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) will be calculated as time-weighted sum of the visual analogue scale (VAS) differences over 2 hour period. Pain intensity will be measured by VAS which is an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). Pain intensity difference (PID) is the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the dosing) and current pain intensity at assessment. Total score ranges from -60 (worst) to 60 (best) for SPID 0-2. A higher value in SPID indicates greater pain relief.</description>

    <description>The relief of pain intensity will be assessed by the percentage pain intensity difference (PID%) in each time point. Pain intensity will be measured by VAS which is an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). PID is the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the dosing) and current pain intensity at assessment.</description>

    <description>Participants with episodic TTH and who have already been treated with Neosaldina will be included in the observation period of this study. During the observation period, participants will be administered with Neosaldina 2 tablets, orally in the beginning of the TTH episode, every 6 hours, and at maximum of 8 tablets per day, according to regular clinical practice of the physicians. The participants will be observed in this study from Day 1 until Day 45.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
