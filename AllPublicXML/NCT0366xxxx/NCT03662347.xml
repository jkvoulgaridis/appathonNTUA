  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common symptom and the most disabling symptom of Multiple Sclerosis, and
      its inefficient management can be a source of multiple consultations (increase in health
      costs) and a reduction in productivity (work stoppages).

      Hence the need to define the most effective therapeutic strategy to reduce fatigue in
      Multiple Sclerosis.

      One of the aims of this project is to provide clinical indicators that can serve as
      evaluation criteria for determining the most effective fatigue management strategy in
      Multiple Sclerosis.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the Minimal Clinically Important
      Difference (MCID) and the Patient Acceptable Symptomatic State (PASS) for fatigue in Multiple
      Sclerosis.

      The source population consists of all people with Multiple Sclerosis living in Lorraine and
      registered in the Lorraine Registry of Multiple Sclerosis (RelSEP).

      Two-year patient follow-up is planned with data collection at 0, 12 and 24 months.

      In addition to data already collected as part of the establishment and monitoring of the
      ReLSEP registry, more specific data for this study will be collected at 0, 12 and 24 months
      by self-questionnaires sent to patients' homes.
