      This study evaluates the effect of sublimated mare milk supplement on patients with biliary
      cholangitis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis, formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is a rare chronic
      disease that primarily affects women. Primary biliary cholangitis often progresses to the
      terminal stage of liver cirrhosis with its inherent complications. At this stage, the only
      way to save the patient's life is liver transplantation, and is accompanied by a number of
      painful symptoms (itching, mucous dryness, abdominal discomfort, fatigue), often restless
      legs syndrome, insomnia, depression and cognitive dysfunction.

      The goal of the treatment is to prevent the terminal stage of cirrhosis of the liver and to
      alleviate the accompanying symptoms. Conventional drug therapy is aimed at slowing the
      progression of the disease and includes both approved for the use of these medications
      (ursodeoxycholic acid) and used outside the approved indications (derivatives of fibric acid,
      budesonide).

      The role of this clinical trial is to increase the effectiveness of therapy for this disease.
      Against the background of the complexity of the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis,
      clinical medicine acquires a remedy in the form of a natural product - mare's milk,
      preventive, dietary, medicinal effects of which have been known for a long time. There are
      data from studies that have shown the efficacy and safety of using mare milk in patients with
      atopic dermatitis as well as with inflammatory bowel diseases. For the liver diseases, there
      are no reported studies.

      In this trial, there will be two parallel groups: Interventional (supplement with standard
      treatment first for 3 months) and Standard treatment group. Differences in clinical,
      laboratory, liver encephalopathy and asthenia will be evaluated between groups.
