  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to examine the effectiveness of a computer-based auditory training
      program to improve the benefits received by individuals who wear hearing aids. The study will
      involve 3 groups - a computer-based training group, an active listening group which will
      involve listening to books on CD, and a placebo group that receives no additional treatment.

    <textblock>
      This proposed study is a multi-site, single-masked (blinded), randomized controlled, parallel
      group clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of an at home PC-based auditory training as
      a supplement to standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention in veterans treated for hearing
      loss, with or without previous hearing-aid experience. The participants will be assigned
      randomly to one of three groups, with hearing-aid use stratified within the groups: (1) Group
      1, HA+AT, in which the participants will receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention
      (HA) and complete the four-week LACE auditory training program (AT); (2) Group 2, HA, with
      the participants receiving only standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention (HA); and (3) Group
      3, HA+DL, in which the participants will receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention
      (HA) and complete four-weeks of placebo auditory training, consisting of directed listening
      (DL) to books-on-tape. The participants in each group will attend four test sessions. During
      Session 1 the informed consent process will be completed, baseline assessments will be made
      to ensure that the participants meet the study inclusion criteria (page 52), testing of
      predictor variables (page 57-58) will be completed, and all hearing aids will be assessed for
      correct functionality (page 53). The participants then will be assigned randomly to a study
      group. Session 2 will occur four weeks after Session 1. During Session 2, baseline
      performance on the outcome measures will be assessed (page 54-57), as will performance on the
      predictor variables. Following testing, the participants in Groups 1 and 3 will receive
      training in the use of the AT or DL programs. Session 3 will occur at the end of the 4-week
      experimental training period. During Session 3 all participants will be retested on the
      outcome measures to assess short-term intervention outcomes. During Session 4, which will
      occur at seven-months post-study enrollment (i.e., six-months post training completion for
      Groups 1 and 3), all participants will be retested on all outcome measures to examine the
      long-term outcomes. In Sessions 2-4, the stability of hearing-aid function will be assessed
      through electroacoustic measures.

    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention (up to 2 to 6 weeks), 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Monosyllabic words (NU-6 female version) with a carrier phrase were presented auditory only in a multitalker babble.The participant is asked to repeat the last word of each phrase. The total number of correct words is input into the Spearman-Karber equation to derive a 50% point. This is the signal-to-noise ratio in dB that an individual requires to get 50% of the words correct. This test was completed at baseline and follow up visits.</description>

    <measure>Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention (up to 2 to 6 weeks), 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (APHAP; Cox &amp; Alexander 1995) was used to assess activity limitations and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly or Adults (HHI; Ventry &amp; Weinstein 1982; Newman et al. 1990) was used to assess participation restrictions. The APHAP is a 24-item questionnaire that documents hearing difficulties in specified listening situations. The items are answered on a 7-point scale from 'Always' (or 99%) to 'Never' (or 1%) with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing difficulty. The APHAP global score that ranges from 1 to 99 was used for all analyses.</description>

    <measure>Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHI) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention (up to 2 to 6 weeks), 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The HHI is a 25-item questionnaire that assesses the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. The HHI for the elderly is for individuals age 65 years and older (Ventry &amp; Weinstein 1982); the HHI for adults is for individuals aged 64 years and younger (Newman et al. 1990). The versions differ in the wording of three questions. The participants were asked to complete the appropriate HHI for aided listening to reflect their residual hearing handicap. HHI items are answered on a scale of Yes (4 points), Sometimes (2 points) and No (0 points), with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing handicap. Total HHI scores, which can range from 0 to 100, were used for all analyses.</description>

        <description>The Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (APHAP; Cox &amp; Alexander 1995) was used to assess activity limitations and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly or Adults (HHI; Ventry &amp; Weinstein 1982; Newman et al. 1990) was used to assess participation restrictions. The APHAP is a 24-item questionnaire that documents hearing difficulties in specified listening situations. The items are answered on a 7-point scale from 'Always' (or 99%) to 'Never' (or 1%) with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing difficulty. The APHAP global score that ranges from 1 to 99 was used for all analyses.</description>

        <title>Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHI) Change</title>
        <description>The HHI is a 25-item questionnaire that assesses the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. The HHI for the elderly is for individuals age 65 years and older (Ventry &amp; Weinstein 1982); the HHI for adults is for individuals aged 64 years and younger (Newman et al. 1990). The versions differ in the wording of three questions. The participants were asked to complete the appropriate HHI for aided listening to reflect their residual hearing handicap. HHI items are answered on a scale of Yes (4 points), Sometimes (2 points) and No (0 points), with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing handicap. Total HHI scores, which can range from 0 to 100, were used for all analyses.</description>

          <title>Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHI) Change</title>
          <description>The HHI is a 25-item questionnaire that assesses the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. The HHI for the elderly is for individuals age 65 years and older (Ventry &amp; Weinstein 1982); the HHI for adults is for individuals aged 64 years and younger (Newman et al. 1990). The versions differ in the wording of three questions. The participants were asked to complete the appropriate HHI for aided listening to reflect their residual hearing handicap. HHI items are answered on a scale of Yes (4 points), Sometimes (2 points) and No (0 points), with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing handicap. Total HHI scores, which can range from 0 to 100, were used for all analyses.</description>
