      This is a phase I - II multicenter, non-comparative, open label study in patients with
      previously treated CLL aimed at defining the MTD of Lenalidomide given in combination with
      Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide and at evaluating the (CR) rate of FC given in combination with
      the MTD of Lenalidomide (FCL).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Lenalidomide given in combination with
           FC.(Phase I)

        -  To evaluate the complete remission (CR) rate of FC given in combination with the MTD of
           Lenalidomide (FCL). (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To define the toxicity and the infection rate of patients treated with FCL and the
           median number of delivered courses of FCL, overall response rate and the
           progression-free survival and the relationship between the response and the baseline
           biologic factors (IgVH, FISH, ZAP-70, CD38).

        -  To evaluate the overall response rate (complete and partial responses).

        -  To evaluate the progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I - II multicenter, non-comparative, open label study in patients
      with previously treated CLL aimed at defining the MTD of Lenalidomide given in combination
      with Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide and at evaluating the (CR) rate of FC given in combination
      with the MTD of Lenalidomide (FCL).

      All patients will receive six monthly courses of FCL schedule consisting of three days of
      Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide administration (d1-d3) combined with 14 days of Lenalidomide
      administration (d1-d14).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 18 months.

          <title>Phase I-II Lenalidomide</title>
          <description>The phase I of the study, carried out at a single center (Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome) was focused at defining the MTD of lenalidomide given in combination with the FC regimen according to a 3 + 3 patient design. During the first course of treatment, lenalidomide was given to all patients at the starting dose of 2.5 mg daily (d1â€“d14). For the subsequent courses, the dose of lenalidomide was progressively escalated at each course, according to a 3 + 3 patient design. In 3 cohorts of 3 patients each, a daily dose of 5, 10, and 15 mg of lenalidomide was tested unless a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was experienced.
The presence of a persistent and severe hematologic toxicity, grade 2 tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), grade 3 tumor flare reaction (TFR), or other grade 3 toxicities was defined as DLT.
In the second phase of the study, FC was given in combination with lenalidomide escalated from 2.5 mg to reach the MTD or the maximum planned dose of 15 mg.</description>

          <title>Phase I-II Lenalidomide</title>
          <description>The phase I of the study, carried out at a single center (Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome) was focused at defining the MTD of lenalidomide given in combination with the FC regimen according to a 3 + 3 patient design. During the first course of treatment, lenalidomide was given to all patients at the starting dose of 2.5 mg daily (d1â€“d14). For the subsequent courses, the dose of lenalidomide was progressively escalated at each course, according to a 3 + 3 patient design. In 3 cohorts of 3 patients each, a daily dose of 5, 10, and 15 mg of lenalidomide was tested unless a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was experienced.
The presence of a persistent and severe hematologic toxicity, grade 2 tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), grade 3 tumor flare reaction (TFR), or other grade 3 toxicities was defined as DLT.
In the second phase of the study, FC was given in combination with lenalidomide escalated from 2.5 mg to reach the MTD or the maximum planned dose of 15 mg.</description>

            <description>The phase I of the study, carried out at a single center (Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome) was focused at defining the MTD of lenalidomide given in combination with the FC regimen according to a 3 + 3 patient design. During the first course of treatment, lenalidomide was given to all patients at the starting dose of 2.5 mg daily (d1â€“d14). For the subsequent courses, the dose of lenalidomide was progressively escalated at each course, according to a 3 + 3 patient design. In 3 cohorts of 3 patients each, a daily dose of 5, 10, and 15 mg of lenalidomide was tested unless a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was experienced.
The presence of a persistent and severe hematologic toxicity, grade 2 tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), grade 3 tumor flare reaction (TFR), or other grade 3 toxicities was defined as DLT.
In the second phase of the study, FC was given in combination with lenalidomide escalated from 2.5 mg to reach the MTD or the maximum planned dose of 15 mg.</description>
