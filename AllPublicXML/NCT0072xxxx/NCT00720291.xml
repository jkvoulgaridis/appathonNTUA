  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies demonstrate that untreated bacterial vaginosis increases the rate of preterm
      birth. Despite this, there is no evidence that screening and treatment of asymptomatic
      bacterial vaginosis nor interpregnancy treatment of endometritis decreases the subsequent
      rate of preterm birth. However, treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis has been
      associated with a modest reduction in subsequent preterm birth. Potential mechanisms for this
      reduction include a decrease in peripheral maternal pro-inflammatory activation of the TH1
      inflammatory cascade with treatment, however this direct pathway has not been elucidated. The
      approved treatment for bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy consists of Metronidazole 500mg
      BID for 7 days. A more complete understanding of the effect of Metronidazole on maternal
      inflammation would be useful in designing strategies to reduce the rates of preterm birth.

      This study proposes to determine the effect of standard treatment of BV carriage on maternal
      serum markers of inflammation. This will be accomplished by giving patients with asymptomatic
      BV either the standard treatment of metronidazole or a placebo for 7 days. Blood will be
      drawn to compare levels of Interleukins 1 and 6 as well as Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha.
