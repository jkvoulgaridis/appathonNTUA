    <measure>Number of Participants With All-Causality and Treatment Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 to 85 for SAD cohorts and Days 1 to 169 for MAD cohorts; participants with positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) results were followed up to stabilization of ADA titers or up to 9 months after Day 169 visit.</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of its causal relationship with study treatment. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 85 (for SAD cohorts) or Day 169 (for MAD cohorts) that were absent before treatment or that worsened after treatment. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Causality with the study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting or Intolerable Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 to 85 for SAD cohorts; Days 1 to 169 for MAD Cohorts</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting or intolerable AEs were originally planned to be collected. However, this outcome measure was not actually summarized, since collection and monitoring of treatment-emergent AEs was performed during the study, and deemed sufficient to ensure the participants safety.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With All-Causality and Treatment Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of its causal relationship with study treatment. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 85 (for SAD cohorts) or Day 169 (for MAD cohorts) that were absent before treatment or that worsened after treatment. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Causality with the study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>
        <time_frame>Days 1 to 85 for SAD cohorts and Days 1 to 169 for MAD cohorts; participants with positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) results were followed up to stabilization of ADA titers or up to 9 months after Day 169 visit.</time_frame>

          <title>Number of Participants With All-Causality and Treatment Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of its causal relationship with study treatment. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 85 (for SAD cohorts) or Day 169 (for MAD cohorts) that were absent before treatment or that worsened after treatment. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Causality with the study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>Pfizer has the right to review disclosures, requesting a delay of less than 60 days.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Originally planned 250 mg cohort was not enrolled in MAD part, because 150 mg cohort already demonstrated optimal glucose-lowering effect. Protocol-specified TBD (to be determined) dose level was 50 mg as well as expansion of the 75 mg cohort.</limitations_and_caveats>
