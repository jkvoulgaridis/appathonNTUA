  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well donor cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
      work in treating patients with a cytomegalovirus infection that has come back or has not
      gotten better despite standard therapy. White blood cells from donors who have been exposed
      to cytomegalovirus may be effective in treating patients with a cytomegalovirus infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and safety of administering most closely human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
      (HMC-CTLs) generated by &quot;gamma-catch&quot; to mediate antiviral activity in hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with CMV infections.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the persistency of the administered HMC-CTLs generated by &quot;gamma-catch&quot; and
      their contribution immune reconstitution.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes intravenously
      (IV). Patients with partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease may receive an
      additional dose of allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes at a minimum
      of 2 weeks from the first infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with or without a malignancy; and/or any type of autologous or allogeneic
             HSCT; and/or patients who are immunocompromised with CMV infection will be included

          -  Persistent CMV infection despite optimum anti-viral therapy

               -  Patients with CMV disease: defined as the demonstration of CMV by biopsy specimen
                  from visceral sites (by culture or histology) or the detection of CMV by culture
                  or direct fluorescent antibody stain in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the
                  presence of new or changing pulmonary infiltrates; OR

             findings attributable to infection; persisting fever without other signs or symptoms
