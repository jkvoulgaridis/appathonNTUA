  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess a novel active drug vs. placebo on ability to reduce smoking and aid
      cessation during a one-week &quot;practice&quot; quit period for each condition in smokers with a high
      interest in quitting (i.e. crossover design). Medication effects on reducing withdrawal and
      cognitive impairment will help assess the mechanism to support quit smoking attempts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to test the proof of principal that an alpha-7 PAM drug, JNJ-39393406, promotes
      smoking cessation when compared to placebo. We have developed, tested, and validated an
      efficient Phase 2a screening procedure that optimally combines the validity of randomized
      clinical trials with the practicality of lab- based medication studies. Notably, it employs a
      within-subject, cross-over design comparing active versus placebo effects on quitting smoking
      to maximize statistical power without a large sample, in contrast to the large samples needed
      for between-groups randomized treatment conditions. Using this procedure, we will evaluate
      effects of JNJ-39393406 vs. placebo on short-term smoking abstinence in smokers who already
      have a high interest in quitting soon. We predict that, compared with placebo, JNJ-39393406
      will increase days of abstinence, identifying initial evidence of efficacy for smoking
      cessation. Our main dependent measure is days of very stringent biochemically validated
      (expired CO&lt;5 ppm) 24-hr smoking abstinence, with post-quit withdrawal and cognitive function
      as secondary measures. Potential for adverse side-effects will be assessed at each visit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quit Status</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one week each drug phase (0-5)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete abstinence from smoking for 24 hr is counted as a &quot;quit day&quot; and is assessed daily from Mon-Fri for just one week, on the JNJ active drug and one week on placebo. This same Mon-Fri procedure for one week (only) is done for both drug phases. Total outcome in each drug condition therefore is number of quit days out of the five assessment days (range 0-5).</description>

    <measure>Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) During Attempt to Quit on Active JNJ Drug and on Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>only on days quit while on JNJ or on placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of withdrawal symptoms will be assessed with standard self-report measure of Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) each quit day during one week only on active JNJ, and each quit day during one week on placebo. Ratings are made on 0-100 visual analog scale, with 0=&quot;not at all&quot; to 100=&quot;very much&quot;, and are averaged to create a total score also ranging from 0-100. Higher scores indicate more severe withdrawal.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Function on Continuous Performance Task (CPT) for Those With CO&lt;10 During First Assessment Day (Mon) of Attempt to Quit Smoking During Both JNJ and Plac Quit Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>first day during quit week on JNJ, and during quit week on placebo.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure of cognitive performance (mean of median speed of correct responding on computer keyboard to letters and numbers) was assessed only on Monday (day 1) of the 0-5 days during each drug/placebo condition. Data only from those shown to have CO&lt;10 ppm were analyzed, to confirm responding during abstinence while on drug/placebo condition. Cognitive testing consisted of standard Continuous Performance Task (CPT), on active JNJ and on placebo phases. This measure is assessed to determine potential mechanism of drug efficacy in relieving disrupted cognitive processing function caused by tobacco deprivation and withdrawal.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function on Continuous Performance Task (CPT) for Those With CO&lt;10 During First Assessment Day (Mon) of Attempt to Quit Smoking During Both JNJ and Plac Quit Periods</title>
        <description>This measure of cognitive performance (mean of median speed of correct responding on computer keyboard to letters and numbers) was assessed only on Monday (day 1) of the 0-5 days during each drug/placebo condition. Data only from those shown to have CO&lt;10 ppm were analyzed, to confirm responding during abstinence while on drug/placebo condition. Cognitive testing consisted of standard Continuous Performance Task (CPT), on active JNJ and on placebo phases. This measure is assessed to determine potential mechanism of drug efficacy in relieving disrupted cognitive processing function caused by tobacco deprivation and withdrawal.</description>
