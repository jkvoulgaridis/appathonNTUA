    <time_frame>Compare preoperative values with postoperative values (up to 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Breast Q is a comprehensive and specific quality of life instrument that allows for patient self-assessment prior to and following breast surgery. Comprised of quality of life and satisfaction domains, and generates domain-specific Q-scores (0-100) constructed using Rasch analysis. The higher the score, the more satisfied the participant was.
-Collected preoperatively (no more than 3 months prior to surgery) and postoperatively (approximately 6 months after conclusion of radiotherapy in the Breast Conservation Cohort and &gt;=3 months after the final balancing reconstructive intervention in the Mastectomy and Reconstruction Cohort.</description>

        Females ages 18 - 72 years of age scheduled to undergo breast conservation therapy (BCT),
        mastectomy or mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),
        lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and early stage breast cancer (Clinical Stages IA-IIB).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be scheduled to undergo breast conservation therapy (BCT), mastectomy or
             mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (defined as initiating the reconstructive
             process at time of mastectomy) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma
             in situ (LCIS), and early stage breast cancer (Clinical Stages IA-IIB). Stage IIB
             tumors are 2-5 cm with micrometastases 0.2 to 2.0 cm in lymph nodes; or 2-5 cm tumor
             with 1-3 positive axillary or internal mammary lymph nodes, or &gt;5 cm with no lymph
             node involvement. Clinical staging, based on imaging and physical exam will be used
             for enrollment. Patients that are upstaged due to unexpected findings at the time of
             surgery/assessment of surgical pathology will be excluded at that time. For staging
             reference please see
             http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/patient/page2#keypoint13

          -  If multifocal/multicentric disease of the ipsilateral breast is encountered and
             patients are still deemed eligible for BCT or mastectomy per standard of care, then
             the tumor area will be calculated as the total volumes of the identified foci.

          -  Patient must be between 18-72 years old

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment

          -  History of radiation to the chest wall or breasts

          -  Patients unable to undergo MRI due to metallic implant or claustrophobia

          -  Patients that are pregnant since breast MRI is contraindicated

          -  History of previous breast surgery other than primary cosmetic augmentation or breast
             reduction

          -  Identification of a concurrent or synchronous contralateral cancer during the
             enrollment period

          -  Any patient that would not have been considered for BCT or reconstruction

          -  BCT patients planning to proceed with reconstruction during their study participation

        <description>The Breast Q is a comprehensive and specific quality of life instrument that allows for patient self-assessment prior to and following breast surgery. Comprised of quality of life and satisfaction domains, and generates domain-specific Q-scores (0-100) constructed using Rasch analysis. The higher the score, the more satisfied the participant was.
-Collected preoperatively (no more than 3 months prior to surgery) and postoperatively (approximately 6 months after conclusion of radiotherapy in the Breast Conservation Cohort and &gt;=3 months after the final balancing reconstructive intervention in the Mastectomy and Reconstruction Cohort.</description>

        <population>-Mastectomy Only cohort was unable to enroll participants due to: participants who chose mastectomy with no reconstruction almost never had an MRI and MRI was a critical inclusion criteria; most of the participants who were approached were older and refused participation; issue with finding and tracking participants who refused reconstruction</population>
