  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effectiveness of a peer-led social skills training intervention compared
      to social activity (usual care) to improve social communication skills following severe brain
      injury.

      A pilot study first tested the feasibility of the approach and the sensitivity of existing
      outcome measures to changes in group social interaction. Following amendments to the pilot
      protocol, twelve new participants with severe ABI were recruited from a residential
      post-acute rehabilitation centre in April 2015. An experimental parallel group design was
      used to compare a peer-led group intervention to a staff-led social activity group.
      Participants were randomised to a peer-led intervention (n=6) or a staff-led social activity
      group (usual care) (n=6). The groups met twice a week for 8 weeks. A peer with severe ABI was
      trained separately to facilitate interaction in the peer-led group. The training took place
      in 16 individual sessions over 4 weeks. Group behaviour was measured twice at baseline, after
      intervention and at maintenance (4 weeks) using measures meeting reliability, validity and
      responsiveness criteria tested in the pilot study.
