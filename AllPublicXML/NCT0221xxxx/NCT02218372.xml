    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical response to fidaxomicin oral
      suspension or tablets and vancomycin oral liquid or capsules in pediatric participants with
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). It also investigated the
      recurrence/sustained clinical response to and safety of fidaxomicin and vancomycin, as well
      as acceptance of the fidaxomicin oral suspension formulation.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Clinical Response (CCR) at End of Treatment (EOT) +2 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 12</time_frame>
    <description>Initial clinical response (ICR) for ages from birth to &lt; 2 years was defined as absence of watery diarrhea for 2 consecutive treatment days, remaining well until study drug discontinuation. ICR for ages ≥ 2 years to &lt; 18 years was defined as improvement in number and character of bowel movements as determined by &lt; 3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs) per day for 2 consecutive treatment days, remaining well until study drug discontinuation. CCR was defined for both age groups as not requiring further CDAD therapy within 2 days after study drug completion, and was reported with a positive (Yes) or negative (No) outcome. Resolution of diarrhea was assessed during interviews of participant/parent/legal guardian, supplemented by review of personal records (if hospitalized) and checked for presence of watery diarrhea (ages from birth to &lt; 2 years) or number of UBMs (for ages ≥ 2 years to &lt; 18 years).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Clinical Response (SCR) at EOT +9 Days</measure>

    <description>SCR at EOT + 9 days was defined as CCR (EOT + 2 days) without CDAD recurrence until assessment at EOT +9 days during the follow-up period. Recurrence for ages from birth to &lt; 2 years was defined as re-establishment of watery diarrhea after CCR to an extent that was greater than that noted on the last day of study drug with positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) in stool and that, in the investigator's opinion, required retreatment with CDAD anti-infective therapy. Recurrence for ages ≥ 2 years &lt; 18 years was defined as re-establishment of diarrhea after CCR to an extent (as measured by the frequency of UBMs) that was greater than that noted on the last day of study drug with positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile in stool and that, in the investigator's opinion, required retreatment with CDAD anti-infective therapy.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug or who had undergone study procedures which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. This included abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram data or physical examinations that were defined as AEs if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, required active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant in the investigator's opinion. The following standard with 3 grades was used to measure the severity of AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values: ● Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities ● Moderate: Affected normal daily activities ● Severe: Inability to perform daily activities. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the test drug/comparative drug.</description>

Resolution of diarrhea was assessed during interviews of participant/parent/legal guardian, supplemented by review of personal records (if hospitalized) and checked for presence of watery diarrhea (ages from birth to &lt; 2 years) or number of UBMs (for ages ≥ 2 years to &lt; 18 years).</description>

Recurrence for ages ≥ 2 years &lt; 18 years was defined as re-establishment of diarrhea after CCR to an extent (as measured by the frequency of UBMs) that was greater than that noted on the last day of study drug with positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile in stool and that, in the investigator's opinion, required retreatment with CDAD anti-infective therapy.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Clinical Response (SCR) at EOT +9 Days</title>
          <description>SCR at EOT + 9 days was defined as CCR (EOT + 2 days) without CDAD recurrence until assessment at EOT +9 days during the follow-up period. Recurrence for ages from birth to &lt; 2 years was defined as re-establishment of watery diarrhea after CCR to an extent that was greater than that noted on the last day of study drug with positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) in stool and that, in the investigator's opinion, required retreatment with CDAD anti-infective therapy. Recurrence for ages ≥ 2 years &lt; 18 years was defined as re-establishment of diarrhea after CCR to an extent (as measured by the frequency of UBMs) that was greater than that noted on the last day of study drug with positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile in stool and that, in the investigator's opinion, required retreatment with CDAD anti-infective therapy.</description>

        <title>Time to Recurrence of CDAD for Participants With CCR at EOT +2 Days</title>
        <description>Time to recurrence was defined as the time (days) from CCR until the onset of recurrence. Time to recurrence of CDAD by Kaplan-Meier Method. Data for median was estimated and the 95% CI could not be estimated due to low event rate. Data not estimable denoted as NA. Participants with CCR at EOT+2 days, who completed the follow-up period but did not experience a recurrence of CDAD were censored at EOT+30 days and those who did not complete the follow-up period and discontinued during this period and did not experience a recurrence of CDAD were censored at day of discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug or who had undergone study procedures which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. This included abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram data or physical examinations that were defined as AEs if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, required active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant in the investigator's opinion. The following standard with 3 grades was used to measure the severity of AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values: ● Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities ● Moderate: Affected normal daily activities ● Severe: Inability to perform daily activities. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the test drug/comparative drug.</description>
