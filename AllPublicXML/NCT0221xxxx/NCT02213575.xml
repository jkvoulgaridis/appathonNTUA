    <textblock>
      This study is a mechanistic study that will enroll 9 subjects who are participating in
      NCT02133885 (which is designed to evaluate minocycline to test the hypothesis that
      minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive effects in drug-resistant neurogenic
      hypertensive individuals) to test whether the antihypertensive effect of minocycline is
      associated with a decrease in activated microglia in central nervous system autonomic regions
      as evidenced by changes in PET and MRI imaging.

    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 9 subjects from NCT02133885 who will agree to undergo additional
      autonomic testing and imaging studies at baseline and after 3-6 months of study treatment.
      Specialized imaging of the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission
      tomography (PET) scanning will be conducted at the Montreal Neurological Institute, in
      Montreal Canada.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects participating in IRB approved protocol #102-2013 will be eligible to
             participate.

          -  (For Study 3 Participants only) Willing to travel to Montreal, Canada for specialized
             imaging of the participant's brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron
             emission tomography (PET) scanning, Autonomic Nervous System Testing and blood
             drawing- if participant qualifies

        Exclusion criteria for control and resistant hypertensive subjects include:

          -  currently pregnant or have been pregnant in the last 6 months;

          -  antibiotic treatment within 2 months of study enrollment;

          -  currently taking a medication (e.g., antibiotic, anti-inflammatory agents,
             glucocorticoids or other immune modulating medications);

          -  unwilling to discontinue vitamin or supplements, including probiotics, potentially
             affecting gut microbiota (vitamins/supplements and medications that possibly affect
             the gut microbiota should be discontinued for at least 2wks prior to stool
             collection);
