    <measure>Change From Baseline in UHDRS-TMS at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>UHDRS is a research tool developed by Huntington Disease (HD) Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes TMS and Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score. The UHDRS TMS assesses all the motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia, ocular pursuit, saccade initiation and velocity, dysarthria, tongue protrusion, finger tapping, hand pronation and supination, luria, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, tandem walking, and retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0 (normal motor function) to 4 (severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0 (normal motor function) to 124 (severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores indicate better motor function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Caudate Volume (Brain Atrophy) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Brain atrophy was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of caudate volume. Caudate volume atrophy is a sensitive biomarker in very early HD and correlates with disease progression. Brain atrophy in the caudate refers to the shrinkage in volume, so that a decrease in volume is a positive value, while an increase in volume is a negative value. Percent change in caudate volume at Week 52 was calculated as the change in caudate volume since the baseline visit, divided by the baseline caudate volume and multiplied by 100.</description>

Of 352 enrolled participants, 123 participants were randomized in 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 milligrams/day (mg/day), or matching placebo prior to 10 January 2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>As of 10 January 2016; following recommendation of Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), treatment of laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm was discontinued as a proactive safety measure. After 10 January 2016; additional eligible participants, who were enrolled, were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day, or matching placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale - Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS)</title>
          <description>The UHDRS TMS assesses all the motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia, ocular pursuit, saccade initiation and velocity, dysarthria, tongue protrusion, finger tapping, hand pronation and supination, luria, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, tandem walking, and retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0 (normal motor function) to 4 (severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0 (normal motor function) to 124 (severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores indicate better motor function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UHDRS-TMS at Week 52</title>
        <description>UHDRS is a research tool developed by Huntington Disease (HD) Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes TMS and Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score. The UHDRS TMS assesses all the motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia, ocular pursuit, saccade initiation and velocity, dysarthria, tongue protrusion, finger tapping, hand pronation and supination, luria, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, tandem walking, and retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0 (normal motor function) to 4 (severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0 (normal motor function) to 124 (severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores indicate better motor function.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Caudate Volume (Brain Atrophy) at Week 52</title>
        <description>Brain atrophy was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of caudate volume. Caudate volume atrophy is a sensitive biomarker in very early HD and correlates with disease progression. Brain atrophy in the caudate refers to the shrinkage in volume, so that a decrease in volume is a positive value, while an increase in volume is a negative value. Percent change in caudate volume at Week 52 was calculated as the change in caudate volume since the baseline visit, divided by the baseline caudate volume and multiplied by 100.</description>
