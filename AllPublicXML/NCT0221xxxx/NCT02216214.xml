    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants who were ≥ 65 years who had symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) were enrolled in 102 centers in 2 countries (US and Canada).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants entered into a 2-week placebo run-in period. During this time, they were asked to complete a 3-day training micturition diary and in the 3 days prior to being randomized (and after, prior to each visit). Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either mirabegron or placebo, stratified by age (&lt; 75 years, ≥ 75 years).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received placebo to match mirabegron at an initial dose of 25 mg and may have been increased to 50 mg of matching placebo after 4 weeks or 8 weeks based on individual participant efficacy, tolerability and investigator discretion. Once a participant had increased dose, they remained on that dose for the remainder of the study unless there were safety reasons that required discontinuation of study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to EOT in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)</title>
        <description>The PPBC is a validated, global assessment tool using a 6-point Likert scale that asks participants to rate their subjective impression of their current bladder condition. Participants assessed their bladder condition using this scale: 1. Does not cause me any problems at all; 2. Causes me some very minor problems; 3. Causes me some minor problems; 4. Causes me (some) moderate problems; 5. Causes me severe problems; 6. Causes me many severe problems. A higher score indicated a worse perception of bladder condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to EOT in Mean Number of Urgency Episodes (Grade 3 and/or 4) Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>Urgency was defined as a complaint of a sudden, compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer. An urgency episode was defined as any micturition or incontinence episode with a severity of grade 3 or 4, assessed by participants based on the PPIUS, where 0 = No urgency; 1 = Mild urgency; 2 = Moderate urgency, could delay voiding a short while; 3 = Severe urgency, could not delay voiding; 4 = Urge incontinence, leaked before arriving to the toilet. The mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 and/or 4) per 24 hours was calculated as the average number of times a participant recorded an urgency episode (grade 3 and/or 4) with or without incontinence per day during the 3-day micturition diary period.</description>

        <description>The VES-13 is a simple function-based tool for screening community-dwelling populations to identify older persons at risk for health deterioration. The VES-13 considers age, self-related health, limitation in physical function, and functional disabilities. The total possible score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating increased disability.</description>

        <description>The OAB-q is a self-reported questionnaire with 33 questions relating to symptom bother and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL portion consists of 25 HRQoL items comprising 4 HRQoL subscales (Coping, Concern, Sleep, and Social Interaction), each item was scored 1-6. The Coping score has 8 items, the Concern score has 7 items, the Sleep and Social score has 5 items each. Each subscale score was calculated by adding each score's items and transforming to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. A positive change from baseline indicated an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to EOT in University of Alabama, Birmingham - Life Space Assessment (UAB-LSA)</title>
        <description>The UAB-LSA measures mobility in terms of the spatial extent of a person's life. Life space is defined based upon the distance a person routinely travels to perform activities over this time frame. The UAB-LSA includes determining how far and how often the person leaves his or her place of residence and the degree of independence the person has. Each level of life space represents a distance further from the room where one sleeps: 0 - Mobility limited to the room where one sleeps; 1 - Mobility limited to within one's dwelling; 2 - Mobility limited to the space just proximal to one's personal living space (for instance, a porch, patio, or yard just outside the home or hallway outside of an apartment); 3 - Mobility limited to one's neighborhood; 4 - Mobility limited to one's town; 5 - Mobility outside one's town. The total scores ranges from 0-120, where a higher score indicates greater mobility.</description>

        <description>The OAB-q is a self-reported questionnaire with 33 questions relating to symptom bother and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL portion consists of 25 HRQoL items comprising 4 HRQoL subscales (Coping, Concern, Sleep, and Social Interaction), each item was scored 1-6. The Coping score has 8 items, the Concern score has 7 items, the Sleep and Social score has 5 items each. Each subscale score was calculated by adding each score's items and transforming to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Participants with ≥ 10-point improvement from baseline in OAB-q HRQL subscales were defined as participants with at least 10-point improvement from baseline in OAB-q Subscales at each visit.</description>

        <description>The PPBC is a validated, global assessment tool using a 6-point Likert scale that asks participants to rate their subjective impression of their current bladder condition. Participants assessed their bladder condition using this scale: 1. Does not cause me any problems at all; 2. Causes me some very minor problems; 3. Causes me some minor problems; 4. Causes me (some) moderate problems; 5. Causes me severe problems; 6. Causes me many severe problems. A higher score indicated a worse perception of bladder condition. Participants with ≥ 1-point improvement from baseline in PPBC were defined as participants with at least 1-point improvement from baseline in PPBC at each visit.</description>
