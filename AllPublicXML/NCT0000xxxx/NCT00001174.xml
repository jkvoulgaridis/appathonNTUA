  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks to identify genes that may affect a person's chances of developing bipolar
      disorder (BP) and related conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar affective disorder is a severe, heritable condition affecting about one percent of

      the population. The mode of inheritance is poorly understood and probably involves multiple
      loci of small to moderate effect. In this project, we use genetic mapping and sequencing
      methods to identify genetic markers and variations that contribute to the risk of bipolar
      disorder. Individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are studied, along with their
      relatives. Phenotypic information obtained from clinical interviews and family history is
      correlated with genotypic information obtained from genetic marker and sequencing methods.
      The goal is to identify genes involved in bipolar disorder and related conditions so that
      better methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention can be developed.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age &gt; 18 yr

        Able to provide informed consent

        Bipolar disorder or related conditions not attributable to substance abuse, neurological
        disease; or a 1st or 2nd degree relative of an enrolled participant. Related conditions are
        defined as those found more often among relatives of people with bipolar disorder or which
        have been shown to be genetically correlated with bipolar disorder through molecular
        genetic studies. These include major depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder, and
        attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

        Able to safely provide a blood or saliva sample

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Active alcohol or substance abuse.

        NIMH employees/staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the study per
        NIMH policy.
