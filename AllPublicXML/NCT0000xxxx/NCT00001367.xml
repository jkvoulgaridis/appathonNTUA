  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a screening and natural history protocol, which allows for evaluation of

      patients and families where neurological conditions are present for enrollment into other

      studies and will also be used to screen healthy volunteers to create a pool of potential
      future HV matches for HMCS protocols. Through diagnostic evaluations, data will be collected
      for research use in this study.
