  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to develop improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      techniques and hardware for studying brain function. MRI is a diagnostic tool that provides
      information about brain chemistry and physiology. This study will evaluate new MRI methods
      for monitoring blood flow to regions of the brain in response to simple tasks. The MRI
      machine used in this study is more powerful than those in most hospitals, permitting a higher
      visual resolution.

      Normal healthy volunteers over 18 years old may be eligible for this study. Candidates will
      be screened with a medical history and questionnaire, and a neurological examination. Study
      participants will have a yearly MRI scan. For this procedure, the subject lies on a stretcher
      that is moved into a donut-shaped machine with a strong magnetic field. A lightweight
      circular or rectangular coil a device that improves the quality of the images may be placed
      on the head. The scan time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours; most scans last between 45 and
      90 minutes. During the scan, the subject may perform simple tasks, such as listening to
      tapes, tapping a finger, moving a hand, watching a screen, or smelling a fragrance. More
      complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing
      buttons.

      Information from this study will be used to develop better imaging methods that will, in
      turn, permit a greater understanding of normal and abnormal brain behaviors.

      Objective

      The goal of this protocol is to improve spatial resolution and contrast in MRI studies of
      brain anatomy and function, by developing novel hardware, and image acquisition and
      reconstruction techniques. Specifically, by improving MRI image quality and manipulating MRI
      contrast, we aim to better characterize and quantify structural, chemical, and blood flow
      variations across the brain, and study their relationship with neuronal activity. For this
      purpose, we will develop and optimize novel MRI techniques on normal, healthy volunteers, and
      combine these with EEG and recording of other physiological signals.

      Study Population

      Any healthy, male or female volunteer 18 years of age and older; the subjects must be capable
      of understanding the procedures and requirements of this study and be willing to sign an
      informed consent document.

      Design

      This is a technical development study design to develop and evaluate new MR technology for
      performing MRI and functional MRI in the CNS with novel contrasts and with a high spatial
      resolution.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome of this study will be the ability to acquire anatomical and functional
      images of the human brain with high spatial resolution, i.e. 200-300 micron and 750-1000
      micron respectively. In addition, developed techniques will allow the robust measurement of
      specific tissue properties, including diffusion, structural anisotropy, iron and myelin
      content, perfusion, and metabolite concentrations. The relative merits of blood flow and
      blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, and their
      particular spatial and temporal signal characteristics will be established. It will be
      determined whether information valuable to interpret BOLD fMRI can be derived from EEG and
      other physiological signals

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be the ability to robustly acquire whole brain MRI sensitized to myelin, iron, diffusion, perfusion, and fiber orientation. Perfusion- and BOLD- based fMRI techniques will allow distinguishing between neuronal and systemic vascular signal contributions. In addition, we anticipate the ability to acquire (proton) spectroscopic data at 5mm resolution.</description>
