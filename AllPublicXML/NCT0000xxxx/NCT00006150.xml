  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hyper IgE Syndromes (HIES) are primary immunodeficiencies resulting in eczema and
      recurrent skin and lung infections. Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES; Job's
      syndrome) is caused by STAT3 mutations, and is a multi-system disorder with skeletal,
      vascular, and connective tissue manifestations. Understanding how STAT3 mutations cause these
      diverse clinical manifestations is critical to our complete understanding of bone metabolism,
      bronchiectasis, dental maturation, and atherosclerosis. Bi-allelic mutations in DOCK8 cause a
      combined immunodeficiency previously described as autosomal-recessive Hyper IgE syndrome.
      These individuals suffer from extensive viral infections as well as have a high incidence of
      malignancy and mortality. The pathogenesis of this disease and long-term natural history is
      being investigated. Therefore, we seek to enroll patients and families with a confirmed or
      suspected diagnosis of HIES syndrome for extensive phenotypic and genotypic study as well as
      disease management. Patients will be carefully examined by a multidisciplinary team and
      followed longitudinally. Through these studies we hope to better characterize the clinical
      presentation of STAT3-mutated HIES, DOCK8 deficiency and other causes of the hyper IgE
      phenotype, and to be able to identify further genetic etiologies, as well as understand the
      pathogenesis of HIES. We seek to enroll 300 patients and 300 relatives.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must be referred to the NIH with a diagnosis or a suspicion of Hyper IgE syndrome.
        Family members of probands and patients referred for other immune syndromes that
        demonstrate some of the characteristics of HIES may also be evaluated under this protocol.
        Male and female patients will be accepted. An inclusion age range will be constructed to
        accommodate at-risk infants born into affected families as well as to be able to examine
        the members of extended families. The extent of evaluation will be tailored to the patient
        s needs, age, and conditions. The cutaneous manifestations of Hyper IgE syndromes are often
        present at birth and need management from that time on.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant women are excluded only from any procedure or test that may endanger the pregnancy
        or the fetus due to the risk from radiographic studies, anesthesia, or certain biopsies. We
        have seen lung infections worsen and flares of skin disease during pregnancy and therefore
        believe that enrolling and following these patients during pregnancy is appropriate in
        order to follow the natural history of the disease.

        Coronary CTA will not be performed on any patient with contraindication to IV contrast
        media. This includes patients with 1) creatinine value of &gt;1.3 mg/dl, 2) history of
        multiple myeloma, 3) Use of metformin-containing products less than 24 hours prior to
        contrast media, and 4) history of significant allergic reaction to CT contrast agents
        despite the use of premedication.

        Subjects with a medical, psychiatric, or social condition which, in the opinion of the
        investigator, would place undue burden on the subject, NIH resources, or increase risk of
        participation, may be excluded.
