  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the treatment and natural history of acromegaly.
      We have a longstanding interest in acromegaly treatment, and a cohort that has been followed
      for 30 years, or more in some cases. We will continue to follow patients and recruit new
      patients for treatment and follow-up. Blood and pituitary tumor tissue (when available
      through clinical care) will be saved for future analyses related to acromegaly.
