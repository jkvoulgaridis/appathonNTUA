  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that lymph nodes are a major reservoir for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a major site of active virus replication in infected
      individuals. There is at least a 10 fold greater viral burden per given number of CD4+ T
      lymphocytes obtained from the lymph nodes versus the peripheral blood in the same infected
      individual. These data have been accumulated predominantly in individuals with progressive
      generalized lymphadenopathy (CDC Class A1 and A2). It is unclear at present whether this
      pattern holds true for all categories of HIV infected individuals. We have proposed that the
      seeding of lymph nodes by HIV early in the course of HIV infection and the persistent
      production of virus in lymph nodes throughout the course of infection are major factors in
      the pathogenesis of HIV in virtually all infected individuals. In addition, it is likely that
      the selective perturbations of various T cell subsets (i.e., V-B classes of CD4+T cells) that
      have been observed in peripheral blood are much more dramatic in the lymph node given the
      greater viral burden in the lymph node compared to the peripheral blood. In order to
      investigate this hypothesis, it is essential that we study simultaneously lymph nodes and
      peripheral blood from the same individuals and that we study different individuals at various
      stages of disease from early in the course of infection (CDC Class A) to advanced disease
      (CDC Class B and C). If, as we suspect, there is active virus replication in the lymph node
      early in the course of infection, even at a time when there is little virus burden or active
      replication in the peripheral blood, this would justify anti-retroviral therapy at the
      earliest possible time in the course of infection. In addition, in certain patients who are
      about to initiate treatment with an anti-retroviral agent such as zidovudine or didanosine
      through their private physician, it would be important to know whether treatment actually
      reduces the viral burden and virus replication in lymph nodes. The effect of therapy on viral
      burden and replication will be compared in the lymph node versus peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells and both of these parameters will be compared with the level of plasma viremia.

      We are studying the pathogenesis of HIV infection and other immune dysfunctions. Because of
      the lack of an adequate animal model it is generally necessary to utilize human peripheral
      blood and lymphoid tissues cells for studying aspects of either in vivo or in vitro HIV
      infection. A dichotomy exists between the amount of HIV that can be measured in peripheral
      blood compared to lymphoid tissue, as well as the types of immune cells that reside in each
      compartment. We wish to be able to continue to elucidate many pathogenic aspects of HIV
      infection and other immune dysfunctions using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
      intact tissue or cells obtained from two major lymphoid organs, lymph nodes and bone marrow.
