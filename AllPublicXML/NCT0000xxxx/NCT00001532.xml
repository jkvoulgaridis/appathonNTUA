  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the genetics involved in the development of lung disease
      by surveying genes involved in the process of breathing and examining the genes in lung cells
      of patients with lung disease.

      The study will focus on defining the distribution of abnormal genes responsible for processes
      directly involved in different diseases affecting the lungs of patients and healthy
      volunteers.

      Optional CT Sub-study

      The standard CT scan will be compared to the low dose radiation CT scan for the 150 subjects
      enrolled in the sub-study to assess the variation between the two techniques. Specifically,
      the quantitative computer aided detection of lung CT abnormalities from LAM can be compared
      to assess whether low radiation dose CT exams is an alternative to conventional CT to monitor
      disease

      status.

      This optional sub-study will be offered to up to 100 adult subjects with lung disease and up
      to 50 children age 9 and older with CF. Children will not be enrolled in the optional CT
      sub-study unless they have had a standard CT scan for medical purposes to use in comparison.
      One additional low dose radiation CT scan of the chest may be done as part of this sub-study
      when these subjects have their next annual CT scan.

      This study is designed to evaluate genetic mechanisms of lung disease by surveying
      polymorphic genes involved in respiratory function and examining gene expression in the lung
      cells of individuals with pulmonary disease (e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, history of infection,
      and genetic mutations consistent with lung pathology). Emphasis will be on defining the
      distribution of allelic variants of nitric oxide synthase, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genes in patients and in age- and
      sex-matched healthy individuals in a control population.

    <intervention_name>Toshibia Aquilion ONE CT</intervention_name>
    <description>The Toshiba Aquilion ONE CT system is currently being used for studies in both general CT radiology and CT cardiac imaging. One of the unique aspects of the Aquilion ONE CT system is its ability to acquire whole organ volume images in a single rotation by utilizing an x-ray detector that is configured as 320 detector rows with a 0.5 mm width, providing a z-axis coverage of 16 cm of anatomy. In line with the evolutionary changes to CT systems, the Aquilion ONE will be upgraded with new technology that will expand its capabilities. The changes being made to the Aquilion ONE will provide enhancements to image acquisition capabilities, reduce ionizing radiation dose, and improve subject access to the system. All of these features assist in enhancing the safety of the currently installed Aquilion ONE CT system.</description>

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion criteria for patients with AAT deficiency include: (1) Diagnosis of AAT with a
        confirmed phenotype considered in the high risk category; (2) Clinical phenotype consistent
        with potential genetic diseases and other genetic causes of lung diseases (3) symptoms
        consistent with pulmonary disease; (4) chest x-ray consistent with pulmonary disease; (5)
        pulmonary function tests consistent with pulmonary disease; (6) smokers, defined as
        individuals who are current smokers (1 pack per day for at least 2 years) and nonsmokers,
        defined as never-smokers or ex-smokers who have quit smoking three or more years ago;
