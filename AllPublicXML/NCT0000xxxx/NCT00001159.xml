  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be patients diagnosed with or suspected to have a thyroid
      function disorder. These conditions may include: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid
      hormone resistance, Graves' Dermopathy, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreting
      pituitary adenomas.

      The main purpose of this study is to further understand the natural history, clinical
      presentation, and genetics of thyroid function disorders. Many of the tests performed are in
      the context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid function
      disorders. In addition, blood and tissue samples may be taken for research and genetic
      studies.

      Patients with thyroid function abnormalities (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) are studied
      and

      treated in this protocol. A limited number of patients with a personal history of signs,
      symptoms or laboratory studies consistent with thyroid dysfunction or a strong family history
      of thyroid abnormalities are also enrolled. Patients undergo routine history and physical
      examination, standard endocrine blood and urine tests, a standard TRH test, thyroid nuclear
      medicine scan, thyroidal radioiodine (RAI) or technetium (99mTc) uptake measurements, as well
      as X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies or other
      standard diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated. Patients will be screened for entry
      into other research studies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects age greater than or equal to 18 years old.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of active, advanced (patient report of advancing plaque-like,
             elephantiasis or nodular form) Graves associated dermopathy with or without eye
