  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the genetics and pathophysiology of diseases presenting
      with intermittent fever, including familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome,
      and related diseases.

      The following individuals may be eligible for this study: 1) patients with known or suspected
      familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome or related disorders; 2) relatives of
      these patients; 3) healthy, normal volunteers 7 years of age or older.

      Patients will undergo a medical and family history, physical examination, blood and urine
      tests. Additional tests and procedures may include the following:

        1. X-rays

        2. Consultations with specialists

        3. DNA sample collection (blood or saliva sample) for genetic studies. These might include
           studies of specific genes, or more complete sequencing of the genome.

        4. Additional blood samples a maximum of 1 pint (450 ml) during a 6-week period for studies
           of white cell adhesion (stickiness)

        5. Leukapheresis for collecting larger amounts of white cells for study. For this
           procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood flows
           through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and
           the rest of the blood is returned to the body through another needle in the other arm.

      Patients may be followed approximately every 6 months to monitor symptoms, adjust medicine
      dosages, and undergo routine blood and urine tests. They will receive genetic counseling by
      the study team on the risk of having affected children and be advised of treatment options.

      Participating relatives will undergo a medical and family history, possibly with a review of
      medical records, physical examination, blood and urine tests. Additional procedures may
      include a 24-hour urine collection, X-rays, and consultations with medical specialists. A DNA
      sample (blood or saliva) will also be collected for genetic studies. Additional blood samples
      of no more than 550 mL during an 8-week period may be requested for studies of white cell
      adhesion (stickiness).

      Relatives who have familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, or hyper-IgD syndrome will receive
      the same follow-up and counseling as described for patients above.

      Normal volunteers and patients with gout will have a brief health interview and check of
      vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) and will provide a blood sample (up to 90 ml, or 6
      tablespoons). Additional blood samples of no more than 1 pint over a 6-week period may be
      requested in the future.

      This is an exploratory natural history protocol that enrolls patients with known or as yet
      undiagnosed disorders of inflammation. Blood, saliva, or buccal samples will be collected for
      genetic analysis, blood samples will be obtained for immunologic and other functional
      studies, a small number of subjects may undergo skin biopsy, leukapheresis, or bone marrow
      aspiration and biopsy, and some subjects will be provided standard medical care follow up,
      with retrospective analysis of the clinical data gathered during follow up. The primary
      objective is to discover the genetic basis of human disorders of inflammation. The secondary
      objective is to enumerate immunologic features and genotype-phenotype associations in
      specific autoinflammatory diseases. The tertiary objective is to describe the clinical
      features of poorly characterized or newly defined disorders of inflammation. This protocol
      provided clinical support for the identification of the gene mutated in familial
      Mediterranean fever (FMF), the discovery of the TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome
      (TRAPS), the identification of NLRP3 mutations in the neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory
      disease (NOMID), the discovery of the deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), and
      the proposal of the now widely accepted concept of autoinflammatory disease. During the last
      decade the protocol has provided the clinical foundation for the discovery of ten more
      monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, seven of which were previously unrecognized as distinct
      diseases. The protocol has also permitted numerous studies delineating the mechanisms of
      autoinflammation and its connections with the human innate immune system. The work catalyzed
      by this protocol has provided the conceptual basis for a number of targeted therapies. During
      the next decade the objective will be to utilize cutting edge genomic technologies to further
      advance discovery.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        There are three populations that will be included in this study: subjects with known or
        suspected autoinflammatory diseases, family members of subjects with known or suspected
        autoinflammatory diseases, and healthy controls. In order to be eligible to participate in
        this study as a subject with known or suspected autoinflammatory disease, an individual
        must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to participate in study procedures (which at the very least
             includes providing a mail-in sample for genetic analysis);

          2. Regardless of gender, at least one month of age;

          3. A medical history that, in the expert opinion of the study team, is consistent with
             the possibility of autoinflammatory disease; and

          4. Ability of the subject, parents (in the case of children), or Legally Authorized
             Representative to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study as a family member of a subject with
        known or suspected autoinflammatory disease, an individual must meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to participate in study procedures (which at the very least
             includes providing a mail-in sample for genetic analysis);

          2. Regardless of gender, at least one month of age;

          3. Relationship, either by blood or marriage, to an individual enrolled or about to be
             enrolled in the study with known or suspected autoinflammatory disease;

          4. Likelihood, in the expert opinion of the study team, that analysis of a sample from
             the individual would advance genetic or functional analysis of the affected relative s
             possible autoinflammatory condition; and

          5. Ability of the subject, parents (in the case of children), or Legally Authorized
             Representative to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study as a healthy volunteer, an individual
        must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to participate in study procedures for healthy volunteers;

          2. Regardless of gender, at least one year old, and not pregnant (by history of a missed
             menstrual period);

          3. Likelihood, in the expert opinion of the study team, that a sample from the individual
             would advance the functional analysis of an autoinflammatory condition under study;
             and

          4. Ability of the subject or parents (in the case of children) to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        For any of the three categories of subjects, an individual will be excluded from
        participation in this study if he or she has a medical condition that would, in the opinion
        of the investigators, confuse the interpretation of the study.
