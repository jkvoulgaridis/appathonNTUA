      This study was developed in order for the professional-staff at the Pulmonary-Critical Care
      Medical Branch (PCCMB) of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to maintain their

        Patients 8 years old and older with signs or symptoms of pulmonary disease of medical
        interest to the professional staff of CPB will be eligible for participation in this
        protocol. Only standard diagnostic procedures and conventional therapy will be performed.
        Patients will not be subjected to any research procedures. This protocol does not commit
        the NIH to medical or surgical treatment of protocol participants after discharge. Patients
        will be discharged to the referring physician.

        Consenting to pregnancy testing in minors of childbearing age:

        We will inform the minor during the assent process that for safety, we need to do a
        pregnancy test. She will also be told that if it is positive, we will counsel her and help
        her tell her parents. If the minor does not want to proceed she will be advised not to sign
        assent and her enrollment on this training protocol will end.
