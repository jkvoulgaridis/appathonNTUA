  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An important mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to develop and carry out
      research studies designed to improve understanding of disease processes and treatments.

      Clinical research continues to become more focused on specific diseases and the signs and
      symptoms of diseases in specific groups of people and patients.

      This study is designed to permit inpatient evaluation and care of patients with heart disease
      who do not qualify to participate in research studies being conducted by the Cardiology
      Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). These patients are valuable
      to the Cardiology Branch of the NHLBI because they help to improve training and experience of
      its researchers.

      An important mission of the NIH is to the conduct of research that elucidates biological
      mechanisms, pathogenesis and treatment of diseases. Clinical research has evolved into an
      increasingly narrow focus on specific diseases and disease presentations in select subgroups
      of patients. It is desirable and consistent with Clinical Center policy, for clinical
      investigators to maintain exposure to a more broad spectrum of disease and disease
      presentations than mandated by the clinical research protocols in order to preserve clinical
      skills of physician and nursing staff, ensure adequate training of clinical research fellows,
      and stimulate ideas for future clinical research. This protocol permits evaluation and
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who do not fulfill eligibility criteria
      for participation in existing clinical research protocols, but who are of medical interest
      for the purpose of training professional staff.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with signs or symptoms or risk of cardiovascular disease may participate in this
        training protocol. The following is a representative list of the types of patient
        presentations and potential diagnoses eligible for this protocol:

        Coronary artery disease with effort or rest angina or inducible myocardial ischemia as
        determined by noninvasive testing.

        Valvular heart disease.

        Cardiomyopathies, including restrictive, congestive, and hypertrophic phenotypes.

        Peripheral-artery disease of upper or lower extremities, with intermittent pain with
        activity (e.g. claudication) or limb-threatening ischemia.

        Renovascular disease with uncontrolled hypertension, intermittent pulmonary edema, or
        evidence of ischemic nephropathy.

        Congenital heart disease, with communications between chambers or major vessels

        Heart surgery patients treated at the Clinical Center prior to closure of the Heart Surgery
        Branch in 1990

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnancy, for those patients who require testing or treatment requiring dobutamine,
        gadolinium or contrast media or radiation exposure.

        Inability of patient, parent or legal guardian to provide informed consent.
