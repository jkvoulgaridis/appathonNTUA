  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by bacteria. This bacteria produces
      several toxins one of which is botulinum toxin A. This toxin causes the symptoms of food
      poisoning. Small amounts of botulinum toxin A have been used to treat speech disorders such
      as stuttering and problems with the muscles of the eyes.

      The study examines the effectiveness of botulinum toxin as treatment for a variety of
      movement disorders. The goals of the study are to refine the technique of treatment to
      provide the best results, to improve the understanding of how botulinum toxin works on
      movement disorders, and find other conditions that may be treatable with botulinum toxin.

      In addition, researchers also plan to study the possible use of botulinum toxin F alone and
      in combination with botulinum toxin A in patients who do not respond to botulinum A toxin
      treatment.&lt;TAB&gt;

      The efficacy of botulinum toxin (BTX) has now been demonstrated for a variety of diseases
      associated with involuntary muscles spasms or movement. The application of botulinum toxin
      therapy to movement disorders requires treatment tailored to the individual patient and
      specific techniques of injection. This protocol 1) allows us to follow the natural history of
      subjects with movement disorders who receive standard botox injections for treatment of
      movement disorders and 2) allows us to provide botulinum toxin injections for patients
      participating in other studies on the physiology of sensorimotor systems and on the
      physiological effects of botulinum toxin.
