      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unlike X-rays and CT-scans does not use radiation to create
      a picture. MRI use as the name implies, magnetism to create pictures with excellent
      anatomical resolution. Functional MRIs are diagnostic tests that allow doctors to not only
      view anatomy, but physiology and function. It is for these reasons that MRIs are excellent
      methods for studying the brain.

      In this study, researchers will use MRI to assess brain anatomy and function in X and Y
      chromosome variation, healthy volunteers, and patients with a variety of childhood onset
      psychiatric disorders. The disorders include attention deficit disorder, autism, congenital
      adrenal hyperplasia, childhood-onset schizophrenia, dyslexia, obsessive compulsive disorder,
      Sydenham's chorea, and Tourette's syndrome.

      Results of the MRIs showing the anatomy of the brain and brain function will be compared
      across age, sex (gender), and diagnostic groups. Correlations between brain and behavioral
      measures will be examined for normal and clinical populations....

      Objective: Our work is driven by the core hypotheses that many of the most severe
      neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood onset are associated with deviations from thepath of
      normal brain development, the neuroanatomical substrates of which can be detected by magnetic
      resonance imaging. Consequently, the long-term goals of the protocol are to: (1) map
      neuroanatomic and neurophysiological trajectories of brain development in health and illness;
      and (2) discern influences on those trajectories from demographic (e.g. age and sex),
      cognitive/behavioral (e.g. IQ), and clinical (e.g. presence/absence of a known neurogenetic
      disorders) factors. Data from the project have resulted in seminal papers on
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia, and typical
      pediatric brain development. The biological bases of male / female differences are explored
      via studies of subjects with anomalous sex chromosome numbers (e.g. XO, XXX, XYY, XXYY,
      XXXXY).

      Study population: Our studies include data from typically developing youth, and individuals
      with a range of psychiatric presentations from behaviorally-defined (e.g. Childhood-Onset
      Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder) as well as geneticallydefined (e.g. Sex Chromosome
      Aneuploidy) groups. Participants span a wide age range (from 3 years of age upwards).

      Design: The study design is to have participants come to the NIH for brain imaging,
      psychological/psychiatric testing, and genetic characterization. Assessment visits each take
      approximately 2 days to complete. Participants are invited to return for longitudinal
      assessments (at approximately 2-year intervals).

      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure used to date have derived from T1-weighted
      structural neuroimaging data which enable us to characterize how a range of anatomical brain
      phenotypes vary as a function of age, sex, behavioral/cognitive traits, diagnostic status and
      genotype. Analyses also consider how these factors relate to other outcomes of interest
      including; gene expression levels, functional metrics from in vivo neuroimaging, and
      questionnaire/interview-based assessment of clinical features.

                  Multi-Dimensionally Impaired, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Childhood Onset
                  Schizophrenia, Turner Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, High

                  Syndrome

               -  ADHD

               -  Down s Syndrome

          -  Newly enrolled adults and minors once they become adults over age 18 who cannot give
             consent due to limited capacity may have a surrogate, i.e., a legally responsible
             representative (LAR), sign the consent. LARs include DPA holders, court-appointed
             legal guardians, or parents or siblings over 18 years of age. We will consult with the
             Human Subjects Protection Unit as necessary.

        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ADHD PARTICIPANTS:

        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defined
        ADHD. The DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD will be based on the Parent Diagnostic Interview for
        Children and Adolescents.

        -Conners Teacher Hyperactivity rating greater than 2 SD above age- and sex-specific means.

        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DOWN SYNDROME PARTICIPANTS:

          -  Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome.

          -  Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. This upper age limit at study entry
             is being implemented for the Down syndrome group for several reasons. First, much of
             the research using magnetic resonance imaging with this population is focused on
             (older) adult populations and in particular the transition to early onset Alzheimer s
             disease. Because most (if not all) individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some
             brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer s disease by age 30 (e.g., plaques and
             tangles; Mann &amp; Esiri, 1989), we would like to enroll participants who are 30 years of
             age and under. Second, studying children and young adults with Down syndrome fills a
             significant gap in the literature, as there are very few structural magnetic resonance
             imaging studies of children and young adults with Down syndrome reported in the
             literature to date, and the majority of these studies are characterized by small
             samples of convenience (i.e., clinic populations). Thus, there is still a need to
             describe the developmental course of this disorder from early childhood to young
             adulthood. Such developmental research may help shed light on the causes of
             intellectual disability in Down syndrome and also identify individuals with the
             syndrome who are most at risk for experiencing the cognitive decline that is reported
             in the literature for some individuals after the age of 30 (Oliver et al., 1998).

        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS:

          -  Meeting DSM-IV criteria for one of the pervasive developmental disorders (i.e.,
             autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not
             otherwise specified).

          -  Having a minimum IQ of 70.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        NIMH staff and their immediate family are excluded from participation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROLS:

          -  Presence of severe psychiatric disorder (as diagnosed prior to subject study
             enrollment) in the subject, sibling, or other first-degree relative. For these
             purposes, exclusionary severe psychiatric disorder include schizophrenia and bipolar
             affective disorder

          -  Presence or history of medical conditions known to affect cerebral anatomy.

          -  Dental braces.

             undergo pregnancy testing.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL PATIENT POPULATIONS:

          -  Dental braces.

          -  Contraindications for MRI scanning according to the NMR Center MRI Safety Screening
             Questionnaire and guidelines.

          -  For females who have reached menarche: Pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to
             undergo pregnancy testing.

          -  Evidence of another medical condition or traumatic event known to affect cerebral

          -  A known genetic disorder (other than the condition under investigation) that would be
             expected to significantly impact findings from cognitive testing and/or neuroimaging.

        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ADHD PARTICIPANTS:

          -  A full-scale IQ of less than 80.

          -  Birth before 34 weeks of gestation.
