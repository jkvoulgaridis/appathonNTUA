      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who
      have recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of fenretinide as assessed by 6-month progression- free
      survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. II. Determine the rate of measurable
      clinical response, time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this
      drug. III. Determine the unexpected toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type
      (glioblastoma multiforme (closed to accrual as of 05/31/2001) and gliosarcoma (closed to
      accrual as of 05/31/2001) vs anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and mixed
      malignant glioma). Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily during weeks 1 and 4.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then before each course of
      chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41-85 patients (21-45 with anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma, and mixed malignant glioma and 20-40 with glioblastoma multiforme (closed
      to accrual as of 05/31/2001) and gliosarcoma (closed to accrual as of 05/31/2001)) will be
      accrued for this study.

        as of 05/31/2001) Anaplastic astrocytoma Anaplastic oligodendroglioma Mixed malignant
        gliomas Original histological diagnosis of low-grade glioma allowed if a subsequent
        histological diagnosis of malignant glioma is confirmed Prior treatment for no more than 2
        prior relapses allowed Disease progression documented by at least 2 pre-study brain scans
        Recent prior tumor resection of recurrent or progressive tumor allowed if recovered from
        the effects of prior surgery
