      This study will investigate inflammatory diseases and disorders. Inflammation is the body s
      immune response to many things, including infections and other acute or chronic irritants. It
      may also be a sign of abnormal immune function. This study will allow evaluation and
      long-term follow-up of such disorders to:

        -  Establish and maintain a group of patients that may be eligible for other NIAID
           protocols.

        -  Provide clinical training and experience for NIAID fellows.

        -  Provide a mechanism for NIAID staff to maintain their clinical skills.

        -  Serve as a starting point for new investigations of syndromes not currently under study.

      Patients between 1 and 80 years of age with acute or chronic inflammation, including but not
      limited to viral, fungal or bacterial infections, or abnormal immune responses may be
      eligible for this study. Immediate family members of patients may also be enrolled for
      preliminary examination to see if they are affected in any way that may warrant further
      investigation.

      All patients and family members will have a history, physical examination and laboratory
      tests. Depending on the results, family members may require additional tests. Patients will
      have additional diagnostic tests indicated for their specific disease, according to accepted
      medical standards. These may include routine blood and urine tests, X-rays or other imaging
      studies, body fluid or tissue cultures, skin tests for allergic or immune responses, and
      others as needed.

      Treatments will include only medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      according to accepted dose schedules and delivery methods.

      Patients may be requested to donate extra blood for research studies. No more than 450 cc (30
      tablespoons) will be drawn from adults within a 6-week period, and no more that 7 cc (1/2
      tablespoon) from children under 18 years of age in the same time period.

    <textblock>
      Inflammatory disorders, including but not limited to those caused by viral, bacterial,
      fungal, and parasitic infections, and those associated with aberrant immunologic responses
      are exceedingly common acute and chronic disorders affecting humans. The pathogenesis of
      these various disorders are being investigated under a number of NIAID clinical research
      protocols. This protocol is an evaluation and long-term follow protocol of such disorders for
      the purposes of maintaining a group of patients on which LCID investigators draw for our
      other various protocols. The patients admitted under this protocol also provide training and
      experience for members of the NIAID infectious diseases and allergy and immunology fellowship
      training programs as well as to provide a mechanism for the members of the Laboratory of
      Clinical Infectious Diseases to maintain their clinical skills. It is anticipated that the
      patients will receive a degree of clinical evaluation, care and monitoring more extensive
      than that generally available and that specimens collected from them can sometimes be used
      for laboratory studies related to inflammatory conditions. Also, this protocol may serve as a
      start point to studies of syndromes or diseases not being addressed by specific protocols,
      and therefore, can be used to evaluate family members of patients with inflammatory
      conditions when appropriate in order to try to understand further the disease before
      embarking in a specific protocol.
