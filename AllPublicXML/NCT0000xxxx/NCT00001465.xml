  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease typically affecting
      women of childbearing age. Currently, there is no effective therapy for the disease and the
      prognosis is poor.

      This study is designed to determine the disease processes involved at the level of cells and
      molecules, in order to develop more effective therapy.

      Researchers intend to identify the proteins and genes that contribute to the process of lung
      destruction in affected individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis develop severe destructive lung disease.
      Most of them are females of childbearing age. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy
      and the prognosis is variable. This study is designed to (a) define the clinical course of
      the disease and (b) elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease at the cellular and molecular
      levels, in order to develop more effective therapy. To accomplish this, we intend to identify
      the proteins and genes that contribute to the process of lung destruction in affected
      individuals.

    <intervention_name>Toshibia Aquilion One CT</intervention_name>
    <description>The Toshiba Aquilion ONE CT system is currently being used for studies in both general CT radiology and CT cardiac imaging. One of the unique aspects of the Aquilion ONE CT system is its ability to acquire whole organ volume images in a single rotation by utilizing an x-ray detector that is configured as 320 detector rows with a 0.5 mm width, providing a z-axis coverage of 16 cm of anatomy. In line with the evolutionary changes to CT systems, the Aquilion ONE will be upgraded with new technology that will expand its capabilities. The changes being made to the Aquilion ONE will provide enhancements to image acquisition capabilities, reduce ionizing radiation dose, and improve subject access to the system. All of these features assist in enhancing the safety of the currently installed Aquilion ONE CT system.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        General admission criteria for patients include one or both of the following:

        Findings on lung biopsy diagnostic of LAM;

        Findings on chest x-ray and/or chest computed axial tomography consistent with LAM.

        Patients with TSC and pulmonary LAM will be included in the study.

        Normal non-smokers in the control group are defined as individuals who have not smoked for
        greater than or equal to 1 year and have no systemic or pulmonary disease.

        Normal smokers defined as individuals with no systemic or pulmonary disease, who have
        smoked for greater than or equal to 1 year and have normal chest x-ray and normal pulmonary
        function tests may be included if needed as controls for a similar population of patients
        with LAM.

        Pregnant and or nursing women can be included in accordance with Federal Regulations at
        Subpart B of 45 CFR 46 Subjects who are pregnant and or nursing will be excluded from
        procedures during their pregnancy that are greater than minimal risk, until they are no
        longer pregnant and/or nursing. Procedures that will not be completed while the subject is
        pregnant and/or nursing including: PFTs, Six Minute Walk Test, thoracentesis, bronchoscopy,
        and measurements with imaging modalities requiring contrast or with radiation exposure such
        as Chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI, bone densitometry (DEXA). Allowing subjects to be included in
        the study may glean important information about individuals with uncommon pulmonary disease
        during and post pregnancy.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion criteria for patients include:

        Age less than 16.

        Advanced stage of a pulmonary or a systemic illness in which the risk of the study is
        judged to be significant even in the absence of a clear contraindication to the procedures.

        Exclusion criteria for patients for the formal exercise study and the stress echocardiogram
        include patients on continuous oxygen. Patients may perform an exercise test that will
        assess the patient's exercise capacity with activities of daily living.
