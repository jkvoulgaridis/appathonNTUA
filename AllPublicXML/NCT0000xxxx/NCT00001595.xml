  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland in childhood; some of these tumors
      (eg craniopharyngioma) are included among the most common central nervous system tumors in
      childhood. The gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely not known;
      their possible association with other developmental defects or inheritance pattern(s) has not
      been investigated. The present study serves as a (i) screening/training, and, (ii) a research
      protocol.

      As a screening and training study, this protocol allows our Institute to admit children with
      tumors of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit to the pediatric endocrine clinics and wards of the
      NIH Clinical Center for the purposes of

      (i)&lt;TAB&gt;training our fellows and students in the identification of genetic defects associated
      with pituitary tumor formation, and

      (ii)&lt;TAB&gt;teaching our fellows and students the recognition, management and complications of
      pituitary tumors

      As a research study, this protocol aims at

      (i)&lt;TAB&gt;developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of pituitary tumors;
      as an example, two new studies have emerged within the context of this protocol: (a)
      investigation of a new research magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tool and its usefulness in
      the identification of pituitary tumors, and (b) investigation of the psychological effects of
      cortisol secretion in pediatric patients with Cushing disease. Continuation of this protocol
      will eventually lead to new, separate protocols that will address all aspects of diagnosis of
      pituitary tumors and their therapy in childhood.

      (ii)&lt;TAB&gt;Identifying the genetic components of pituitary oncogenesis; those will be
      investigated by (a) studying the inheritance pattern of pituitary tumors in childhood and
      their possible association with other conditions in the families of the patients, and (ii)
      collecting tumor tissues and examining their molecular genetics. As with the clinical
      studies, the present protocol may help generate ideas for future studies on the treatment and
      clinical follow up of pediatric patients with tumors of the pituitary gland and, thus, lead
      to the development of better therapeutic regimens for these neoplasms.

      There are a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland and hypothalamus; the gene(s)
      involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely not known; their possible
      association with other developmental defects or inheritance pattern(s) has not been
      investigated. The present study serves as a (i) screening, and, (ii) an observational
      research protocol.

      As a screening study, this protocol allows our Institute to admit patients with tumors of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary unit to the clinics and wards of the NIH Clinical Center for the
      purposes of determining eligibility for CC protocols.

      As an observational research study, this protocol aims at:

      Developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of pituitary tumors; as an
      example, a new study had emerged within the context of this protocol: investigation of the
      psychological effects of cortisol secretion in pediatric (only) patients with Cushing
      disease, and (c) to study (longitudinally) whether CS in pediatric patients is also
      associated with a hypercoagulable state. Continuation of this protocol will eventually lead
      to new, separate protocols that will address all aspects of diagnosis of pituitary tumors and
      their therapy in childhood.

      Identifying the genetic components of pituitary oncogenesis; those will be investigated by
      (a) studying the inheritance pattern of pituitary tumors in childhood and their possible
      association with other conditions in the families of the patients, collecting tumor tissues
      and examining their molecular genetics, and using whole exome/genome sequencing (WE/GS) and
      related techniques in identifying genetic predisposition or causative factors.

      As with clinical studies, the present protocol may help generate ideas for future studies on
      the treatment and clinical follow up of patients with tumors of the pituitary gland and,
      thus, lead to the development of better therapeutic regimens for these neoplasms
