  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four rare genetic diseases, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), the XP/CS
      complex and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) have defective DNA excision repair although only XP has
      increased cancer susceptibility. We plan to perform careful clinical examination of selected
      patients with XP, XP/CS, CS, or TTD and follow their clinical course. We will obtain tissue
      (skin, blood, hair, buccal swabs) for laboratory examination of DNA repair and for genetic
      analysis. We hope to be able to correlate these laboratory abnormalities with the clinical
      features to better understand the mechanism of cancer prevention by DNA repair. Patients will
      be offered counseling and education for cancer control.

        Patients will be sought by contacting professional organizations (such as the American
        Academy of Dermatology-XP Task Force), lay support groups (such as the XP Society and the
        Share and Care CS Support Network) or by direct referral.@@@Healthy volunteers or NIH staff
        will be recruited through the Program for Healthy Volunteers (CRVP@mail.cc.nih.gov),
        through the Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison Office (prpl@mail.cc.nih.gov), or as a
        self-referral through the clinicaltrials.gov web site (http://clinicaltrials.gov). Healthy
        volunteers may also be approached by a member of the LCBG, NCI regarding interest in
        participating on this protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  On referral, subjects will be considered for inclusion in the study:

        If they have clinical documentation of typical features of XP, XP/CS, CS or TTD, XP/TTD or
        other overlap syndromes or

        If they have laboratory documentation of defective DNA repair or

        If they have some suggestive clinical features and are willing to participate in the study
        or

        if they are first degree relatives or other family members of patients with XP, XP/CS, CS,
        TTD, XP/TTD or other overlap syndromes

        if they are healthy volunteers of age 1 year and above (including NIH employees) willing to
        donate blood, skin, buccal cells, or hair. Healthy volunteer children will not have skin
        biopsies performed if they are age 12 years or younger.

        -Patients or legally authorized representatives must provide informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
