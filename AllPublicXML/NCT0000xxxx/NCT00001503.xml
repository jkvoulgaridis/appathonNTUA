    <textblock>
      This protocol is to provide follow-up medical/surgical visits for DCS patients who are long
      term survivors and may not currently be a participant entered on an active research protocol.
      No investigational treatments or standard treatments will be administered on this protocol.

      Background:

        -  Patients enrolled on CCR clinical protocols may require long term follow-up to assess
           outcome (e.g., survival) or the effects of prior therapy.

        -  Keeping the primary treatment protocols open after accrual is complete in order to
           follow patients for long term outcome is an administrative burden on investigators and
           the IRB.

      Objectives:

      -To provide follow-up for patients who are long term survivors previously enrolled Center for
      Cancer Research (CCR) trial but who may not currently be enrolled on a research protocol.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients who were previously enrolled on a CCR protocol and who are not eligible for an
      active NCI intramural primary research protocol.

      Design:

        -  The medical procedures/tests will be based on the patient's diagnosis, treatment and
           supporting clinical information. This is a follow-up study in which only standard tests
           and procedures are to be performed.

        -  Clinical information that is relevant to the patients prior protocols will be collected
           for research purposes.

        -  Procedures that entail more than minimal risk to the patient should not be performed for
           research purposes on this protocol.
