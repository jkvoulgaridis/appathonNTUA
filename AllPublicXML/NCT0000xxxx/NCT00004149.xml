      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with metastatic stage IVA or IVB
           hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Assess, in a preliminary manner, the effect of this drug on pain control in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the potential value of serial quantitative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and
           prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) mRNA determinations in RNA from peripheral
           blood mononuclear cells as surrogate markers of disease response in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the feasibility of using pretreatment bone marrow evaluation of PSA and PMSA mRNA
           levels and pi class glutathione S-transferase expression (i.e., eliminate glutathione
           levels) as potential correlates of disease response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12 for one
      course. Treatment continues as biweekly infusions for at least 14 additional weeks in the
      absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or excessive increase in serum
      prostate-specific antigen.

      Pain is assessed at baseline and then before each biweekly treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24
      months.
