  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate mood and behavior changes in the time period
      surrounding and including menopause. This is an observational study; volunteers who
      participate will not receive any new or experimental therapies.

      Controversy exists regarding the relationship between estrogen and progesterone (gonadal
      steroid) changes and midlife-onset depression. This study will examine the role of gonadal
      steroids in perimenopausal mood and behavioral disorders.

      Perimenopausal women with depression symptoms and a control group of healthy perimenopausal
      volunteers will be compared to identify correlates of the occurrence of depression.
      Participants with depressive symptoms may also participate in companion studies that will
      test the antidepressant efficacy of phytoestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators
      (SERMS).

      A group of younger pre-perimenopausal women with normal menstrual cycle functioning will be
      followed through menopause in an effort to confirm the association of depression onset with
      changes in reproductive endocrine functioning.

      Controversy exists regarding the relevance of changes in gonadal steroids for midlife onset
      depressions. The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful screening of patients
      and healthy volunteers for participation in research protocols that examine the role of
      gonadal steroids in depressions occurring during the perimenopause and for the collection of
      natural history data. Women in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which may include: a
      psychiatric diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical history; a physical exam; blood
      and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request for medical records. The data collected may
      also be linked with data from other perimenopausal depression protocols (e.g., DNA,
      psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc.) for the purposes of better understanding the
      diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of women with depression during the
      perimenopause. Upon conclusion of the screening process, participants will either be offered
      entry into a research protocol and will sign the appropriate informed consent, or will be
      considered not appropriate for participation in research and will be referred back into the
      community. The second purpose of this protocol is to permit the identification of
      premenopausal women who are followed longitudinally through the menopause transition in an
      effort to confirm the association of depression onset with change in reproductive endocrine
      function. This protocol, then, serves as a screening and evaluation protocol to recruit
      subjects who are characterized with standard measures in this protocol and then offered
      participation in related studies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Perimenopausal Subjects:

               -  History within the last one year of at least one month with perimenopause-related
                  mood or behavioral disturbances of at least moderate severity - that is,
                  disturbances that are distinct in appearance and associated with a notable degree
                  of functional impairment;

               -  Age 40-65;

               -  History of the onset of menstrual irregularity during the past six months but not
                  greater than one year of amenorrhea (i.e., not postmenopausal);

               -  Biological evidence of a deterioration of normal ovarian activity, specifically,
                  plasma FSH levels persistently elevated (&gt; 14IU/L) (as recommended by the Stages
                  of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria (106)) drawn at two week intervals over a
                  period of eight weeks;

               -  No prior estrogen replacement therapy for treatment of perimenopausal physical or
                  emotional symptoms within the last six months; and

               -  In good medical health;

               -  Subjects must be competent to comprehend the purpose of the screening process and
                  to provide written informed consent and be willing to participate in NIMH IRB
                  approved research protocols.

          -  A control group of age-matched perimenopausal women who meet patient selection
             criteria with the exception of the presence of mood or behavioral disorders will also
             be sought.

          -  Premenopausal women will be women who meet the following inclusion criteria for the
             longitudinal study participants:

               -  Regular menstrual cycle function (21-34 days);

               -  Absence of current mood or behavioral disturbance as determined by a structured
                  diagnostic interview;

             be withheld from participants who need or want them;

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse or dependence (excluding nicotine) of sufficient
             magnitude to require independent, concurrent treatment intervention (e.g., antabuse or
             opiate treatment, but not including self-help groups);

          -  Pregnant or lactating women;

          -  Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent.

          -  NIMH employees, staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the
