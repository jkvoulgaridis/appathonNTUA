  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an inherited disease which results in decreased
      pigmentation (oculocutaneous albinism), bleeding problems due to a platelet abnormality
      (platelet storage pool defect), and storage of an abnormal fat-protein compound (lysosomal
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin).

      The disease can cause poor functioning of the lungs, intestine, kidneys, or heart. The major
      complication of the disease is pulmonary fibrosis and typically causes death in patients ages
      40 - 50 years old. The disorder is common in Puerto Rico, where many of the clinical research
      studies on the disease have been conducted. Neither the full extent of the disease nor the
      basic cause of the disease is known. There is no known treatment for HPS.

      The purpose of this study is to perform research into the medical complications of HPS and
      begin to understand what causes these complications. Researchers will clinically evaluate
      patients with HPS of all ethnic backgrounds. They will obtain cells, blood components
      (plasma), and urine for future studies. Genetic tests (mutation analysis) to detect
      HPS-causing genes will also be conducted.&lt;TAB&gt;

    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease consisting of
      oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool defect and, in some patients, lysosomal
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. Other manifestations include pulmonary fibrosis (often
      fatal in the fourth or fifth decade), chronic granulomatous colitis and, rarely, renal
      involvement or cardiomyopathy. There exist 10 different genes known to cause HPS, but only
      HPS-2 and HPS-10 have a basic defect whose mechanism is known, i.e., defective subunits of a
      coat protein, adaptor complex-3, responsible for intracellular vesicle formation. HPS-1 is a
      severe genetic type common in northwest Puerto Rico, and HPS-3 is a milder one seen in
      central Puerto Rico. HPS-4 resembles HPS-1 in severity; HPS-5 and HPS-6 resemble HPS-3 in
      severity. HPS-7, HPS-8, and HPS-9 are extremely rare and have not been fully characterized.
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate individuals with HPS, perform mutation analysis
      for known HPS-causing genes, search for variants in other genes responsible for HPS, and
      obtain specimens to analyze basic mechanisms of HPS.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with HPS age 1-80 years are eligible to enroll in this protocol.

        The diagnosis of HPS is based upon a paucity or deficiency of platelet dense bodies on
        whole mount electron microscopy or the identification of pathogenic variants in HPS genes
        by genetic testing. Some subjects who have not been diagnosed with HPS may be admitted to
        the protocol based upon the presence of albinism and a platelet storage pool deficiency.

        Most female subjects who participate in the Obstetrics/Gynecology Questionnaire will be
        enrolled in the protocol.

        Subjects with HPS or family members who are their caregivers participating in the HPS
        Symptom Questionnaire will be at least 18 years of age. These subjects will enroll in the
        protocol and will provide written consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Infants under age one year are excluded because there is generally no urgency for a very
        early diagnosis and care is more readily provided to older infants at the Clinical Center.

        Pregnant women and adults who are unable to provide consent are excluded.
