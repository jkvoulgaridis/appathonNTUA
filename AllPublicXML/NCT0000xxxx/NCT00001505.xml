      Background:

      -This protocol is concerned with the acquisition of blood, skin, or mucosal samples from
      healthy volunteers or patients with selected skin diseases to support the basic science and
      clinical research activities of the Dermatology Branch and other intramural Laboratories and
      Branches at the NIH Clinical Research Center.

      Objectives:

      (Primary)

      -To allow collection of blood, skin, or mucosal samples from healthy volunteers or patients
      with selected skin or systemic diseases as needed to support the research activities of our
      Branch and other Laboratories and Branches.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy individuals (including employees and other patients) and patients with selected
           skin or other diseases, including individuals of both genders and all racial/ethnic
           groups.

        -  Patient volunteers must be willing to undergo blood drawing and/or skin/mucosal
           biopsies.

      Design:

      -This is dependent upon the particular investigation for which these samples are needed.
