  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure conducted by placing a
      small fiberoptic scope into the lung of a patient, and injecting sterile water (saline) into
      the lung and removing the fluid. The sterile solution removed contains secretions, cells, and
      protein from the lower respiratory tract. This sample can be analyzed to provide more
      information about possible disease processes going on in the lungs.

      This protocol will be used to perform BAL, bronchial brushing, and bronchial wall biopsy in
      normal volunteers and patients with pulmonary disease. The samples collected during the study
      will be used to examine biochemical processes in the lung that may contribute to lung disease

      This protocol proposes to perform bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushing and bronchial
      wall biopsy in research volunteers and in patients with pulmonary disease to evaluate the
      cellular components of normal and diseased lungs. This research study will help to improve
      our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in the lung during progression of pulmonary
      disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients and research volunteers will be accepted for bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar
        lavage only if their heath status will not be compromised by the procedure. Examples of
        disease that may be studied under this protocol include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency;
        lymphangioleiomyomatosis and the cystic lung disease; pulmonary fibrosis; and sarcoidosis.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients or research volunteers with abnormalities that contraindicate, or increase the
        risk of, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, including a history of allergy
        to atropine, lidocaine, or other topical anesthetics or premedications; FEV(1) less than
        0.8 liters; PaO(2), on supplemental 02, of less than 70 mmHg or PaCO(2) greater than 45
        mmHg; presence of uncorrected clotting disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, significant
        cardiac disease, renal or liver failure; metastatic disease; hematologic disorders such as
        severe anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 7 g/ml), granulocytopenia, or platelet
        disorders.

        Patients or research volunteers with a positive serum test for human immunodeficiency virus
        or hepatitis B or C. The rationale for excluding participation on the basis of HIV
        seropositivity is because of the known effects of HIV on the lungs.

        Patients or research volunteers who are pregnant or lactating.

        Patients or research volunteers incapable of giving informed consent.
