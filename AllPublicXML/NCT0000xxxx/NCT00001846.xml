      This protocol is designed to provide a mechanism for the Department of Transfusion Medicine,
      Clinical Center to collect and process blood components from paid, healthy volunteer donors
      for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and FDA researchers for in vitro laboratory
      use. Donors meeting research donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood and
      blood components by standard phlebotomy and apheresis techniques. The investigational nature
      of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the risks and discomforts of the
      donation process will be carefully explained to the donors, and a signed informed consent
      document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule
      based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. NIH and FDA investigators requesting
      blood components for research use will be required to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo
      of request, briefly describing the nature of the research, and providing assurance that
      samples provided through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo
      research. This protocol also provides a detailed schema for careful and frequent laboratory
      safety monitoring of repeat research apheresis donors.

      Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and the
      DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code that links
      the product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the blood
      and components collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol, and
      is not possible to describe, since it involves basic investigative efforts in greater than
      170 different NIH and FDA laboratories. The intent of this protocol is not to approve the
      research itself, but to provide adequate and complete informed consent for the donor, and to
      assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study subjects (research blood
      donors) is performed in accordance with IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other applicable Federal
      regulatory standards...

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -NIH and FDA intramural investigators performing in vitro studies involving human blood
      components have a need for a steady, reliable, consistent source of these blood components,
      preferably derived from screened donors documented to be free of potential
      transfusion-transmissible diseases.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide a mechanism, that is reviewed and approved by IRB, for the Department of
           Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center to collect and process blood and blood components
           from paid, healthy volunteer donors for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and
           FDA laboratories for in vitro research use.

        -  To provide adequate and complete informed consent to the donors of research blood
           samples, and to assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study
           subjects (research blood donors) from research risks is performed in accordance with
           IRB, OPRR and other applicable Federal regulatory standards.

      Eligibility:

      Donors must meet the eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation with the
      exception of foreign travel history and other requirements, some of which are outlined below:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Weight greater than 110 pounds

        -  No known heart, lung, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders

        -  No history of sickle cell disease

        -  Female subjects should not be pregnant

      Design:

        -  Donors meeting research donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood and
           blood components by standard phlebotomy and apheresis techniques.

        -  The investigational nature of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the
           risks and discomforts of the donation process will be carefully explained to the donors,
           and a signed informed consent document will be obtained.

        -  Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule based on the duration
           and discomfort of the donation.

        -  NIH and FDA investigators requesting blood components for research use will be required
           to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo of request, briefly describing the nature of
           the research, and providing assurance that samples provided through this protocol will
           be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo research.

        -  Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and
           the DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code
           that links the product with a donor s identity.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        Donors must meet the eligibility criteria for volunteer blood donation, defined in the Code
        of Federal Regulations 21 CFR 640, and AABB Standards as modified in the 2007 FDA/CBER
        Guidance Document: Eligibility Criteria for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular
        and Tissue-Based Products, with the exception of foreign travel history and other
        conditions, as noted below:

          -  Ability of subject to understand, ask questions, and the willingness to provide
             written informed consent

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Weight greater than 110 pounds

          -  Female subjects should not be pregnant

          -  No known heart, lung, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders

          -  No history of sickle cell disease

          -  No history of engaging in high-risk activities for exposure to the AIDS virus, as
             defined in the AABB Donor Education Materials distributed to all donors. Deferral
             periods for high-risk activities (MSM, IV drug use or receipt of money or drugs in
             exchange for sex) will not exceed the corresponding deferral period as defined for
             allogeneic blood donors.

          -  No history of malaria in the past 12 months

          -  Donors who have a family history of CJD, donors who have undergone tattooing or body
             piercing within the prior 12 months, donors who have received a graft such as bone,
             skin or dura mater, donors who are taking finasteride or retinoids, and donors who
             have had sexual contact within the past 12 months with a person who has symptomatic
             hepatitis C infection or donors who have lived with a person who has hepatitis in the
             last 12 months, are similarly eligible for research-use only donations on this
             protocol.

          -  Donors who have traveled to Europe, Africa, Asia, and areas of South America, who are
             rendered ineligible for allogeneic donation due to malarial risk, Zika risk and vCJD
             risk, are eligible for research donations

          -  Donors with a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) only, without
             other positive infectious disease markers,are eligible for research donations.

          -  Donors with HLA antibodies are eligible for research donations

          -  Donors who have received an experimental drug, agent, or vaccine, and who are referred
             for a research plasma or leukocyte collection, specifically because they were given
             this drug, agent, or vaccine, are acceptable only if their research product is
             collected for use by the PI who administered the experimental drug, agent, or vaccine.
             Otherwise, they are deferred for one year after receiving an experimental drug, agent,
             or vaccine.

          -  Donors who have received a xenotransplant are eligible for research donations.

          -  Granulocyte donors may not receive dexamethasone if they have poorly controlled
             hypertension or diabetes, or if they have a history of cataracts. Hetastarch (also
             known as hydroxyethyl starch or &quot;HES&quot;) and dexamethasone may elevate blood pressure
             and raise blood glucose levels, and repetitive steroid administration may increase the
             risk of posterior subcapsular cataract formation or progression.

          -  Granulocyte donors must have an estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate of &gt;
             45ml/min/1.73m^2.

          -  Granulocyte donors may not receive filgrastim if they have a history or symptoms of
             coronary heart disease.

        Investigators are informed that eligibility standards for research donors differ from those
        for transfusion donors through an electronic &quot;User Agreement&quot; which they electronically
        sign when they register to receive blood components on this protocol.
