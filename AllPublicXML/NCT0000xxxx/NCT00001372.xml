  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and their
      relatives to learn more about how the disease develops and changes over time. It will also
      study genetic factors that make a person susceptible to SLE.

      Patients 10 years of age and older with known or suspected SLE and their relatives may be
      eligible for this study. Patients will be evaluated with a medical history and physical
      examination, blood and urine tests. Other procedures may include:

        1. Electrocardiogram

        2. 24-hour urine collection

        3. Imaging studies, such as chest and joint X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans,
           bone scans, and bone densitometry.

        4. Questionnaire about the degree of disease activity, and survey of risk factors for
           disease complications.

        5. Apheresis Collection of plasma (fluid portion of blood) or blood cells for analysis.
           Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a
           machine that separates it into its components. The required component (plasma or cells)
           is removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle or
           through a second needle in the other arm.

        6. Skin biopsy Removal of a small skin sample for microscopic analysis. An area of skin is
           numbed with an anesthetic and a small circular portion (about 1/4 inch in diameter) is
           removed, using a sharp cookie cutter-type instrument.

        7. Kidney, bone marrow or other organ biopsy Removal of a small sample of organ tissue.
           These biopsies are done only if they can provide information useful in better
           understanding the disease or making treatment decisions.

        8. Genetic studies Collection of a blood sample for gene testing.

      Patients will be followed at least once a year with a brief history and physical examination
      and routine blood and urine tests. Some patients may be seen more often. Treatment
      recommendations will be offered to patients' physicians, and patients who are eligible for
      other research treatment studies will be invited to enroll.

      Participating relatives of patients will fill out a brief medical history questionnaire and
      provide a DNA sample (either a blood sample or tissue swab from the inside of the cheek) for
      genetic testing.

      This research protocol will evaluate subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and
      their relatives to study the pathogenesis and natural history of the disease and the
      mechanisms leading to enhanced organ damage. Patients will be evaluated by a history and
      physical examination and routine laboratory studies will be obtained as needed to assess
      disease activity or complications of the disease and to monitor for drug-related toxicities.
      Blood, skin or urine specimens may be requested for research purposes, including genetic
      studies. In addition, a subset of these patients will undergo several tests to understand the
      pathogenic changes affecting their blood vessels. Patients who are eligible for other
      research protocols will be offered the opportunity to participate in these studies by signed
      informed consent. Any medical care recommended or provided to the patient will be consistent
      with routine standards of practice and provided in consultation with the patient s referring
      physician. Blood and urine samples and cardiovascular testing will also be collected or
      performed on healthy volunteers for research purposes and to support the identification and
      validation of new biomarker candidates.
