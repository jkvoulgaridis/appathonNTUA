  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients whose parathyroid activity is elevated above normal are referred to as having
      hyperparathyroidism. This study will help researchers better understand the causes of
      hyperthyroidism and to evaluate and improve methods for diagnosis and treatment.

      In this study, patients diagnosed with or suspected of having hyperparathyroidism will be
      selected to participate. In addition, patients with related conditions such as parathyroid
      tumors, will also be selected.

      Subjects will be asked to provide blood and urine for testing to confirm their condition.
      They will then be surgically treated by removal of the parathyroid gland(s)
      (parathyroidectomy).

      Subjects with parathyroid tumors will undergo several diagnostic tests to determine the exact
      location of the tumor as well as the tumor's activity. The tests may include; ultrasounds,
      nuclear scanning, CT scans, MRI, and specialized blood testing.

      Sometimes parathyroidectomy leads to hypoparathyroidism. Options for treating the patients
      after the surgical procedure will also be addressed. Calcium and Vitamin D supplements are
      typically the mainstay of post parathyroidectomy therapy. Other potential treatments include
      transplanting the parathyroid gland(s) to other areas of the body.

      Patients with confirmed or suspected primary hyperparathyroidism or complications therefrom
      (such as postoperative hypoparathyroidism) will be admitted for diagnosis and treatment. The
      principal diagnostic components are calcium in serum and urine, parathyroid hormone in serum,
      and mutation tests on germline or tumor DNA. Patients with moderately to severe primary
      hyperparathyroidism will be treated. Treatment will be mainly by parathyroidectomy.
      Preoperative testing to localize parathyroid neoplasm(s) will be used usually and with more
      extended methods in cases with prior neck surgery. Other options are medications or no
      intervention. Patients with a hyperparathyroid syndrome may be managed for their
      extraparathyroid features (medical management or surgical treatment). Preoperative tumor
      localization tests will be selected according to clinical indications from the following:
      ultrasound, technetium-thallium scan, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging,
      somatostatin receptor imaging, fine needle aspiration for parathyroid hormone assay,
      selective arteriogram, selective venous catheterization for parathyroid hormone assay.
      Options for management of postoperative hypocalcemia include calcium, vitamin D analogs,
      parathyroid autografts and synthetic parathyroid hormone. Research specimens may consist of
      blood or tumors. In addition, a substudy for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type
      1 (MEN1) will assess the utility of two PET/CT scans with radiotracers (68Gallium-DOTATATE
      and 18F-DOPA).

    <description>The purpose of this study is to understand the causes of primary hyperparathyroidism, to evaluate and improve methods for diagnosis and treatment, and to provide insight into the mechanisms of normal parathyroid function. Hereditary causes of primary hyperparathyroidism will be characterized. Methods of pre-operative parathyroid gland localization will be evaluated (6, 7, 8). Genes that contribute to development of parathyroid tumors will be analyzed (4, 9, 10).</description>
