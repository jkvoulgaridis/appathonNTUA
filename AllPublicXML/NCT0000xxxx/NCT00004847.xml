  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop better methods of diagnosis, localization, and treatment
      for pheochromocytomas. These tumors, which usually arise from the adrenal glands, are often
      difficult to detect with current methods. Pheochromocytomas release chemicals called
      catecholamines, causing high blood pressure. Undetected, the tumors can lead to severe
      medical consequences, including stroke, heart attack and sudden death, in situations that
      would normally pose little or no risk, such as surgery, general anesthesia or childbirth.

      Patients with pheochromocytoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened
      with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine
      tests. Study participants will undergo blood, urine, and imaging tests, described below, to
      detect pheochromocytoma. If a tumor is found, the patient will be offered surgery. If surgery
      is not feasible (for example, if there are multiple tumors that cannot be removed),
      evaluations will continue in follow-up visits. If the tumor cannot be found, the patient will
      be offered medical treatment and efforts to detect the tumor will continue. Main diagnostic
      and research tests may include the following:

        1. Blood tests - mainly measurements of plasma or urine catecholamines and metanephrines as
           well as methoxytyramine. If necessary the clonidine suppression test can be carried out.

        2. Standard imaging tests - Non-investigational imaging tests include computed tomography
           (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sonography, and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and FDG
           (positron emission tomography) PET/CT. These scans may be done before and/or after
           surgical removal of pheochromocytoma.

        3. Research PET scanning is done using an injection of radioactive compounds. Patients may
           undergo 18F-FDOPA, 18F-DA, as well as 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT . Each scan takes up to about
           2 hours.

        4. Genetic testing - A small blood sample is collected for DNA analysis and other
           analyses....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare and clinically important
      chromaffin cell tumors that typically arise from the adrenal gland or from extra-adrenal
      paraganglia, respectively. The clinical features and consequences of PHEO/PGL result from the
      release of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine). An undetected PHEO/PGL poses a
      hazard to patients undergoing surgery, childbirth, or general anesthesia, due to the
      potential for excess catecholamine secretion, which can result in significant, often
      catastrophic outcomes. Diagnosing and localizing a PHEO/PGL can be challenging. Plasma and
      urinary catecholamines as well as their metabolites and radio-iodinated
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning can yield false-positive/negative results in patients
      harboring the tumor. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lack
      sufficient specificity. The molecular mechanisms by which genotypic changes predispose to the
      development of PHEO/PGL remain unknown - even in patients with identified mutations.
      Moreover, in patients with hereditary predispositions, PHEOs/PGLs differ in terms of their
      growth, malignant potential, catecholamine phenotype, responses to standard screening tests,
      various imaging modalities and therefore subsequently, different therapeutic options. This
      protocol focuses on developmental, molecular, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomics,
      immunologic and other types of studies to investigate the bases for predisposition to develop
      PHEOs/PGLs and for expression of different neurochemical and other phenotypes and malignant
      potentials including therapeutic responses. Furthermore, this protocol will also use new
      imaging approaches, for example [18F]-6F-dopamine ([18F]-6F-DA),
      [18F]-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([18F]-DOPA), and [68Ga]-DOTA-Tyr-octreotate ([68Ga]-
      DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, as well as PET/MRI scanning and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI.

    <intervention_name>([18F]-DOPA)</intervention_name>
    <description>is L 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) labeled with the radioactive isotope 18F. In general, PPGLs belong to the group of neuroendocrine tumors. This heterogeneous group of tumors takes up amino acids, transforms them into biogenic amines (dopamine and serotonin) by decarboxylation and stores the amines in vesicles. L DOPA is a precursor of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine). Epinephrine conversion to dopamine is catalyzed by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. According to previous and current studies, [18F]-DOPA PET is highly sensitive and specific for detection of PHEO /PGL67-69. However, there are only a few reports in the literature using [18F]-DOPA as a PET agent and particularly for patients with metastatic PPGLs. PET imaging will be done together with either a CT, an MRI or both modalities.</description>

    <description>is an imaging agent that binds specifically to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). PPGLs similar to other neuroendocrine tumors express one or more SSTRs1-5.

    <intervention_name>([18F]-6F-DA)</intervention_name>
    <description>is an imaging agent developed at the NIH, that may improve specificity and sensitivity in the localization of PPGLs. [18F]-6F-DA enters cells via the membrane norepinephrine transporter. Once inside cells, [18F]-6F- DA is translocated via the vesicular monoamine transporter into storage vesicles, where the radioactivity is concentrated. After injection of [18F]-6F- DA, the much faster disappearance of [18F]-6F-DA-derived radioactivity from the bloodstream and non- neuronal cells than from chromaffin cells should enable rapid visualization of PPGLs by PET scanning.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are adults or children of any age with known, sporadic or familial PHEO/PGL, on
        the basis of one or more of the following:

          1. High levels of blood or urinary catecholamines, metanephrines, methoxytyramine or
             chromogranin A.

          2. Highly suspected presence of PHEO/PGL based on imaging studies, even with normal
             biochemistry.

          3. Personal or family history of PHEO/PGL or genetic mutations known to predispose
             individuals to develop PHEO/PGL.

        Patients can be studied to provide blood/urine samples for biochemical, proteomic, and/or
        genetic and epigenetic analysis.

        Signed informed consent is required.

        Patients must be willing to return to NIH for follow-up evaluation.

        Patients must have an outside general practitioner or endocrinologist. Patients with
        metastatic disease must also have an outside oncologist.

        Patients with PHEO/PGL will be accepted through clinician or self- referrals.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Potential patients will be excluded on the basis of one or more of the following:

          1. Pregnant (based on a pregnancy test done either outside the NIH or at the NIH) or
             breastfeeding women

          2. Severe cardiac dysfunction

          3. Currently on dialysis

             A pregnancy test is performed in women of childbearing age (up to age 55). If after
             enrollment to this protocol, a patient is found to have a positive pregnancy test, her
             participation in this protocol will be terminated.

             Research scans are contraindicated in patients with proven myelodysplastic syndrome.

             Patients who are not willing to return to the NIH (e.g., after surgery or an initial
             evaluation) for more than 2 years may be removed from the protocol.

             If the patient is eligible for a surgery and chooses to receive surgical intervention
             at a place outside of the NIH, his/her decision may affect future participation in the
             study. We also understand that due to extenuating circumstances the patient may need
             to pursue the surgery somewhere else. Under those circumstances, our team will provide
             a list of necessary criteria for continued follow-up (i.e. tissue transfer, follow-up
             tests, etc.).

               -  The patient will need to inform the research team ahead of time about the surgeon
                  and institution that will be performing the surgery, so that the team can aid in
                  facilitating the appropriate arrangements for tissue transfer.

               -  The patient will need to consult with the outside surgeon to develop a plan for
                  sending a sample of tumor tissue to the NIH research team.

               -  If the surgeon is not consulted or the sample is not transferred, we may inform
                  participants that their enrollment in the study may no longer be scientifically
                  appropriate. In this case, the research team will work with the participant to
                  develop a plan to obtain medical records to facilitate transfer of care in
                  patient s preferred facility.

             Pregnant and breastfeeding women will not be included in the protocol because their
             participation as a demographic is not essential to this study. The information we are
             seeking can be acquired from a cohort of non-pregnant patients. The exclusion of
             pregnant women does not preclude these patients from receiving appropriate care and
             management from an outside facility

             SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR IMAGING STUDIES WITHIN OUR PROTOCOL:

             In adult patients:

             Imaging studies are not done in patients that have the following exclusion criteria:

               -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women.

               -  Patients with a body weight of &gt;= 400 pounds due to weight limitations of
                  PET/CT/MRI scanners or patients who are not able to enter the bore of PET/CT/MRI
                  scanners due to increased BMI.

               -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g., cough, severe
                  arthritis, etc.).

               -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
                  examinations due to other reasons (e.g., severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia,
                  etc.)

               -  Any additional medical conditions, serious illness or other extenuating
                  circumstance that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, may
                  significantly interfere with study compliance.

             Additionally, DCE-MRI is not done in patients with acute or chronic renal
             insufficiency since gadolinium chelate injection is contraindicated in those patients.
             Patients with impaired kidney function, based on the measurments of a creatinine
             clearance, will not undergo DCE-MRI. DCE-MRI is also not done in patients with severe
             claustrophobia or who have iron or metal in the MRI scan site, in patients with
             pacemakers or defibrillators or in patients with an allergy to gadolinium. Very
             rarely, gadolinium at the site of injection or the dosed limb can cause skin and soft
             tissue necrosis, thrombosis, fasciitis, and compartment syndrome requiring surgical
             intervention.

             In pediatric patients:

             Inclusion criteria for research PET imaging in children:

               -  Children over 10 years old with very high suspicion of sporadic or familial
                  PHEO/PGL (e.g., the presence of new onset of hypertension or hypertensive
                  episodes, sweating, headaches, pallor, palpitations, drug resistant hypertension,
                  etc.) family history of PHEO/PGL or genetic mutations known to predispose
                  individuals to develop these tumors or the presence of a tumor on conventional
                  imaging including ultrasound, CT and/or MRI.

               -  Children must give written informed assent and be willing to return to the NIH
                  for follow-up.

               -  Female patients of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test on the
                  day of the enrollment into this protocol and within 24 hours of any treatment or
                  test involving radioactivity or radiation exposure. They should be abstinent or
                  use appropriate contraception while taking part in the study, which involves
                  radiation.

             Exclusion criteria for research PET imaging in children:

               -  Children of less than 10 years of age.

               -  Children with impaired mental capacity that precludes informed assent.

               -  Pregnant or breastfeeding female adolescents.

               -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g., cough, turbulent
                  children, severe claustrophobia, etc.).
