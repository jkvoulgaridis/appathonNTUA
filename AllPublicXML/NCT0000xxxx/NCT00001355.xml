  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to evaluate selected patients with documented recurrent or unusual
      infections and their family members for clinical and laboratory correlates of immune
      abnormalities. It allows long term follow up of patients with host defense defects and
      permits the periodic study of their blood, urine, saliva, skin, stool and vaginal specimens
      or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for medically indicated purposes
      and research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of these
      diseases. This protocol may help provide patients and materials for the development of
      therapies for these diseases.

      This study will:

        1. Determine the biochemical and genetic causes of inherited immune diseases affecting
           phagocytes (white blood cells that defend against bacterial and fungal infections)

        2. Try to develop better ways to diagnose and treat patients with these diseases, and to
           prevent, diagnose and treat their infections

      Patients and family members may undergo the following procedures:

        -  A personal and family medical history, physical examination and other procedures, which
           may include various blood tests; urinalysis; saliva collection; imaging studies such as
           chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and lung
           function studies, dental examination or eye examinations, if medically indicated.

        -  Patients who have draining wounds will have fluid collected from these wounds for
           biochemical study.

        -  Tissues removed as part of medical care, such as pieces of lung, liver, or teeth, or
           biopsies of these tissues will be studied.

        -  Patients who have an immune problem that investigators wish to study further will be
           asked to return to NIH for follow-up visits at irregular intervals, but at least every 6
           months. The visits will include an updated medical history, examination directed at the
           particular medical problem related to the immune disorder, follow-up of abnormal tests
           or treatment, and collection of blood, saliva, urine, or wound fluid for study.

        -  Patients may have genetic testing and must be willing to have specimens stored for
           future research.

        -  Family members will have a medical history, saliva or urine collection, and chest X-ray
           or other imaging study, if medically indicated.

        -  Normal volunteers who have had tissue biopsies or pieces of tissue removed as part of
           medical care, such as pieces of lung, liver, or teeth, will have these tissues studied.

        -  NIH does not cover the cost of the initial screening visit for travel or lodging. A
           financial assessment may determine if the patient is eligible for financial assistance.
           This study does not enroll children under the age of 2.

        -  Patients will be asked to obtain their medical records, previous test results, or
           imaging studies prior to the first visit.

      This protocol is designed to evaluate selected patients with documented recurrent or unusual
      infections and their family members for clinical and in vitro correlates of immune
      abnormalities. It will also allow long term follow up of patients with host defense defects
      and permit us to periodically obtain blood, urine, saliva, skin, breast milk, stool and
      vaginal specimens or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for medically
      indicated purposes and research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical
      bases of these diseases. This protocol may help provide patients and materials for the
      development of therapies for these diseases.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients known to have or suspected of having an immune defect significantly or primarily
        involving the phagocytes will be eligible for enrollment, as well as their blood relatives.
        Such syndromes include but are not limited to those listed above. There will be no limit to
        age, sex, race or disability. Patients or patient relatives must be over 1 month of age.

        The patient and patient relative cohorts will include the following special populations:

          -  Children: Children are included in this study because immune defects maypresent in
             early childhood, and early diagnosis or characterization may benefit subjects.

          -  Decisionally impaired adults: Patients and patient relatives will be able to provide
             informed consent for themselves or if they lack the capacity to provide informed
             consent, the study team will obtain consent from the legally authorized
             representative. Patients with underlying immune disorders, autoimmune phenomena or
             severe infections may sometimes present with delirium, encephalopathy, or coma and are
             therefore unable to provide informed consent. Excluding patients who are unable to
             provide consent could adversely impact patient access to medical therapy at the NIH as
             well as adversely impact research recruitment. Excluding patients unable to provide
             consent would also essentially prohibit us from evaluating patients at higher risk for
             adverse outcomes and therefore skew our understanding of disease. Similarly, enrolled
             patient subjects who lose the ability to provide ongoing consent during study
             participation may continue in the study. The risks and benefits of participation for
             subjects unable to consent should be identical to those described for less vulnerable
             patients.

        Healthy volunteers will be healthy adults between the age of 18 and 80 years of either sex,
        and they must be able to provide informed consents for themselves.

        INCLUSION OF NIH EMPLOYEES:

        NIH employees and members of their immediate families may participate in this protocol. We
        will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will
        give each employee a copy of the NIH information sheet on Employee Research Participation.

        For NIH employees:

          -  Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation.

          -  The NIH information sheet regarding NIH employee research participation will be
             distributed to all potential subjects who are NIH employees.

          -  The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance
             with NIH Clinical Center and NIAID policies, which define the scope and limitations of
             the protections.

          -  For NIH employee subjects, consent will be obtained by an individual independent of
             the employee s team. Those in a supervisory position to any employee and co-workers of
             the employee will not obtain consent.

        The importance of maintaining confidentiality when obtaining potentially sensitive and
        private information from co-workers or subordinates will be reviewed with the study staff
        at least annually and more often if warranted.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The presence of an acquired abnormality which leads to immune defects, such as HIV,
        cytotoxic chemotherapy or malignancy could be grounds for possible exclusion if, in the
        opinion of the investigator, the presence of such disease process interfered with
        evaluation.

        Individuals with dementia that impairs obtaining informed consent are excluded from
        enrolling as healthy volunteers, although such subjects may enroll in the patient or
        relative cohorts if unless there is an appropriate surrogate (legal guardian or durable
        power of attorney who is willing to provide consent).
