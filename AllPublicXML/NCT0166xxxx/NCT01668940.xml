    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Lillipops in the
      improvement of morning sickness symptoms. Secondary objectives are to assess if there are any
      changes to concurrent symptoms that may intensify NVP, such as metallic taste or
      gastrointestinal issues (e.g. heartburn, acid reflux, indigestion and gas), as well as
      preference for freezie flavours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is the most common medical condition of pregnancy,
      also known as morning sickness which affects up to 80% of pregnant women. Lillipops Iced
      Soothies are naturally flavoured freezies developed in the United Kingdom for women with
      morning sickness. They are available in 5 different flavours: grapefruit and tangerine, lemon
      and mint, chamomile and orange, lime and vanilla, and ginger. The flavours are derived from
      steam distillation of the peels (grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, orange, lime), mint leaves,
      and chamomile flowers to release and collect their essential oils. Vanilla pods and ginger
      are macerated and their resin is used. These flavours are chosen because they may provide
      relief of symptoms as they are either traditional remedies for NVP, such as ginger, or
      soothing and refreshing flavours, such as chamomile, vanilla and citrus.

      This study hypothesizes that using Lillipops Iced Soothies will reduce the severity of NVP
      symptoms according to the PUQE-24 (pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea)
      scoring system for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, we hypothesize concurrent
      symptoms that may intensify NVP, such as metallic taste or gastrointestinal disorders (e.g.
      heartburn, acid reflux, indigestion and gas), will be alleviated. We hypothesize that
      improvements to NVP and concurrent symptoms will be greater with Lillipop freezies compared
      to another commercially available freezie.

    <masking_description>A computerized randomization table will be prepared by a third party who is not otherwise involved in the study. After a participant has given consent to enrol in the study, the next participant number in sequence will be assigned and the appropriate corresponding sealed envelope will be opened by the study coordinator, determining which product (if any) the participant will receive. The boxes will be given unique codes depending on whether they contain Lillipops (4 flavours), Ginger Lillipops or Mr. Freeze freezies, and the different flavours will also be coded. Participants will be shown a list of the ingredients that are found in Lillipops and Mr. Freeze freezies to ensure that they do not have allergies or take medications that interact with any ingredient(s) that they may be asked to consume.</masking_description>

    <description>Initially, women will be given 1 multiflavour box of Lillipop samples minus the ginger flavour (4 flavours). Each box contains 24 freezies (20 mL each), 6 of each flavor. They will be told to eat the freezies as needed to alleviate symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 per day, and to not have any other popsicles, freezies or any ginger products throughout the duration of the study (7 days). They can request an additional multiflavour box of freezies at each follow-up, as needed.
All participants will initially receive counselling and advice by the Motherisk NVP Counsellor about symptom management. This includes advice about dietary, non-medicinal and medical treatments as per the Motherisk NVP protocol</description>

        <title>Improvement of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy (NVP)</title>
        <description>To assess the effectiveness of Lillipops in the improvement of NVP symptoms. The primary endpoint of interest is the severity of NVP as compared between the 4 groups, defined according to the PUQE-24 (pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea) scoring system for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy that was developed and validated by Motherisk.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, +1, +3, +5, +7 days</time_frame>
        <population>The study was terminated due to the original study PI's departure, and the final analyses have not been conducted. The study file has been locked in 2015 after the official study closure.</population>

            <title>Lillipops Iced Soothies (4 Flavours)</title>
            <description>Initially, women will be given 1 multiflavour box of Lillipop samples minus the ginger flavour (4 flavours). Each box contains 24 freezies (20 mL each), 6 of each flavor. They will be told to eat the freezies as needed to alleviate symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 per day, and to not have any other popsicles, freezies or any ginger products throughout the duration of the study (7 days). They can request an additional multiflavour box of freezies at each follow-up, as needed.
All participants will initially receive counselling and advice by the Motherisk NVP Counsellor about symptom management. This includes advice about dietary, non-medicinal and medical treatments as per the Motherisk NVP protocol.</description>

They will be told to eat the freezies as needed to alleviate symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 a day and to not have any other popsicles, freezies or other ginger products throughout the duration of the study (7 days). Due ginger’s antiemetic property, a maximum daily dose is up to 1000mg/day of dried ginger root powder in pregnancy.They can request an additional box of freezies at each follow-up, as needed.All participants will initially receive counselling and advice by the Motherisk NVP Counsellor about symptom management.
