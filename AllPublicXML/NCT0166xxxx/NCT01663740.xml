    <measure>Change in Sperm Density From Baseline to the End of Treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Sperm density was calculated based on the average of two semen samples. Change was calculated as the sperm density measured at post-baseline visit (EOT) minus (-) the sperm density measured at baseline for each participant. A negative change from baseline indicated a lower sperm density (worsening).</description>

    <measure>Change in Terminal Uridine Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) Score From Baseline to EOT and End of Follow-up (FU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 28), end of FU (Week 52)</time_frame>
    <description>Sperm DNA fragmentation change (chromatin damage) was evaluated based on TUNEL score. Change was calculated as the TUNEL score measured at post-baseline visit (EOT and FU) minus the TUNEL score measured at baseline for each participant.

        <description>Sperm DNA fragmentation change (chromatin damage) was evaluated based on TUNEL score. Change was calculated as the TUNEL score measured at FU minus the TUNEL score measured at EOT for each participant. A negative change from EOT indicated a lower TUNEL score. TUNEL score represents percentage of sperm with fragmented DNA; total score ranged from 0% to 100%, higher score represents more fragmentation.</description>
