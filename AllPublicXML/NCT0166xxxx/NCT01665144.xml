    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 3-month Confirmed Disibility Progression (CDP) Events as Measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 month up to the maximum of approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS uses an ordinal scale to assess neurologic impairment in MS based on a neurological examination. Scores in each of 7 functional systems (Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel &amp; Bladder, and Cerebral) and an ambulation score were combined to determine the EDSS steps, ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Confirmed disability is defined as an increase of score of 1 point in patients with baseline score of 3.0 to 5.0 and 0.5 point increase with baseline score of 5.5 to 6.5.</description>

    <description>Participants started on Day 1 and were uptitrated from 0.25 mg to 2 mg of BAF312 orally over a period of 6 days. After Day 7, participants continued on the treatment epoch for 3 months. During the Core Part of the study, participants participated in a maximum of 3 epochs. Following the Core Part, eligible patients enter the Extension Part during which all receive open-label BAF312.</description>

        <description>The EDSS uses an ordinal scale to assess neurologic impairment in MS based on a neurological examination. Scores in each of 7 functional systems (Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel &amp; Bladder, and Cerebral) and an ambulation score were combined to determine the EDSS steps, ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Confirmed disability is defined as an increase of score of 1 point in patients with baseline score of 3.0 to 5.0 and 0.5 point increase with baseline score of 5.5 to 6.5.</description>
