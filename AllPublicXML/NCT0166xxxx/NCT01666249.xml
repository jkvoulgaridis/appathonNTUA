  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a open, prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase III study for clinical assessment of
      anti-Rh immunoglobulin (KamRho-D®) in Rh and Coombs negative women with risk sensitization.
      The anti-Rh immunoglobulin is an immunobiological containing high concentration of specific
      antibodies against factor D and &quot;neutralizes&quot; D antigen present in the Rh-positive fetal red
      blood cells (Rh +), which passed into the bloodstream of Rh-negative pregnant women (Rh).

      This a phase III study in which women participants with RH and Coombs negative will receive
      only one dose of 1500 IU anti-Rh immunoglobulin intramuscularly up to 72 hours post
      exposition (child-birth) and will be following until six months to verification of negative
      Coombs maintenance. Safety evaluation data will include report of all adverse events
      (including type, frequency, intensity, seriousness, severity and action taken related to the
      investigational product).
