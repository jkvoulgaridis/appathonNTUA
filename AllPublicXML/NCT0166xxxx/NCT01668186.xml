  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders (PBD) are a group of inherited disorders due to defects
      in peroxisome assembly causing complex developmental and metabolic sequelae. In spite of
      advancements in peroxisome biology, the pathophysiology remains unknown, the spectrum of
      phenotypes poorly characterized and the natural history not yet systematically reported. Our
      aims are to further define this population clinically, biochemically and genetically. The
      investigators will prospectively follow patients from Canada, the US and internationally, and
      collect data from medical evaluations, blood, urine and imaging studies that would be
      performed on a clinical care basis. For patients who are unable to attend our clinic, we will
      collect all medical records and images since birth as well as subsequent records/images for
      the next 5 years or until the end of the study. Clinical data from medical records will be
      banked in our Peroxisomal Disorder Research Databank and Biobank. The investigators will use
      this information to identify standards of care and improve management.

      Participants have the option to be seen in consultation at the McGill University Health
      Centre in Montreal, Canada, on a yearly basis. This includes a consultation in Genetics,
      Nutrition, Neurology, and Ophthalmology (OCT and FAF exams). All medical records and images
      will be collected, retrospectively and prospectively, until the end of the study, and entered
      anonymously in a database. Biospecimens will be collected to identify new biomarkers.
      Candidate drugs will be evaluated for recovery of peroxisome functions in cultured
      fibroblasts.
