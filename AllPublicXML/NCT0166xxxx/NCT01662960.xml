  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether an existing treatment for problems that
      participants have with making movements after a stroke can be performed at home.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two forms of home-based treatment for post-stroke problems making
      movements with the arms and hands. After initial pre-treatment assessments, participants will
      complete 4 weeks of treatment, with assessments after each week of treatment and 3 months
      after the completion of treatment.

    <measure>Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after 1 month of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures impairment-level ability to move the arm and hand. Scores range from 0 to 66, with higher scores indicating greater ability to move the arm and hand.</description>

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures the ability to complete simulated everyday tasks with the arm. Scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the integrity of sensory perception of the arm. The score is the proportion of items answered correctly, and ranges from 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Virtual-reality Assessment of Navigation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the ability to detect lateralized attention problems in a simulated navigation test. Evidence for lateralized attentional problems was defined as a 20% difference in item detection between the left and right side.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the self-reported ability to complete everyday tasks with the arm. Total scores for all items are reported. The scale ranged from 0 to 300, with higher scores indicating higher self-reported ability.</description>
