  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic myeloablative (MA) HCT with
      a T cell depleted graft, the infusion of naturally occurring regulatory T cells with
      conventional T cells (T cell add back) in pre-defined doses and ratios will reduce the
      incidence of acute graft vs host disease while augmenting the graft vs leukemia effect and
      improving immune reconstitution.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of administration of several dose
           combinations of conventional T cells (Tcon) and regulatory T cells (Treg) in patients
           undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with HLA matched donors
           (related or unrelated) using a T cell depleted graft [CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor
           cells (&quot;CD34+ HSPC&quot;)], without immune suppression.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of infused regulatory and conventional T cells
           in the matched donor setting

        -  To determine 1 year event free survival (EFS) post HCT

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the 1 year OS in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT with matched donors.

        -  To measure the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft vs host disease (GvHD)

        -  To measure incidence of serious infections
