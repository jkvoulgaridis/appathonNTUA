  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved medication for rheumatoid
      arthritis and ulcerative colitis, may be beneficial in neuropathic pain conditions. In this
      study, the investigators will evaluate whether sulfasalazine improves pain due to painful
      peripheral neuropathy.

    <description>Average pain score will be the average of daily pain scores (0-10) recorded by the subject in a pain diary during the second week of the two week treatment period. Higher scores are worse (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine).</description>

Higher scores are worse (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Percent pain reduction will be calculated from BL to end of treatment period 1 (2 weeks), based on average pain scores at each time point.</description>

(tick ONE box) (1=No change (or condition has gotten worse), 2=Almost the same, hardly any change at all, 3=A little better, but no noticeable change, 4=Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference, 5=Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change, 6=Better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference, 7=A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference). Item 2 is as follows: In a similar way, please circle the number below that matches your degree of change since beginning care at this clinic (0-10 scale): 0= Much better, 5= No change, 10= Much worse.</description>

So 6 participants received both sulfasalazine and placebo treatments, one only received sulfasalazine in period 1, and one only received placebo in period 1. 2 of the sulfasalzine participants are missing PGIC.</population>
