  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot comparative effectiveness study designed to determine whether trazodone is as
      effective as quetiapine for treatment of insomnia in veterans with a history of addiction and
      mental health issues. The study will have two concurrent phases (parts); first an
      acceptability determination phase, to determine whether and why (or why not) veterans already
      taking quetiapine are willing to try an alternative to quetiapine for sleep; and second, a
      randomized trial phase which will test whether staying on quetiapine has any advantage over
      switching to trazodone. The purpose of the first phase will be a) to document the proportions
      of patients and physicians who are willing to agree to such a switch, b) to characterize
      sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of potentially eligible subjects associated
      with a willingness to switch from quetiapine to trazodone and c) to record the reasons given
      why patients and their prescribers are (or are not) willing to accept a switch from
      quetiapine to trazodone. It will also function to provide some educational background to
      patients and a reminder to providers about the potential severe side-effects of quetiapine,
      and will thus facilitate clinical informed consent for the clinical trial phase of the study.
      Completion of the first part of the study will also serve as the screening component for part
      II. Part II includes, first, obtaining written informed consent from eligible subjects, and
      then randomly assigning them to continue quetiapine or to be switched to trazodone in
      open-label &quot;real world&quot; fashion for the duration of 4 weeks, followed by another four weeks
      of open, non-randomized follow- up. The purpose of the second part of the study is to
      determine if trazodone is an adequate substitute for quetiapine, primarily in terms of
      treating insomnia. The investigators hypothesize that trazodone will not be inferior to
      quetiapine in maintaining good quality of sleep measured by sleep scales (i.e., scores will
      not significantly worsen once switched). This study is open to Veterans in the VA system
      only. Eligible subjects must have a history of &quot;dual diagnosis&quot; (i.e., a history of addiction
      and mental illness).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I of the study involves identification through VA records of subjects eligible for the
      study based on their prescription of quetiapine. Potentially eligible subjects will be
      contacted by the research team. Subjects will answer a brief questionnaire about their
      experience with the medication quetiapine as used for insomnia. If subjects are interested in
      participated in part II, the clinical trial portion of the study, they will be further
      screened for eligibility.

      Part II consists of a 4 week clinical trial in which subjects are randomized to stay on
      quetiapine or switch to trazodone, all of which will be open-label. Subjects will be
      evaluated for symptoms of sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. subjects will also
      be assessed for changes in mood, and alcohol/drug use. After the initial 4 week treatment
      period, subjects on trazodone can choose to switch back to quetiapine or continue on
      trazodone. Subjects will also be evaluated after an additional 4 weeks (8weeks from start of
      the study) on outcome measures.

    <measure>Change in Average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI)Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (week 0) to end of 4 week and end of week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Data analyzed for change from score at baseline, to week 4, to week 8. The range of scores is 0-21 on this scale, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. This is a comparison between groups (trazodone versus quetiapine)of the change on TOTAL PSQI scores over time using repeated measures analysis. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments. The first four weeks of treatment is the active acute experiment phase, and this will be the main comparison time period for the endpoint, but the investigators will also analyze change in PSQI until the follow-up point at the end of week 8.</description>

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline (week 0) to the end of week 4 and at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>THE RANGE OF SCORES IS FROM 0-28, WITH 28 REPRESENTING SEVERE INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS. Measurements made and reported at baseline, week 2, week 4. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. . This is a comparison between groups (trazodone versus quetiapine)of the change on TOTAL ISI scores over time using repeated measures analysis. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments. The investigators will first report the comparison during the active treatment phase (baseline to end of week 4) as the main comparison, but will also examine and report changes on the outcome at the follow up point (end of week 8).</description>

    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (week 0) to end of week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements made at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. The change from week 4 to week 8 (post-intervention) will also be measured and analyzed, reported. This is a comparison between groups (trazodone versus quetiapine)of the change on ESS scores over time using repeated measures analysis. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments. The investigators will first report the comparison during the active treatment phase (baseline to end of week 4) as the main comparison, but will also examine and report changes on the outcome at the follow up point (end of week 8).The minimum score on ESS is 0-24 units, with higher score representing greater sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>from week 0 (baseline) to end of week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory scale measures a broad range of psychiatric symptoms (psychological distress) and is meant to provide an overall measure of mental health symptomatology. The BSI has 53 items that use a 5-item Likert scale response. In general, higher scores correspond to greater symptomatology and distress. Usually, the range of scores goes from 0 - 4, since it is averaged over the number of responses, however, we report the raw total score which is the sum of all responses, thus the range is 0-212. Measurements made at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. This is a comparison between groups of the change on BSI scores over time using repeated measures analysis. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments.</description>

Measurements made at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. This is a comparison between groups (trazodone versus quetiapine)of the change on AUQ scores over time. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments.

        <title>Change in Average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI)Score</title>
        <description>Data analyzed for change from score at baseline, to week 4, to week 8. The range of scores is 0-21 on this scale, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. This is a comparison between groups (trazodone versus quetiapine)of the change on TOTAL PSQI scores over time using repeated measures analysis. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments. The first four weeks of treatment is the active acute experiment phase, and this will be the main comparison time period for the endpoint, but the investigators will also analyze change in PSQI until the follow-up point at the end of week 8.</description>

        <title>Change in Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) Over Time</title>
        <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory scale measures a broad range of psychiatric symptoms (psychological distress) and is meant to provide an overall measure of mental health symptomatology. The BSI has 53 items that use a 5-item Likert scale response. In general, higher scores correspond to greater symptomatology and distress. Usually, the range of scores goes from 0 - 4, since it is averaged over the number of responses, however, we report the raw total score which is the sum of all responses, thus the range is 0-212. Measurements made at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8. Data will be presented and analyzed for those time points with the main outcome measured as the change from baseline to week 4. This is a comparison between groups of the change on BSI scores over time using repeated measures analysis. This is a non-superiority analysis, so the hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between treatments.</description>
