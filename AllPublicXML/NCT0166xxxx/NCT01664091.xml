  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to carefully evaluate the effect of giving radiation
      therapy after temporary breast reconstruction. The investigators want to see if this type of
      reconstruction combined with radiation will look better (once the final reconstruction has
      been completed) and will reduce the risk that the participant will develop complications that
      sometimes occur with other kinds of reconstruction procedures. The investigators also want to
      know if it is easier to give the radiation with this type of reconstruction than with other
      kinds of reconstruction procedures. The reconstruction procedure involves the temporary use
      of a tissue expander and an acellular dermal matrix (ADM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  ADMs have been used in combination with a tissue expander and radiotherapy but have not
           been studied formally in terms of their ability to avoid complications sometimes seen
           with other methods of reconstruction and improve the delivery of the radiation. The only
           difference between being on the study and not being on the study is that the research
           team will analyze the records of those who participate to see how easy it was to give
           the radiation, how good the cosmetic outcome of the reconstruction is and what, if any,
           complications occured.

        -  A minimum of 6 weeks between the surgery and the start of radiation therapy is required
           to allow for adequate healing. Often this interval will be longer, as many patients will
           receive chemotherapy in the interim. There is no maximum time from surgery to radiation.

        -  Around the time of radiation planning, the radiation oncologist and plastic surgeon will
           agree upon how much deflation of the tissue expander will be required to permit
           simulation of the radiation therapy.

        -  Radiation therapy to the chest wall (with or without adjacent lymph nodes) will be given
           once daily Monday through Friday over 5-7 weeks.

        -  After the completion of the radiation therapy, the tissue expander will be re-expanded
           and eventually replaced by the permanent implant or flap reconstruction at the
           discretion of the plastic surgeon.

        -  Participants will be expected to return to the Radiation Oncology Clinic for follow-up
           visits 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the end of the radiation therapy. Evaluation of
           cosmetic results and complications will be done at these visits using a recognized
           scoring system and photographs taken at each time point and scored for specific items
           (necrosis, telangiectasia, etc).

    <description>Success rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing all of the following: 1) completion of PMRT and placement of the permanent implant and/or flap reconstruction; 2) no major complications (infection requiring hospitalization, major revisions, early/severe capsular contracture, or pain requiring implant removal); and 3) a physician-reported 'excellent' or 'good' cosmetic result (not 'fair' or 'poor') at 2 years following PMRT (requiring a stable reconstruction with good symmetry and contour relative to the contralateral breast).</description>

    <measure>Cosmetic Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmesis was measured by means of strict photographic analysis using five views (frontal, right and left lateral, and right and left quarter views) and independent assessment of the results by a plastic surgeon or radiation oncologist who has not treated the patient. Cosmetic score was defined in 4 categories: Excellent = treated breast looks essentially the same as the opposite breast; Good = minimal but identifiable result of treatment; Fair = significant effects of radiation therapy noted; Poor = severe normal tissue sequelae.</description>

    <description>An independent assessment of contracture was conducted by a plastic surgeon or radiation oncologist who had not treated the participant. Photographic analysis incorporated five views (frontal, right and left lateral, and right and left quarter views). Baker classification was used to score the extent of contracture: Class IA-absolutely natural, cannot tell breast was reconstructed; Class IB-soft, but the implant is detectable by physical examination or inspection because of mastectomy; Class II-mildly firm reconstructed breast with an implant that may be visible and detectable by physical examination; Class III-moderately firm reconstructed breast with readily detectable implant, but the result may still be acceptable; or Class IV-severe capsular contracture with an unacceptable aesthetic outcome and/or significant patient symptoms requiring surgical intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants received immediate breast reconstruction using a sub-muscular tissue expander (TE) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sling placed during the same surgery. This was followed by post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) no sooner than a minimum of 6 weeks and optimally 6 months, if adjuvant chemotherapy was required. The prescribed chest-wall dose was 50 -50.4 gray (Gy) in 25-28 fractions given once daily over 5-7 weeks with a 0.5-centimeter (cm) bolus to the scar every other day. Permanent reconstruction was performed at least 5 months after completion of PMRT.</description>

      <time_frame>Specific adverse events (AEs) as listed were evaluated and reported on the follow-up and cosmetic evaluation case report form at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24 months post RT. AEs were graded according to 5 classifications: mild, mild-moderate, moderate, moderate-severe and severe. Serious AEs were defined as AEs with a classification of moderate-severe or severe and other AEs with a classification of mild, mild-moderate or moderate.</time_frame>

          <title>TE-ADM With PMRT</title>
          <description>Participants received immediate breast reconstruction using a sub-muscular tissue expander (TE) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sling placed during the same surgery. This was followed by post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) no sooner than a minimum of 6 weeks and optimally 6 months, if adjuvant chemotherapy was required. The prescribed chest-wall dose was 50 –50.4 gray (Gy) in 25-28 fractions given once daily over 5-7 weeks with a 0.5-centimeter (cm) bolus to the scar every other day. Permanent reconstruction was performed at least 6 months after completion of PMRT.</description>
