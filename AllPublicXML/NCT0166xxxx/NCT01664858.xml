      CE-MARC 2 is a randomised controlled trial to determine diagnosis and patient management in
      patients presenting to outpatient clinics with suspected stable angina. Cardiac Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (at 3Tesla) will be evaluated prospectively against current best clinical
      practice (defined by international guidelines). The study hypothesis is that 3Tesla
      CMR-guided management of patients with suspected stable angina is superior to current
      clinical practice based on 1) the principles of the National Institutes for Clinical
      Excellence (NICE) CG95 guidelines (2010); 2) SPECT AHA appropriateness criteria, in terms of
      avoiding study-defined unnecessary invasive coronary angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial of non-invasive imaging to determine diagnosis and
      management of patients presenting with suspected stable angina. Despite the widespread
      availability of non-invasive imaging and guideline-enshrined use of optimal medical therapy
      (OMT), patients with suspected coronary heart disease (CHD) often end up having invasive
      coronary angiography early in their disease course. Currently &gt;50% of elective invasive
      coronary angiograms performed in the UK and US do not lead on to a revascularisation
      procedure (data from 2008-09 UK Hospital Episode Statistics; American College of Cardiology
      National Cardiovascular Data Registry (Patel MR, et al., N Engl J Med 2010;362:886-95)). The
      UK NICE guidelines for the management of chest pain of recent onset (CG95; 2010) could
      increase this proportion even further. This is inefficient for patients and also of
      healthcare resources.

      More widespread use of non-invasive functional imaging could reduce the rates of unnecessary
      angiography. We have shown in the CE-MARC study (Lancet 2012) that cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance (CMR) at 1.5Tesla has a higher diagnostic accuracy for the detection of CHD than
      single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). CE-MARC 2 will be a three-way randomised
      controlled trial of patient management in 1200 patients with known or suspected CHD,
      comparing 3Tesla CMR to SPECT-guided care or NICE guidelines-based management. The primary
      endpoint will be the reduction of unnecessary invasive angiography (defined by invasive FFR)
      at 12 months - identified by our expert patients as an important 'patient focused' clinical
      outcome measure. The secondary objectives will include: 1) assessment of safety of a
      CMR-guided management strategy 2) cost effectiveness analysis of these strategies.

    <measure>Cost Effectiveness Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the long term cost-effectiveness of the alternate diagnostic testing strategies, information from the trial will be used to update the economic model developed as part of the original CE-MARC trial. The model will use information from the trial, including on resource use, costs, HRQoL and other clinical outcomes (e.g. on unnecessary tests and MACE events), together with epidemiological, clinical and economic data from other sources to calculate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients. The economic analysis will use methods consistent with those recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Given the potential difference between diagnostic strategies in terms of mortality, the modelling will adopt a lifetime time horizon to capture any difference.</description>

        <title>Cost Effectiveness Analysis</title>
        <description>To assess the long term cost-effectiveness of the alternate diagnostic testing strategies, information from the trial will be used to update the economic model developed as part of the original CE-MARC trial. The model will use information from the trial, including on resource use, costs, HRQoL and other clinical outcomes (e.g. on unnecessary tests and MACE events), together with epidemiological, clinical and economic data from other sources to calculate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients. The economic analysis will use methods consistent with those recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Given the potential difference between diagnostic strategies in terms of mortality, the modelling will adopt a lifetime time horizon to capture any difference.</description>
