    <textblock>
      A study for women with ovarian cancer that has returned at least 6 months after
      platinum-based chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b is unblinded and will have a small number of participants that will take LY2228820
      plus gemcitabine and carboplatin to test the safety of the combination and determine a
      recommended dose for the Phase 2 portion.

      Phase 2 will be blinded and all study participants will receive carboplatin and gemcitabine.
      Participants of one group will receive LY2228820, and the other group will receive placebo.

      If the participant achieves at least stable disease, there is a maintenance phase following
      the first 6 cycles. The participant will take either LY2228820 or placebo. The participant
      will continue therapy until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria are
      fulfilled.

    <measure>Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 Dose of LY2228820 in Combination With Gemcitabine and Carboplatin (Maximum Tolerated Dose [MTD])</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (21 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>Recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2228820 that could be safely administered in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin based on defined dose limiting toxicities (DLT) assessment and MTD definition. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 33% of patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1 that does not exceed the single-agent MTD for LY2228820 (300 mg Q12H).</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS) in Participants Treated With LY2228820 Plus Gemcitabine and Carboplatin Versus Placebo Plus Gemcitabine and Carboplatin</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to Date of Disease Progression or Death from any cause (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as time from date of randomization to the date of investigator-determined objective progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Complete Response or Partial Response (Overall Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Disease Progression (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response Rate was estimated as the percentage of participants with best response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), based on RECIST version 1.1 divided by the total number of randomized participants. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least 30% disease in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Study Completion (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) instrument measures health related quality of life (HRQoL) in participants with ovarian cancer. The instrument is organized into sections of physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being and ovarian subscales with a 5-point rating scale in which 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; Data presented here are change from baseline at follow-up in the FACT-O Total Score. The total score is the sum of Physical Well Being (PWB) + Social Well-being (SWB) + Emotional Well Being (EWB) + Family Well-being (FWB) + Ovarian Cancer Subscale (OCS). The FACT-O Total score range 0 - 152 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <description>Recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2228820 that could be safely administered in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin based on defined dose limiting toxicities (DLT) assessment and MTD definition.

        <title>Phase 2: Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) instrument measures health related quality of life (HRQoL) in participants with ovarian cancer. The instrument is organized into sections of physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being and ovarian subscales with a 5-point rating scale in which 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; Data presented here are change from baseline at follow-up in the FACT-O Total Score. The total score is the sum of Physical Well Being (PWB) + Social Well-being (SWB) + Emotional Well Being (EWB) + Family Well-being (FWB) + Ovarian Cancer Subscale (OCS). The FACT-O Total score range 0 - 152 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
