  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is funded by the Moody Endowment. In this project, we will investigate the
      potential effect of skeletal muscle nitric oxide (NO) production on skeletal muscle
      anabolism, muscle strength, physical function, and body composition in older individuals.
      Further, we will determine whether augmentation of NO-mediated signaling reduces fatigue and
      fatigability.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators hypothesize that upregulation of skeletal muscle NO-cGMP mediated responses
      through phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition by sildenafil or tadalafil causes an acute
      anabolic response of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. NO is well-known to elicit
      vasodilation through stimulation of cGMP signaling, and NO-mediated changes in muscle
      perfusion may influence both skeletal muscle anabolism and perceptual fatigue. To measure
      skeletal muscle protein synthesis, we will infuse a stable isotope tracer of phenylalanine
      and measure its incorporation into skeletal muscle proteins following a dose of sildenafil,
      tadalafil, or placebo. The Investigators will also determine whether differences exist
      between men and women in response to PDE inhibition. As skeletal muscle NO-cGMP signaling has
      been implicated in fatigue responses, we will assess the acute effect of sildenafil and
      tadalafil on fatigue. Fatigue can be manifested both as a performance deficit at a local
      level (e.g., a reduced ability of skeletal muscle to produce power or force) as well as a
      subjective experience of lacking physical or mental energy. Accordingly, we will use more
      than one means (skeletal muscle performance, fatigue questionnaires, accelerometers) to study
      fatigue. The Investigators hypothesize that sildenafil or tadalafil will acutely reduce
      exercise-associated fatigability and skeletal muscle fatigue development

    <time_frame>after 4 weeks of placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic Fatigue Measure (knee extension) is measured on a Biodex System Pro 4 within a 75 degree range of motion. Subjects performed concentric contractions at a fixed speed of 120 degree/sec. 50 contractions were performed at 100% force, one contraction every second. Isokinetic fatigue will be measured at week 4 and week 8. Depending on grouping, the week 4 and week 8 measures may be placebo or active drug. Data will be reported as after 4 weeks of placebo or after 4 weeks of active drug. Data is presented as mean maximum force over all 50 kicks.</description>

    <measure>Exercised Induced Fatigability as Measured by Fatigue Rating Scale After 4 Weeks of Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>after 4 weeks of placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The fatigue rating scale is a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being no fatigue at all and 10 being the worst fatigue the subject can imagine. The subject is asked to rate their level of fatigue in their leg. This test was performed before and immedicately after the Biodex leg fatigue test after 4 weeks of placebo. Data is presented as change in scale from pre fatigue test to post fatigue test, with a higher score indicating a greater level of fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue symptoms will be measured using the 30-item Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form, a validated measure that yields one overall score of total fatigue calculated using five sub scales (general, physical, emotional, mental, vigor). With the exception of the vigor sub scale, higher scores indicate greater fatigue. Total fatigue score is calculated by summing the sub categories (general, physical, emotional and mental) and subtracting vigor. Total scores range from -24 to 96, with a higher score indicating more fatigue.</description>

        <title>Skeletal Muscle Fatigue as Measured by Biodex 4 Pro After 4 Weeks of Placebo</title>
        <description>Isokinetic Fatigue Measure (knee extension) is measured on a Biodex System Pro 4 within a 75 degree range of motion. Subjects performed concentric contractions at a fixed speed of 120 degree/sec. 50 contractions were performed at 100% force, one contraction every second. Isokinetic fatigue will be measured at week 4 and week 8. Depending on grouping, the week 4 and week 8 measures may be placebo or active drug. Data will be reported as after 4 weeks of placebo or after 4 weeks of active drug. Data is presented as mean maximum force over all 50 kicks.</description>

        <title>Exercised Induced Fatigability as Measured by Fatigue Rating Scale After 4 Weeks of Placebo</title>
        <description>The fatigue rating scale is a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being no fatigue at all and 10 being the worst fatigue the subject can imagine. The subject is asked to rate their level of fatigue in their leg. This test was performed before and immedicately after the Biodex leg fatigue test after 4 weeks of placebo. Data is presented as change in scale from pre fatigue test to post fatigue test, with a higher score indicating a greater level of fatigue.</description>

        <description>Peak isometric strength is measured on a Biodex System 4 Pro. This test is isolated to the quadricep muscle of one leg. Isometric test is performed at 90 degrees with 5 seconds of force production for each contraction and 15 seconds of rest. 1 set of 3 contractions at 100% force performed. Isometric strength was measured at week 4 and week 8. Depending on grouping, the week 4 and week 8 measures may be placebo or active drug. Data will be reported as after 4 weeks of placebo or after 4 weeks of active drug.</description>

        <title>Maximum Peak Isokinetic Leg Strength as Measured by Biodex Pro4 After 4 Weeks of Active Drug</title>
        <description>Isokinetic strength (knee extension) is measured on a Biodex System Pro 4 within a 75 degree range of motion. Subjects performed concentric contractions at a fixed speed of 120 degree/sec. 1 set of 3 contractions were performed at 100% force. Isokinetic strength will be measured at week 4 and week 8. Depending on grouping, the week 4 and week 8 measures may be placebo or active drug. Data will be reported as after 4 weeks of placebo or after 4 weeks of active drug.</description>

        <title>Walking Distance at 100% Effort as Measured by Walking Test After 4 Weeks of Placebo</title>
        <description>Walking performance will be assessed during 2 minutes of walking in long corridor hallways. Subjects will be asked to walk at 100% effort (as quickly as they can safely walk without running) for 2 minutes. Distance traveled for the 2 minutes will be recorded. The walking test will be completed at week 4 and week 8. Depending on grouping, the week 4 and week 8 measures may be placebo or active drug. Data will be reported as after 4 weeks of placebo or after 4 weeks of active drug.</description>

        <title>Perceptual Fatigue as Measured by Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form Total Score at Week 0</title>
        <description>Fatigue symptoms will be measured using the 30-item Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form, a validated measure that yields one overall score of total fatigue calculated using five sub scales (general, physical, emotional, mental, vigor). With the exception of the vigor sub scale, higher scores indicate greater fatigue. Total fatigue score is calculated by summing the sub categories (general, physical, emotional and mental) and subtracting vigor. Total scores range from -24 to 96, with a higher score indicating more fatigue.</description>

        <title>Perceptual Fatigue as Measured by Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>Fatigue symptoms will be measured using the 30-item Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form, a validated measure that yields one overall score of total fatigue calculated using five sub scales (general, physical, emotional, mental, vigor). With the exception of the vigor sub scale, higher scores indicate greater fatigue. Total fatigue score is calculated by summing the sub categories (general, physical, emotional and mental) and subtracting vigor. Total scores range from -24 to 96, with a higher score indicating more fatigue.</description>
