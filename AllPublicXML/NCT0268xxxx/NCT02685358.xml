  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an often severe and frequently disabling condition.
      It is associated with compromised health, early mortality, and substantial economic costs.
      PTSD is common in VA primary care patients; however, brief, effective treatments for PTSD are
      not available in the primary care setting. Instead, patients with PTSD are referred to mental
      health settings, yet many patients do not accept these referrals or do not adequately engage
      in such services. Thus, this project seeks to improve health care for Veterans by testing the
      effectiveness of a primary care-based treatment called clinician-supported PTSD Coach. In
      this treatment a primary care mental health clinician guides patients in using the PTSD Coach
      mobile app to learn about PTSD symptoms, treatment options, and strategies to cope with
      common PTSD-related concerns. If this treatment is found to be effective at reducing PTSD
      symptoms and increasing use of mental health care, it will provide a tremendous benefit to
      Veterans with PTSD seen in VA primary care.

      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an often severe and frequently disabling condition.
      It is associated with compromised health, early mortality, and substantial economic costs.
      PTSD is common in VA primary care patients; however, brief, effective treatments for PTSD are
      not available in the primary care setting. Instead, patients with PTSD are referred to mental
      health settings, yet many patients do not accept these referrals or do not adequately engage
      in such services. Thus, this project represents a unique opportunity to improve health care
      for Veterans by examining the effectiveness of a primary care-based treatment called
      Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach. In this treatment a primary care mental health clinician
      guides patients in using the PTSD Coach mobile app to learn about PTSD symptoms, treatment
      options, and strategies to cope with common PTSD-related concerns. This randomized clinical
      trial will enroll and treat 260 VA primary care patients (female and male) who have PTSD and
      are not currently being treated for it. Commonly used, well-established clinical interviews
      and self-report measures will be used to assess important clinical outcomes. If this direct
      treatment is found to be effective at reducing PTSD symptoms and increasing use of mental
      health care, it will provide a tremendous benefit to Veterans with PTSD seen in VA primary
      care.

    <intervention_model_description>Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach (CS PTSD Coach) consists of four 20-30 minute sessions focused on instructions for using the PTSD Coach app, setting symptom reductions goals, and assigning specific PTSD Coach activities (i.e., assessments, management strategies, psycho-educational readings) for completion between sessions. PC-MHI providers deliver CS PTSD Coach using a treatment manual, which was developed and piloted by the PIs. Session 1 will be face-to-face and sessions 2-4 may be face-to-face or by phone, depending on patient preference. To help participants overcome treatment barriers psycho-education about treatment options are provided and active problems solving is encouraged. Specific next steps for treatment or self-management are developed collaboratively, typically in session 4. After session 4, Participants are encouraged to continue using PTSD Coach and have access to the research version of the app until the 24-week follow-up.</intervention_model_description>
