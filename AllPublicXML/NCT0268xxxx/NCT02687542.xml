    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily OFF Time at Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10; Baseline was defined as the average daily OFF time (using 3 Hauser patient diary days) prior to Day -1 (study derived day and equalled to nominal visit day 0).</time_frame>
    <description>A paper Hauser diary was utilized to record motor state for half-hour intervals. Participants completed the diary by answering whether they had been OFF for 3 consecutive days in the week prior to each visit (except Day 28 visit), including 3 consecutive days during the week prior to Day 0 (Randomization).
The daily OFF time was calculated as the average of the 3 consecutive daily OFF hours from the Hauser diary at each visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily ON Time With Troublesome Dyskinesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 3, 5, 10 and 15; Baseline was defined as the average daily ON time with Troublesome Dyskinesia (using 3 Hauser patient diary Days) prior to Day -1 (study derived day and equalled to nominal visit Day 0).</time_frame>
    <description>A paper Hauser diary was utilized to record motor state for half hour intervals. The participants answered the Hauser diary on whether they had been ON with troublesome dyskinesia. A diary day started with the interval 24:00-0:30 through 23:30-24:00 on each chronological day for 3 consecutive days. On the days recording the home diary, participants made an entry every 30 minutes during their normal waking time and upon awakening from time asleep.
The daily ON hours was calculated as the average of the 3 consecutive daily ON hours from the Hauser diary at each visit.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 15; Baseline was defined as the Day -1 (study derived day and equalled to nominal visit Day 0) measurement</time_frame>
    <description>MDS-UPDRS Part III assessed the motor signs of Parkinson's disease and was administered by the investigator. It was comprised of 33 sub-scores based on 18 items, several with right, left or other body distribution scores. Each question was anchored with 5 responses that were linked to commonly accepted clinical terms: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. If more than 7 of the Part III items were missing, the score for that time point was missing, otherwise MDS-UPDRS Part III score was imputed as sum of the non-missing items*(total number of items)/ (number of items non-missing). The MDS-UPDRS Part III total score range is 0-132. Higher score indicated more severe motor signs of Parkinson's disease.
Results at Week 15 should be interpreted with caution given almost half the participants were not available for this analysis at Week 15 as compared to Week 10 and the complicated nature of protocol changes that impacted the study design after Week 10.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 0 (Baseline), 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 70, 77, 84, 91, 105 and 119</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was an interview based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS responses were mapped to the C-CASA. There were 3 key endpoints for suicidality data analysis and evaluation:
Suicidal Behavior: A participant was said to have suicidal behavior if the participant had experienced completed suicide / suicide attempt / reparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior.
Suicidal Ideation: Any observed suicidal ideation mapped to a single C-CASA category.
Suicidal Behavior or Ideation (participants with new onset suicidality): A participant was considered to have a new onset of suicidality if the participant reported no ideation and no behavior at the baseline assessment and reported any behavior or ideation post-baseline. Data observed at screening was not considered in the definition of worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease - Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 5, 10 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The QUIP-RS was a brief, patient reported outcome measure designed to assess the severity of symptoms of Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders (ICDs) and related behaviors reported to occur in Parkinson's disease.
The QUIP-RS assessed 7 disorders (Gambling, Sex, Buying, Eating, Hobbyism-punding [performing tasks and repeating activities] and Taking medications). If more than 5 items were missing, the total QUIP-RS score was set as missing; otherwise, the total QUIP-RS score was imputed as follows: sum of the non-missing item scores * (total number of items) / (number of items non-missing). The higher score indicated a greater level of the ICD.
The total QUIP-RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.</description>

    <measure>Total Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC-20) on Days 105 and 119, and Change From Day 105 to Day 119</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 105 and 119</time_frame>
    <description>The PWC-20 is a physician completed, 20 item reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation symptoms. The PWC-20 was collected after the completion of study treatment and also at the first visit of follow-up.
The total PWC-20 score was the sum of 20 item scores and ranged from 0 to 60. If more than 5 items were missing, the total PWC-20 score was missing; otherwise, the total PWC-20 score was imputed as follows: sum of the non-missing items * (total number of items) / (number of items non-missing). The higher score indicated more frequent/severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily OFF Time at Week 10</title>
        <description>A paper Hauser diary was utilized to record motor state for half-hour intervals. Participants completed the diary by answering whether they had been OFF for 3 consecutive days in the week prior to each visit (except Day 28 visit), including 3 consecutive days during the week prior to Day 0 (Randomization).
The daily OFF time was calculated as the average of the 3 consecutive daily OFF hours from the Hauser diary at each visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 10; Baseline was defined as the average daily OFF time (using 3 Hauser patient diary days) prior to Day -1 (study derived day and equalled to nominal visit day 0).</time_frame>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily ON Time With Troublesome Dyskinesia</title>
        <description>A paper Hauser diary was utilized to record motor state for half hour intervals. The participants answered the Hauser diary on whether they had been ON with troublesome dyskinesia. A diary day started with the interval 24:00-0:30 through 23:30-24:00 on each chronological day for 3 consecutive days. On the days recording the home diary, participants made an entry every 30 minutes during their normal waking time and upon awakening from time asleep.
The daily ON hours was calculated as the average of the 3 consecutive daily ON hours from the Hauser diary at each visit.
Results at Week 15 should be interpreted with caution given almost half the participants were not available for this analysis at Week 15 as compared to Week 10 and the complicated nature of protocol changes that impacted the study design after Week 10.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 3, 5, 10 and 15; Baseline was defined as the average daily ON time with Troublesome Dyskinesia (using 3 Hauser patient diary Days) prior to Day -1 (study derived day and equalled to nominal visit Day 0).</time_frame>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Daily ON Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia</title>
          <description>A paper Hauser diary was utilized to record motor state for half hour intervals. The participants answered the Hauser diary on whether they had been ON without troublesome dyskinesia. A diary day started with the interval 24:00-0:30 through 23:30-24:00 on each chronological day for 3 consecutive days. On the days recording the home diary, participants made an entry every 30 minutes during their normal waking time and upon awakening from time asleep.
The daily ON hours was calculated as the average of the 3 consecutive daily ON hours from the Hauser diary at each visit.
Results at Week 15 should be interpreted with caution given almost half the participants were not available for this analysis at Week 15 as compared to Week 10 and the complicated nature of protocol changes that impacted the study design after Week 10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III</title>
        <description>MDS-UPDRS Part III assessed the motor signs of Parkinson's disease and was administered by the investigator. It was comprised of 33 sub-scores based on 18 items, several with right, left or other body distribution scores. Each question was anchored with 5 responses that were linked to commonly accepted clinical terms: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. If more than 7 of the Part III items were missing, the score for that time point was missing, otherwise MDS-UPDRS Part III score was imputed as sum of the non-missing items*(total number of items)/ (number of items non-missing). The MDS-UPDRS Part III total score range is 0-132. Higher score indicated more severe motor signs of Parkinson's disease.

        <description>Each question of Part I,II or IV with 5 responses was linked to the same clinical terms as Part III.The score was missing if more than 7 items were missing for a time point; otherwise Part I,II or IV score was imputed as sum of non-missing items*(total number of items)/(number of items non-missing).•PartI (Non-Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living) assessed non-motor experiences of daily living using 13questions(Range:0-52).•PartII(Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living) assessed motor experiences of daily living using 13questions(Range:0-52).•PartIV(Motor Complications) assessed motor complications,dyskinesias, and motor fluctuations using historical and objective information with 6questions(Range:0-24).•MDS-UPDRS Total Score:the sum of Parts I,II,III,and IV(Range:0-260).Higher score indicated more severe motor signs of Parkinson's disease.Week15's results were interpreted cautiously given almost half participants were not available for the analysis as compared to Week10</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation Assessed Using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Post-baseline Visits</title>
        <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was an interview based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS responses were mapped to the C-CASA. There were 3 key endpoints for suicidality data analysis and evaluation:
Suicidal Behavior: A participant was said to have suicidal behavior if the participant had experienced completed suicide / suicide attempt / reparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior.
Suicidal Ideation: Any observed suicidal ideation mapped to a single C-CASA category.
Suicidal Behavior or Ideation (participants with new onset suicidality): A participant was considered to have a new onset of suicidality if the participant reported no ideation and no behavior at the baseline assessment and reported any behavior or ideation post-baseline. Data observed at screening was not considered in the definition of worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease - Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</title>
        <description>The QUIP-RS was a brief, patient reported outcome measure designed to assess the severity of symptoms of Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders (ICDs) and related behaviors reported to occur in Parkinson's disease.
The QUIP-RS assessed 7 disorders (Gambling, Sex, Buying, Eating, Hobbyism-punding [performing tasks and repeating activities] and Taking medications). If more than 5 items were missing, the total QUIP-RS score was set as missing; otherwise, the total QUIP-RS score was imputed as follows: sum of the non-missing item scores * (total number of items) / (number of items non-missing). The higher score indicated a greater level of the ICD.
The total QUIP-RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.</description>

        <title>Total Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC-20) on Days 105 and 119, and Change From Day 105 to Day 119</title>
        <description>The PWC-20 is a physician completed, 20 item reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation symptoms. The PWC-20 was collected after the completion of study treatment and also at the first visit of follow-up.
The total PWC-20 score was the sum of 20 item scores and ranged from 0 to 60. If more than 5 items were missing, the total PWC-20 score was missing; otherwise, the total PWC-20 score was imputed as follows: sum of the non-missing items * (total number of items) / (number of items non-missing). The higher score indicated more frequent/severe symptoms.</description>
