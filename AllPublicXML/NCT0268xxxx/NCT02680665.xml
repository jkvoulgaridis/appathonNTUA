    <time_frame>38 days at maximum</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to AMEPAROMO capsules in a participant who received AMEPAROMO capsules. A serious ADR was an ADR resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to AMEPAROMO capsules was assessed by the physician.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Cyst Negative</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days + 3 months at maximum</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of cyst negative, which was defined as the percentage of participants with negative results in the examination of cysts after AMEPAROMO capsules up to 3 months after the completion of observation period or discontinuation of treatment, was presented along with its 2-sided 95% CI. The results of the examination of cysts were assessed as &quot;negative &quot;, &quot;positive&quot;, or &quot;indeterminate&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Clinical Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days at maximum</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved clinical effectiveness over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with its 2-sided 95% CI. Clinical response of AMEPAROMO capsules was assessed as &quot;effective&quot;, &quot;not effective&quot;, or &quot;indeterminate&quot; by the physician based on the clinical course at the end of the observation period or at the time of treatment discontinuation.</description>
