  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have confirmed that IV dexamethasone prolongs brachial plexus blocks.
      However, these studies only used fixed doses of IV dexamethasone at relatively high doses,
      which could potentially lead to increased glucose levels, delayed wound healing, and
      unintended side effects. There remains a paucity of research on the effective dose range of
      IV dexamethasone for the prolongation of supraclavicular blocks. The optimal dosage of IV
      dexamethasone for prolongation of analgesia vs. motor block prolongation from supraclavicular
      blocks in shoulder surgery has yet to be delineated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have confirmed that perineural dexamethasone prolongs bupivacaine and
      ropivacaine brachial plexus blocks by approximately 10 hours (from approx. 12 to 22 hours)
      without clinical evidence of toxicity. However, perineural toxicity in an animal model has
      raised concern about its use as a peripheral nerve block adjuvant. Moreover, recent studies
      suggest that high dose IV dexamethasone (810mg) prolongs analgesia to a similar degree as
      perineural dexamethasone for interscalene, supraclavicular and sciatic nerve blocks performed
      with ropivacaine and bupivacaine. However these studies only utilized fixed, high level doses
      of IV dexamethasone. Moreover, there remains a concern that high dose IV dexamethasone may
      lead to postoperative hyperglycemia and could possibly increase the risk of postoperative
      wound infection.68 Open surgery under general anesthesia has been shown to increase blood
      glucose levels with a peak at approximately 2 hours post-induction and results have been
      conflicting regarding whether or not IV dexamethasone causes greater increase910.

      To our knowledge, it is not yet known if arthroscopic surgery under regional anesthesia
      triggers a similar increase in blood glucose levels and if this is impacted by administration
      of IV dexamethasone. Our study aims to identify the duration of supraclavicular block
      prolongation that can be expected over a range of doses of IV dexamethasone. We also seek to
      identify what association, if any, is noted between IV de and changes in blood glucose levels
      after shoulder surgery with regional anesthesia and sedation. Finally, we will collect data
      on side effects and postoperative complications, if any, in patients receiving a range of
      doses of IV dexamethasone.
