    <textblock>
      This phase IIB trial studies how well enzalutamide and paclitaxel before surgery works in
      treating patients with stage I-III androgen receptor-positive triple-negative breast cancer.
      Androgens can cause the growth of triple-negative breast cancer. Anti-hormone therapy, such
      as enzalutamide, prevent androgen from binding to the androgen receptor, thereby decreasing
      cell growth and causing tumor cell death. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving enzalutamide and
      paclitaxel before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed. This treatment study is part of the MD Anderson Moonshot
      initiative.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden-index
      (RCB-I) rates of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were non-responders
      to initial anthracycline and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and who were treated with
      enzalutamide in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) distribution of androgen receptor
      (AR)-positive TNBC patients who were nonresponders to initial anthracycline and
      cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, treated with enzalutamide in combination with weekly
      paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.

      II. To determine the safety of administering enzalutamide in combination with weekly
      paclitaxel.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the association between biomarkers in the peripheral blood and tumor tissue
      with safety and efficacy for TNBC patients who were treated with enzalutamide and treatment
      in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.

      II. To investigate the correlation between circulating tumor cells (CTC) characteristics
      and/or gene profiles and treatment response of enzalutamide and taxane.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) daily on days 1-7 and paclitaxel intravenously (IV)
      over 2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat every 7 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: After 12 cycles of therapy, patients undergo surgical resection of primary tumor
      with or without lymph node biopsy or complete axillary dissection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days after surgery.
