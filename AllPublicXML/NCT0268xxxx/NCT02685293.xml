    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, chronic-dosing (7
      days), two-period, two-treatment, cross-over study to evaluate the treatment effect of PT003
      compared with that of Placebo MDI on Cardiovascular Hemodynamics following chronic-dosing (7
      days) in subjects with moderate to severe COPD.
