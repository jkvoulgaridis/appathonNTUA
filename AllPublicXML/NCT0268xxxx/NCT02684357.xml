  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo and active comparator controlled,
      parallel design study that is being performed to assess the safety and efficacy of
      risankizumab (BI 655066) to support registration for the treatment of moderate to severe
      chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients.

    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized to receive either placebo, ustekinumab, or risankizumab in Part
      A. All participants received 2 sets of injections to maintain the blind: the placebo arm
      received placebo for risankizumab and placebo for ustekinumab), the risankizumab arm received
      risankizumab and placebo for ustekinumab, and the ustekinumab arm received ustekinumab and
      placebo for risankizumab. Participants who received placebo in Part A switched to
      risankizumab in Part B; participants who received ustekinumab or risankizumab in Part A
      continued to receive the same treatment (ustekinumab or risankizumab) in Part B.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI90) at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear or Almost Clear at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear (1) = mean &gt;0, &lt;1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, &lt;2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, &lt;3.5; and Severe (4) = mean ≥3.5.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

          -  Patients with:

               1. non-plaque forms of psoriasis (including guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular),

               2. current drug-induced psoriasis (including an exacerbation of psoriasis from beta
                  blockers, calcium channel blockers, or lithium),

               3. active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis
                  that might confound trial evaluations according to investigator's judgment,

          -  Previous exposure to BI 655066,

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational study or less than 30 days (from
             screening) since completing another investigational study (participation in
             observational studies is permitted),

          -  Previous exposure to ustekinumab (Stelara®),

          -  Use of any restricted medication, or any drug considered likely to interfere with the
             safe conduct of the study,

          -  Major surgery performed within 12 weeks prior to randomization or planned within 12
             months after screening (e.g., hip replacement, aneurysm removal, stomach ligation),

          -  Known chronic or relevant acute infections including active tuberculosis, HIV or viral
             hepatitis; QuantiFERON® tuberculosis (TB) test or purified protein derivative (PPD)
             skin test will be performed according to local labelling for comparator products. If
             the result is positive, patients may participate in the study if further work up
             (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has
             no evidence of active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established,
             then treatment should have been initiated and maintained according to local country
             guidelines,

          -  Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years
             prior to screening, except appropriately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin or in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix,

          -  Evidence of a current or previous disease, medical condition (including chronic
             alcohol or drug abuse) other than psoriasis, surgical procedure (i.e., organ
             transplant), medical examination finding (including vital signs and electrocardiogram
             [ECG]), or laboratory value at the screening visit outside the reference range that is
             in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically significant and would make the study
             participant unreliable to adhere to the protocol or to complete the trial, compromise
             the safety of the patient, or compromise the quality of the data,

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered biologic agent or
             its excipients,

          -  Women who is pregnant, nursing, or who plans to become pregnant while in the trial,

          -  Previous enrolment in this trial.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI90) at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI100 is defined as a 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</title>
        <description>DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a DLQI Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Ustekinumab (Part A)</title>
        <description>DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI75 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI75 at Week 52 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Ustekinumab (Part B)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>
