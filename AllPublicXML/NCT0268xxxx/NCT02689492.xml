  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will explore the patients satisfaction to COPD medical treatment (i.e.
      pharmacological and not pharmacological treatment) in a clinical real-world setting and how
      the satisfaction for medical treatment is related to clinical parameters, quality of life,
      illness perception and treatment adherence evolution.

      Moreover health care resource consumption will be observed during the observation period.

    <measure>The Patients' Satisfaction With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Medical Treatments During a 12-month Observation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment visit, 6-month follow-up visit and 12-month follow-up visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's self-reported satisfaction or dissatisfaction with pharmacological treatments was measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version 1.4, a validated instrument. The TSQM has total 9 items (TSMQ-9) with responses to nearly all items rated on a 5-point or 7-point rating scale that provide scores on 3 scales: effectiveness (items #1 #2 #3), convenience (items #4 #5 #6) and global satisfaction (items #7 #8 #9).
The TSQM-9 domain scores were calculated as recommended by the instrument authors. (i) Effectiveness = [(item1 + item2 + item3) - 3]/18*100, (ii) Convenience = [(item4 + item5 + item6) - 3]/18*100 and (iii) Global satisfaction = [(item7 + item8 + item9) - 3]/14*100.
Each domain score can be calculated only if all the three items considered in the calculation of that score are not missing. The TSQM-9 domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain.</description>

    <measure>Measurements of Patient Disease Perception, Adherence to COPD Treatment, Health Status and Dyspnea Over 12-months Observation Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment visit, 6-month follow-up visit and 12-month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's disease perception was evaluated by Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) consist 8 questionnaires rated 1 - 10 response scale. Mean total score ranges from 8-80, where a greater score indicated a more threatening view of COPD.
Adherence was measured using Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, 4 items (MMAS-4) questionnaire which consists of 4 questions. Items are summed to give an adherence score ranging from 0 to 4, where a higher score indicated a greater adherence grade.
Patients' health status was measured using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaire that consists of 8-items in which patients can choose a score from 0 to 5. The total score ranges from 0 to 40, where a higher score indicated a worst impact of symptoms on the patient's daily activities.
Dyspnea was measured using Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MMRC) with a 0-to-4 grading system. It had 0-to-4 grading system, with higher score indicating a higher level of dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>The Relationship Between Treatment Satisfaction - Effectiveness Domain and Demographics, Clinical Parameters and Patient Reported Outcome (PROs) During a 12-month Observation Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A regression model was estimated, where the dependent variable was the effectiveness domain score and the independent variables were: age and gender (at enrollment), number of exacerbations, relevant spirometry parameters (Forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) % of the predicted), level of dyspnea (MMRC score classes: 0-4), impact of COPD on a patient's life (CAT total score: 0-40) and treatment adherence (MMAS-4 score classes: 0-4) collected during observational period. Because dependent variable was collected at each study visit, repeated measures model was estimated taking into account all available values for dependent and independent variables.
Mean is actually estimate of beta values. Visit 1 is at enrollment, visit 2 is at 6 months and visit 3 is at 12 months.</description>

    <measure>The Health Care Resources Utilization According to the Italian National Health Service (INHS) During a 12-month Observation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health care resources consumption related to COPD, COPD exacerbations and COPD-drug-related adverse events was computed during observational period in terms of number of (inward and day-hospital) hospitalizations, number of emergency room accesses, number of General Practitioner (GP) visits, specialist visits and laboratory tests or examinations.
Hospitalization (Number Analyzed) - Number of hospitalizations not in ICU during observation period per patient, Emergency room accesses (Number Analyzed) - Number of Emergency room accesses during observation period per patient, Specialist Outpatient Visits (Number Analyzed) - Number of specialist outpatient visits per patient during observation period, GP Visits (Number Analyzed) - Number of general practitioner visits per patient during observation period, Laboratory Tests (Number Analyzed) - Number of tests per patient during observation period.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a multi-center, non-interventional (observational), prospective cohort study based mainly on newly-collected data for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. No treatments were administered to the patients on the protocol basis, since this was a non-interventional study. The total number of enrolled patients was 401.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Patients attended specialist sites to ensure that all patients met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were not to be entered to trial if any one of the specific entry criteria were not met.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Patients' Satisfaction With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Medical Treatments During a 12-month Observation Period</title>
        <description>Patient's self-reported satisfaction or dissatisfaction with pharmacological treatments was measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version 1.4, a validated instrument. The TSQM has total 9 items (TSMQ-9) with responses to nearly all items rated on a 5-point or 7-point rating scale that provide scores on 3 scales: effectiveness (items #1 #2 #3), convenience (items #4 #5 #6) and global satisfaction (items #7 #8 #9).
The TSQM-9 domain scores were calculated as recommended by the instrument authors. (i) Effectiveness = [(item1 + item2 + item3) - 3]/18*100, (ii) Convenience = [(item4 + item5 + item6) - 3]/18*100 and (iii) Global satisfaction = [(item7 + item8 + item9) - 3]/14*100.
Each domain score can be calculated only if all the three items considered in the calculation of that score are not missing. The TSQM-9 domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain.</description>

        <title>The Relationship Between Treatment Satisfaction - Effectiveness Domain and Demographics, Clinical Parameters and Patient Reported Outcome (PROs) During a 12-month Observation Period.</title>
        <description>A regression model was estimated, where the dependent variable was the effectiveness domain score and the independent variables were: age and gender (at enrollment), number of exacerbations, relevant spirometry parameters (Forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) % of the predicted), level of dyspnea (MMRC score classes: 0-4), impact of COPD on a patient's life (CAT total score: 0-40) and treatment adherence (MMAS-4 score classes: 0-4) collected during observational period. Because dependent variable was collected at each study visit, repeated measures model was estimated taking into account all available values for dependent and independent variables.
Mean is actually estimate of beta values. Visit 1 is at enrollment, visit 2 is at 6 months and visit 3 is at 12 months.</description>

        <title>The Relationship Between Treatment Satisfaction - Global Satisfaction Domain and Demographics, Clinical Parameters and Patient Reported Outcome (PROs) During a 12-month Observation Period.</title>
        <description>A regression model was estimated, where the dependent variable was the global satisfaction domain score and the independent variables were: age and gender (at enrollment), number of exacerbations, relevant spirometry parameters (Forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) % of the predicted), level of dyspnea (MMRC score classes: 0-4), impact of COPD on a patient's life (CAT total score: 0-40) and treatment adherence (MMAS-4 score classes: 0-4) collected during observational period. Because dependent variable was collected at each study visit, repeated measures model was estimated taking into account all available values for dependent and independent variables.
Mean is actually estimate of beta values.Visit 1 is at enrollment, visit 2 is at 6 months and visit 3 is at 12 months.</description>
