    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dasatinib and venetoclax work in treating patients with
      Philadelphia chromosome positive or BCR-ABL1 positive early chronic phase chronic myelogenous
      leukemia. Dasatinib and venetoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with previously-untreated chronic phase chronic
      myeloid leukemia (CML) who achieve major molecular response by 12 months of treatment with
      dasatinib 50 mg orally daily (first 70 patients) and of dasatinib 50 mg daily in combination
      with venetoclax 200 mg daily starting after 3 months of dasatinib therapy (after protocol
      amendment).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 12 months molecular response (MR)4.5 rate and the cumulative overall rate
      of MR4.5 (BCR-ABL transcripts [IS] =&lt; 0.01%).

      II. To estimate the proportion of patients with MR4.5 at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-months of
      therapy.

      III. To estimate the proportion of patients with sustained MR4.5 of 3 years and more.

      IV. To estimate the treatment-free remission rate, time to progression, and overall survival.

      V. To assess the safety of this combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 15 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 months of dasatinib treatment, patients also
      receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-14 of each month for 3 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity (patients enrolled prior to 4/1/2018 receive only
      dasatinib).
