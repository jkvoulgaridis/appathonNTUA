  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare acute tear production produced by the Oculeve
      Intranasal Lacrimal Neurostimulator with two control devices in participants with aqueous
      tear deficiency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial in
      which participants with aqueous tear deficiency will receive three different device
      applications in a randomized sequence.

    <measure>Acute Stimulated Tear Production</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 post-application</time_frame>
    <description>Stimulated acute tear production in the study eye at Day 0 as measured by the difference between the Schirmer test score during stimulation and the test score before stimulation (basal). The Schirmer strip is placed just under the eyelid and wicks up the tears. It measures tear production on a linear scale of 0-35 mm. The study eye was defined as the eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by the cotton swab at Visit 1/Screening or, if there was no difference in stimulated tear production, the eye with the lower basal Schirmer score at Visit 2/Day 0 was selected. If there was no difference for either measure, the right eye was used as the study eye.</description>

          <description>Stimulated acute tear production in the study eye at Day 0 as measured by the difference between the Schirmer test score during stimulation and the test score before stimulation (basal). The Schirmer strip is placed just under the eyelid and wicks up the tears. It measures tear production on a linear scale of 0-35 mm. The study eye was defined as the eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by the cotton swab at Visit 1/Screening or, if there was no difference in stimulated tear production, the eye with the lower basal Schirmer score at Visit 2/Day 0 was selected. If there was no difference for either measure, the right eye was used as the study eye.</description>
