  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study employs a modified continual reassessment method (mCRM) design to estimate the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PF-05230907, defined as a target toxicity rate of 15% based
      on treatment emergent thromboembolic and/or ischemic events (TIEs). The mCRM design utilizes
      Bayesian methodology to continuously learn the dose-toxicity relationship, which is
      characterized by a parametric model.

      Subjects with a diagnosis of ICH (determined by computed tomography) will be enrolled in
      cohorts of 3. The total length of time planned for study participation is approximately 3
      months; 6.0 hours for screening, a single dose administration with a 4-day minimum hospital
      confinement period and follow-up visits through Day 91.

      Severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be graded according
      to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      version 4.03. All subjects who receive PF-05230907 are evaluable for TIEs. The determination
      of MTD using mCRM modeling will be based on TIEs which occur through 7 days post-dose (Day
      8).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Thromboembolic and/or Ischemic Events (TIEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through day of discharge (Day 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Thromboembolic and/or ischemic events (TIEs) were defined as any of the following events: disseminated intravascular coagulation (Grade [Gr]&gt;=3); acute coronary syndrome (Gr &gt;=3); cardiac arrest (Gr &gt;=4); myocardial infarction (Gr &gt;=3); Cardiac troponin I increased (Gr 3); ischemia cerebrovascular (Gr &gt;=1 and associated with lesion[s]); portal vein thrombosis (Gr &gt;=2); ischemic stroke (Gr &gt;=1 and associated with lesion[s]); transient ischemic attacks (Gr 2); purpura (Gr &gt;=2); superior vena cava syndrome (Gr &gt;=1); thromboembolic event (Gr &gt;=2); visceral arterial ischemia (Gr &gt;=2); peripheral arterial ischemia (Gr &gt;=3). TIEs were graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. For the respective event to count as a treatment-emergent TIE, onset or worsening of the event must have occurred following treatment with PF-05230907 and during the interval between Day 1 dosing through Day 8.</description>

    <description>Laboratory safety parameters included hematology, blood chemistry, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), fibrinogen, antithrombin III (ATIII), Protein S level, Protein C activity, cardiac troponin I, D-dimer, and urinalysis. The number of participants with laboratory test abnormalities meeting specified criteria without regard to baseline abnormality was assessed. Any abnormalities occurring after the administration of treatment and increasing in severity from baseline value were counted as treatment-emergent.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Physical Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose), Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8/discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Comprehensive and targeted physical examinations included general appearance, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), skin, heart (auscultation), lungs (auscultation), abdomen (palpitation and auscultation), and extremities with attention to swelling, general or localized tenderness, entire leg or calf swelling, edema, and collateral superficial veins. The results of the comprehensive and targeted physical examinations were combined to evaluate the changes from baseline through Day 8 (or discharge) for each site parameter according to the categories: positive change (abnormal to normal); no change (normal to normal or abnormal to abnormal); negative change (normal to abnormal). Parameters with at least 1 participant meeting the positive/negative change from baseline criteria are presented here.</description>

        <description>Thromboembolic and/or ischemic events (TIEs) were defined as any of the following events: disseminated intravascular coagulation (Grade [Gr]&gt;=3); acute coronary syndrome (Gr &gt;=3); cardiac arrest (Gr &gt;=4); myocardial infarction (Gr &gt;=3); Cardiac troponin I increased (Gr 3); ischemia cerebrovascular (Gr &gt;=1 and associated with lesion[s]); portal vein thrombosis (Gr &gt;=2); ischemic stroke (Gr &gt;=1 and associated with lesion[s]); transient ischemic attacks (Gr 2); purpura (Gr &gt;=2); superior vena cava syndrome (Gr &gt;=1); thromboembolic event (Gr &gt;=2); visceral arterial ischemia (Gr &gt;=2); peripheral arterial ischemia (Gr &gt;=3). TIEs were graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. For the respective event to count as a treatment-emergent TIE, onset or worsening of the event must have occurred following treatment with PF-05230907 and during the interval between Day 1 dosing through Day 8.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Physical Examination</title>
        <description>Comprehensive and targeted physical examinations included general appearance, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), skin, heart (auscultation), lungs (auscultation), abdomen (palpitation and auscultation), and extremities with attention to swelling, general or localized tenderness, entire leg or calf swelling, edema, and collateral superficial veins. The results of the comprehensive and targeted physical examinations were combined to evaluate the changes from baseline through Day 8 (or discharge) for each site parameter according to the categories: positive change (abnormal to normal); no change (normal to normal or abnormal to abnormal); negative change (normal to abnormal). Parameters with at least 1 participant meeting the positive/negative change from baseline criteria are presented here.</description>

        <description>The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. The total NIHSS score range is from 0 (normal) to 42 (severe impairment), with higher values indicating greater level of neurological impairment.</description>
