  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing amount of evidence which suggests that miscarriage is related to a
      primary endometrial problem. Recent cochrane meta-analysis (March 2015) has proven that
      endometrial scratch improves live birth in women who underwent IVF.

      The aim of the study is to find out if scratch of the endometrium prevents recurrent
      miscarriage.

      The Warwick BRU-RH (Biomedical Research Unit- Reproductive Health) hypothesis is that failed
      pregnancies are the result of failed decidualisation of the endometrium.
