  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease. Maintaining optimum quality of life
      is a major goal of care. There is a strong body of evidence that exercise can reduce or
      manage fatigue, depression and insomnia in breast cancer patients; however, the evidence base
      is overwhelmingly in early stage cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to see if a
      home-based, self-directed walking program can have similar benefits in women with an MBC
      diagnosis. The primary objective is to evaluate whether engagement in physical activity will
      reduce fatigue during active treatment for MBC (baseline to 3 months); this is the primary
      endpoint. Secondary objectives pertain to feasibility of recruitment and retention of study
      participants and measuring changes between baseline, 3 months and 6 months in additional
      quality of life measures. Exploratory analyses pertain to changes in p16INK4a levels and
      sarcopenia between baseline and 3 months. The design is a single arm intervention trial in 30
      patients. Findings from this study will provide preliminary data for a grant application to
      test the physical activity intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a large
      sample of women with metastatic breast cancer.
