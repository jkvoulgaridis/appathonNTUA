    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase IIa, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group
      study with the primary objective to assess the efficacy potential of GSK3196165 on pain, in
      subjects with active inflammatory hand osteoarthritis (HOA).

      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled into the study, following a screening period of up
      to 4 weeks. The total treatment period will be 12 weeks, with the follow up period completing
      at Week 22. At least 40 subjects will be randomized across the two treatment arms, to either
      placebo or GSK3196165 in a 1:1 ratio.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 24-hour Average Hand Pain Intensity, Averaged Over the 7 Days Prior to Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 Pre-dose) and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were required to complete a daily pain NRS based on their 24-hour average hand pain intensity with the anchors &quot;0&quot; (no pain) and &quot;10&quot; (worst imaginable pain), which was averaged over the 7 days prior to assessment visit. The 7 day average score was calculated as sum of daily 24 hours average hand pain NRS scores in the 7 days prior to assessment visit, divided by number of entries recorded in those 7 days. Baseline visit was at Day 1 and Baseline value was defined as the average of the 7 days prior to baseline visit (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Intent-To-Treat Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (GSK3196165 or placebo).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) 3.1 NRS Scores at Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 Pre-dose), Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AUSCAN Index is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of a 15-item scale which measures pain (5 items), stiffness (1 item) and degree of disability/physical function (9 items) during the preceding 48 hours. All items are rated on NRS scale with anchors &quot;0&quot; (none) to &quot;10&quot; (extreme). The scores for the pain and physical function components were calculated as simple summation of the item scores relating to that domain, so the Pain component ranges from 0 (i.e. all pain item scores are scored 0 [none]) to 50 (i.e. all pain item scores are scored 10 [extreme]), and the Physical Function component ranges from 0 (i.e. all physical function item scores are scored 0 [none]) to 90 (i.e. all physical function item scores are scored 10 [extreme]). The total AUSCAN score was calculated as simple summation of the 15 item scores and therefore ranges from 0 to 150. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Soft Tissue Swollen Hand Joints at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 Pre-dose), Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Swollen Hand Joint Count was measured by the total number of soft tissue swollen hand joints out of a possible 30 joints: 8 distal interphalangeal, 8 proximal interphalangeal, 2 interphalangeal joints, 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, 2 carpometacarpal joint across both hands. In case of missing observations for soft tissue swollen hand joints then the remaining observations were assessed and weighted by dividing the number presented by the number of non-missing, and by multiplying by 30 for the joint count. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

A joint was considered tender if it was scored &gt;0 on the tender joint severity scale. Joints were rated 0=no pain/tenderness, 1=mild pain, 2=moderate pain and 3=severe pain. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 24-hour Average Hand Pain Intensity, Averaged Over the 7 Days Prior to Week 6</title>
        <description>Participants were required to complete a daily pain NRS based on their 24-hour average hand pain intensity with the anchors &quot;0&quot; (no pain) and &quot;10&quot; (worst imaginable pain), which was averaged over the 7 days prior to assessment visit. The 7 day average score was calculated as sum of daily 24 hours average hand pain NRS scores in the 7 days prior to assessment visit, divided by number of entries recorded in those 7 days. Baseline visit was at Day 1 and Baseline value was defined as the average of the 7 days prior to baseline visit (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Intent-To-Treat Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (GSK3196165 or placebo).</description>

          <description>Participants were required to complete a daily pain NRS based on their 24-hour average hand pain intensity with the anchors &quot;0&quot; (no pain) and &quot;10&quot; (worst imaginable pain), which was averaged over the 7 days prior to assessment visit. The 7 day average score is calculated by sum of daily 24 hours average hand pain NRS scores in the 7 days prior to assessment visit, divided by number of entries recorded in those 7 days. Baseline visit was at Day 1 and Baseline value was defined as the average of the 7 days prior to baseline visit (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of Worst Hand Pain Intensity Over 24 Hours Averaged Over the 7 Days Prior to Each Visit</title>
        <description>Participants were required to complete a daily pain NRS based on their 24-hour worst hand pain intensity with the anchors &quot;0&quot; (no pain) and &quot;10&quot; (worst imaginable pain), which was averaged over the 7 days prior to assessment visit. The score is calculated as sum of daily 24 hours worst hand pain NRS scores in the 7 days prior to assessment visit, divided by number of entries recorded in those 7 days. Baseline visit was at Day 1 and Baseline value was defined as the average of the 7 days prior to baseline visit (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) 3.1 NRS Scores at Each Visit.</title>
        <description>The AUSCAN Index is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of a 15-item scale which measures pain (5 items), stiffness (1 item) and degree of disability/physical function (9 items) during the preceding 48 hours. All items are rated on NRS scale with anchors &quot;0&quot; (none) to &quot;10&quot; (extreme). The scores for the pain and physical function components were calculated as simple summation of the item scores relating to that domain, so the Pain component ranges from 0 (i.e. all pain item scores are scored 0 [none]) to 50 (i.e. all pain item scores are scored 10 [extreme]), and the Physical Function component ranges from 0 (i.e. all physical function item scores are scored 0 [none]) to 90 (i.e. all physical function item scores are scored 10 [extreme]). The total AUSCAN score was calculated as simple summation of the 15 item scores and therefore ranges from 0 to 150. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) 3.1 NRS Scores at Each Visit.</title>
          <description>The AUSCAN Index is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of a 15-item scale which measures pain (5 items), stiffness (1 item) and degree of disability/physical function (9 items) during the preceding 48 hours. All items are rated on NRS scale with anchors &quot;0&quot; (none) to &quot;10&quot; (extreme). The scores for the pain and physical function components were calculated as simple summation of the item scores relating to that domain, so the Pain component ranges from 0 (i.e. all pain item scores are scored 0 [none]) to 50 (i.e. all pain item scores are scored 10 [extreme]), and the Physical Function component ranges from 0 (i.e. all physical function item scores are scored 0 [none]) to 90 (i.e. all physical function item scores are scored 10 [extreme]). The total AUSCAN score was calculated as simple summation of the 15 item scores and therefore ranges from 0 to 150. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Soft Tissue Swollen Hand Joints at Each Visit</title>
        <description>Swollen Hand Joint Count was measured by the total number of soft tissue swollen hand joints out of a possible 30 joints: 8 distal interphalangeal, 8 proximal interphalangeal, 2 interphalangeal joints, 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, 2 carpometacarpal joint across both hands. In case of missing observations for soft tissue swollen hand joints then the remaining observations were assessed and weighted by dividing the number presented by the number of non-missing, and by multiplying by 30 for the joint count. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Tender Hand Joints at Each Visit</title>
        <description>Tender Hand Joint Count was measured by the total number of tender joints out of a possible 30 joints: 8 distal interphalangeal, 8 proximal interphalangeal, 2 interphalangeal joints, 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, 2 carpometacarpal joints across both hands. A joint was considered tender if it was scored &gt;0 on the tender joint severity scale. Joints were rated 0=no pain/tenderness, 1=mild pain, 2=moderate pain and 3=severe pain. Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose value. Change from Baseline is equal to post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment or events associated with liver injury and impaired liver function were categorized as SAE. All participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (GSK3196165 or placebo) were included in Safety Population.</description>
