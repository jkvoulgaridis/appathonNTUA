  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in the treatment of
      participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either pembrolizumab or brentuximab vedotin (BV) for up to 35
      three-week cycles of treatment.

      The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs
      Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in participants with relapsed or
      refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma compared to treatment with BV.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has relapsed (disease progression after most recent therapy) or refractory (failure to
             achieve Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR] to most recent therapy)
             classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.

          -  Has responded (achieved a CR or PR) to BV or BV-containing regimens, if previously
             treated with BV.

          -  Has measurable disease defined as ≥1 lesion that can be accurately measured in ≥2
             dimensions with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan or combined CT/positron emission
             tomography (PET) scan. Minimum measurement must be &gt;15 mm in the longest diameter or
             &gt;10 mm in the short axis.

          -  Is able to provide an evaluable core or excisional lymph node biopsy for biomarker
             analysis from an archival (&gt;60 days) or newly obtained (within 60 days) biopsy at
             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

          -  Has adequate organ function

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate
             method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days (for participants
             receiving pembrolizumab) or 180 days (for participants receiving BV) after the last
             dose of study drug.

          -  Male participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method
             of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days (for
             participants receiving pembrolizumab) or 180 days (for participants receiving BV)
             after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients in BV or

             within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunosuppression or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
