               2. Group B: Subjects with relapsed or refractory AML, Subjects with relapsed or
                  refractory high-risk MDS, defined as revised International Prognostic Scoring
                  System (IPSS-R) intermediate or greater disease.

          2. Age ≥18 years.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.

          4. Life expectancy ≥3 months in the judgment of the investigator.

          5. Adequate organ function.

          6. Group A subjects must have measurable or evaluable disease per the appropriate disease
             criteria.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             Screening and must agree to use an effective form of contraception from the time of
             the negative pregnancy test up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug.
             Effective forms of contraception include abstinence, hormonal contraceptive in
             conjunction with a barrier method, or a double barrier method. Women of
             non-child-bearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or
             have been postmenopausal for ≥1 year.

             alopecia is allowed).

         10. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent prior to any study‑related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.

             narrow therapeutic range taken within 14 days or 5 drug half-lives before start of
             study drug.

         13. Active secondary malignancy
