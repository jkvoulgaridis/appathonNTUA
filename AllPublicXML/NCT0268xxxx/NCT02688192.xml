  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies a mobile health fitness program for adolescent and young adult
      childhood cancer survivors. Adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors are at risk
      to have negative late effects from treatment and to develop chronic health conditions. A
      sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and early
      mortality. Physical activity reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease and early mortality,
      improves cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, bone health, and body composition, and
      it is also positively associated with quality of life. Programs and technologies that promote
      physical activity are important because health behaviors adopted by adolescent and young
      adult childhood cancer survivors are likely to continue into adulthood. A mobile health
      fitness application may motivate adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors to
      engage and maintain physical activity.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of the technology-enhanced (electronic accelerometer + app + 8
      weekly group sessions) fitness program in a pilot randomized clinical trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of the technology-enhanced fitness program on participants'
      cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness.

      II. Examine the effects of the program on secondary outcomes of health related quality of
      life (HRQOL) and fatigue.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (Intervention): Participants attend 8 group meetings weekly, wear an electronic
      accelerometer, engage in private social support messaging within the app and Facebook private
      groups, and then use the mobile app for 4 weeks without in-person groups.

      ARM II (WAITLIST CONTROL [WLC]): After the 6 month assessment, participants receive the
      FitSurvivor intervention as in arm I.

    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated by the number of participants who enroll and complete baseline assessment for the randomized trial. In total, 354 participants were mailed letters; 68 were contacted/screened, of which 56 were eligible and 49 enrolled (88% of those screened eligible, 14% of total potentially eligible pool).</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Measured Using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue measured using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. The PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale yields three subscales: general, sleep/rest, and cognitive fatigue. Scores are transformed on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Measured Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is a well-validated measure of HRQOL with physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning domains. The PedsQL Generic Core yields two summary scores - Physical Summary and Psychosocial Summary. Scores are transformed on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cardiorespiratory Fitness Measured Using Submaximal Treadmill Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via submaximal treadmill testing using a modified Bruce protocol. This standardized graded treadmill test adds two warm-up stages, with the first performed at a 1.7 mph and 0% grade and the second at 1.7 mph and 5% grade. Participants performed the graded exercise test until they reached 85% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate, which was measured using a chest-worn Polar heart rate monitor. Estimated VO2 max was calculated for each participant using the multi-stage model and American College of Sports Medicine metabolic equations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Muscle Strength/Endurance Measured Using 10-repetition Maximum Strength Tests (Upper and Lower Body)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Lower and upper body muscular strength/endurance were measured via 10-repetition maximum (10-RM) tests following National Strength and Conditioning Association guidelines (leg press machine for lower body and barbell bench press for upper body). Weight was increased until participants executed 10 repetitions in good form for both exercises. Estimates of 1-RM leg and bench press were made using a linear prediction equation. Higher scores indicate greater muscular strength/endurance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility - Engagement With the App</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the FitSurvivor intervention (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement with the app was measured by 1) number of in-app exercises completed; 2) points earned (more active = more points); 3) achievements unlocked; and 4) number of likes and comments posted within the social feed. These are count data. Achievements unlocked has possible range of 0 to 20. Number of in-app exercises completed, points earned, and number of likes and comments posted within the social feed have a possible lower limit of 0 and no upper limit; higher numbers indicate more instances of each. The full range of participant data are: number of in-app exercises completed = 0-44; points earned = 0-1,195; number of achievements unlocked = 1-20; number of likes/comments posted = 0-8.</description>

        <description>The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is a well-validated measure of HRQOL with physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning domains. The PedsQL Generic Core yields two summary scores - Physical Summary and Psychosocial Summary. Scores are transformed on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

        <title>Change in Cardiorespiratory Fitness Measured Using Submaximal Treadmill Test</title>
        <description>Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via submaximal treadmill testing using a modified Bruce protocol. This standardized graded treadmill test adds two warm-up stages, with the first performed at a 1.7 mph and 0% grade and the second at 1.7 mph and 5% grade. Participants performed the graded exercise test until they reached 85% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate, which was measured using a chest-worn Polar heart rate monitor. Estimated VO2 max was calculated for each participant using the multi-stage model and American College of Sports Medicine metabolic equations.</description>

        <description>Lower and upper body muscular strength/endurance were measured via 10-repetition maximum (10-RM) tests following National Strength and Conditioning Association guidelines (leg press machine for lower body and barbell bench press for upper body). Weight was increased until participants executed 10 repetitions in good form for both exercises. Estimates of 1-RM leg and bench press were made using a linear prediction equation.

        <description>Engagement with the app was measured by 1) number of in-app exercises completed; 2) points earned (more active = more points); 3) achievements unlocked; and 4) number of likes and comments posted within the social feed. These are count data. Achievements unlocked has possible range of 0 to 20. Number of in-app exercises completed, points earned, and number of likes and comments posted within the social feed have a possible lower limit of 0 and no upper limit; higher numbers indicate more instances of each. The full range of participant data are: number of in-app exercises completed = 0-44; points earned = 0-1,195; number of achievements unlocked = 1-20; number of likes/comments posted = 0-8.</description>
