    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized to receive either placebo, ustekinumab, or risankizumab in Part
      A. All participants received 2 sets of injections to maintain the blind: the placebo arm
      received placebo for risankizumab and placebo for ustekinumab), the risankizumab arm received
      risankizumab and placebo for ustekinumab, and the ustekinumab arm received ustekinumab and
      placebo for risankizumab. Participants who received placebo in Part A switched to
      risankizumab in Part B; participants who received ustekinumab or risankizumab in Part A
      continued to receive the same treatment (ustekinumab or risankizumab) in Part B.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI90) at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear (1) = mean &gt;0, &lt;1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, &lt;2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, &lt;3.5; and Severe (4) = mean ≥3.5.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.). A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI90) at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI100 is defined as a 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.). A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI100 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Ustekinumab (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI100 is defined as a 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI75 at Week 12 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Ustekinumab (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as at least a 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving DLQI Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Ustekinumab (Part A)</title>
        <description>DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.). A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>PSS Total Score: Change From Baseline to Week 16 in Participants Who Received Risankizumab Compared With Placebo (Part A)</title>
        <description>The PSS asks the participant to rate the severity of symptoms of psoriasis in the last 24 hours (pain, redness, itching, and burning) using a 5-point Likert -type scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The PSS total score is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 16, where the higher the score, the greater the severity of psoriasis symptoms. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used for missing data.</description>
