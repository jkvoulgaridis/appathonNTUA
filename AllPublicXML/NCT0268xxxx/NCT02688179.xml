  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of patients over 60 years old develop postoperative delirium following cardiac
      surgery. Delirium increases morbidity and mortality, and may lead to long-term cognitive
      impairment similar to patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The underlying
      mechanisms behind delirium are not understood, and therefore the current prevention and
      treatment strategies are inadequate. Several hypotheses exist for the pathophysiology of
      delirium, one of which is the role of neuroinflammation. The stress associated with high-risk
      procedures such as cardiac surgery may lead to systemic inflammation causing endothelial
      dysfunction and disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB). When this occurs, the brain is
      susceptible to neuronal injury via neuroinflammation after which a state of delirium may
      ensue. To characterize the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in delirium, the investigators
      will explore the biomarkers most closely linked to each step of the proposed pathway.

      Aim 1a. Test the hypothesis that endothelial injury is associated with delirium. The
      investigators hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction is associated with an increased
      incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will
      measure biomarkers from subjects undergoing cardiac surgery. Blood samples from three time
      points [baseline, upon arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU), and postoperative day 1
      (POD1)] will be analyzed and compared between patients that did and did not develop
      postoperative delirium.

      Aim 1b. Test the hypothesis that BBB disruption is associated with delirium. The
      investigators hypothesize that disruption in the BBB is associated with an increased
      incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will
      measure levels of biomarkers at baseline, upon arrival to the ICU, and on POD1.

      Aim 1c. Test the hypothesis that neuronal injury is associated with delirium. The
      investigators hypothesize that neuronal injury is associated with an increased incidence of
      delirium after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will measure
      levels of biomarkers at baseline, upon arrival to the ICU, and on POD1.
