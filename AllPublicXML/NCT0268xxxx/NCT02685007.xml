  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe ease of use and satisfaction with application of the
      pre-rolled TachoSil in laparoscopic procedures within approved therapeutic indication as per
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being observed in this study is called Tachosil. Tachosil is being used in open
      invasive surgery for use as a local haemostatic and tissue sealing. This study will look at
      the application and an overview on the ease of use of pre-rolled form of Tachosil in minimal
      invasive (laparoscopic) surgery, cost analysis along with the evaluation of participant's
      satisfaction with the product.

      The study will enroll approximately 131 participants who will be inpatients. A participant
      can be included in the study when the physician has decided to use pre-rolled TachoSil
      according to the local SmPC and after obtaining informed consent from the participant.
      Participants will be analyzed in a routine setting after surgery.

      Data from all participants will be collected from their files as well as study specific
      questions answered by the treating physician.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in 7 Austrian centers. The overall recruitment
      period is expected for 1 year and six months. Participants will be analyzed from the date of
      surgery till their discharge from hospital.

    <description>Investigators were asked to evaluate the overall manageability and satisfaction with TachoSil in laparoscopic surgery. The overall manageability and satisfaction of TachoSil application was assessed using Likert scale. It is a 5-point scale, that ranges from 1-5, where 1=easy to use/satisfied to 5=difficult to use/not satisfied. Higher scores indicates difficulty and less satisfaction. The mean manageability satisfaction with the application of TachoSil were reported.</description>

        <title>Investigators Assessment of Tachosil</title>
        <description>Investigators were asked to evaluate the overall manageability and satisfaction with TachoSil in laparoscopic surgery. The overall manageability and satisfaction of TachoSil application was assessed using Likert scale. It is a 5-point scale, that ranges from 1-5, where 1=easy to use/satisfied to 5=difficult to use/not satisfied. Higher scores indicates difficulty and less satisfaction. The mean manageability satisfaction with the application of TachoSil were reported.</description>
