  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to compare the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system with commercially available
      stented aortic bioprostheses, in patients requiring aortic valve replacement surgery with
      coronary artery bypass.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study comparing the cross-clamp time (XCT) and cardiopulmonary bypass
      time (CPBT) of the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system with any commercially available stented
      aortic bioprosthesis, in patients with logistic EuroSCORE 1 ≥ 6 undergoing elective surgical
      aortic valve replacement surgery with concomitant coronary bypass grafts.

      Additionally, the aim is to gather sufficient data to quantify the effect size of short term
      patient benefit outcomes previously identified from literature and finally to explore
      additional healthcare resource utilization or health economic endpoints.

    <description>Cardiopulmonary cross clamp time is the amount of time that the patient's aorta (blood vessel) is clamped by a surgical instrument used in cardiac surgery. This allows the normal blood flow to be sent to an artificial heart and lung machine to keep it at a constant temperature and oxygen level.</description>

Class III. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest.
Class IV. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort.

        <title>Amount of Aortic Valvular Regurgitation Over Time.</title>
        <description>Aortic valvular regurgitation occurs when the aortic valve in the heart does not close tightly allowing some of the blood that was pumped out of the heart to leak back into it. Aortic valvular regurgitation is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 represents no regurgitation and 4 represents severe regurgitation.</description>

        <title>Subjects With a Major Paravalvular Leak (OPC) Over Time</title>
        <description>Number of subjects who experienced a Major Paravalvular Leak (OPC) shown over various time points.
Paravalvular leak refers to blood flowing through a channel between the implanted artificial valve and the cardiac tissue as a result of inappropriate sealing.
Paravalvular leak is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 = no leak, 1 = a trace leak, 2 = a mild leak, 3 = a moderate leak, and 4 = a severe leak. A major paravalvular leak (OPC)are any events of leak that required surgical intervention or were considered an serious adverse event.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized questionnaire that asks subjects to rate themselves (no problems, some problems, extreme problems) on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scale is indexed and ranges from a minimum of 0.275 and a maximum of 1.000. A lower number indicates the participants experiences more problems and a higher number indicates the participants experiences fewer problems.</description>

        <title>Subject's Average Score on the KCCQ - Quality of Life Questionnaire Over Time</title>
        <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. Scores range from 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status. Subjects took this questionnaire at baseline, 30 days, 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years.</description>
