    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled
      investigation designed for comparison of two parallel treatment groups: gammaCore (active
      nVNS treatment) and a Sham device (control treatment), for the acute treatment of migraine
      attacks

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Period 1: 4-week observational run-in period; no stimulation treatment. Subjects use standard
      of care (SoC) medication to treat their migraine attacks, according to their individual
      prescriptions.

      Period 2: 4-week randomized/controlled period. After the run-in period, subjects are
      randomized (1:1) to receive either an nVNS device or a sham device to treat up to 5 migraine
      attacks.

      Period 3: 4-week open-label (active treatment) period. After the randomized period, subjects
      continue to the open-label period where all subjects receive an active gammaCore device to
      treat up to 5 migraine attacks.

    <description>Treatment effect on quality of life: EQ-5D-5L is assessed at end of the run-in period and at the end of each 4-week period for nVNS and sham therapies.
EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4 = severe problems and 5 = extreme problems. Subjects indicate health state by ticking choosing appropriate statement in each dimension. The 5 dimensions scores are combined into a score, where a lower score indicates less problems.
Scores across all 5 dimensions are averaged resulting in a total theoretical score of 1 to 5 with lower scores indicating less problems</description>

    <measure>Bang Blinding Index Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Period 2 (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>After the first treated attack and at the end of the double blind period (period 2) subjects were asked to guess if they were had received 'gammaCore-S', ''sham' or 'do not know'. Bang blinding index estimated are presented for the gammaCore-S and sham.
Bang Blinding Index shows the success of blinding. The blinding index proposed is scaled to an interval of -1 to 1, 1 being complete lack of blinding, 0 being consistent with perfect blinding and -1 indicating opposite guessing which may be related to unblinding.
A score of one means they guess correctly, -1 incorrectly. If the bang index includes 0 it indicates that the guesses were consistent for the sham and active and the study was appropriately blinded</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Measured by Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each study period (each study period was 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The HIT-6 measures impact of headaches on ability to function at work, at home and in social situations. Subjects answer 6 questions about ability to function and normal daily life and for each question they rate the impact of their headaches as 'never' (6 points) or 'rarely' (9 points) or 'sometimes' (10 points) or 'very often' (11 points) or 'always' (13 points). Minimum score = 36, maximum score = 78.
Higher score is worse and lower score is better quality of life</description>

          <description>Treatment of up to 5 migraine attacks with the Active gammaCore-S non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator device which delivers a mild electrical signal in the vicinity of the vagus nerve
gammaCore-S: At onset of migraine pain, the subject self-administers a bilateral treatment with the gammaCore nVNS device (2 minutes on the right side, and 2 minutes on the left side). If their headache pain has not improved after 15 minutes, they administer another bilateral treatment. If they are not pain-free at 2 hours, they have the option to administer a third bilateral treatment, or take their usual rescue medication.</description>

If they are not pain-free at 2 hours, they have the option to administer a third bilateral treatment with the Sham device, or take their usual rescue medication.</description>

gammaCore-S: At onset of migraine pain, the subject self-administers a bilateral treatment with the gammaCore nVNS device (2 minutes on the right side, and 2 minutes on the left side). If their headache pain has not improved after 15 minutes, they administer another bilateral treatment. If they are not pain-free at 2 hours, they have the option to administer a third bilateral treatment, or take their usual rescue medication.</description>

        <description>Treatment effect on quality of life: EQ-5D-5L is assessed at end of the run-in period and at the end of each 4-week period for nVNS and sham therapies.
EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4 = severe problems and 5 = extreme problems. Subjects indicate health state by ticking choosing appropriate statement in each dimension. The 5 dimensions scores are combined into a score, where a lower score indicates less problems.
Scores across all 5 dimensions are averaged resulting in a total theoretical score of 1 to 5 with lower scores indicating less problems</description>

gammaCore-S: At onset of migraine pain, the subject self-administers a bilateral treatment with the gammaCore nVNS device (2 minutes on the right side, and 2 minutes on the left side). If their headache pain has not improved after 15 minutes, they administer another bilateral treatment. If they are not pain-free at 2 hours, they have the option to administer a third bilateral treatment, or take their usual rescue medication.</description>

        <title>Bang Blinding Index Scores</title>
        <description>After the first treated attack and at the end of the double blind period (period 2) subjects were asked to guess if they were had received 'gammaCore-S', ''sham' or 'do not know'. Bang blinding index estimated are presented for the gammaCore-S and sham.
Bang Blinding Index shows the success of blinding. The blinding index proposed is scaled to an interval of -1 to 1, 1 being complete lack of blinding, 0 being consistent with perfect blinding and -1 indicating opposite guessing which may be related to unblinding.
A score of one means they guess correctly, -1 incorrectly. If the bang index includes 0 it indicates that the guesses were consistent for the sham and active and the study was appropriately blinded</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Measured by Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)</title>
        <description>The HIT-6 measures impact of headaches on ability to function at work, at home and in social situations. Subjects answer 6 questions about ability to function and normal daily life and for each question they rate the impact of their headaches as 'never' (6 points) or 'rarely' (9 points) or 'sometimes' (10 points) or 'very often' (11 points) or 'always' (13 points). Minimum score = 36, maximum score = 78.
Higher score is worse and lower score is better quality of life</description>

            <description>Treatment of up to 5 migraine attacks with the Active gammaCore-S non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator device which delivers a mild electrical signal in the vicinity of the vagus nerve
gammaCore-S: At onset of migraine pain, the subject self-administers a bilateral treatment with the gammaCore nVNS device (2 minutes on the right side, and 2 minutes on the left side). If their headache pain has not improved after 15 minutes, they administer another bilateral treatment. If they are not pain-free at 2 hours, they have the option to administer a third bilateral treatment, or take their usual rescue medication.</description>

          <title>Quality of Life Measured by Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)</title>
          <description>The HIT-6 measures impact of headaches on ability to function at work, at home and in social situations. Subjects answer 6 questions about ability to function and normal daily life and for each question they rate the impact of their headaches as 'never' (6 points) or 'rarely' (9 points) or 'sometimes' (10 points) or 'very often' (11 points) or 'always' (13 points). Minimum score = 36, maximum score = 78.
Higher score is worse and lower score is better quality of life</description>
