  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to analyze subjects having a normal hip and compare the in
      vivo kinematics to subjects requiring a total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to having a diseased
      hip and then later post-operative to their implanted hip. Ten subjects will have a normal
      hip, ten hips will be diseased, requiring a THA and then those ten diseased hips will be
      re-analyzed at least six months post-operatively after implantation of a THA.
