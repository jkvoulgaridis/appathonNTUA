  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with opioid use disorder on methadone
      maintenance therapy, and associated with problems related to psychosocial functioning,
      medical and psychiatric health, and substance craving and use. Neuroimaging has strongly
      correlated pain processing with the medial prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices.
      This study will investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) using the H7 coil targeting these same brain areas for the treatment of chronic pain
      in patients on methadone maintenance therapy,and magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy
      (MRI/MRS) will be used to evaluate target engagement and mechanism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research aims of this study are to (1) investigate the efficacy of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior
      cingulate cortex for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain in participants with opioid use
      disorder on methadone-maintenance therapy, and (2) investigate target engagement by measuring
      changes in gray matter volume and glutamate-glutamine in these brain regions by magnetic
      resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Given the high incidence of chronic pain in the OUD
      population and specifically the methadone-maintained population, there is great need for
      effective treatments. Untreated chronic pain contributes to medical and psychiatric problems,
      reduced quality of life, and increased risk of substance use and overdose. Non-invasive
      neuromodulation like rTMS, which is currently FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression
      and OCD, holds promise as a safe and effective therapeutic. This project will investigate
      rTMS of brain regions known to process the affective and cognitive components of chronic
      pain, utilizing a treatment protocol modeled after the FDA-approved protocol for
      obsessive-compulsive disorder.

      Volunteers will be randomized in a double-blind manner to 25 sessions (5 weeks) of either
      active high-frequency rTMS or sham stimulation. Participants will regularly complete measures
      to evaluate changes in pain severity and interference. The primary clinical outcome measures
      will be pain severity and interference scores on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).
      Additionally, participants will undergo MRI/MRS scans before and after the 5 weeks of rTMS to
      evaluate target engagement and help elucidate the potential mechanism of action of the
      intervention.
