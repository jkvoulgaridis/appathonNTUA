  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, Open-label, Randomised, Active-controlled, Parallel Group, Multicentre
      Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of PA21 (Velphoro®) and Calcium Acetate
      (Phoslyra®) in Paediatric and Adolescent CKD Patients with Hyperphosphataemia. The aim of
      this Phase 3 clinical study is to demonstrate similar efficacy of PA21 (Velphoro) in
      paediatric and adolescent patients with CKD, and to provide safety and dosing information for
      this patient population. The Phoslyra (comparator) group provides information for a
      descriptive comparison of PA21 against a commonly used calcium-based phosphate binder
      (calcium acetate).

    <description>During Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks), PA21 subjects will receive PA21 at a starting dose based on their age. Dose of PA21 will be increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject has been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time.
During Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension),subjects will continue on the dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses may be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject has been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time during Stage 2.</description>

Dose of Phoslyra will be increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject has been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time.
During Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension),subjects will continue on the dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses may be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject has been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time during Stage 2.</description>

PA21 (Velphoro®), chewable tablets 500 mg and 250 mg iron
PA21 (Velphoro®), powder for oral suspension 500 mg, 250 mg and 125 mg iron
Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's age. Dose was increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.
Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension): dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses could be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time.</description>

          <description>Formulation:
Calcium Acetate (Phoslyra®) - Oral Solution: 667 mg calcium acetate per 5 mL.
Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's weight or, if considered more appropriate by the Investigator, at an equivalent dose of their previous phosphate binder (PB), calcium-based or sevelamer. Dose was increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.
Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension): dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses could be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.</description>

PA21 (Velphoro®), chewable tablets 500 mg and 250 mg iron
PA21 (Velphoro®), powder for oral suspension 500 mg, 250 mg and 125 mg iron
Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's age. Dose was increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.
Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension): dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses could be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time.</description>

          <description>Formulation:
Calcium Acetate (Phoslyra®) - Oral Solution: 667 mg calcium acetate per 5 mL.
Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's weight or, if considered more appropriate by the Investigator, at an equivalent dose of their previous phosphate binder (PB), calcium-based or sevelamer. Dose was increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.
Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension): dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses could be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.</description>

Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's age. Dose was increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.
Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension): dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses could be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety or tolerability reasons at any time.</description>

Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's age.

            <description>Formulation:
Calcium Acetate (Phoslyra®) - Oral Solution: 667 mg calcium acetate per 5 mL.
Stage 1 (Open-Label Dose Titration; up to 10 weeks): starting dose based on the participant's weight or, if considered more appropriate by the Investigator, at an equivalent dose of their previous phosphate binder (PB), calcium-based or sevelamer. Dose was increased or decreased as required for efficacy (to achieve age specific target serum phosphorus level), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.
Stage 2 (Open-Label Safety Extension, 24 week safety extension): dose received at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose change is required. Doses could be titrated for efficacy (to achieve age specific target Serum phosphorus levels), provided a subject had been receiving that dose for a minimum of 2 weeks, and for safety/tolerability reasons at any time.</description>
