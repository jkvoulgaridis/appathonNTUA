    <textblock>
      This phase 3, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of one dose of Tenapanor in subjects with
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) as defined by the ROME III criteria
      and who have active disease as determined after a two-week screening period. Subjects who
      qualify and are randomized into the study will either receive 50mg BID of Tenapanor (1:1) for
      a 26 week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the 26-week double-blind treatment period, subjects will record daily assessments
      including: frequency and timing of bowel movements; sensation of complete bowel emptying;
      consistency of bowel movements; degree of straining, worst abdominal pain, abdominal
      discomfort, abdominal bloating, abdominal fullness and abdominal cramping; and use and timing
      of rescue medication. Subjects will also record weekly assessments including: adequate relief
      of IBS symptoms, degree of relief of IBS symptoms, IBS severity, and constipation severity.

    <time_frame>First 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An overall responder is defined as a weekly responder for the first 6/12 weeks where both CSBM and abdominal pain response criteria were met for the week. The CSBM response criteria are defined as an increase of one or more change in average weekly CSBMs from baseline. The definition of a CSBM is as follows: A CSBM is a spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) for which the subject responds &quot;yes&quot; to the following question; &quot;Did you feel like you completely emptied your bowels?&quot; The abdominal pain response criterion is defined as a decrease of 30% or more of percent change in average weekly worst abdominal pain from baseline.</description>

        <description>An overall responder is defined as a weekly responder for the first 6/12 weeks where both CSBM and abdominal pain response criteria were met for the week. The CSBM response criteria are defined as an increase of one or more change in average weekly CSBMs from baseline. The definition of a CSBM is as follows: A CSBM is a spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) for which the subject responds &quot;yes&quot; to the following question; &quot;Did you feel like you completely emptied your bowels?&quot; The abdominal pain response criterion is defined as a decrease of 30% or more of percent change in average weekly worst abdominal pain from baseline.</description>
