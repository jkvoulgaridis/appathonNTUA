    <textblock>
      Randomized two-arm study examining 90 day primary patency of two FDA-approved tunneled
      dialysis catheters.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VectorFlow tunneled dialysis catheter is a novel symmetrical tip design tunneled dialysis
      catheter which in pre-clinical testing and retrospective review has improved flow and patency
      compared to other dialysis catheter designs. This study will compare 90 day patency rates of
      newly inserted VF catheters to the Palindrome catheter both of which are FDA approved devices
      and will inserted as standard of care. The Palindrome catheter has been selected as the
      comparison device because it is also a symmetrical tip catheter design and prior studies by
      the manufacturer of this device suggests it has a lower occlusion rate and better flow
      compared to other catheter designs.

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint will be primary patency at 90 days following catheter insertion. Primary patency is defined as an HD catheter which provides adequate hemodialysis (flow &gt;300mL/min) without need for additional interventions (ie TPA infusions or catheter exchange) to maintain flow or correct device failure.</description>

    <description>Primary assisted patency at 90 days defined as an HD catheter which provides adequate hemodialysis (flow &gt;300mL/min) without need for catheter exchange or fibrin sheath stripping to maintain flow or correct device failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary device service interval (measured in weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary device service interval defined as the service interval that begins after device replacement or salvage without abandonment of the access site. Examples of interventions include device exchange over a guide wire, fibrin sheath stripping, thrombolytic infusion directly into a catheter, catheter tip repositioning, kinked catheter repositioning, and replacement/repair of a TDC component. Each device revision results in the start of a new secondary device service interval. Patients will be followed up to 12 months post-initial catheter insertion for secondary device service interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total access site service interval (measured in weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total access site service interval defined as the sum of all device service intervals at a single access site. This accounts for devices replaced or manipulated due to device failure, but maintaining the original venous access site. Replacement of an inadvertently removed catheter through the existing subcutaneous tunnel results in a new device service interval, but does not end the access site service interval. Patients will be followed up to 12 months post-initial catheter insertion for total access site service interval.</description>

    <description>TDC insertion with Palindrome will be in accordance with its FDA-approved indication under moderate sedation or general anesthesia with local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine in per institutional protocol. Following TDC insertion, the catheter may be used immediately. The goal of HD is typically to achieve a target effective blood flow of 300mL/min within the first 3 hemodialysis sessions. The dialysis records from each of the first three HD sessions will be reviewed by the study coordinator for (A) Blood flow rate (QB), (B) Arterial and venous lumen pressures, (C) Kt/V, and (D) Urea reduction ratio (URR). Additionally, need and use of thrombolytic infusion (ie t-PA) (other than single dose injection) to restore or improve patency and/or need for catheter exchange.</description>
