  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertigo is among the most common symptoms associated with migraine and affects 26.5% of
      migraine sufferers, leading to a dramatic impact in life limiting even the most simple
      activities. A new device, the OtoBand, a transcranial vibrating system, has been shown to
      mitigate and sometimes prevent vertigo and nausea in healthy subjects. The current study aims
      to determine if the Otoband can treat or reduce symptoms of Migraine Associated Vertigo
      (MAV).

      Vertigo is among the most common symptoms associated with migraine and affects 26.5% of
      migraine sufferers. Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) has a dramatic impact on daily life,
      impacting work, relationships, and even activities of daily living. At the current time, the
      mainstay of therapy for migraine is pharmaceutical intervention, either acute (particularly
      triptans, 2) or preventative. However, this therapy has a delayed effect and can lead to a
      host of side effects.

      In this project we examine a device that has shown promise and might be beneficial for
      treating or improving the course of recovery from MAV. The Otoband is a transcranial
      vibrating system to be placed against the skull, preferably over the mastoid bone, behind the
      ear. To date, the device has only been systematically tested on healthy volunteers and has
      shown improvement of vertigo symptoms during the use of virtual reality systems and road
      motion sickness.

      Individuals identified at Jefferson University medical center with a history of MAV attacks
      will be referred to the Otolaryngology Department where their diagnosis will be confirmed and
      offered to enroll in the study. Participants will be able to take home an Otoband to wear
      when they have MAV attacks. The Otoband will be set at the effective power (proved to reduce
      vertigo symptoms in previous studies) and low power (proved to not impact vertigo symptoms,
      considered as sham device). Participants will have to assay their vertigo symptoms before,
      during and immediately after wearing the Otoband to evaluate the efficacy of the device.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be given the transcranial vibrating system (the Otoband) to use when they have migraine associated vertigo (MAV). The Otoband will function for up to 4 periods of 30 minutes per day, at one of two possible pre-set power levels.
The possible power levels are A) a level deemed to be effective, or B) a placebo (ineffective) power level. On a given calendar day, the power level remains constant. The sponsor will provide Otobands with a predetermined, randomly assigned power schedule based on calendar day.
Subjects will use the Otoband during each MAV episode. They will fill out questionnaires about associated symptoms (dizziness, nausea, headache, brain confusion) 2 &amp; 20 minutes after using turning the Otoband on, and 20 minutes after they stop using the Otoband.
Outcomes measured will be compared between days with device at effective versus placebo power to determine if the Otoband affects dizziness, nausea, headache and brain confusion symptoms during MAV attacks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Neither the subject nor the investigators in the study will know the calendar's schedule for normal or placebo power levels. At both settings, the device will be felt to vibrate, making it unlikely that participants will be able to guess which setting is effective and which is ineffective.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants will be given the transcranial vibrating system (Otoband) to be used during migrane associated vertigo (MAV) attacks. Participants will be able to use the Otoband up to 4 times, 30 minutes each time, per day. The Otoband will be set to the effective power level. Participants will fill out questionnaires about 4 symptoms associated to MAV: before, during (2 and 20 minutes after turning on the Otoband) and after the session (20 minutes after the Otoband was or has stopped). The conditions evaluated will be: dizziness, nausea, headache and brain confusion.
Participants will complete questionnaires either online using secure HIPPA-compliant webforms, or using pre-printed questionnaires, as they prefer.</description>
