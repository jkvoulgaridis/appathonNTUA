  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biolab Sanus is developing a product in the form of orodispersible tablet containing 1.0 mg,
      1.75 mg and 3.5 mg of Zolpidem®. Thus, it is intended to evaluate the efficacy of Zolpidem®
      Orodispersible 1.0 mg or 1.75 mg in women and Zolpidem Orodispersible 1.75 mg or 3.5 mg in
      men for the improvement of the maintenance insomnia disorder, through the evaluation of the
      Insomnia Severity Index, and using a Sleep Diary throughout the study, as well as to evaluate
      the latency of the sleep after a spontaneous or provoked wake up measured by polysomnography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Information provided evidence for the therapeutic use of Zolpidem® in the treatment of
      insomnia. Several studies have emphasized the importance of using Zolpidem® in small doses,
      in the orodispersible form, in the treatment of insomnia. Accordingly, Biolab Sanus is
      developing a product in the form of orodispersible tablet containing 1.0 mg, 1.75 mg and 3.5
      mg of Zolpidem®. Thus, it is intended to evaluate the efficacy of Zolpidem® Orodispersible
      1.0 mg or 1.75 mg in women and Zolpidem Orodispersible 1.75 mg or 3.5 mg in men for the
      improvement of the maintenance insomnia disorder, through the evaluation of the Insomnia
      Severity Index, and using a Sleep Diary throughout the study, as well as to evaluate the
      latency of the sleep after a spontaneous or provoked wake up measured by polysomnography.

The assessement will be performed by means of the standard questionnaire before and at the end of the treatment period. The computed mean difference for each treatment will be compared by ANOVA (treatment doses vs placebo in each gender) in order to assess its statistical significance.</description>
