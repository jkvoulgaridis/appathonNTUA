  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients are able to participate in a
      prehabilitation program (prior to the beginning of treatment) which includes: (1) a
      home-based exercise program or (2) just a prehabilitation education session.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplant may have the potential for severe side effects, including
      functional (reduced aerobic capacity, reduced muscle strength) and psychosocial (e.g. reduced
      quality of life, increased fatigue) detriments.

      Evidence shows that exercise is considered to be an effective treatment approach in
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients during and after treatment with regard to the
      above mentioned side-effects. Also, prehabilitative exercise in colon and lung cancer
      patients was shown as feasible and effective. However, no experience exists with regard to
      prehabilitation exercise in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL will be assessed with the validated 30-item self-assessment questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0).
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed with the validated 29-item self-assessment questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire- High Dose Chemotherapy- 29 Items (EORTC QLQ-HDC29).
The QLQ HDC29 module includes 29 items, consisting of six multi-item scales and eight single-items. For the multi-item scales and single-item scales a high score is equivalent to worse or more symptoms/problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) which is a 20-item, multidimensional self-assessment questionnaire.
Respondents use a scale ranging from 1 to 7 to indicate how aptly certain statements regarding fatigue represent their experiences. Higher total scores correspond with more acute levels of fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality and sleep problems will be assessed with the validated and frequently used Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).
Zero for 'Rarely', 1 for 'Some or a little of the time', 2 for 'Occasionally or a moderate amount of time', 3 for 'Most or all of the time'. Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity behavior in the domains of commuting activity, leisure time activities such as cycling, walking, and sports, household and occupational activity will be assessed via a standardized and validated questionnaire, the Short QUestionnaire to ASsess Health-enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH).
Household work and activities at work or school were prestructured for intensity. A basic intensity score of 2 and 5 for light and intense activities, respectively. Total minutes of activity are calculated for each question by multiplying frequency (days/week) by duration (min/day). Activity scores for separate questions are calculated by multiplying total minutes of activity by the intensity score. The total activity score is calculated by taking the sum of the activity scores for separate questions. Higher values equals more time spent completing the activity.</description>

    <measure>Godin Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity behavior in the domains of commuting activity, leisure time activities such as cycling, walking, and sports, household and occupational activity will be assessed via a standardized and validated questionnaire, the Godin Physical Activity Questionnaire.
Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by summing the products of the separate components, as shown in the following formula:
Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light) Higher activity score = more active</description>

    <measure>Body Pain: Brief Pain Inventory- Short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bodily pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory- Short form (BPI-SF).
The BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score is calculated from the four items about pain intensity. Each item is rated from 0, no pain, to 10, pain as bad as you can imagine, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference. The seven sub-items are rated from 0, does not interfere, to 10, completely interferes, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 70.</description>
