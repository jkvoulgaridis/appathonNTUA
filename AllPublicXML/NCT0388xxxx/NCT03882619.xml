  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the effects of calligraphy activity on symptoms, attention, emotion, and quality
      of life in people with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that through a six-month intervention
      using calligraphy activity, people with schizophrenia will have their symptoms decreased,
      attention improved, emotion enhanced, and quality of life increased. This study will adopt
      single-blind, randomized controlled trial, and 160 people with schizophrenia will be
      recruited in this study. They will be randomly assigned to either a calligraphy activity
      group (treatment group; n=80) or an occupational activity group (control group; n=80).
      Participants will complete assessments at pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up using the
      following instruments: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Chu's Attention Test,
      The Taiwanese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-T), WHO questionnaire on the
      Quality of Life, Brief Form (WHOQOL-BREF), and Chinese Depression Anxiety Stress
      Scales(DASS21).

    <description>Emotion is assessed using self-report of Chinese Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. The scale includes three subscales: depression (score range 0-21; higher score indicates higher depression), anxiety (score range 0-21; higher score indicates higher anxiety), and stress (score range 0-21; higher score indicates higher stress).</description>

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline, end of study (3 months after baseline), and 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Attention is assessed using Chu's Attention Test. The test contains 200 items and is assessed in 10 minutes with two scores calculated: correct number (answered number-number of error answer); rate of correct number (correct number divided by answered number). Higher scores in correct number and rate of correct number indicate better attention.</description>
