      Background: IQOS (&quot;I-Quit-Ordinary-Smoking,&quot;) is a type of the growing class of
      &quot;heat-not-burn&quot; (HNB) tobacco products. The effect of the acute exposure to IQOS smoke on the
      pulmonary function of healthy smokers has not been studied extensively.

      Objectives: Evaluation of the acute effects of IQOS on pulmonary function.

      Methods: Healthy non symptomatic smokers, underwent exhaled CO measurement, spirometry
      including flows, volumes and diffusion capacity, and measurement of their respiratory
      resistances at 5, 10 and 20 Hz (R5Hz, R10Hz and R20Hz) with the use of an impulse
      oscillometry system (IOS) before and 15 min after the use of an IQOS.

      All participants underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) (MasterScreen PFT, Jaeger,
      Wurzburg, Germany) and total respiratory resistances measurement with an impulse oscillometry
      system (IOS)( (Viasys Jaeger MasterScreen IOS system).From the basic pulmonary measurements
      (flows and dynamic lung volumes), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital
      Capacity (FVC), Tiffenau index (FEV1/FVC, FEV1%), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Maximal
      Expiratory Flow (MEF) at 25%, 50%, and 75% of vital capacity, Functional Residual Capacity
      (FRC), Total Lung Capacity (TLC), Residual Volume (RV), Diffusion Capacity (DLCO) were
      measured. Each manoeuvre was repeated for at least three technically acceptable forced
      expiratory flow curves in order to attain the best results. Respiratory impedance at 5 Hz
      (Z5Hz) and respiratory resistance at 5, 10, and 20 Hz (R5Hz, R10Hz, and R20Hz, respectively),
      reactance at 5, 10, and 20 Hz and resonant frequency were assessed with IOS.

      After smoking heated tobacco (IQOS): 5 minutes after smoking IQOS , they repeated again PFTs
      and IOS measurements.
