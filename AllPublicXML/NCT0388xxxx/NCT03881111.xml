  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Chinese extension study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      pembrolizumab plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy versus placebo plus
      cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy as first-line treatment in a Chinese cohort of participants
      with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma.

      The primary efficacy hypotheses are that both progression-free survival (PFS), according to
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and determined by blinded
      independent central review, and overall survival (OS) are superior with pembrolizumab plus
      chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy in all Chinese participants as well as
      Chinese participants whose tumors are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (~1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of patients with cancer. It contains 30 questions (items), 24 of which aggregate into nine multi-item scales representing various aspects, or dimensions, of quality of life (QOL): one global scale, five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, pain), and six additional single-symptom items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Individual items are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Raw scores for each scale are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; a higher score on the global and functional scales represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, and a higher score on the symptom scale represents a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the EORTC Quality Of Life Questionnaire Oesophageal Module (QLQ-OES18) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (~1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer. It contains 18 items and is based on four subscales—dysphagia (three items), eating (four items), reflux (two items) and pain (three items), as well as six single-item subscales—saliva swallowing, choking, dry mouth, taste, cough and speech. All items are scored using a four-point Likert scale that offers these response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; higher symptom scores represent a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>
