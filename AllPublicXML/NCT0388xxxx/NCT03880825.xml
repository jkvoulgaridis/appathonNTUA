  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the
      effect of levoketoconazole on the single-dose PK of metformin in health subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the effect of
      levoketoconazole on the PK of a single 500 mg dose of metformin. There will be 3 sequential
      treatment periods, and all subjects will receive metformin only in Period 1, escalating doses
      of levoketoconazole in Period 2, and concurrent administration of metformin and
      levoketoconazole in Period 3.

          1. 18-55 years of age, inclusive, at time of consent.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2, inclusive.

          3. In good general physical health as determined by absence of clinically significant
             medical history, physical examination findings, vital signs, clinical laboratory
             evaluations and ECG measurements.

          4. Has not consumed and agrees to abstain from taking any prescription drugs, dietary
             supplements including vitamins and herbal preparations, or non-prescription drugs
             (except as authorized by the Investigator AND Medical Monitor) for 14 days prior to
             initial CRU admission on Day -1 and through Follow-Up.

          5. Has not consumed alcohol-containing beverages for 3 days prior to initial CRU
             admission on Day -1 and agrees not to consume alcohol for the duration of the study
             through Follow-Up.

          6. Is a nonsmoker (for at least 3 months) with negative urinary cotinine test at

          1. Evidence of any out-of-normal-range laboratory value at Screening that has not been
             reviewed, approved, and documented as Not Clinically Significant by the Investigator
             (except for LFTs, which must be within the normal range).

             opinion of the Investigator.

          3. History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic,
             endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, chronic
             respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Clinically significant ECG abnormality or confirmed QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec at
             Screening or unconfirmed QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec at CRU admission.

          5. Family history (parents, siblings, and offspring) of QT interval sudden cardiac death.
