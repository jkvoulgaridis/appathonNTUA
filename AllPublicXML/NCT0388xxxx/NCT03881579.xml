  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently almost 5 million Americans suffer from the distressing symptoms related to dementia
      and this number that will triple by 2050. The overall goals of the proposed project are to
      evaluate, in community dwelling Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants the benefits
      of a 12-month nurse-led early palliative intervention on symptoms, quality of life, health
      care resource use. The relevance of this research to public health is that there is an urgent
      need to improve the palliative care of persons with dementia living in the community. This
      study will contribute substantially to that effort.

      200 ADRC participants will be recruited and randomizes 100 each to usual care (UC) or {usual
      care plus an early palliative care intervention} (EPC) to be delivered by a nurse over a
      twelve-month period. The EPC will include one nurse-led palliative consult in a two-hour
      house call and followed by 11 monthly 30-minute phone assessment plus usual care. The study
      aims are to determine whether EPC will lead to lower symptom burden, higher quality of life,
      lesser resource use (e.g. hospital admissions and days, emergency visits) &amp; greater patient
      activation. Mixed-methods framework will be utilized to analyze the audiotapes of the
      encounters between the research nurse and the patient during the twelve intervention sessions
      and to assess whether the information that is provided to participants differs by patient
      ethnicity and cognitive levels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Edmonton Symptoms Assessment Scale (ESAS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, one year, two years</time_frame>
    <description>This ESAS is designed to assist in the assessment of nine symptoms common in patients: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing and shortness of breath, (there is also a line labelled &quot;Other Problem&quot;). The severity at the time of assessment of each symptom is rated from 0 to 10 on a numerical scale, 0 meaning that the symptom is absent and 10 that it is of the worst possible severity. The patient and family should be taught how to complete the scales. It is the patient's opinion of the severity of the symptoms that is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for symptom assessment. We will assess change in ESAS scores between three points in time to determine changes (if any) over time: on study entry, one year later and two year later.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality-of-life Alzheimer's Disease scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, one year, two years</time_frame>
    <description>QOL AD measures quality of life. It has 13 questions and Points are assigned to each item as follows: poor = 1, fair = 2, good = 3, excellent = 4.
The total score is the sum of all 13 items.: We will assess change in QOL scores between three points in time : on study entry, one year later and two year later.</description>

    <measure>Change in Zarit Caregiver Burden scores over time:</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, one year, two years</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview contains 22 items. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always) . The factor structure is a two-factor model, addressing personal strain and role strain. We will assess change in Zarit scores between three points in time : on study entry, one year later and two year later.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Activation Measure over time</measure>
    <time_frame>one year, two years</time_frame>
    <description>3-item survey that assesses a person's underlying knowledge, skills and confidence integral to managing his or her own health and healthcare.
PAM segments individuals into one of four activation levels along an empirically derived 100-point scale. Each level provides insight into an extensive array of health-related characteristics, including attitudes, motivators, and behaviors. Individuals in the lowest activation level do not yet understand the importance of their role in managing their own health, and have significant knowledge gaps and limited self-management skills. Individuals in the highest activation level are proactive with their health, have developed strong self-management skills, and are resilient in times of stress or change. PAM measures patient activation and agency: We will assess changes in activation scores in ESAS scores between three points in time : on study entry, one year later and two year later.</description>
