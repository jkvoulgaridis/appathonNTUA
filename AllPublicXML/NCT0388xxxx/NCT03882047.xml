  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate (SCH
      32088) aqueous nasal spray 200 mcg once daily compared to placebo once daily in the treatment
      of participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Flonase (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray
      200 mcg once daily has been chosen as the active control for this study.

    <masking_description>Both participant and investigator were blinded to treatment identity. Because the mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate bottles were not identical in appearance, a double-dummy study design was used and each bottle had a matching placebo. Thus, although participants received bottles of different appearance, they did not know whether bottles contained active substance or placebo.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score Averaged Over Day 1 Through Day 15 (Based on Participant Diaries)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 through Day 15 (averaged over 15 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline averaged over study Day 1 through study Day 15 was calculated for Total Nasal Symptom Score, based on participant diaries. Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, stuffiness, itching, sneezing) in their diaries using the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The Total Nasal Symptom Score was the sum of the 4 individual scores (range=0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms.) Change from baseline was the 15-day average score minus the baseline score. Scores were recorded twice daily, in the morning (AM) and night (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to obtain the 15-day average score. Baseline score was an average of the 3 AM scores and 3 PM scores preceding treatment. Negative changes indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score at Day 4 (Physician Evaluation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at Day 4 was calculated for the Total Nasal Symptom Score, as assessed by the physician. The Total Nasal Symptom Score was a composite of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing scores. The physician scored each symptom during the study visit on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12. Change from baseline = visit score - baseline score (Day 1 visit). A negative change from baseline score indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at Day 15 was calculated for the Total Nasal Symptom Score, as assessed by the physician. The Total Nasal Symptom Score was a composite of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing scores. The physician scored each symptom during the study visit on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12. Change from baseline = visit score - baseline score (Day 1 visit). A negative change from baseline score indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at Day 4 was calculated for the Overall Condition of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis, as assessed by the physician. The physician scored their overall condition on study Day 4 on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. A higher value indicated greater severity of symptoms. Change from baseline = visit score - baseline score (Day 1 visit). A negative change from baseline score indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Response to Therapy at Day 4 (Physician Evaluation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Response to therapy was assessed by evaluating the participant's relief of nasal symptoms at Day 4. The physician evaluated the participant's response using the following 5-point scale: 1=complete relief, 2=marked relief, 3=moderate relief, 4=slight relief, and 5=no relief. The scores were averaged across each treatment group, with a lower score indicating a greater response to therapy and an improvement in nasal symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score Averaged Over Day 1 Through Day 15 (Based on Participant Diaries)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline averaged over study Day 1 through study Day 15 was calculated for Total Nasal Symptom Score, based on participant diaries. Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, stuffiness, itching, sneezing) in their diaries using the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The Total Nasal Symptom Score was the sum of the 4 individual scores (range=0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms.) Change from baseline was the 15-day average score minus the baseline score. Scores were recorded twice daily, in the morning (AM) and night (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to obtain the 15-day average score. Baseline score was an average of the 3 AM scores and 3 PM scores preceding treatment. Negative changes indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline at Day 4 was calculated for the Total Nasal Symptom Score, as assessed by the physician. The Total Nasal Symptom Score was a composite of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing scores.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overall Condition of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis at Day 4 (Physician Evaluation)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline at Day 4 was calculated for the Overall Condition of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis, as assessed by the physician. The physician scored their overall condition on study Day 4 on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. A higher value indicated greater severity of symptoms. Change from baseline = visit score - baseline score (Day 1 visit). A negative change from baseline score indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Response to Therapy at Day 4 (Physician Evaluation)</title>
        <description>Response to therapy was assessed by evaluating the participant's relief of nasal symptoms at Day 4. The physician evaluated the participant's response using the following 5-point scale: 1=complete relief, 2=marked relief, 3=moderate relief, 4=slight relief, and 5=no relief. The scores were averaged across each treatment group, with a lower score indicating a greater response to therapy and an improvement in nasal symptoms.</description>
