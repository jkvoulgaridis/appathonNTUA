      This study is a prospective, multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) designed to
      collect patient outcome data on a commercially available human autologous homologous skin
      construct (SkinTE™) with SOC dressing compared to SOC dressings alone in the treatment of
      Diabetic Foot Wounds (DFU) .The trial will be single blinded in regard to wound healing
      assessment (another clinician, other than the investigator at each site will assess wound
      healing) and confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an independent adjudication
      committee made up of wound care experts. The study will last thirteen weeks, with a two week
      screening period prior to enrollment.

      There are two arms in the study:

      Arm 1: The Experimental Arm , that will include SOC Therapy. SOC therapy in this study is
      offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too
      large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic
      antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement) and the experimental wound care covering
      with human autologous,homologous skin construct (SkinTE™ followed by a moisture retention
      dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression
      wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).

      Arm 2: The Standard of Care Arm. The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM
      boots or total contact casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM),
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in
      conjunction with debridement) and wound care covering with calcium alginate Fibracol dressing
      followed by a moisture retentive dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4
      gauze pads, soft roll and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).

    <description>The Wound-QoL, or wound quality of life questionnaire, measures the disease-specific, health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. It consists of 17 items on impairments which are always assessed in retrospect to the preceding seven days. This questionnaire will be given to clinical trial participants at each visit, with the scale scores recorded. Each question is scored. Answers to each item are coded with numbers (0='not at all' to 4='very much'). As noted above the score will be reported with a minimam score of &quot;0&quot; and a maximum score of 68</description>

    <description>The FACES pain scale will be administered to the clinical trial participants at each visit. The trial participant will select their pain level with a series of faces that correspond to a number between 0 which implies no pain , up to 10 which implies the most severe pain. The scores will be recorded for each clinical trial participant on each visit</description>

          -  Presence of a DFU, Wagner 1 (see Appendix B for definitions), extending at least
             through the dermis provided it is below the medial aspect of the malleolus.

          -  The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if two or more DFUs are present with the
             same Wagner grade and will be the only one evaluated in the study. If other
             ulcerations are present on the same foot they must be more than 2 cm distant from the
             index ulcer.

          -  Index ulcer (i.e. current episode of ulceration) has been present for greater than 4
             weeks prior to SV1 and less than 1-year, as of the date the subject consents for
             study.

          -  Index ulcer is a minimum of 1.0 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at SV1 and TV1.

          -  Adequate circulation to the affected foot as documented by a dorsal transcutaneous
             oxygen measurement (TCOM) or a skin perfusion pressure (SPP) measurement of ≥ 30 mmHg,
             or an Ankle Branchial Index (ABI) between 0.7 and 1.3 within 3 months of SV1, using
             the affected study extremity. As an alternative arterial Doppler ultrasound can be
             performed evaluating for biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the
             level of the ankle or a Toe Brachial Index (TBI) of &gt; 0.6 is acceptable.

          -  The target ulcer has been offloaded for at least 14 days prior to randomization.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of

             study and undergo pregnancy tests.

          -  Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply
             with weekly visits.

          -  Subject has read and signed the IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent Form before
             screening procedures have been completed.

          -  The index ulcer has a clean granular base, is free of necrotic debris, and appears to
             be healthy vascularized tissue at time of placement of treatment product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Index ulcer(s) deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other
             than diabetes.

          -  Index ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer and should
             undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma of the ulcer.

          -  Subjects on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days
             preceding the first Screening Visit (SV1).

          -  History of radiation at the ulcer site (regardless of time since last radiation
             treatment).

          -  Index ulcer has been previously treated or will need to be treated with any prohibited
             therapies, such as chlorhexidine or collagenase. (See Section 7.3 of this protocol for

             Screening visit, or who receive such medications during the screening period, or who
             are anticipated to require such medications during the study.

          -  Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to
             complete this study or has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.

          -  Osteomyelitis or bone infection, cellulitis, or &quot;active&quot; Charcot's arthropathy of the
             affected foot near the site of the wound or on the same limb as the index ulcer as
             verified by X-ray, MRI, or bone biopsy within 30 days prior to randomization if any of
             the aforementioned conditions are expected. (In the event of an ambiguous diagnosis,
             the Principal Investigator will make the final decision.)

          -  Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Presence of diabetes with poor metabolic control as documented with an HbA1c ≥12.0
             within 30 days of randomization.

             than 3.0 mg/dl within 120 days of randomization.

          -  Target wound has presence of local active soft tissue infection or Gangrene involving
             the treatment site.

          -  Index ulcer has reduced in area by 30% or more after 14 days of SOC from SV1 to the
             TV1/randomization visit.
