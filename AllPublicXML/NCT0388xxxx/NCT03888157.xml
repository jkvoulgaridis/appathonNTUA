  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how the medicine Victoza® (liraglutide)
      works in people with Type 2 diabetes in Iran. Patients will get Victoza® as prescribed to
      them by their study doctor. The study will last for about 5 to 8 months. Patients will be
      asked to complete some questionnaires about their health and diabetes treatment. Patients
      will complete these during their normally scheduled visits with study doctor.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured with the EQ-5D-5L instrument's index score. The EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). The outcome will be presented as EQ-5D index values using the United Kingdom (UK) value set.</description>

The scale is numbered from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates &quot;worst&quot; and 100 indicates &quot;best&quot;. The outcome will be presented as EQ-5D VAS scores.</description>
