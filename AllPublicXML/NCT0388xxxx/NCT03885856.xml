  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to analyse whether there is a difference in clinical and radiological outcomes
      between single row and double row repair techniques for the treatment of shoulder's rotator
      cuff tears.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A tear of the rotator cuff is one of the most common disorders of the shoulder and can have a
      significant effect on daily activities as a result of a loss of motion and strength. The goal
      of rotator cuff repair is to treat the patient's current clinical symptoms and improve
      shoulder function and to prevent the long-term consequences of rotator cuff arthropathy. This
      project aims at a retrospective analysis of preexisting risk factors for sustaining rotator
      cuff injury as well as for failing to reach the previous functional level, used surgical
      technique -either single row repair or double row repair- and its significance for the
      functional outcome.

    <description>The ASES questionnaire is composed of both a physician-rated component and a patient-reported component. The patient questions focus on joint pain ( Visual Analogue Scale ranging from 0 = &quot;no pain at all&quot; to 10 = &quot;pain as bad as it can be&quot;), instability, and activities of daily living (ranging from &quot;unable to do&quot; to &quot; not difficult&quot;). The pain and functional portions are summed to obtain the final ASES score with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Constant-Murley score (CMS)</measure>

    <description>Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function</description>
