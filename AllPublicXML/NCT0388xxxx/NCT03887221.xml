    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single center, single and multiple-dose, open-label, randomized,
      parallel-group, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability study. The subjects will be
      randomised into two study cohorts to receive single and multiple doses of 50 mg safinamide
      (cohort 1), or single and multiple doses of 100 mg safinamide (cohort 2) as follows:

      Cohort 1: One safinamide 50 mg film-coated tablet will be administered on day 1 followed by 7
      safinamide 50 mg film-coated tablets administered orally from day 8 to day 14.

      Cohort 2: One safinamide 100 mg film-coated tablet will be administered on day 1 followed by
      7 safinamide 100 mg film-coated tablets administered orally from day 8 to day 14.

      The investigational products will be administered in the morning, at 8:00±1hour, under
      fasting conditions, with 240 mL (total volume) of still mineral water. A mouth-and-hand check
      will be performed immediately after dosing to ensure treatment compliance.

      The primary endpoint will assess the pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple
      dose administration of the study drug. The secondary endpoint will provide the safety and
      tolerability data after single and multiple dose administration of the study drug.
