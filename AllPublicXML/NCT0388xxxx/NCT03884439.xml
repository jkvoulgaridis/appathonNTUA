    <description>&lt;Crohn's disease&gt; The usual dose is 5 mg as Infliximab [Infliximab Biosimilar 3] for every kg of body weight given as an intravenous infusion. After an initial dose is given, the subsequent doses are given at Weeks 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter. After a dose at Week 6 is given, the dose may be increased or the dosing interval may be reduced for patients who have reduced effects. At an increased dose, the dose may be adjusted to 10 mg for every kg of body weight. At a reduced dosing interval, the dose of 5 mg for every kg of body weight may be given at the minimum dosing interval of 4 weeks. &lt;Ulcerative colitis&gt; The usual dose is 5 mg as Infliximab [Infliximab Biosimilar 3] for every kg of body weight given as an intravenous infusion. After an initial dose is given, the subsequent doses are given at Weeks 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter.</description>
