  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study looking at a new way to evaluate vascular problems or tumors in brain surgery
      patients using a standard &amp; approved intravenous dye and augmented reality.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study investigating a new technique with an approved medication (ICG or indocyanine
      green) and using that and a near infrared mode on a standard operating room microscope to see
      the information provided for vascular or neoplastic (tumor related) neurosurgical problems.
      The technique uses the data from the microscope and using ICG with augmented reality
      overlaying the data into the microscope view (this is the new process). The technique is
      called GLOW800.

    <description>The treatment group will consist of patients who require a medically necessary craniotomy. If an investigator deems that it will be useful to see blood vessels better with indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography (VA), patients may be consented for the use if ICG VA using augmented reality (GLOW800). This will not add additional time or risk to their surgery</description>
