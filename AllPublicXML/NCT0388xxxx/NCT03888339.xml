  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study designed as a randomized controlled trial of parallel group design will be conducted
      at the Dental clinic of the University of Valencia to evaluate the influence of 2.5 mm high
      abutments with different shapes (commercially available high abutments vs high abutments with
      modified shape to imitate short abutments) on peri-implant bone loss around bone level
      implants with platform switching in partially edentulous patients that require a fixed
      rehabilitation supported by two implants in the posterior mandible or maxilla and in fixed
      rehabilitation supported by one implant in the anterior mandible or maxilla.

    <intervention_name>Commercially available high abutments placement</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be randomly selected for the commercially available high abutments option. Two or three implants will be placed following the drilling protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Implants will be placed 0.5mm subcrestal. Once the implants have been placed, periapical radiographs and clinical pictures will be taken. Implants will be uncovered 10 weeks after being placed. After performing the incision and elevation a minimal flap, conventional high transmucosal abutments will be screwed using the torque recommended by the manufacturer. Once the abutments have been screwed, periapical radiographs and clinical pictures will be taken. The abutments will not be unscrewed thereafter throughout the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject requiring two implants in the posterior mandible or maxilla, being at
             least 18 years old and able to sign an informed consent. Final patient inclusion will
             be made after flap elevation during the implant placement surgery to be able to
             confirm the presence of a vertical thickness ≥ 3mm of keratinized soft tissues.

          -  Bone volumes should allow the placement of implants at least 8 mm long (i.e, 10 mm
             bone height to the inferior alveolar nerve) and 4.2 mm wide (7 mm wide bone crest)
             without bone regeneration procedures.

          -  Patients will be grouped into: 1) non smokers; 2) light smokers (≤ 10 cigarettes/day);
             3) heavy smokers (≥ 11 cigarettes/day)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to commit to follow-up.

          -  General contraindications to implant surgery.

          -  Immuno-suppressed/immune-compromised patients.

          -  Patients irradiated in the head and/or neck.

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Untreated periodontal disease.

          -  Poor oral hygiene and motivation.

          -  Addiction to alcohol or drugs.

          -  Psychiatric problems and/or unrealistic expectations.

          -  Patients with an acute infection (abscess) or suppuration in the site intended for
             implant placement.

          -  Patients treated or under treatment with intravenous amino-bisphosphonates.

          -  Patients referred only for implant placement if the follow-up cannot be done at the
             treatment center.

          -  Patients participating in other studies, if the present protocol could not be fully
             adhered to.
