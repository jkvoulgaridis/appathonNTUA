  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation limitation has a significant adverse effects on cardiovascular function and
      cerebral oxygenation during exercise in patients with COPD. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC)
      has been shown to improve ventilation by washing out the anatomical dead space and permitting
      a better gas exchanges. Moreover, it is able to ensure the desired inspired oxygen fraction
      (FiO2) even at high level of patient's minute ventilation by minimizing the room air
      entrainment. The effects of HFNC on exercise performance in terms of hemodynamic changes and
      exercise endurance in COPD patients remain unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to
      examine the effects of HFNC on the exercise endurance in COPD patients. The investigator's
      secondary purpose is to investigate whether HFNC could improve efficiency of ventilation,
      leading to an improvement of hemodynamic and cerebral oxygenation response.

      This is a randomized crossover study. Patients who have been diagnosed as COPD will be
      recruited from outpatient department. After signing informed consent form, patients undertake
      an incremental exercise test and two constant load exercise at the 70% of maximum workload
      achieved at a previous incremental exercise test on arm ergometer in two separate days. The
      constant load tests will be performed with HFNC and with nasal cannula at the same inhaled
      oxygen fraction in random order. The hemodynamics CO, SV, EF of all subjects during exercises
      will be measured by a bioelectrical impedance device (Physioflow), and cerebral oxygenation
      status (oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb)
      was measured by a near infrared spectrophotometer (NIRS).
