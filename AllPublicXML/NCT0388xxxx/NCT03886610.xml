      The overall study aim is to provide additional magnetic resonance imaging parameters of the
      cervical spinal cord, brainstem and brain and a better understanding of changes after spinal
      cord injury (SCI) and to define new magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers to correlate with
      sensomotoric functioning and clinical outcome.

    <textblock>
      Injury of the spinal cord, for instance induced by trauma, is complex involving primary
      mechanisms caused by forces directly affecting the spinal cord and secondary mechanisms
      consisting of complex physiological processes after trauma.

      Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current standard to assess morphologic
      changes of the spinal cord after injury. However, conventional MRI provides little
      information regarding the health and integrity of the brain and spinal cord tissue itself,
      due to the fact that signal intensity changes are non-specific and do not correspond directly
      with physiological processes. This is reflected in the poor correlation of conventional MRI
      data with neurological and functional impairment in various spinal cord pathologies (such as
      multiple sclerosis compression myelopathy) and failure to provide reliable prognostic
      information.

      By applying a combination of diffusion weighted imaging, functional MRI and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy will give us a better understanding of the changes after injury of the
      cervical spinal cord, brainstem and brain. Correlating the imaging data with the neurological
      and clinical status of patients could improve the patient status prediction and therapy
      planning.

      This study is divided into three sub-projects:

      i) Reproducibility study of the MR measurements in healthy controls ii) Progression of MR
      biomarkers in subacute patients with SCI and comparison to chronic patients with SCI iii)
      Prediction of clinical outcome based on MR biomarkers

    <description>Degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process (value between zero and one). A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter.</description>
