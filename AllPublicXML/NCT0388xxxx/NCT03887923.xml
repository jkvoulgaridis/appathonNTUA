      This project uses a novel non-pharmacological treatment to improve balance and reduce falls
      in patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD) using a conceptual framework that combines current
      vestibular physical therapy (VPT) practice guidelines with the latest motor learning theories
      for cognitively-impaired patients. The modified VPT protocol for AD patients was developed by
      experts in VPT and motor learning in AD and will be tested. This pilot study will provide
      much-needed data about whether VPT can be adapted for patients with AD, and whether VPT shows
      promise in improving or stabilizing balance, spatial cognition, and gait function in patients
      with AD.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to perform the tasks within VPT will be monitored during each exercise within all eight training sessions. The number of times modifications are needed to be made to the protocol will be recorded (for example, the number of times the participant needs cuing to attend to the exercise for gaze stabilization which requires constant head movement for the 30-second exercise trial will be recorded).</description>
