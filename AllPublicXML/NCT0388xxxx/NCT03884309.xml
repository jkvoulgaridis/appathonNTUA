        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is presently consuming an extensively hydrolyzed infant formula (EHF) for
             persistent feeding intolerance symptoms, symptoms of suspected food protein (milk
             and/or soy) sensitivity, or other conditions where EHF is deemed an appropriate
             feeding.

          -  Parent(s) of infants confirm their intention not to administer prescription
             medications, over the counter medications, home remedies, prebiotics, probiotics,
             herbal preparations or rehydration fluids that might affect GI tolerance.

          -  Parent(s) confirm their intention to feed their infant the study product as the sole
             source of nutrition for the duration of the study.

          -  Parent(s) confirm their intention not to administer vitamins, minerals (with the
             exception of Vitamin D supplements), solid foods or juices to their infant from
             enrollment through the duration of the study.

          -  Participant's parent(s) or a legally authorized representative (LAR) has voluntarily
             signed and dated an informed consent form (ICF) approved by an Independent Ethics
             Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) and provided Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (or other applicable privacy regulation)
             authorization prior to any participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An adverse maternal, fetal or participant medical history that is thought by the
             investigator to have potential for effects on growth, and/or development.

          -  Participant is receiving oral or inhaled steroids.

          -  Participant participates in another study that has not been approved as a concomitant
             study.

          -  Participant has an allergy or intolerance to any ingredient in the study product.

          -  Participant has been treated with antibiotics or other medications that in the opinion
             of the PI may affect growth, GI tolerance and/or development, within 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment.
