  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the most common childhood neuro-developmental
      disorder that is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms
      last till adulthood in 65% of cases. ADHD has been reported to have a worldwide prevalence of
      5.3% and it is more common in boys than in girls (Ghanizadeh 2008; Serra-Negra et al. 2012
      and Shooshtari et al. 2013) The symptoms of ADHD are generally treated through behavioral
      therapy, with or without pharmacological intervention. Medications prescribed are commonly
      divided into stimulant or non-stimulant drugs. The stimulant medications (such as
      methylphenidate and amphetamines) have been implicated in adverse oral effects, such as
      xerostomia and gingival enlargement. The current evidence is controversial regarding the
      severity and prevalence of dental caries, dental trauma, periodontal diseases, oral habits
      and tooth wear among patients with ADHD (Chau et al. 2017).

      In the Arab world, few studies have been published on ADHD. Accordingly, in the Arab society
      and Egypt there are limited data regarding the oral findings of children with ADHD. Owing to
      the sparsity of these data, this study will be conducted to evaluate different oral
      characteristics of Egyptian children with ADHD.
