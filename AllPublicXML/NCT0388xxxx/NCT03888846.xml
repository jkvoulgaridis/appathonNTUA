  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Behçet's Disease (BD) has no FDA-approved therapies, numerous clinical reports
      suggest that oral ulcers of BD may resolve when treated with systemic ingested pentoxifylline
      (PTX). The investigators here propose to investigate the therapeutic potential of PTX
      dissolved in muco-adherent formulation and directly applied to the oral lesions. This 60
      patient proof of concept trial is designed to meet regulatory requirements for safety
      concerns while at the same time exploring the potential efficacy and clinical utility of this
      product. The investigators hypothesize that application of topical PTX will accelerate the
      healing of these lesions in a clinically meaningful way, and further hypothesize that topical
      PTX can become a valuable adjunct to any other systemic therapy for BD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's Clinic at Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty at the University of Istanbul has a long
      history of supportive care for BD patients and is recognized as the world leader in this
      regard. According to the EULAR 2018 recommended guidelines of Behcet's Disease, the first
      line of therapy recommended against recurring oral ulcers is colchicine. However, a
      significant portion of the participants undergoing colchicine therapy does not have
      sufficient response and require subsequent immune modulatory therapy. By comparing
      participants receiving colchicine as part of supportive care to those who also receive
      topical pentoxifylline (PTX), the investigators seek to prove the concept that topical PTX
      may have clinical value. Additionally, the investigators seek to demonstrate the safety and
      practicality of using topical PTX in BD patients. If the PTX gel therapy provides a
      sufficient response in participants, these participants might not need to undergo immune
      modulatory therapies. The risks of PTX are well characterized and previously reported adverse
      events were primarily gastrointestinal. The investigators expect fewer GI symptoms to result
      from the topical PTX application. The investigators anticipate the benefits of PTX can be
      optimized by a topical application, but require a trial to test that hypothesis.
