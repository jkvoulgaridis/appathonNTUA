    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well nutrition and exercise interventions work in reducing androgen
      deprivation therapy-induced obese frailty in prostate cancer survivors. Individualized
      nutrition and exercise advice for prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy
      may help to reduce obese frailty and change the levels of myokines in blood.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of individualized nutrition and exercise counseling interventions on
      myokine expression and body composition in prostate cancer (PrCa) patients being treated with
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine any changes in muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength and functional
      capacity resulting from the nutrition and exercise counseling interventions.

      II. Determine any changes in myokines, circulating inflammatory and frailty-associated
      cytokines resulting from the nutrition and exercise counseling interventions.

      III. Determine the effect of the study interventions on dietary intake, physical activity,
      fatigue, and quality of life.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate changes in secondary objectives with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and
      testosterone levels.

      II. Evaluate adherence to nutrition and exercise advice. III. Evaluate assessment tools and
      recruiting strategies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive an individualized diet plan for 6 months. Patients complete an
      individualized home-based exercise program aerobic and resistance exercise over 10-30 minutes
      per day, at minimum 3 days per week for 6 months, and a progressive resistance exercise
      program including an individually tailored prescription targeting the chest, shoulders, arms,
      and leg musculature for 1-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions, 5 days per week over 6 months.
      Patients also attend monthly educational meetings for 6 months.
