  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the CLIPPCAIR study is to construct and validate a new algorithm for
      predicting post-operative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values for lung
      resection candidates; this new model will be based on data derived from a thoracic CT scan
      with injection of contrast media.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondarily, the predictions made using traditional scintigraphic data will be compared with
      those from the new algorithm in a subset of high-risk patients, and cumulative contrast media
      and irradiation doses associated with imaging will be presented. How other measures of
      pulmonary function (e.g. transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO)) and the
      presence/absence of operative complications might be predicted will also be investigated.
      Additionally, the potential links between (i) pre-surgical imaging data, (ii) post-surgical
      changes in respiratory function, and (iii) changes in health related quality of life will
      also be explored.

           sufficiently large/distinct

        -  obtained the patient's consent for the use of his remaining excised tissue specifically
           for this ancillary study
