  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 month, pragmatic trial designed to assess the differences in a digital medicine
      system (DMS)- ABILIFY MYCITE (Aripiprazole tablets with sensor)- measuring adherence versus
      treatment as usual (TAU) for adult patients with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and major
      depression. Outcomes of interest will be adherence as measured by refill rates and all-cause
      and psychiatric health care use. Each patient will be in the study for a duration of 12
      months.

      All treatment medication decisions will be made by the healthcare professionals (HCPs) and
      not by protocol. Psychiatrist(s), nurse(s) and/or team manager(s) who will be responsible for
      subjects' care, will be considered as HCPs in this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, 12-month, pragmatic trial designed to assess adherence in patients using
      ABILIFY MYCITE versus patients receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Both groups will complete
      surveys at baseline, 90, 180, and 360 days and will receive care at the discretion of their
      physician. The usual care group will not receive the ABILIFY MYCITE intervention. The primary
      outcome will assess refill rates at 6 months.

      Eligible patients will enroll at their screening/baseline visit and ABILIFY MYCITE onboarding
      will be provided in the clinic, with commercial informational materials and additional call
      center support. Patients will then initiate 3 months of treatment with ABILIFY MYCITE at the
      baseline visit. At the Day 90 visit, patients will have the opportunity to either stop or
      continue using ABILIFY MYCITE for the remainder of the study (9 months). This decision must
      be a joint decision with the patient and his or her treating physician. During this optional
      interventional phase, patients may start and stop ABILIFY MYCITE as clinically indicated.

      All enrolled patients will have required in-person visits at baseline, 90-days, and 180-days.
      The day 360 (final) visit can be in-person or via telephone.

      Medical and actual pharmacy dispensing data will be collected from day 1 through day 360
      using the VA's electronic medical record system.

    <description>If patients are assigned to the ABILIFY MYCITE treatment group, the patients and physician will initiate the system at the baseline visit, and continue to use the system for 3 months. At any time after the first 3 months, a patient and his or her doctor will have the opportunity to either discontinue or continue using ABILIFY MYCITE for the remainder of the trial (9 additional months; 12 months total) as long as clinically appropriate with the goal of measuring adherence to improve clinical decision-making and care.
Both ABILIFY MYCITE and TAU participants will complete a battery of questions related to quality of life, patient usability/satisfaction, etc. at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>Initiation of ABILIFY MYCITE will commence immediately, with subjects wearing the patch and using the smartphone app for a total of 3 months from baseline visit to the 3 month visit. Following the initial 90-days, the physician and patient may determine to use ABILIFY MYCITE anytime during the following 9 months. Following this period (up to 12 months), the subjects will not use ABILIFY MYCITE and return to standard care. A safety follow-up phone call will occur at 2 weeks after the 12 month/early termination (ET) visit. In addition, individuals in the ABILIFY MYCITE arm will evaluate satisfaction with the use of ABILIFY MYCITE.</description>
