    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized (single arm), multi-center, post-market clinical study
      designed to evaluate FIBERGRAFT® BG Matrix mixed in up to 150 subjects with degenerative disc
      disease (DDD) with or without radiculopathy, or spinal stenosis and/or spondylolisthesis
      requiring a fusion. The patient population will include adult (skeletally mature) men and
      women undergoing 1 or 2 level fusion in the lumbar spine (L2-S1) who are deemed eligible for
      the study, characterized by inclusion and exclusion criteria.

          3. Must have symptomatic spinal stenosis and/or spondylolisthesis or degenerative disc
             disease (DDD) at one or two adjacent levels from L2-S1, requiring a fusion.

          4. Must have completed a minimum of three months of unsuccessful conservative,
             non-operative care.

          5. DDD and spinal stenosis and/or spondylolisthesis must be confirmed by MRI or CT scans.

          6. Must score at least 40 points on the Oswestry Disability Index.

          7. Must score at least a 4 on a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale for back or leg pain.

          8. Must be able to comply with the protocol's follow-up schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic at more than two levels.

          2. Previous fusion surgery at any lumbar level with or without instrumentation (prior
             discectomy, laminotomy, laminectomy or nucleolysis at the index level (&gt; 6 months) is
             permitted).

          3. Previous total disc replacement at any lumbar level.

          4. Undergoing fusion for recurrent stenosis at the level to be treated.

          5. Extraspinal cause of back and/or leg pain, or back and/or leg pain of unknown
             etiology.

          6. Spondylolisthesis not able to be reduced to grade I.

          7. Lumbar scoliosis greater than 11 degrees.

          8. Osteoporosis*, osteopenia, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, or metabolic or systemic
             bone disorders that affect bone or wound healing.

          9. Use of posterior instrumentation for stabilization is not possible.

         10. Intra-operative soft tissue coverage is not possible.

         11. Spinal tumors.

         12. Active arachnoiditis.

         13. Fractures of the epiphyseal plate or fractures for which stabilization of the fracture
             is not possible.

         14. Impaired calcium metabolism.

         15. Active systemic infection or surgical site infection.

         16. Osteomyelitis at the graft site.

         17. Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease.

         18. Chronic steroid use (used steroids for one month within the last 6 months) or any
             medical condition that requires treatment with drugs known to interfere with bone
             healing.

         19. Systemic disease such as AIDS, HIV, hepatitis (active), tuberculosis.

         20. Morbid obesity defined as body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 or a weight more than 100 lbs over
