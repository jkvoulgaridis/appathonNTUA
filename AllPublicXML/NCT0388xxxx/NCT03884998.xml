    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies best dose and how well copanlisib when given together with
      nivolumab works in treating participants with Richter's transformation or transformed
      indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving copanlisib and nivolumab
      may work better in treating participants with Richter's transformation or transformed
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of copanlisib administered in combination
      with nivolumab in patients with transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with
      nivolumab in patients with transformed CLL/NHL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the T-cell repertoire and activation patterns following dual targeting of PI3K
      and PD-1.

      II. To establish if PD-1/PD-L 1 expression correlates with response to the combination of
      copanlisib and nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.

      Participants receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days for 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 4-6 months thereafter.

             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing. Pregnant individuals are excluded from this study
             because copanlisib and nivolumab have the potential to cause fetal harm based on
             relevant animal studies (Refer to the appropriate prescribing information). Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants,
             breast-/chest-feeding should be discontinued prior to treatment with copanlisib and
             nivolumab.
