  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a group based stabilization and skill-training
      intervention to individual out-patient treatment for long lasting post-traumatic reactions.
      Half of the participants will receive the combined treatment while the other half will
      receive individual treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients in mental health care have previously experienced life-stressors and traumatic
      events that are related to the problems they seek treatment for. Although the diagnostic
      labels vary, the clinical picture often demonstrates long lasting complex psychological and
      somatic post-traumatic symptoms such as avoidance, bodily activation, difficulties in
      regulating emotions and in relationships with others, impaired quality of life and reduced
      level of function. Patients often receive long-term individual therapy in general mental
      health care, occasionally without clinically significant improvement. Still, they continue
      treatment due to high symptom pressure and low level of functioning. The study targets a
      novel intervention which tests the effect of adding a group based stabilization and skill
      training intervention to conventional individual treatment among 160 patients already
      receiving treatment in a community mental health hospital. Change in variables covering
      mental health issues, functional impairment, well-being, use of hospital services and drug
      prescriptions will be examined, as well as markers of inflammation found in sera before and
      after intervention. The purpose is to develop better and more effective treatment options for
      a large number of patients who receive mental health care in community mental health
      hospitals.
