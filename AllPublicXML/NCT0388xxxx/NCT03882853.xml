  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with T score of bone mineral densitometry less than or equal to -2.5 will be
      included in the study. Initial evaluation consists of obtaining demographic data, performing
      international physical activity questionnaire (short form) Additionally; Berg balance test,
      timed sit and walk test, single leg stance test, tandem walk test, tandem stance test will be
      performed. Baseline static and dynamic balance scores of patients will be determined by the
      Corebalance Premiere-19 balance device. After acclimation the device and tests, 3
      measurements will be made and the most successful score will be taken. The lowest value will
      be showing best performance. After the first evaluation, patients will be randomized using
      windows excel randomization option to two groups by another observer. Patients will be
      blinded about which exercise group they will be separated to. Both groups will be thought
      exercise series which will be based on recommendations which is published on October 2016 by
      UK national osteoporosis foundation. Patients would be encouraged to perform the exercises on
      recommended basis and handouts will be given to patients in both groups. The yoga group will
      also be taught &quot;tree pose&quot;.

      Patients will be encouraged to note their exercises regularly on daily basis. Patients will
      be reevaluated after first and third months and balance tests will be re-performed to
      determine the effect of given exercises.

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Neurological or vestibule dysfunctions which may affect balance

        -  Severe mental disturbances effecting communication

        -  Locomotor dysfunction which prevents patient to perform balance tests

        -  Active musculoskeletal pathology which disrupt performing exercises.

      Patients with osteoporosis who applied to PMR outpatient clinic of Istanbul Medeniyet
      University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital will be included in the study. Informed
      consent detailing the purpose and content of the study will be obtained from patients.
      Initial evaluation of patients will be performed by the same doctor. Initial evaluation
      consists of obtaining demographic data and performing international physical activity
      questionnaire (short form) to evaluate physical activity frequencies of patients.
      Additionally; Berg balance test, timed sit and walk test, single leg stance test, tandem walk
      test, tandem stance test will be performed. Baseline static and dynamic balance scores of
      patients will be determined by the Corebalance Premiere-19 balance device. After acclimation
      the device and tests, 3 measurements will be made and the most successful score will be
      taken. The lowest value will be showing best performance. After the first evaluation,
      patients will be randomized using windows excel randomization option to two groups by another
      observer. Patients will be blinded about which exercise group they will be separated to. To
      learn the exercises the patient will be referred to physiatrist Ozge Solakoglu who completed
      a 200-hour yoga teacher training programme certificated by Yoga Alliance. Both groups will be
      thought exercise series which will be based on recommendations which is published on October
      2016 by UK national osteoporosis foundation. Patients would be encouraged to perform the
      exercises on recommended basis and handouts will be given to patients in both groups. The
      yoga group will also be taught &quot;tree pose&quot;.

      Patients will be encouraged to note their exercises regularly on daily basis. Patients will
      be reevaluated after first and third months and balance tests will be re-performed to
      determine the effect of given exercises.

    <description>The Korebalance Premiere-19 device and software will be used to make balance assessment. Static test requires standing steady and balancing on the platform, keeping the cross-hairs of cursor in the center of the test pattern. The score indicates the deviation of user's center of gravity from the center of the pattern. After familirization of the patient to the test, the lowest score of three measurements will be noted. The lowest score gives the most successfull scores of test.</description>

    <description>The Korebalance Premiere-19 device and software will be used to make balance assessment. Dinamic test offers a moving cursor that the user ''follows''. Cursor patterns a clock-wise circle. After familirization of the patient to the test, the lowest score of three measurements will be noted. The lowest score gives the most successfull scores of test.</description>

    <measure>Berg balance test score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min.</time_frame>
    <description>14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting. A five-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0-4. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;4&quot; the highest level of function. Total Score is 56. Score of 41-56 indicates low fall risk, 21-40 indicates medium fall risk, 0 -20 indicates high fall risk. It is supported a cut off score of 45/56 for independent safe ambulation.</description>

    <measure>Timed sit and walk test score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 min.</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to determine fall risk and measure the progress of balance, sit to stand and walking. The patient starts in a seated position, the patient stands up upon command, walks 3 meters, turns around, walks back to the chair and sits down. The time stops when the patient is seated. The subject is allowed to use an assistive device. If an assistive device is used, it will be documented.</description>

    <measure>Single leg stance test score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 min</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to test the static balance and postural control. It is performed eyes open and arms on the hips. The patient must stand unassisted on one leg. The time between one foot is flexed off the floor to the time when it touches the ground. If less then 30 second, it will be noted, patients stands with more than 30 seconds accepted succesfull.</description>
