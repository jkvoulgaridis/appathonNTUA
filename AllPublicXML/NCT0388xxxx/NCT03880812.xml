  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the provision of societal cost information
      affects patients' decisions whether or not to undergo surgical management in carpal tunnel
      syndrome, using a hypothetical scenario.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the large societal costs of carpal tunnel surgery and existence of a relatively
      inexpensive treatment option, carpal tunnel release provides fertile ground for testing
      whether societal costs can influence patient decision-making in hand surgery. Such work would
      inform future efforts to reduce societal healthcare costs by elucidating whether appeals to
      societal cost are effective at driving stewardship of limited healthcare resources at the
      patient level. In this study, the investigators aimed to answer this question by presenting
      participants with a hypothetical scenario in which the participants had to choose between
      surgery and wrist bracing for carpal tunnel syndrome. Participants were randomized into two
      cohorts and societal cost information was presented to the intervention group. The effect of
      societal cost information on treatment choice is assessed, along with participants'
      healthcare attitudes.

    <description>Choice for carpal tunnel release over splinting. All participants were presented a hypothetical case of mild carpal tunnel syndrome. The scenario described (nocturnal) symptoms of numbness and tingling and two treatment choices: carpal tunnel release or wrist splinting. In addition, participants were randomized to review total annual societal cost information for CTR procedures in the United States. After reviewing the case, participants were asked to indicate if they would choose surgery (more expensive) or splinting (less expensive). Scoring was measured on a 6-point ordinal Likert scale (ranging from 1=&quot;Definitely not&quot; to 6=&quot;Definitely&quot;).</description>
