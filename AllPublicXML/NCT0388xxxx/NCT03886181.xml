  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation
      emitter device for superficial cutaneous, mucosal or soft tissue neoplasia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety
      and efficacy of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through
      radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in
      patients.

      Superficial lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using
      DaRT seeds.

      Reduction in tumor volume and evaluation the percent of necrotic tissue in the tumor 30-45
      days after DaRT seeds insertion (15-30 days after seed removal) will be assessed. Safety will
      be assessed by the cumulative incidence, worst severity and frequency of adverse events (AEs)
      observed including the follow-up period.
