  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study was designed to inform protocol adaptation, and to evaluate the
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention for
      methadone maintenance clients. Adults (N=15) were recruited from a methadone clinic to
      participate in a 6-week mindfulness course. Indices of feasibility, including recruitment,
      retention, data from focus groups and course satisfaction surveys, supported feasibility of
      the intervention. Outcome measures were self-report, and included depression, craving, PTSD
      symptoms, and experiential avoidance, and were assessed at baseline, postcourse, and 1-month
      follow-up. Data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Mean scores on
      all primary outcomes changed in the expected direction at both postcourse and 1-month
      follow-up assessment, although only depression and experiential avoidance reached
      significance. Results support feasibility and acceptability, and provide preliminary data on
      outcomes for future trials of mindfulness-based approaches within this client population.

      As rates of opiate misuse rise in the United States, there areso do significant associated
      health, and financial consequences to afflicted individuals, their families, and society at
      large. Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) is one evidence-based approach to treating
      individuals with opiate addiction, yet supplemental psychosocial treatment to support this
      approach is lacking. Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) has shown to be efficacious
      in various substance use populations, but has yet to be assessed with MMT clients. The
      current study was designed to inform protocol adaptation for to MMT clients, and to evaluate
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a MBRP for this population. The
      sample consisted of adults (N=15) recruited from a methadone clinic to participate in a
      6-week MBRP course. Indices of feasibility, including recruitment, retention, data from focus
      groups and course satisfaction surveys, supported feasibility of the intervention. Outcome
      measures were self-report, and included self-compassion, depression, craving, PTSD symptoms,
      and experiential avoidance, and were assessed at baseline, postcourse, and 1-month follow-up.
      Data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Mean scores on all primary
      outcomes changed in the expected direction at both postcourse and 1-month follow-up
      assessment, although only depression and experiential avoidance reached significance. Results
      from this initial pilot support feasibility and acceptability, and provide preliminary data
      on outcomes for future trials of mindfulness-based approaches within the MMT community.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability - Satisfaction with the Course</measure>
    <time_frame>post course (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the course will be assessed using the Overall Course Satisfaction Survey, items #1-4 (Bowen, Chawla, &amp; Marlatt, 2010). This is a self-report questionnaire, the first 4 items of which are open-ended questions assessing satisfaction with the course, barriers to learning, and perceived helpfulness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability - Enactment of Learned Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>post course (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Enactment will be assessed using the Overall Course Satisfaction Survey, items #5-7 (Bowen, Chawla, &amp; Marlatt, 2010). This is a self-report questionnaire, the last 3 questions of which are 10-point Likert-type items, and assess importance of skills and likelihood of implementing them into daily life after the course ends. Higher scores indicate higher perceived importance and likelihood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, a 21-item self report measure. Items are summed for a total score ranging from 0-63. A score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety symptoms will be assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a 21-item self report measure. Items are summed for a total score that can range between 0 and 63 points. A total score of 0 - 7 is interpreted as a Minimal anxiety, 8 - 15 as Mild, 16 - 25 as Moderate, and 26 - 63 as Severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Craving for substances will be assessed using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, a five-item Likert-scaled measure assessing frequency, intensity, duration, and overall levels of craving, adapted to include both alcohol and drugs. Each question is scaled from 0 to 6. Sum scores range from 0-30, with greater scores indicating higher craving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trauma symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C), which measures presence and severity of trauma symptoms using 16-item Likert-scaled questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Experiential avoidance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) is a widely used measure of experiential avoidance and psychological inflexibility consisting of nine Likert-scaled items, answer options ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). High scores reflect greater experiential avoidance and immobility, while low scores reflect greater acceptance and action.</description>
