  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the epidemiologic features of Kawasaki disease (KD) in Shanghai from 2013
      through 2017 and identify the risk factors for coronary artery lesions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the KD research group network established during the first survey in Shanghai, a set
      of questionnaires and diagnostic guidelines for KD will be sent to 50 hospitals providing
      pediatric medical care in Shanghai, China. Medical records of participants with KD diagnosed
      from January 2013 through December 2017 will be retrospectively analyzed. Data are collected
      by pediatricians, including demographic information, clinical manifestations, prognosis,
      laboratory indexes, treatment and echocardiographic findings.

      Age and seasonal distribution at onset, treatment and cardiac abnormalities wil be described.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to identify risk factors for coronary
      artery lesions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of coronary artery lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>from admission to one month after onset</time_frame>
    <description>Coronary artery lesions were identified with two-dimensional echocardiography in the acute phase (within one month of onset). Participants were considered to have coronary artery lesions if the luminal diameter of a coronary artery was &gt;3.0 mm in children aged younger than 5 years or &gt;4.0 mm in those aged 5 years and older, or when the internal diameter of a segment was ≥1.5 times that of an adjacent segment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>from admision to discharge (about two weeks after onset)</time_frame>
    <description>Ear temperature was measured each day during hospitalization. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance was defined as persistent fever (&gt;38°C) after 36 hours of completion of initial IVIG infusion or recurrent fever requiring another dose of IVIG or other adjunctive therapies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk factors associated with coronary artery lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>from admisson to one month after onset</time_frame>
    <description>Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify risk factors that were independently associated with coronary artery lesions. Odds ratio and 95% CI were calculated for each variable.</description>
