    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multicenter clinical investigation. It is anticipated
      that a total of eighty (80) subjects will be enrolled at approximately 4-7 sites. The
      clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for joint
      arthroplasty subjects, which entails clinical evaluation on a regular ongoing basis, or as
      needed should the subject become symptomatic in the treated joint.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy/performance of the ReUnion RSA System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be
      measured the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score. Safety of the
      ReUnion RSA System will be demonstrated through reporting of device-related intra-operative
      and post-operative Adverse Events (AEs). Enrolled subjects will be assessed at Pre-Operative,
      Operative/Discharge, and at 6 Weeks, 6 Months, 12 Months, 24 Months and annually thereafter
      up to 10 years following the index procedure.

    <description>The ReUnion RSA System is designed as a reverse total shoulder endoprosthesis to address unrepairable gross rotator cuff tear, rotator cuff arthropathy with pseudoparalysis of the shoulder joint, advanced arthritic and rheumatic disorders affecting the shoulder joint, and failed previous shoulder arthroplasty. The ReUnion RSA System is comprised of a Humeral Cup, Humeral Insert, Glenosphere, Glenoid Baseplate and Screws. The intended purposes of the ReUnion RSA System are to achieve pain relief, improvement of range of motion and restoration or improvement of the shoulder function while ensuring long-term replacement of the shoulder joint with sufficient stability of all endoprosthesis components.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to sign the informed consent.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and
             radiographic evaluations.

          -  Subject is male or non-pregnant female and 18 years or older at the time of surgery.

          -  Subject's joint has gross rotator cuff deficiency, a functional deltoid muscle and is
             anatomically and structurally suited to receive the implant and subject has one or
             more of the following:

               -  Painful, disabling joint disease of the shoulder resulting from degenerative
                  arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis

               -  Failed previous shoulder joint replacement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the shoulder joint.

          -  Subject has mental or neuromuscular disorder which would create an unacceptable risk
             of prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure or complications in
             postoperative care.

          -  Subject has bone stock compromised by disease, infection or prior implantation which
             cannot provide adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  Subject has anticipated activities which would impose high stresses on the prosthesis
             and its fixation.

          -  Subject is obese such that he/she produces a load on the prosthesis which can lead to
             failure of fixation of the device or to failure of the device itself.

          -  Subject has concomitant disease(s) which may significantly affect the clinical
             outcome.

          -  Subject has traumatic or pathologic fracture of the proximal humerus
