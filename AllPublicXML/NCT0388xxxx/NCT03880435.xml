  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the costs and effects of HYALOBARRIER® GEL ENDO versus no HYALOBARRIER® GEL ENDO
      for increasing the chance of conception leading to live birth measured at 30 weeks after
      randomization in women wishing to become pregnant after surgical removal of intrauterine
      pathology (endometrial polyps, fibroids with uterine cavity deformation, uterine septa, IUAs
      or RPOC after miscarriage) by hysteroscopy as an outpatient or in hospital treatment.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Design:

      Multi-centre, parallel group, superiority, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Post
      market study of a Medical Device class III.

      Participant:

      Women aged 18 to 47 years attending Belgian gynaecological departments, scheduled for
      operative hysteroscopy for endometrial polyps, fibroids with uterine cavity deformation,
      uterine septa, intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) or retained products of conception, and wishing
      to conceive spontaneously or before fertility treatment with ovulation induction (OI),
      controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF/ICSI.

      Treatment:

      Application of Hyalobarrier® gel endo at time of surgery

      Control:

      No application of Hyalobarrier® gel endo

      Follow up:

      short term follow-up: 30 weeks after receiving the treatment allocation long term follow-up:
      66 weeks after receiving the treatment allocation

      To blind all trial participants, fertility physicians and gynaecologists doing second- or
      third-look hysteroscopy, 10 ml of a sterile ultrasound gel will be applied into the vagina at
      the end of the procedure in all women regardless of their treatment allocation.

    <masking_description>None of the participants will be informed of the allocated treatment by the surgeon performing the operative hysteroscopy or the personnel present in the OR. The medical record will not reveal any information whether HYALOBARRIER® GEL ENDO was applied at the end of the procedure. The REDCap software will automatically document the allocation and store all the records and the randomisations. The gynaecologist doing the operative hysteroscopy should not be the same as the fertility physician and the gynaecologist doing the second look hysteroscopy. In the exceptional case that the surgeon doing the operative hysteroscopy is the same person as the fertility physician or the gynaecologist doing the second-look hysteroscopy, blinding is assured by notification of treatment allocation if the surgeon has left the operating room.</masking_description>
