  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intellectual disability (ID) is a diagnosis characterized by significant limitations both in
      intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social and
      practical adaptive skills. The disability originates before age 18 years. People with IDs
      will often require health- and social services throughout their lifetimes. Studies report
      worse health among people with IDs compared to the general population, in addition to more
      unmet healthcare needs and more difficulty accessing healthcare. There are also concerns
      about low levels of physical activity in this population.

      In general health surveys in Norway do not include people with intellectual disabilities, and
      studies of health indicators in this group are largely lacking. Further, the unique
      organization of services for this group in Norway calls for specific research efforts. This
      project will use multinational health indicators for youths and adults with IDs in a
      biopsychosocial context in attempt to identify unmet health care needs to improve services.
      In addition to a description of the health indicators, the objective of this project is
      delimited to assess the health determinant physical activity level in association with body
      mass index (BMI) and functioning.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with IDs are experiencing more illnesses and approximately 80% of adults 50 years or
      older have multimorbidities. To improve services, information about health care provision
      should be complemented with knowledge about the health situation and functioning in a
      community-based setting.

      The main objectives of this study are to describe health indicators in a Norwegian population
      of youths and adults with IDs in relation to age, and to assess the associations between the
      health determinant physical activity and body mass index, physical function, activities and
      social participation in youths and adults with IDs.

      Assessments of physical and mental health indicators, and aspects of activities and social
      participation according to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
      (ICF), in relation to health determinants and unmet healthcare needs in a cross-sectional
      health screening survey.

      The prevalence of suitable health indicators will be compared to studies in this area and
      from the following Norwegians population based studies: the &quot;Troms√∏-study&quot;, the &quot;HUNT&quot; study
      and the &quot;NORSE study&quot;.

      The following articles will be published as part of this project:

        1. A feasibility study of the use of tests like the Short Physical Performance Battery.

        2. An overview of the health indicators among youths and adults with intellectual
           disabilities in Norway, in relation to age groups.

        3. Presentation of levels and predictors for physical activity, as well as body mass index,
           in youths and adults with IDs.

        4. Presentation of functioning (daily activities and work) in association to levels of
           physical activity.
