    <textblock>
      This is a 4-visit, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel group study evaluating
      the safety and efficacy of CSF-1 in the treatment of presbyopia. Approximately 150 subjects
      will be enrolled across 7 study centers in the United States. At Visit 2, subjects will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: CSF-1, CSF-1 Component #1, or CSF-1
      Component #2. All subjects will dose twice a day in both eyes with a single drop of their
      assigned treatment for approximately 1 week. At Visit 3, subjects randomized to CSF-1 will
      now receive a different concentration of CSF-1, subjects randomized to CSF-1 Component #1
      will receive a different concentration of CSF-1 Component #1 and subjects randomized to CSF-1
      Component #2 will continue dosing with the same concentration of CSF-1 Component #2. All
      subjects will continue dosing twice a day in both eyes for approximately 1 week.

    <description>This treatment arm consists of 2 different concentrations of CSF-1. Subjects randomized to the CSF-1 treatment arm will receive their first dose of CSF-1 in-office at Visit 2. All subjects will dose twice a day in both eyes with a single drop for approximately 1 week. At Visit 3, subjects randomized to the CSF-1 arm will now receive a different concentration of CSF-1. Subjects will continue dosing twice a day in both eyes for approximately 1 week.</description>
