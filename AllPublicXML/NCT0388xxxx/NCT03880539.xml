    <textblock>
      This is a research study to collect information from people that have Clostridium difficile
      infection (CDI) and are treated with a standard antibiotic treatment in which the antibiotic
      dose is gradually reduced over 6 weeks and bezlotoxumab (BEZLO), an approved monoclonal
      antibody targeting C. difficile toxin, which has shown to reduce CID recurrence when used in
      combination with standard antibiotic treatment.

    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a type of bacteria which causes diarrhea in some people
      who receive antibiotics for other infections. The current antibiotics used to treat C diff
      infection (CDI) are usually successful in treating the initial episode of CDI, but may not
      prevent recurrent infection. To prevent recurrent CDI, standard oral antibiotic treatment
      with vancomycin is extended by gradually reducing the dose over 4-8 weeks. This is called
      antibiotic taper. Bezlotoxumab (BEZLO), a monoclonal antibody targeting C. difficile toxin B,
      is an approved medication that has also been shown to reduce CDI recurrence in patients
      receiving antibacterial drug treatment of CDI. In this study, approximately 12 people with
      multi-recurrent CDI will be treated with BEZLO in combination with standard oral tapered
      vancomycin. Study participation will last 16 weeks. The rate of CDI recurrence in this group
      will be compared to information collected from approximately 72 historical patients with
      multi-recurrent CDI treated with oral tapered vancomycin only.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention group will consist of a single arm of patients treated with BEZLO + SOC oral VAN pulse/taper for multi-recurrent CDI, with a planned enrollment of 12 patients. To achieve the aim of the proposed study, we will compare the efficacy of BEZLO + SOC oral VAN pulse/taper to a historical cohort of patients treated with SOC oral VAN pulse/taper only. These patients will be matched 1:6 on criteria previously outlined in this proposal (BEZLO + SOC, n=12; SOC comparator, n=72; total number of patients in study, n=84).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>If diarrhea resolves (defined as &lt;2 loose stools per day for at least 2 consecutive days) and subsequently begins again (3 or more loose stools in 24 hours or less for at least 2 consecutive days), this will represent a new episode of diarrhea. If there is a new episode of diarrhea at any time during the 12-week study period, an unscheduled visit will be conducted. A stool sample will be provided for any new episode of diarrhea which occurs and a stool test for toxigenic C. difficile (NAAT plus EIA) will be performed. CDI reoccurrence will be defined as new episode of diarrhea and positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile (NAAT plus EIA).</description>
