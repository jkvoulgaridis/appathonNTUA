  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a unique clinical scenario that results in widespread
      activation of the hemostatic system. Conventional CPB interferes with normal hemostasis by
      diluting hemostatic cells and proteins, through reinfusion of shed blood, and through
      activation on the bypass circuit surface of multiple systems including platelets, the
      kallikrein-kinin system, and fibrinolysis . Besides, deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB) are partly sequelae of blood-foreign surface reactions. The arterial filter is
      the part of the CPB circuit where blood cells are exposed to high mechanical stress and where
      cellular aggregates may fasten in large quantitiesiec.

      This is a clinical and observational study. It is being performed in the surgical center and
      intensive care unit of the Heart Institute (InCor) from Faculty of Medicine, University of
      São Paulo (FMUSP), on patients undergoing cardiac surgery, who satisfy inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. In the preanesthetic visit, patient assessment of the criteria described
      in study methodology is verfied. During the surgery, a blood sample is taken to analyze
      hemostatic function in the begin of cardiopulmonary bypass, before arterial filter
      (pre-filter) and in the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, after arterial filter (post-filter).
      Other routine laboratory exams is being colected until first postoperative day, on the
      eletronic medical records. At the end of surgery, the arterial filter is withdrawn from
      cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to be prepared and analysed by SEM. Ten arterial filter
      samples from pre-determined sites and sizes are sent to the clinical laboratory for
      evaluation of platelet and leukocyte gene expression in arterial filter. Patients will be
      followed until hospital discharge or 28 days after surgery, regarding allogeneic transfusion
      needs, reoperation and thromboembolic events.
