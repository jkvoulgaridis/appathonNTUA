  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to further the understanding of environmental factors that may underlie
      variations in body composition seen in youth with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Non-caloric
      artificial sweeteners, broadly consumed in many individuals with T1D, are a modifiable
      dietary factor that may be associated with negative health outcomes, particularly those
      relevant to the future risk of diabetes-related complications.

      Investigators will measure body composition (the amount of fat and muscle in the body and
      where the fat is stored) using a bioelectrical impedance analysis machine and DEXA scanner.
      Blood will be drawn for the following labs: HbA1c, lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel
      and leptin. Participants will also answer questions about their diets and consumption of
      artificial sweeteners.

    <intervention_name>Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis</intervention_name>
    <description>BIA is a radiation-free and clinically accessible measure of body composition [47, 49]. An electrode is placed on the youth's extremities and they are asked to sit for 10 minutes. The youth's height and weight is manually inputted and the measure is obtained (approx. 90 seconds to complete). BIA sends a low level of electrical current through the body and measures the impedance to the current based on fat, muscle, bones providing a measure of body composition.</description>
