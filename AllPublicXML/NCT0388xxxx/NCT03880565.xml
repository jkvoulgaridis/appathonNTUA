      This is a Phase II, single center (Under the Center for Resuscitation Medicine at the
      University of Minnesota Medical School), partially blinded, prospective, intention to treat,
      safety and efficacy clinical trial, randomizing adult patients (18-75 years old) with
      refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) out-of hospital
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) who are transferred by emergency medical services (EMS) with ongoing
      mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or who are resuscitated to receive one of the
      2 local standards of care practiced in our community: 1) Early Extracorporeal Membrane
      Oxygenation (ECMO) Facilitated Resuscitation or 2) Standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support
      (ACLS) Resuscitation

    <description>Survival to hospital discharge with mRS ≤ 3 along with functional status as measured by CPC. mRS scale ranges from 0 (no residual symptoms) to 6 (dead) with 7 (unable to contact patient/caregiver) and 8 (mRS not performed). Scores of 3 (the patient has moderate disability), 2 (the patient has slight disability), 1 (the patient has no significant disability), and 0 indicate favorable outcome. CPC scale ranges from 1 (good cerebral performance) to 5 (brain death). CPC scores of 2 (moderate cerebral disability) and 1 indicate functional status.</description>

    <description>Early Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Facilitated Resuscitation: ECMO is initiated expeditiously, regardless of whether return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) has been achieved and with on-going mechanical CPR, if required, followed by coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when appropriate.</description>

    <description>Standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Resuscitation: Patients with refractory VF/VT OHCA will be treated with ACLS resuscitation for at least 15 minutes after arrival in the emergency department (ED), or up to 60 minutes from 911 call, after which the physician (MD) can continue resuscitation efforts until ROSC is achieved or futility has been reached based on their clinical judgment. If the patient has not achieved ROSC during the times mentioned above, the ED MD can declare death when he or she believes that ACLS is futile. If ROSC is present upon arrival or has been achieved anytime during resuscitation in the ED, the patient will be taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) for coronary angiography and PCI and potential VA ECMO or other circulatory support device initiation, as clinically indicated.</description>
