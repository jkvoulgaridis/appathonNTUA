  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study was to examine whether introducing a work intervention into a
      traditional lifestyle rehabilitation program for persons with BMI above 30, would affect the
      participants' ability to work and their lifestyle change. The investigators wanted to find
      out how the participants experienced their health, workability and work capacity, quality of
      life, diet and self-efficacy before and during the intervention

      The background for this study was insights about obesity and sick leave. Obesity is related
      to lower labor force participation, increased sickness absence and reduced productivity. A
      Danish study from 2006 reported a yearly 1, 8 million extra days of work absence and close to
      1.100 cases of disability pension related to obesity. A 2016-report from OECD show that
      persons with obesity between the ages 50-59 have three times as much work absence as those
      who do not struggle with obesity. This indicates that persons with obesity are a group where
      the need for work rehabilitation is important. Despite this connection, work focus has not
      been a part of lifestyle interventions for persons with morbid obesity until the last two
      years.

      By introducing a work intervention into a traditional lifestyle rehabilitation program for
      persons with BMI over 30, the investigators wanted to examine whether this would affect the
      participants' ability to work and their lifestyle change. The study was designed as a
      randomized controlled study with an exploring prospective design. The intervention lasted 12
      months and each patient had three visits (baseline, 6 and 12 months) at Muritunet, each
      lasting 4-2-2 weeks. The participants were randomized into two intervention, one with work
      intervention and one without.

      Data material gathered at each stay consisting of self-reported forms, test, journal and
      individual interviews. These were all collected at baseline, and at six and twelve months.

    <description>Mapping changes with the Return-to-work-efficacy scale (RTWSE-19). The 19-item RTWSE-19 scale is a new self-report measure intended to assess workers' beliefs of their current ability to resume normal job responsibilities following pain onset. Response range (1−10). 1 is &quot;not sure at all&quot; and 10 is &quot;very sure&quot;. The 19 subscales are divided into three main categories, and the total score is the sum of these catagories. Higher value indicate better outcome. (Shaw et.al 2011).</description>

    <description>Mapping changes in 15D. The 15D is a generic, comprehensive (15-dimensional), self-administered instrument for measuring HRQoL. 5 ordinal levels on each dimension, by which more or less of the attribute is distinguished. A set of utility or preference weights is used to generate the 15D score (single index number) on a 0-1 scale. The valuation system of the 15D is based on an application of the multiattribute utility theory. The single index (15D score) on a 0 1 scale, representing the overall HRQoL (0 = being dead, 0.0162 = being unconscious or comatose, 1 = no problems on any dimension = 'full' HRQOL) is calculated from the health state descriptive system by using a set of population based preference or utility weights.

    <description>Mapping changes with the scoring system subjective health complaints (SHC). The SHC consists of 29 questions concerning severity and duration of subjective somatic and psychological complaints. Intensity of each complaint is scored on a four-point scale from 0-3, where 0 is no complaints and three is severe complaints. The SHC inventory yields scores on single items and a total number of health complaints categorized into five factors: musculoskeletal pain (alpha=0.74), pseudoneurology (alpha=0.73), gastrointestinal problems (alpha=0.62), allergy (alpha=0.58) and flu (alpha=0.67).

    <description>The intervention period lasted for a year with three institution-based stays, 4 weeks at baseline and 2 weeks at 6 and 12 months. At baseline, participants got a functional assessment and an individual adjusted rehabilitation plan. At all three stages: The intervention contains activity training with a focus on the joy of movement, strength- and cardio-training. There were lectures and cognitive therapy to promote self-care and lifestyle change. The intervention contained lectures on diet, nutrition and cooking-classes. Participants set goals at baseline and adjusting these during the progress. Exercise programs was designed to use at home. The Cognitive Information Processing model of career guidance was the mainframe for the work dimension. All participants had talks with the work consultant at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Two work lectures, &quot;Duties and rights as employees&quot; and &quot;Work as medicine&quot;. When needed the work consultant contacted the employer in order to facilitate changes.</description>
