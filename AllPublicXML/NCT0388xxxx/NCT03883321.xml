  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CBSM is a program combining cognitive and behavioral therapies, relaxation provided in
      groups of 8 to 10 patients. This program has demonstrated benefits in stress management
      skills, adaptive strategies, anxiety, quality of life, social inclusion, medication
      adherence, depression, therapeutic alliance, and general well-being. It would also improve
      breast cancer survival after adjuvant therapy. This program has been put in place at the
      center of pain for patients with cancer pain in any stage. This study aims to evaluate the
      benefits of this technique on a patient population suffering from chronic pain related to
      cancer.

      Methodology: Observational study, prospective, open, mono-centric, comparative, evaluating a
      psychosocial intervention type CBSM versus no intervention (group &quot;waiting list&quot;).

      Main Objective: To evaluate the impact of the implementation of a &quot;CBSM&quot; program on the
      stress management capacities of a pilot group of 30 patients followed at the pain center of
      Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital for chronic pain related to cancer or its treatment,
      compared to a control group &quot;waiting list&quot;

      Primary Outcome: Measurement of emotional stress (PSS14)

      Secondary objective:

      Determine patients' interest in this program and the feasibility of the program.

      Determine patient satisfaction with this program To evaluate the impact of the program on the
      quality of life of patients. To evaluate the impact of the program on the handicap perceived
      by the patients in connection with their pains.

      Evaluation of the impact of the program on the pain of the patients (on the daily behavior).

      Evaluation of the impact of the program on depression and anxiety. Determine the impact of
      the 3-month program of the 9th session on the different dimensions described above
