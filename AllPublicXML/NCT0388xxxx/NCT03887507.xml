      This Study evaluates the effectiveness of a Vojta locomotion reflex program as short-term
      automatic postural control in patients with Multiple sclerosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In two consecutive weeks two interventions will be conducted: Vojta group(A) and standard
      therapy group(B). The last one is based on balance exercises targeting core stability, Bobath
      concept and sensory strategies. In the Vojta group 5 sessions will be conducted for a
      duration of 2 weeks and the same will be realised on the standard group. In addition, during
      the study, a daily activity shall be prescribed in both groups: Vojta exercise during 20
      minutes for group A and walking for 20 minutes in group B.

    <description>There will be 3 Vojta therapy sessions conducted on 2 consecutive weeks with an interval of 7 dayssessions, on 1st, 7th and 14th days. Each session will consist of a 45-minute Vojta thera between py protocol based on three exercises, 15 minutes per exercise: Crawling Réflex, and 1st phase and 2nd phase Rolling reflex. The relative or close person will be instructed to carry out an exercise protocol to do at home every day for 20 minutes during the 2-week study. All interventions will be made by the principal investigator.</description>

    <description>The standard group shall perform 4 sessions of physiotherapy in the same period for two consecutive weeks, with one hour per session in its specialized MS association, on 1st, 3rd, 8th, 10th and 15th days. This will be applied by experienced physiotherapists during the treatment of people with MS. The program will consist in balance exercises targeting core stability, exercises of coordination and Pilates as well as individual sessions using the Bobath concept. Patients in this group will walk at least for 20 minutes per day during the study period.</description>
