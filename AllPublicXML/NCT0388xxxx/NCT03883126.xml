  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Directly reinforcing abstinence from alcohol with monetary incentives is an effective
      treatment for alcohol dependence, but barriers in obtaining frequent, verified biochemical
      measures of abstinence limit the dissemination of this treatment approach. The goal of this
      study is to use technological advancements to remotely, accurately, and securely monitor
      alcohol use with a newly developed smartphone app and breathalyzer. This treatment approach
      has the potential to facilitate the dissemination of an effective, evidence-based treatment
      for alcohol dependence to a broader population whose treatment needs are not currently being
      adequately met.
