  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>preoperative anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative anxiety will be evaluated at two times. At the preoperative holding area before given premedication and while entering to the operating room.</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative anxiety will be evaluated by mYPAS (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale) The mYPAS consists of 22 items in five categories (activity, emotional expressivity, state of arousal, vocalization and use of parents). The highest behavioral level observed in each of the five mYPAS categories is the score for that category. Partial weights were calculated and then added to a total score that ranged from 0 to 100. Cut off points were set to classify: a score of 23.4 to 30 for no anxiety, any score greater than 30 for anxiety.
Preoperative anxiety at preoperative waiting room and at operation room will be evaluated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>maternal anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be evaluated once. At the preoperative holding area while waiting for operation with their child.</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal state anxiety will be evaluated by STAI-FORM TX1 questionnaire at preoperative waiting room.
The STAI TX1 is an internationally well accepted measure and has been used in a range of comparable studies for assessing the level of parents'anxiety. Raw scores on each subscale range between 20 and 80, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of anxiety.</description>
