      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ezetimibe
      10 mg once daily co-administered with atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg daily for up to 12 consecutive
      months in participants with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or in
      participants with coronary heart disease (CHD) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors and
      primary hypercholesterolemia not controlled by a starting dose (10 mg daily) of atorvastatin.

      Adult participants with a diagnosis of HeFH or CHD or multiple risk factors (≥2) and with
      primary hypercholesterolemia who had successfully completed the 14-week, double-blind
      efficacy and safety study of ezetimibe co-administered with atorvastatin (Protocol No.
