  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Painted Playgrounds Aim 2 (Assessment) project will examine the effects of a stenciling
      intervention aimed at increasing physical activity and improving fundamental motor skill
      functioning of preschool aged children. 72 children from local licensed childcare centers
      will participate in individual assessments at baseline and follow-up 6-8 weeks later.
      Assessments include height/weight, surveys and wearing a physical activity monitor
      (accelerometer) for 7 days. A parent/legal guardian will provide consent for their child to
      participate and will also complete a brief survey about their child's lifestyle and habits.
