  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque buildup and phosphorylated
      tau (p-tau) in the brain, as well as widespread neurodegeneration. Amyloid-β and tau are
      proteins that build up in the brain that may contribute to memory problems. The evidence
      suggests that both amyloid and tau play a critical role in AD and interventions that reliably
      and safely decrease the intracerebral burden of amyloid or tau could potentially be of marked
      clinical importance. Currently, therapeutic options are very limited and while there are
      pharmacologic interventions that transiently improve cognitive function, there are no
      treatments that alter disease progression.

      The purpose of this study is to see if multiple daily sessions of non-invasive brain
      stimulation can affect brain activity to decrease the amount of amyloid and tau in people
      with AD as compared to Sham (placebo) stimulation. The type of brain stimulation that will be
      used is called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). This study will
      investigate different doses of tACS (2-4 weeks) and assess safety. The hope is that tACS will
      decrease the amount of amyloid and tau and improve memory and thinking in people with AD.

      This is an interventional, sham controlled, double-blind study in patients with early to
      moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The study will enroll approximately 55 individuals with
      amyloid positive Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or AD. Each subject will undergo a 1-2 visit
      screening period consisting of a physical and neurological exam, medical history and
      medication review, safety questionnaires, and cognitive testing. Each subject will then
      undergo 5-7 baseline visits including neuropsychological testing (memory and thinking tests),
      amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging if one is not available or it has been
      greater than 6 months, tau PET imaging, tACS-EEG (transcranial alternating current
      stimulation and electroencephalogram) assessment, TMS-EEG (transcranial magnetic stimulation
      and electroencephalogram) plasticity assessment, functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), blood and saliva sample collection, and optional lumbar puncture (LP). Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: stimulation for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, once a
      day or twice a day. One of the groups is a sham group. This means that this group will not
      receive actual tACS. Each session will be one hour of either individualized gamma-frequency
      (40 Hz) tACS or sham tACS, depending on the assigned group. Subjects will be assessed for any
      side effects before and after each session and complete a short memory and thinking test
      either daily or weekly. At the end of the daily sessions, 5-7 follow up visits will include a
      repeat of the baseline measures including amyloid and tau PET scans. Long-term follow-up
      visits will include an EEG, cognitive testing and an amyloid PET scan. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to a repeat amyloid PET scan at either 2, 4 or 8 weeks after the last scan.
      The PET imaging studies will be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital.

    <description>tACS is a non-invasive way of stimulating the brain externally using weak electric currents. Electrodes are placed into a cap that you wear on your head. A weak electrical current travels back and forth through the electrodes to your head. tACS will be applied at a frequency of 40Hz and targeting the area of maximal tracer uptake on amyloid PET imaging using an individualized multielectrode design to maximize the induced electrical current to the target region.</description>
