  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate a new medical device in the management of pain.
      The principle of this new treatment is based on the emission of electromagnetic radiation in
      millimeter band. This new modality of pain management is evaluated in a perioperative
      management in patients undergoing surgery for aortic valve replacement.

      The hypothesis is that the use of this medical device in perioperative would reduce the
      consumption of postoperative morphine with an identical quality of analgesia. The decline in
      morphine consumption would allow a decrease in opioid adverse effects.
