  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar bone graft is one of the main step of the surgical care of the patients who are
      suffering from cleft lip and palate. They are usually performed before the lateral incisor
      eruption, at about 5 years old and using cancellous bone taken from the iliac crest.

      The aim of the study is to show if adding a cortical graft to the cancellous cause more
      complications, which may be source of partial or total graft loss in the 6 month following
      the observation

      This is an observational, retrospective and monocentric study. To be included, patients had
      to suffer from a clef lip and palate or alveolar cleft and had to have an alveolar bone graft
      with gingivo-periosteoplasty in the pediatric plastic surgery unit of the Montpellier
      hospital from June 1999 to Mai 2016. They were divided into two groups : the first with
      patients who had a cortical and cancellous bone graft and the second with patients who had a
      cancellous graft only.

      Both groups were followed 6 mounts after the operation to look for the occurence of
      complications which lead to a graft loss. Bilateral cleft are seen as 2 graft events
