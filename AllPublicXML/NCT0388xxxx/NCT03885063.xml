    <measure>Self Neglect as assessed by the Elder Self-Neglect Instrument (of participants who receive home-delivered meals)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Elder Self-Neglect Assessment (ESNA) is a 25-item rating scale to assess for SN.
Each item is a 5-point Likert scale to assess the participant and the participant's home. Scores are tallied with the following suggested interpretations: (1) if high scores for social behavioral SN (B) but not environmental SN (E), then there is high risk for SN, (2) if high scores are for both B &amp; E, then severe unintentional SN, and (3) if high E but not B, then intentional SN. An item example asks, &quot;Does the older adult wear dirty clothes&quot;?</description>

    <description>The UPCN scale was developed by the researchers which taps a respondent's need for information or help surrounding pet-related issues. It is based on the Benjamin Rose Institute Unmet Needs Scale (see references). Response categories are dichotomous (0=No and
1=Yes). The total score is the sum of the items noted for each measure. Higher scores indicate greater unmet need for information or help. The individual scales may be summed to create a score for total unmet need.</description>

    <description>The BRI-CC is a telephone-based intervention designed for adults with chronic conditions and has been used in persons with dementia and their caregiver (CG). This assessment is guided by the use of assessment tools with domains that trigger specific and pertinent needs of the dyad such as relationship strain, depression, financial concerns, memory problems, and difficult behaviors. To address unmet needs, the care consultant and dyad develop action plans with specific action steps pertinent to the dyad. The intervention involves maintenance and support where the care consultant (CC) continues the relationship with the dyad through regular telephone contact, email and mail. CC use a web-based reporting system, to maintain and track dyad information, assessments, action plans, completed tasks, and ongoing contacts. At a minimum, the care consultant will contact the dyad by telephone once per month over the duration of the study period (i.e. 6 months).</description>
