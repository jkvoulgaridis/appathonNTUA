  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the primary objective of this study is to investigate the sedative, and analgesic effects of
      oral, or nebulized ketamine as premedication drugs, and providing postoperative analgesia for
      the preschoolers and decrease their need for systemic analgesia.The secondary objective is to
      compare each sedation technique after oral, or nebulized ketamine for safety ,and procedural
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative communication, premedication interventions, and being accompanied by parents are
      useful methods in decreasing preoperative separation anxiety , postoperative psychological
      trauma, and ensuring smooth induction for preschoolers undergoing elective surgery.

      Procedural sedation, and analgesia was defined by O'Donnell as a drug induced state of
      decreasing awareness, pain, and memory that allowing patient continue his ,or her own
      protective reflexes, and moving purposefully( O' Donnell etal, 2003).

      Ketamine is an anesthetic drug having sedative, and analgesic properties with different
      routes of administration in children (IV, intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral, rectal,
      sublingual, intranasal, and nebulized) .

      Ketamine produces its analgesic properties in acut pain management from reversible
      antagonizing the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)receptors , reducing levels of many
      proinflammatory mediators in the acute phase, and acting on other non-NMDA pathways that
      playing important roles in pain, and mood regulation, like its effect on µ-opioid receptors,
      nicotinic, muscarinic cholinergic, ɣ-aminobutyric acid receptors, activation of high
      -affinity D2 dopamine receptors, and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.

      The oral route is the most popular than other routes ,as it's safe, efficient, acceptable,
      and familiar for pediatric patients..

      Oral ketamine often requires higher, and frequent doses as it's bioavailability is lower
      (17-24%) compared to IV (100%),Intramuscular (93%), sublingual/transbuccal(30%),
      intranasal(25-50%),and inhaler (70%) due to extensive first pass metabolism in liver, and
      intestine.

      Ketamine inhalation is safe, rapid absorption, and affordable route of administration.

    <time_frame>30 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>• To assess onset time of sedation by sedation scale (SS-5) score.
The sedation scale:
Rarely awake, needs shaking, or shouting to wake up.
Asleep, eyes closed, wake up when called softly,or lightly touched.
Sleepy, but eyes open spontaneously.
Awake.
Agitated.</description>

    <measure>compare each sedation technique for the time of separation state.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 30 minutes after drug intake</time_frame>
    <description>The separation state will be assessed and designated as satisfactory separation if the Emotional State Scale (ESS-4) score will be no more than two points.
The Emotional State Scale (ESS-4):
Calm.
Apprehensive, not smiling, tentative behavior, withdrawn.
Crying.
Thrashing, crying with movements of the arms, and legs, resisting.</description>

    <time_frame>at time of attempted cannulation, regardless of whether the vein is actually cannulated on the first attempt.</time_frame>
    <description>Successful venous cannulation is defined as an Emotional State Scale (ESS-4≤ 2).
The Emotional State Scale (ESS-4):
Calm.
Apprehensive, not smiling, tentative behavior, withdrawn.
Crying.
Thrashing, crying with movements of the arms, and legs, resisting.</description>

    <measure>to compare the intensity of pain postoperative.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after recovery, and every half hour for four hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>the intensity of pain will be assessed using modified Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS).
