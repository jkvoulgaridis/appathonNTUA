    <textblock>
      After providing informed consent, patients will be randomized to either the intervention
      treatment (&quot;EvoCit procedure&quot;) or the control treatment (&quot;EvoHep procedure&quot;).

      After randomization, each study arm consists of four weeks of 3x4 hours hemodialysis
      treatments according to the allocated protocol. After the last dialysis treatment of the
      fourth treatment week and after a long interdialytic interval, patients will crossover to the
      alternative hemodialysis procedure. After crossover, the study will be completed with, again,
      four weeks of 3x4 hours hemodialysis treatments according to the allocated protocol.
