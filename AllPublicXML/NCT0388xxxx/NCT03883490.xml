  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 1-2% of people are born with a 'bicuspid' aortic valve, with only two cusps instead of
      the common 'tri-leaflet' valve. People with this valve develop dysfunction of the valve
      (narrowing or leakage) at a much earlier age. It is also more common for them to develop
      enlargement of the main blood vessel coming out of the heart, the aorta, and some studies
      suggest that they are also at higher risk of life-threatening tears in the aortic wall.
      Current guidelines recommend surgical replacement of the aorta at an earlier stage in these
      patients. The exact mechanism for the dilatation is not clear, and some studies have
      suggested greater 'stiffness' in the wall of the aorta. In this study, the investigators
      propose to 1.) study aortic size, stiffness and flow patterns using MRI in patients with
      bicuspid and tricuspid valves with a narrowing (aortic stenosis, 2.) measure markers in
      patients' blood that may be important in the process of expansion, 3.) compare the change in
      MRI and blood markers at before and 12 months after surgery, in patients who are due to have
      aortic valve replacement surgery.
