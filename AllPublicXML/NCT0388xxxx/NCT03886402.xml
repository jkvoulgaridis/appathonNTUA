    <measure>International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 30 days, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IIEF is a brief 15-item, self-administered questionnaire that was developed as a measure to detect treatment-related erectile function in patients in cross-cultural settings. Instrument includes 5 domains; erectile function (EF), orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), intercourse satisfaction (IS) and overall satisfaction (OS). The sub-scales scores range as follows: Erectile Function: 1-30 Orgasmic Function: 0-10 Sexual Desire: 2-10 Intercourse Satisfaction: 0-15 Overall Satisfaction: 2-10 The items are not weighted and total scores range from 5 to 75. On the Erectile Function sub-scale lower scores indicate worse erectile dysfunction, while on the remaining sub-scales higher scores indicate less dysfunction</description>

    <measure>Partner Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 30 days, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire asks the partner for their perceptions of effectiveness and overall satisfaction with the SVF treatment their partner received for erectile dysfunction. The questionnaire consists of 7 Likert scale questions (1 - 5), with a total score range of 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating more satisfaction. There are no subscales.</description>
