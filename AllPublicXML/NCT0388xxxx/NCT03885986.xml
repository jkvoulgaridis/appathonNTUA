  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign cysts and cystic-appearing lesions in and around the knee are common and
      differentiation between them through the history, symptoms and clinical examination is
      difficult due to the presence of common findings such as pain, edema, and palpable mass. The
      clinical presentation depends on the location, size of the lesion and its relation with the
      surrounding structures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Benign knee cysts can be subdivided into four major categories as following:1- synovial
      cysts, 2- popliteal (Baker's) cyst, 3- ganglion cysts, 4- meniscal cysts. Whereas, The
      &quot;cyst-like&quot; lesions can be sub-classified into the following:1- normal knee bursae, 2- normal
      knee recesses, 3- miscellaneous cyst-like lesions as aneurysms, hematomas, seromas and
      abscess.

      Many of these lesions have fairly characteristic locations and imaging features. Knowledge of
      these variants and lesions is essential for accurate diagnosis and to avoid mistaking them
      for aggressive soft tissue lesions, including sarcomas. Ultrasonography and magnetic
      resonance imaging are the most useful imaging modalities in evaluating these Benign cystic
      lesions. Ultrasonography can distinguish cysts from solid lesions and assess the degree of
      vascularity within the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging can help to delineate the location
      of the lesion in relation to anatomic structures and also determine if the lesion is cystic
      or solid when contrast is administered.
