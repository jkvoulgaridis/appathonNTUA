  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study to compare the postoperative ileus in open and laparoscopic
      gastrointestinal surgery through the determination of the time the patient takes to pass
      flatus, pass stool, bowel movement, oral intake, the time of hospital stay and total hospital
      costs. Postoperative ileus (POI) is one of the major focus of concern for surgeons, hospital
      executives, quality assurance directors as well as patients because of its role in causing
      patient distress, discomfort, and morbidity, leading to an increase in the duration of
      hospital stay and cost of care.

      All patients aged ≥18 years scheduled to undergo gastric and colorectal cancer resection
      surgery at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, West China Hospital between 2019 to
      2020 will be screened for eligibility. The inclusion criteria for the study will be the
      patient undergoing elective gastric cancer surgery, have the American Society of
      Anesthesiologist (ASA) grade ≤ III, alert consciousness, and BMI, and accurate preoperative
      diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma on the basis of computed tomography CT scan report,
      Gastroscopy and Histopathological reports. Exclusion criteria will be those who cannot
      participate in study assessments owing to the language barrier, dementia or postoperative
      delirium; previously received palliative surgery, develops early postoperative bowel
      obstruction, Anastomotic leakage or Gastroparesis, those requiring reoperation for any other
      indication before the commencement of formal assessment for PPOI. Those requiring more than
      30 minutes of adhesiolysis. Each patient will be approached during preoperative counseling on
      an individual basis by one of the authors (YZ)
