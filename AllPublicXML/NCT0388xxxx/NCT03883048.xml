      Through analysis of demographic factors (gender, age, smoking history, body mass index),
      clinical indicators (signs and symptoms), sputum culture results (pseudomonas aeruginosa),
      Brain Natriuretic Peptide and imaging (scope and type of Bronchiectasis), pulmonary function
      index, inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome of patients, some factors will be found which
      maybe be related to severity and prognosis of Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With
      Bronchiectasis.

      The patients with Bronchiectasis during the past five years were retrospectively analyzed.
      demographic factors (gender, age, smoking history, body mass index), clinical indicators
      (signs and symptoms), sputum culture results (pseudomonas aeruginosa), Brain Natriuretic
      Peptide and imaging (scope and type of Bronchiectasis), pulmonary function index, pulmonary
      artery systolic pressure through Doppler Ultrasound, prognosis, the past year the number of
      exacerbations and hospitalization days will be analyzed. Different groups: Bronchiectasis
      with pulmonary hypertension and Bronchiectasis without pulmonary hypertension according to
      the results of doppler ultrasound; mild (40mmHg or SPAP &lt; 60mmHg), moderate (60mmHg = SPAP &lt;
      80mmHg), and severe (80mmHg = SPAP) group according to SPAP level; survival and death groups
      according to the results of follow-up. Above indexes between the different groups will be
      analyzed to explore which factors can be independent factors combined with Bronchiectasis
      pulmonary hypertension, the degree of pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and the prognosis
      of patients.

      60 Bronchiectasis patients will be enrolled in a prospective study, and divided into two
      groups (Bronchiectasis with pulmonary hypertension and Bronchiectasis without pulmonary
      hypertension). Interleukin 1 beta, IL - 18, endothelin 1 in peripheral blood and
      bronchoalveolar lavage from patients will be examined through enzyme linked immunosorbent
      assays (ELISA). NLRP3 inflammasome, ASC, Caspase 1 mRNA expression from peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells and mucous membrane of the bronchial lung tissues will be examined through
      RT-PCR method.

      The correlation indexes between different groups were compared and analyzed to explore which
      factors were associated with bronchiectasis and pulmonary hypertension.
