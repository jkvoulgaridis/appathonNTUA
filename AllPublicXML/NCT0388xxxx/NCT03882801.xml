  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose
      administration of gefapixant (MK-7264) in participants with moderate to severe obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA). The primary hypothesis is that multiple dose administration of gefapixant
      (MK-7264) in participants with moderate to severe OSA reduces the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)
      relative to placebo.

             interview which must include: Documented sleep study in the past that confirmed the
             OSA diagnosis without significant prior medical intervention.

          -  Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) ≥ 20 events/hour at screening.

             between treatment periods) and until the post-study visit.

          -  A baseline oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry (SpO2) ≥ 94% at screening to ensure
             that carotid body response to hyperoxia is not impaired.
