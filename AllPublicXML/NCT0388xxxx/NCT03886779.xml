          1. Are male or female at least 18 years of age who are scheduled for unilateral cataract
             surgery VIA phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
             and for whom no other ophthalmic surgical procedures (e.g., relaxing incisions,
             iridectomy, conjunctival excisions, etc) are to be conducted during the cataract
             surgery.

          2. Agree not to have any other ocular surgical procedures in the study or fellow (non
             study) eye within 15 days prior to the initiation of dosing with the test article or

          3. Have a Best Corrected Visual Acuity of 20/200 or better in either eye.

          4. Are willing/able to return for all required study visits.

          5. Are willing/able to follow instructions from the study investigator and his/her staff.

             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy).

          8. Have signed informed consent approved by Institutional Review Board or Independent
             Ethics Committee.

          9. Have IOP ≥ 5 mmHg and ≤ 22 mmHg (in study eye) without anti glaucoma therapy at the
             pre operative screening visit (if &gt;22 mmHg, adjust following pachymetry)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have known hypersensitivity to bromfenac or nepafenac or to any component of the test
             article (including &quot;procedural&quot; medications such as anesthetic and/or fluorescein

             measured on slit lamp examination) in the study eye at the screening visit.

          4. Have a known blood dyscrasia or bone marrow suppression, a diagnosis of
             uncontrolled/unstable peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or ulcerative
             colitis, or any uncontrolled/unstable pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, autoimmune,
             hepatic, renal, or central nervous system disease.

          5. Have used ocular, topical, or systemic NSAIDs or ocular, topical, or systemic

             dosing with the test article or throughout the duration of the study.

          6. Have used any ocular prostaglandins within 30 days prior to initiation of dosing with
             the test article or throughout the duration of the study.

          7. Have active corneal pathology noted in the study eye at the screening visit. Active
             corneal pathology is defined as corneal pathology that is non stable, or greater than
             mild, or will compromise assessment of the safety or efficacy of treatment.
             Superficial punctate keratitis in the study eye is a criterion for exclusion.

          8. Have any extraocular/intraocular inflammation in the study eye noted at the screening
             visit (blepharitis allowed if mild only, and no concurrent conjunctivitis or lid
             erythema/edema) or ongoing, unresolved uveitis.

          9. Have used topical, ocular, inhaled or systemic steroids within 14 days prior to
