      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of
      Al18F-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetate-octreotide (Al18F-NOTA-octreotide) as a
      positron emission tomography (PET) somatostatin receptor imaging agent in patients with
      neuroendocrine tumors.

      In the first part of the study, six healthy volunteers will undergo several sequential
      whole-body PET/CT scans starting from the moment of tracer injection up to six hours post
      injection for an initial safety assessment and dosimetry study of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide in
      humans.

      In the second part of the study, six neuroendocrine tumor patients, with at least five
      positive lesions on routine clinical 68Ga-DOTA-peptide PET, will undergo a dynamic PET scan
      for the first 45 minutes, followed by three single static whole-body PET/CTs up to three
      hours post injection for an initial efficacy assessment (evaluation of the lesion detection
      rate) and pharmacokinetics study of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide in humans. Furthermore a first
      comparison with 68Ga-DOTA peptide PET will be performed.

    <measure>Potential of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide as somatostatin receptor PET imaging tracer in patients with neuroendocrine tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be met if in 4 out of 6 patients, at least two tumor lesions per patient are visualized in case of 5 to 10 known positive lesions on the 68Ga-DOTA-peptide PET, or at least 25% of the known tumor lesions per patient are visualized in case of more than 10 known positive tumor lesions on the 68Ga-DOTA-peptide PET. The study will be partially positive if in at least one patient at least 80% of the known positive lesions on the 68Ga-DOTA-peptide PET is visualized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dosimetry of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Dosimetry will be assessed by means of the sequential whole-body PET/CT scans performed in healthy volunteers. Absorbed dose per unit of injected activity (mGy/MBq) at the organ and whole-body level will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normal-organ and tumor uptake of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide as a function of time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo dynamic PET scanning followed by three static whole-body PET/CT scans at different time points post injection. Uptake as a function of time (pharmacokinetics) will be studied using the software package PMOD (PMOD technologies LLC, Zürich, Switzerland). Volumes of interest (VOIs) will be delineated in relevant normal organs and tumor lesions on all PET images and standardized uptake values (SUV) in all these VOIs will be measured to compute normal-organ and tumor uptake as a function of time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the ideal time point for imaging after Al18F-NOTA-octreotide injection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor-to-background ratios as a function of time will be measured. The time point resulting in optimal tumor-to-background ratios, taking into account a realistic implementation in clinical practice, will be defined as the ideal time point for imaging.</description>

    <measure>Safety analysis of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide administration: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide administration on clinical symptoms and signs and biochemistry values will be evaluated. Baseline values will be recorded and patients will be assessed clinically and with serial biochemical analysis. Adverse events will be scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

    <description>In the first part of the study, 6 healthy volunteers will receive a single intravenous single injection of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide, followed by whole-body PET/CT scans at various time points for an initial safety assessment and dosimetry study.
In the second part of the study, a single dose of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide will be intravenously injected in 6 patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
