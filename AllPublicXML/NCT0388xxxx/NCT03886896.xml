    <textblock>
      Intravenous lidocaine - a potent local anesthetic with analgesic and anti-inflammatory
      properties has been shown to be an effective adjunct that reduces intra and postoperative
      opioid consumption and facilitates pain management in adults. In children population
      promising but limited evidence is available. The study was planned to evaluate the efficacy
      of continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine to reduce opioid consumption during and after
      laparoscopic appendectomy in children.

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain in children is still one of the most under diagnosed and under treated
      medical problems. It affects post-surgery recovery, mortality and morbidity, limits mobility.
      Untreated pain not only causes child's suffering but can decrease the pain threshold in the
      future or lead to the development of chronic pain. Postoperative analgesia has been
      traditionally based on opioids but as their use can be associated with adverse effects
      prolonging hospital stay and affecting recovery current guidelines focus on multimodal
      approaches involving numerous analgesics with different mechanism of action. Growing evidence
      suggests that intravenous lidocaine reduces intra- and postoperative requirement for opioids.
      Lidocaine has been proved to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also a
      potent peripheral nervous system modulator inhibiting peripheral and central sensitization.
      The studies performed in adult population have proved the efficacy of systemic lidocaine in
      postoperative pain treatment. It is an effective adjunct that reduces opioids consumption and
      facilitates pain management. As such lidocaine infusion has been included in postoperative
      pain management guidelines for adults. Studies on children population have promising results
      but high quality randomized controlled trials are still missing.

      The proposed study has been planned to evaluate the efficacy of continuous infusion of
      lidocaine as an adjunct to standard general anesthesia (involving fentanyl and sevoflurane)
      in reducing opioids consumption and facilitating postoperative pain control in children
      undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy.
