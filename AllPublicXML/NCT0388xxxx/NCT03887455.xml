      This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of BAN2401 in participants with early
      Alzheimer's disease (EAD) by determining the superiority of BAN2401 compared with placebo on
      the change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) at 18 months
      of treatment in the Core Study. This study will also evaluate the long-term safety and
      tolerability of BAN2401 in participants with EAD in the Extension Phase and whether the
      long-term effects of BAN2401 as measured by the CDR-SB at the end of the Core Study is
      maintained over time in the Extension Phase.

             dose for at least 12 weeks prior to Baseline. Treatment-naive participants for
             Alzheimer's disease can be entered into the study. Unless otherwise stated,

             of a legal representative should be obtained (capacity to consent and definition of
             legal representative should be determined in accordance with applicable local laws and
             regulations). In countries where local laws, regulations, and customs do not permit
             participants who lack capacity to consent to participate in this study (example,

             capacity to consent in the investigator's opinion, the participant's assent should be
             obtained, if required and in accordance with local laws, regulations and customs, plus
             the written informed consent of a legal representative should be obtained (capacity to
             consent and definition of legal representative should be determined in accordance with
             applicable local laws and regulations). In countries where local laws, regulations,
             and customs do not permit participants who lack capacity to consent to participate in
             this study (example, Germany and Spain), they will not be enrolled

                  participant

               -  Contraindications to MRI scanning, including cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator,

               -  Other significant pathological findings on brain MRI during the Core Study
                  including but not limited to: cerebral contusion, encephalomalacia, aneurysms,
