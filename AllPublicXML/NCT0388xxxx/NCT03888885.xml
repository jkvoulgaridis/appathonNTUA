      This project examines the effects of implementing sport education model in university
      required physical education lessons on perceived physical literacy and physical activity
      levels of the students.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scholars suggested the practical application of sport education could operationalize physical
      literacy that some features of this pedagogical model are positively associated to the
      development and attributes of physical literacy. However, there is no further supplement on
      the curriculum and pedagogical method for physical educators to develop students as
      physically literate individuals. Compared to primary school students and adolescents,
      university students are at the stage of transition from compulsory physical education in
      secondary school to more self-initiated physical lifestyle in adulthood. It is therefore
      important that they develop physical literacy as well as a positive attitude towards physical
      activity. Unfortunately, despite its importance, physical literacy among university students
      is insufficiently investigated. In view of the above, this study employs a cluster randomized
      trial design to examine the effectiveness of sport education model delivered in the required
      physical education lessons at the university level to eligible students. The investigation
      focuses on the pre- and post-test and follow-up difference to see whether there are
      differences on perceived motivational climate, situational motivation, and their
      corresponding outcome of perceived PL, PA enjoyment and, self-report and objective PA levels.
      Also, this study investigates the fitness instruction time by videotaping and coding during
      every PE lesson from both groups. This study would be significant that the findings could
      establish the importance on physical literacy development through sport education model as
      well as develop students' physical literacy and positive attitude towards physical activity.

    <description>The globally standardized and validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire - short form is the short version of the IPAQ used to measure self-reported PA levels (Craig et al., 2003; Hallal et al., 2012). Four generic items of vigorous, moderate, walking and sitting were included to obtain the PA levels from the participants. Example items included: During the last 7 days, on how many days did you do vigorous physical activities like heavy lifting, digging, aerobics, or fast bicycling (vigorous)? They are required to answer the total duration of different type of PA which were at least 10 uninterrupted minutes in the last 7 days (Booth et al., 2000).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Objective Physical Activity Levels at the 10th lesson (11th week) and Follow-up at the 13th lesson (15th week)</time_frame>
    <description>A sub-sample of 128 participants was randomly selected to wear accelerometers to measure their objective physical activity levels for at least 8 hours per day, in 7 consecutive days by using Actigraph GT3X+ (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA).</description>

    <measure>Motivational Climate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10th lesson (11th week) (Post-intervention) and 13th lesson (15th week) (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The 34-item Empowering and Disempowering Motivational Climate Questionnaire in Physical Education was based on achievement goal theory and self-determination theory to assess students' perception on the motivational climate of empowering and disempowering features created by their PE teachers. Participants responded to the instrument on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). Example statements include: (a) (empowering); (b) My teacher tried to interfere in aspects of pupils' lives outside of PE (disempowering). Milton et al. (2018) clarified the questionnaire is internal consistent (α = 0.82 - 0.91) and factorial and construct validity.</description>

    <measure>Situational Motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10th lesson (11th week) (Post-intervention) and 13th lesson (15th week) (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Situational Motivation Scale is a 16-item instrument which was used to measure participants' situational intrinsic and extrinsic motivation while performing given physical activities. The four behavioral sub-scales include amotivation, external regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1991). Participants responded to the instrument on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all true and 7 = very true). Example items included: (a) this activity is fun (intrinsic motivation); (b) I believe this activity is important for me (identified regulation); (c) I don't have any choice (external regulation); and (d) I do this activity, but I am not sure it is a good thing to pursue it (amotivation). Guay and colleagues (2000) illustrated that it has adequate internal consistency (α = 0.77-0.95) and construct validity in PA settings among college students aged from 18 - 22 years (mean age = 18.9).</description>

    <measure>Perceived Physical Literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10th lesson (11th week) (Post-intervention) and 13th lesson (15th week) (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Physical Literacy Instrument is a 9-item instrument which is used to measure both teachers' (Sum, Wallhead, Ha, &amp; Sit, 2018; Sum et al., 2016) and adolescents' (Sum et al., 2018a) perceived PL. Three sub-scales are &quot;sense of self and self-confidence&quot;, &quot;self-expression and communication with others&quot; and &quot;knowledge and understanding&quot; (Whitehead, 2010) which were identified as key attributes of and related to PL. Participants responded to the instrument on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). Example statements include: (a) I am physically fit, in accordance with my age (sense of self and self-confidence); (b) I have strong social skills (self-expression and communication with others); (c) I am aware of the benefits of sports related to health (knowledge and understanding). The scale scores are reliable with the internal consistency from .73 to .76 (Sum et al., 2016).</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Enjoyment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10th lesson (11th week) (Post-intervention) and 13th lesson (15th week) (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale is designed to measure how much a student enjoys participating in PA. Participants responded to the 16-items instrument on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = disagree a lot and 5 = agree a lot). There are nine positive items such as &quot;I find it pleasurable&quot;, &quot;It gives me energy&quot; and seven negative items such as &quot;I dislike it&quot;, &quot;It is not fun at all&quot;. Participants receive high scores on positive items and low scores on negative items would indicate a high enjoyment of PA. Motl et al. (2001) established adequate internal consistency (α = 0.81-0.86), and factorial and construct validity.</description>

    <measure>Fitness instruction time of physical education lessons</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10th lesson (11th week) (Post-intervention) and 13th lesson (15th week) (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Fitness instruction time of physical education lessons was measured using System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (McKenzie, Sallis, &amp; Nader, 1992) which is a validated and reliable momentary time sampling and interval recording device to gather quantitative data for objectively assessing PE lessons. It constitutes by three categories of students' PA levels, lesson context and teacher behaviour or teacher interactions. Each category was coded as different types of activities every 20 seconds (10 seconds observe; 10 seconds record) throughout a lesson. The observer decided on what was occurring at the moment an observation interval ends. The lessons information of starting and ending time, locations, gender, etc. were also recorded.</description>

    <description>A total number of 25 lecturers participated in the 12-hour CPD workshop on Sport Education curriculum on June 2018. The content of the workshop focused on the development of a Sport Education season, the changing roles of teachers and students, the assessment of personal and social responsibility, and the application of sport education season and related pedagogies on handball, badminton, swimming and physical conditioning. The Sport Education courseware and class materials were then designed by the eligible lecturers. The intervention was lasted for 10-lesson, 1-day per week and the duration for each lesson was around 90 minutes. The specific five phases in Sport Education model of team selection, teacher-directed, pre-season, formal competition and cumulating event were included. The eligible lecturers led the lessons according to the designated course wares and lesson plans for each sport.</description>
