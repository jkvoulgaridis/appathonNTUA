  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol seeks to assist biorepositories/biobanks in distributing their stored specimens
      and data to researchers that will actually utilize them to advance medicine and technology.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      iSpecimen has built a partner network comprised of supplying institutions that have ethically
      acquired human biospecimens and created biorepositories/biobanks to store the specimens and
      data.

      Many of these biorepositories have protocols allowing for the collection of their samples but
      require an additional IRB or ethics review for the distribution of their samples.

      This protocol establishes a method of such supply sites to allow their specimens to be
      distributed and used for research via iSpecimen's technology and network of research clients.

             distributed.

          -  Specimens from biobanks that have collected materials and de-identified data under a
             waiver of consent

          -  Specimens from a biobank that meet the criteria for non human subject research under
             the common rule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specimens and/or that have been obtained from subjects without informed consent, nor
