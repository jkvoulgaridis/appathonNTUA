      A prospective clinical trial to study the safety and effectiveness of Transcatheter Artery
      Chemotherapy and Embolization (TACE) using CalliSpheres Drug-Eluting Beads with oxaliplatin
      (DEBOXA) in treating patients who have inoperable neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) liver
      metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and effectiveness of Transcatheter Artery Chemotherapy and
      Embolization (TACE) using CalliSpheres Drug-Eluting Beads with oxaliplatin (DEBOXA) in
      patients with inoperable neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) liver metastases.

      II. Determine the response rate (RR) of intrahepatic lesions in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Determine the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival time (DFS), time to
      hepatic progression (THP), and quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Safety assessment: adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events(SAEs)

      OUTLINE: This is a single-arm, multi-center, prospective study.

      Patients receive D-TACE. Embolization agent: CalliSpheres Drug-Eluting Beads. Chemotherapy
      agent: oxaliplatin. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks in the absence of progression of hepatic
      lesions, or unacceptable toxicity.
