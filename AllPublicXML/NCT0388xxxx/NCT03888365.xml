  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicenter, single-day, Phase 2 study. This study will include a
      14-day Screening Period and Study Day 1 clinic visit. Participants will be required to
      perform an activity to induce symptoms of PAH, and subjects' severity of self-reported
      symptoms of PAH will be measured from pre-activity, immediately after the activity, and
      through the 30-minute recovery. Participants will be asked about their PAH symptoms using 3
      PGI-S questions that address their overall PAH symptoms, shortness of breath, and physical
      fatigue.

      This is an observational, multicenter, single-day, Phase 2 study. This study will include a
      14-day Screening Period and Study Day 1 clinic visit. Participants will be required to
      perform an activity to induce symptoms of PAH, and subjects' severity of self-reported
      symptoms of PAH will be measured from pre-activity, immediately after the activity, and
      through the 30-minute recovery. Participants will be asked about their PAH symptoms using 3
      PGI-S questions that address their overall PAH symptoms, shortness of breath, and physical
      fatigue.

      PAH symptoms will be induced via the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT).

      The total number of shuttles completed by a participant during the Screening ISWT will be the
      maximum targeted for that participant during the remaining ISWTs in the study.

      After Screening, participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on PAH medications as
      prescribed by their physician: Cohort A will include participants who are currently
      prescribed and using inhaled treprostinil for the treatment of PAH and Cohort B will include
      participants who are taking other PAH medications (instead of inhaled treprostinil).

      The baseline PGI-S and Borg dyspnea score assessments will be conducted prior to (-15 and 0
      minutes; pre-ISWT) activity that is typically expected to induce symptoms of PAH. The
      participant will initiate activity (ISWT), and these same assessments will be performed
      immediately at the end of the ISWT (within 1 minute of completing the activity). The PGI-S
      assessments will also be performed throughout recovery following completion of the ISWT.
      Continuous pulse oximetry will be performed at each clinic visit starting at each pre-ISWT
      and through recovery. Vital sign assessments will be performed at the beginning and at the
      end of each clinic visit.

        Males and females aged 18 years and above with a diagnosis of PAH that is either idiopathic
        or familial PAH (WHO Group 1), collagen vascular disease associated PAH, PAH associated
        with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, PAH induced by anorexigens/toxins, or
        PAH associated with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (repaired ≥1 years).
