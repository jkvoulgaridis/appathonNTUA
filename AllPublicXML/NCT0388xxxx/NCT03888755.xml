    <measure>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 120 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The TOSR was defined as a 50 percent (%) reduction from the pre-treatment score in the 3-symptom composite VAS score for non-laryngeal attacks and 5-symptom composite VAS score for laryngeal attacks. A VAS utilizes a scale consisting of a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal line with extreme values at the beginning (0 mm = no symptom) and end (100 mm = worst possible symptom) of the line. The participant should draw a vertical line at the point along the scale that represents the current status of the measured symptom. Composite VAS scores were calculated as the average of VAS measurements for skin swelling, skin pain, and abdominal pain (3-symptom composite) for non-laryngeal attacks and for skin swelling, skin pain, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and voice change (5-symptom composite) for laryngeal attacks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Primary Symptom Relief (TOSR-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 120 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Primary symptom relief was based on the participant-assessed VAS score for a single primary symptom (determined by edema location) and corresponds to a reduction by 31 mm at a pretreatment VAS of 100 mm and by 21 mm at a pretreatment VAS of 30 mm. If the primary symptom pretreatment VAS less than (&lt;) 30 mm, then primary symptom relief was defined as 68% reduction from pretreatment. A VAS utilizes a scale consisting of a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal line with extreme values at the beginning (0 mm = no symptom) and end (100 mm = worst possible symptom) of the line. The TOSR-P was calculated from the time of icatibant administration to the onset of primary symptom relief.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Composite Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS utilizes a scale consisting of a 100 mm horizontal line with extreme values at the beginning (0 mm = no symptom) and end (100 mm = worst possible symptom) of the line. The participant should draw a vertical line at the point along the scale that represents the current status of the measured symptom. Composite VAS scores was calculated as the average of VAS measurements for skin swelling, skin pain, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and voice change (5-symptom composite) for laryngeal attacks and as the average of VAS measurements for skin swelling, skin pain and abdominal pain (3-symptom composite) for non-laryngeal attacks. Change from baseline in the composite VAS score was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Symptom Score (SS) Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator-assessed composite symptom score was calculated as an average of abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, and skin swelling (8 symptoms) for non-laryngeal attacks and the average of abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, skin swelling, dysphagia, voice change, breathing difficulties, stridor, and asphyxia (13 symptoms) for laryngeal attacks using the following 5-point scale 0 = none (absence of symptoms); 1 = mild (no to mild interference with daily activities); 2 = moderate (moderate interference with daily activities); 3 = severe (severe interference with daily activities); 4 = very severe (very severe interference with daily activities). Here the composite SS assessed by investigator was reported.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR)</title>
        <description>The TOSR was defined as a 50 percent (%) reduction from the pre-treatment score in the 3-symptom composite VAS score for non-laryngeal attacks and 5-symptom composite VAS score for laryngeal attacks. A VAS utilizes a scale consisting of a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal line with extreme values at the beginning (0 mm = no symptom) and end (100 mm = worst possible symptom) of the line. The participant should draw a vertical line at the point along the scale that represents the current status of the measured symptom. Composite VAS scores were calculated as the average of VAS measurements for skin swelling, skin pain, and abdominal pain (3-symptom composite) for non-laryngeal attacks and for skin swelling, skin pain, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and voice change (5-symptom composite) for laryngeal attacks.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Primary Symptom Relief (TOSR-P)</title>
        <description>Primary symptom relief was based on the participant-assessed VAS score for a single primary symptom (determined by edema location) and corresponds to a reduction by 31 mm at a pretreatment VAS of 100 mm and by 21 mm at a pretreatment VAS of 30 mm. If the primary symptom pretreatment VAS less than (&lt;) 30 mm, then primary symptom relief was defined as 68% reduction from pretreatment. A VAS utilizes a scale consisting of a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal line with extreme values at the beginning (0 mm = no symptom) and end (100 mm = worst possible symptom) of the line. The TOSR-P was calculated from the time of icatibant administration to the onset of primary symptom relief.</description>
