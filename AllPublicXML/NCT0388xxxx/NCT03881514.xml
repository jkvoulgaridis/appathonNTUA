  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hearing screening may fail due to some perinatal and neonatal factors. It is well
      known that false positivity increases cost and maternal anxiety and anxiety in the neonatal
      hearing screening. The effect of the type of delivery to hearing screening is not yet clear.
      The first automated mode of delivery of babies born in Turkey auditory brainstem response
      (SAD's), the authors aimed to evaluate the effects of the test results and false positive
      rate.

      newborns were evaluated with brainstem response test. The AABR test was performed before
      patients were discharged. Perinatal and neonatal variables and AABR test results were
      recorded retrospectively.

    <description>hearing test results of newborns. The test results will be grouped according to the type of birth. The effect of the type of delivery on hearing test results will be investigated. The relationship between vaginal route and cesarean section and hearing test will be the first results.
hearing test results were evaluated separately for the right and left ear as 'passed the test' and 'left test'.</description>
