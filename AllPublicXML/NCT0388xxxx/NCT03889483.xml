  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EEG signals have been collected and studied since the early 1990's as a way of assessing
      brain function at a gross level. As early as the 1930's a derivative of the raw EEG signal -
      event-related potentials (ERPs) - have been computed. The current research is primarily
      focused on three ERP components: the N100, P300 and N400. Each of the three ERPs have been
      studied in the academic laboratory for multiple decades. Through this research, a strong
      understanding has been developed regarding what can affect these components (e.g. task set,
      emotional state, etc.). However, these signals within various pediatric populations (e.g.,
      those with persistent mTBI symptoms or multiple concussions) are not well characterized.

      Being able to safely and effectively employ the NeuroCatch™ Platform in a post-concussive
      pediatric cohort could provide researchers with the potential to elucidate the persistence of
      objective measures of impairment, patterns of recovery, and chronicity of problems due to
      mTBI in children. Secondly, understanding the degree to which these neurophysiological
      components fluctuate over time is crucial to the understanding of brain functioning. However,
      for this type of technology to be useful in quantifying brain health in this population,the
      degree to which a post-concussive pediatric brain naturally fluctuates in its processing
      capability must be quantified. NeuroCatch™ Platform has the ability to measure changes in
      several domains of brain function. These cognitive processes are foundational blocks for some
      of the highest cognitive processes: information integration and executive functioning.

Cohort 1: 30 participants with persistent mTBI symptoms (duration greater than 6 weeks), as determined by the Investigator; Cohort 2: 30 participants who recovered quickly from mTBI (i.e., within approximately six weeks based on symptomatology), as determined by the Investigator; Cohort 3: 15 participants who have had multiple mTBIs (2 or more medically verified concussions over the last year); and Cohort 4: 30 participants who have never had a concussion. Participants in Cohorts 1-3 will be recruited 6-16 weeks post injury date.
After study enrollment, all participants undergo two NeuroCatch Platform assessments.</intervention_model_description>
