  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if there is a significant difference in
      post-operative trichiasis at 12 months comparing a new procedure, the Bevel/rotate/advance
      procedure (BRAP), to the Trabut procedure among repeat surgery patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 700 participants with previously operated trichiasis on a
      1:1 basis to receive either the Bevel/rotate/advance procedure (BRAP) or the Trabut
      procedure. The participants will be followed at 1 day, 2 weeks, 3-6 months, and then 12
      months following the surgery. The primary study endpoint is recurrence of post-operative
      trichiasis within 12 months of surgery. The investigators will conduct logistic regression
      analysis comparing post-operative trichiasis recurrent rates in participants receiving BRAP
      versus participants receiving Trabut. Adjusted analyses will account for demographic
      characteristics as well as trichiasis severity prior to surgery.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of post-operative trichiasis defined as at least one trichiatic eyelashes or evidence of recent epilation. Trichiatic eyelashes are eyelashes touching the globe with the eye in the primary gaze. The outcome will be assessed at 3-6 months and at 12 months. If the eyelid has trichiasis at 2 weeks, but not at 3-6 months or 12 months, the eyelid will not be considered to have post-operative trichiasis.</description>

    <measure>Number of eyelids with each of the trichiasis severity levels at 3-6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Severity will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of eyelashes touching the globe and the amount of eyelashes epilated.
Trichiasis severity will be defined using the following categories:
i. Mild: 1-4 eyelashes touching globe and no epilation OR 1-10 eyelashes epilated and no eyelashes touching the globe ii. Moderate: 5-9 eyelashes touching globe and no epilation OR 1-4 eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated iii. Severe: 5-9 eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated OR 10+ eyelashes touching globe (regardless of epilation status) OR 11-20 eyelashes epilated (regardless of eyelashes touching globe) OR entire eyelid epilated</description>

    <measure>Change in severity of post-operative trichiasis between 3-6 months and 1 year using grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine progression of severity between 3-6 months and a year and assess predictors of change in severity. Change will be measured in terms of number of categories between 3-6 month and 1 year outcome. E.g. Mild to Severe would be a 2 category change.
Severity will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of eyelashes touching the globe and the amount of eyelashes epilated.
Trichiasis severity will be defined using the following categories:
i. Mild: 1-4 eyelashes touching globe and no epilation OR 1-10 eyelashes epilated and no eyelashes touching the globe ii. Moderate: 5-9 eyelashes touching globe and no epilation OR 1-4 eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated iii. Severe: 5-9 eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated OR 10+ eyelashes touching globe (regardless of epilation status) OR 11-20 eyelashes epilated (regardless of eyelashes touching globe) OR entire eyelid epilated</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of eyelids with moderate/severe eyelid contour abnormalities at 3-6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The eye examiner in the field will assess for eyelid contour abnormalities and grade the abnormalities as mild, moderate, or severe. For the analysis, no abnormality and mild eyelid contour abnormality will be combined, and moderate and severe eyelid contour abnormality will be combined. For secondary analyses, the investigators will classify eyelid contour abnormalities using the photographs to capture the full range of ECA categories: none, mild, moderate, and severe.
The definitions for the categories are: 1) Mild: Vertical deviation from the natural contour, 1 mm in height (less than half the pupil height in daylight) and affecting 1/3 of horizontal eyelid length. 2) Moderate: Vertical deviation from the natural contour 1-2 mm in height (about the pupil height in daylight) or affecting 1/3-2/3 of horizontal eyelid length 3) Severe: Vertical deviation from the natural contour 2 mm in height (more than the pupil height in daylight) or a defect &gt;2/3 of the horizontal eyelid length</description>

    <measure>Cumulative number of eyelids with presence of pyogenic granulomas within 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pyogenic granulomas occasionally develop after trichiasis surgery. It is thought that this is a response to a foreign material, such as a sutures or an incision edge. All granulomas will be noted regardless of size. The investigators will count granulomas observed at the 3-6 month visit (including participants where the granuloma was removed) and granulomas observed at 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Number of eyelids with other abnormalities at 12 months</measure>

    <description>The eye examiner will examine the eyes for other abnormalities at 12 months: gaps between eyelid and the eye, abnormally thick eyelid, overcorrected eyelids, and infections</description>
