  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) comprise of a heterogeneous group of entities that are
      benign, premalignant or malignant. With increased use of modern imaging techniques in recent
      years, incidentally discovered PCL have become much more common. However, imaging modalities
      for characterising PCL is a known clinical uncertainty since imaging is capable of detecting
      these lesions but may often not be able to distinguish malignant from benign lesions.
      Incorrect assessment of PCL can lead to fatal consequences because a malignant lesion may not
      be treated and a benign may be unnecessarily resected. The aim of this study was to assess
      the performance of endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the
      diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions compared to cross-sectional imaging modalities
      (CT/MRI). Our hypothesis is that EUS-FNA has a higher accuracy for diagnosing PCLs compared
      with cross-sectional imaging.
