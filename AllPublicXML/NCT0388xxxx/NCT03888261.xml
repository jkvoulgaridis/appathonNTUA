  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases are currently the most prevalent and most costly health conditions
      world-wide, and morbidity is expected to increase over coming years. Factors such that
      increased life-expectancy and certain life style-related factors, such as smoking, high-fat
      diet and alcohol-consumption, are commonly associated with the increase in most of the common
      chronic diseases. However, more complex psychosocial factors such as depression, stress,
      work-related dynamics and thinking patterns are thought be associated with poor health status
      and impaired health related quality of life among patients with suffering from chronic
      physical conditions (i.e. a biopsychosocial approach). Therefore, psychosocial intervention
      has been suggested as a complementary treatment strategy for patients with chronic
      conditions.

      The aim of this randomized trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of mind-body
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation on health-related quality of life, and disease specific
      endpoints in people with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or heart failure.

    <measure>WHO-Five Well-being Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. The WHO-5 consists of five statements. The total raw score, ranging from 0 to 25, is multiplied by 4 to give the final score, with 0 representing the worst imaginable well-being and 100 representing the best imaginable well-being.</description>

    <measure>SF36: Physical Component Summary (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

    <measure>Illness Perception Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. Every item is rated using a 0-10 response scale, a higher score reflecting a more threatening view of the illness.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh sleep quality index</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Self-Compassion Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. As a rough guide, a score of 1-2.5 for your overall self-compassion score indicates you are low in self-compassion, 2.5-3.5 indicates you are moderate, and 3.5-5.0 means you are high.</description>

    <measure>Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. ► Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. ► Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. ► Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress</description>

    <measure>Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 10-12 weeks (1-2 weeks post-intervention), and 26 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All participants. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. Higher score indicates worse depression or anxiety.</description>
