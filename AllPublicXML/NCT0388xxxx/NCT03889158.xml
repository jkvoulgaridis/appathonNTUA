  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on whether high cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults has a protective
      effect on the vascular response to acute inflammation in comparison to low-fit older and
      young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic inflammation both increase cardiovascular disease risk, especially with
      aging, which may be due to vascular dysfunction. Aging and inflammation also lead to
      increased oxidative stress, which impairs vascular function. During acute inflammation,
      endothelial function is altered differently in younger and older adults with decreases in
      endothelial function in younger, but not older adults. However, cardiorespiratory fitness is
      cardio-protective, impacting inflammation, vascular function, and oxidative stress. During
      acute inflammation, moderately fit older adults exhibit similar responses to younger adults,
      suggesting preserved endothelial reactivity. However, whether the protective mechanism is
      oxidative stress has not been confirmed. Furthermore, it is undetermined whether the vascular
      dysfunction is further propagated down the arterial tree during acute inflammation to the
      microvasculature.

      The aims of this research study are to determine if age and fitness moderate the vascular
      response to acute inflammation and to determine if antioxidant administration eliminates
      vascular dysfunction during acute inflammation. The results from this study will help to
      elucidate if fitness is a protective and preventive measure to ameliorate the detrimental
      cardiovascular response to acute inflammation. Thus, this study may provide health
      professionals with a behavioral intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease burden in the
      rapidly growing aging population.

    <description>Flow-mediated dilation - Brachial artery vasodilator function will be noninvasively measured through assessment of brachial artery dilation using ultrasonography. The brachial artery will be imaged proximal to placement of a blood pressure cuff just below the antecubital fossa. Endothelium-dependent dilation of the brachial artery will be measured at baseline and again for 5 minutes following ischemic stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the forearm to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes).
We are interested in:
How does endothelial function change before and during acute inflammation (Visit 2 baseline versus Visit 3 baseline) with varying fitness levels?
Is the change in endothelial function during acute inflammation due to oxidative stress and does this vary by fitness level? We will compare the change in endothelial function at baseline from Visit 1 before and after the Vitamin C to the change during acute inflammation in Visit 3 before and after Vitamin C.</description>

    <description>Central pulse wave velocity - Approximately 20-sec of pressure waveforms will be collected at the brachial, common carotid, and femoral arteries using a high-fidelity strain-gauge transducer. Pulse wave velocity will be calculated from the distances between measurement points and the measured time delay between proximal (carotid) and distal (femoral) waveforms.
