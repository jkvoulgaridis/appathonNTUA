    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of Bosutinib (Bosulif,Pfizer®) in the treatment of patients
      with Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Half participants will receive 100 mg of Bosutinib , while
      the other half will receive placebo.

    <textblock>
      This proposal will evaluate the effects of Bosutinib (Bosulif, Pfizer®) treatment - an
      FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c-Abelson (Abl) and Src tyrosine kinases-
      in patients with DLB. Investigators have demonstrated safety and efficacy of this compound in
      pre-clinical animal models and others have shown similar benefits of Bosutinib on
      inflammation and neurotoxic protein clearance in neurodegeneration. Investigators have
      demonstrated that Bosutinib enters the brain (5% CSF:plasma ratio) and inhibits Abl at lower
      doses (5mg/kg) than the cancer dose (80mg/kg) in animals. Bosutinib also reduces the levels
      of neurotoxic proteins including alpha-synuclein, tau and beta-amyloid and improves motor and
      cognitive behavior in models of neurodegeneration. The use of Bosutinib is a novel strategy
      that promotes autophagy to clear neurotoxic protein aggregates in neurons. Bosutinib is
      FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at an oral dose of
      400-600 mg daily. Based on our preclinical evidence, investigators used allometric conversion
      to extrapolate animal to human dose and estimated a human equivalent dose daily dose of 100mg
      Bosutinib in this clinical study to determine the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics in patients with mild to moderate DLB.

    <intervention_model_description>We will evaluate the effects of 100 mg Bosutinib versus matching placebo taken daily by mouth for 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week wash-out period in individuals diagnosed with DLB. We will perform physiologically-based population pharmacokinetics (popPK) using a seamless random single dose (RSD) of Bosutinib, where participants (n=30) will be randomized to 3 groups (n=10) and take a single oral dose of 100mg, 200mg, Bosutinib or placebo (1;1;1) open label. Lumbar puncture will be performed between 1-4 hours after dosing. Participants will then be randomized double-blinded into 2 groups 1;1 using placebo(n=15) and 100mg (n=15) for 3 months.
Randomization and Registration will be performed by an internet based randomization module. Randomization of the subjects to the 2 treatment groups will be performed in a stratified manner. The chance for randomization to the groups is 1:1 for placebo: 100 mg Bosutinib.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomized by a Biostatistician by an internet based randomization module into two groups. The researchers include : Primary investigator , Sub-Investigators ,Clinical Coordinators, Nurse Practitioners , and Clinical Reseach unit staff.
The investigators will be blinded to the dosage. Medications for any patient will be labeled by the CRU with a package medical identification number (Med. Id). A patient specific patient identification number (Pat. Id.) will be assigned to each patient. The investigator will have to note the Pat.Id on the designated medication package number after randomization.</masking_description>

    <measure>Safety and tolerability Go/NoGo (25% discontinuations) will be determined based on any emergent adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine safety and tolerability using the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) of interest, including myelosuppression, urinary, pancreatic and hepatic disorders, QTc prolongation as per Bosutinib IB.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>We will determine Bosutinib levels in CSF and plasma.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>We have demonstrated that Bosutinib enters the brain (5% CSF: plasma ratio) and inhibits Abl at lower doses (5mg/kg) than the cancer dose (80mg/kg) in animals. We predict that Bosutinib will be detected in the CSF. We will measure Bosutinib in both the CSF and Plasma and perform population pharmacokinetics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>We will determine changes in DLB related CSF and plasma biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma biomarkers include HVA, DOPAC, Abeta40/42, total tau, ptau231/181 and total and oligomeric alpha-synuclein. We expect Bosutinib to lower the levels of CSF markers of cell death, including neuron specific enolase (NSE), S100B and phosphorylated neurofilaments. We will also examine the effects of Bosutinib on other exploratory CSF and plasma inflammatory biomarkers, including triggering receptors on myeloid cells (TREM)-2, which is a potential risk factor for neurodegeneration.</description>
