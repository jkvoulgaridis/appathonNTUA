      1. Background During the last years, the brain has been identified as a major
           insulin-sensitive organ . The investigators and also other scientists identified
           hypothalamus, fusiform gyrus and prefrontal cortex as major insulin-sensitivity brain
           areas in humans . Brain insulin action regulates important physiological functions in
           humans such as food intake, body weight regulation, and cognition. Furthermore, animal
           studies suggest that insulin action specifically in the brain is involved in the control
           of peripheral glucose metabolism via regulation of the sensitivity to insulin in the
           rest of the body. Recently, the investigators were able to replicate these findings in
           humans: The investigators measured whole-body insulin sensitivity in combination with
           the well-established experimental delivery of human insulin to the brain via an
           intranasal approach. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was profoundly improved by brain
           insulin action in lean but not in obese healthy volunteers. What determines the
           effectiveness of this brain-derived pathway is still unknown. Furthermore, insulin
           resistance of the brain is linked to neurodegenerative diseases possibly explaining the
           elevated risk for such diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes.

           GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to acutely modulate appetite- and reward-related
           brain areas in humans. Research in animals suggest a close interaction between insulin
           and GLP-1 action especially in homeostatic centers of the hypothalamus. In this context,
           it is important that GLP-1 sensitivity of the brain is still present in the insulin
           resistant human brain.

           The investigators therefore hypothesized that GLP-1 agonists are able to improve insulin
           sensitivity of the brain; this might be one mechanism how GLP-1 agonists lead to weight
           loss and improved glucose metabolism. This might also have beneficial implications for
           cognitive function.

           However, at present, there are no human studies examining the effect of a GLP-1 agonist
           on brain activity and especially insulin action in the brain in patients with type 2
           diabetes mellitus (T2D).

           Furthermore, there is no study in humans examining the effect of newly initiated insulin
           therapy on brain activity and especially insulin action in the brain in patients with
           T2D.

        2. Rationale Based on the close interplay between hypothalamic insulin and GLP-1
           signalling, the investigators hypothesize that the antidiabetic therapy with insulin
           glargine/lixisenatide combination (iGlarLixi) induces improved hypothalamic and
           prefrontal insulin sensitivity compared to a therapy with insulin glargine alone. This
           could underlay iGlarLixi's beneficial effects on body weight and whole-body glucose
           homeostasis.

        3. Objective To assess whether treatment with iGlarLixi versus insulin glargine changes
           brain regional insulin sensitivity and thereby glucose metabolism, eating behaviour, and
           cognition in patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled with oral
           antidiabetic drugs (OAD).
