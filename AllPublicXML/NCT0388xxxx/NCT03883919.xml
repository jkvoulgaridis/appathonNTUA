  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the efficacy of nanoliposomal irinotecan as a second-line regimen in pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC), together with the favorable toxicity profile of paricalcitol and its
      interplay with irinotecan metabolism, the investigators propose a second-line pilot study in
      advanced PDAC that will enroll patients who have progressed on a gemcitabine-based regimen.

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of cycle 9 (estimated to be 18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 72 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS: PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
