  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several Drugs used in routine care in oncology induce rare but often severe or fatal
      cardiovascular or metabolic side effects. This study will investigate, evaluate, report and
      treat the cardiovascular side effects of anticancer drugs, through a specific cardiovascular
      routine checkup and follow-up taking place in several Cardio-oncology programs throughout
      France. The different including centers will be: Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris
      (APHP.6: Pitié-Salpétrière, Saint Antoine and Tenon's hospitals, Paris, France).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several anticancer and supportive care drugs used in oncology have an impact on the
      cardiovascular and metabolic systems, leading to a wide range of cardiovascular and metabolic
      disorders and side effects. Those are poorly described, due to the evolution of the
      anticancer pharmacopeia, and recent recognition of these adverse events. This study will
      investigate the potential benefits of a specialized cardio-oncology check-up and follow-up in
      this context.
