  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Can a novel electronic display of pain be successfully used in the emergency department and
      does it (1) change analgesic prescription and (2) change amount of pain experienced? Pain is
      a common symptom in emergency care. As patients are seldom reassessed, staff may not be aware
      of pain. Currently, members of nursing or medical staff need to ask patients about their pain
      and record it manually using a visual analogue scale from 0-10.

      The new electronic display uses buttons to represent a pain scale from 0 (no pain) to 10
      (worst pain). Patients will select the number that best corresponds to their pain every 15
      minutes. In the experimental group, the score will be displayed on a screen. In the control
      group, the score will not be displayed. The investigators will compare the overall amount of
      pain in both groups, and will look at their pain management (painkillers prescribed). The
      investigators will also ask patients and staff for their opinions on the display.

      The study will include adult patients in the emergency department at Leicester Royal
      Infirmary with an initial pain score of 5 or more who are able to make a decision about
      whether to participate. Participants will also need to be likely to stay in the hospital for
      more than 2 hours to allow the investigators to gather enough useful data. The study will
      recruit 200 participants. If the study can demonstrate that the monitor is acceptable to
      patients and staff and results in improved pain management, it is a low cost intervention
      which could be widely implemented within the NHS. It also has the potential for being used in
      other areas such as surgical wards. The investigators have previously found that 300-400
      patients per week in the department have moderate to severe pain and might therefore benefit
      from this monitor.

    <description>Data collected from the display using the 11 point numerical pain scale. The area under the curve will be compared between the intervention and control groups.

    <description>The scores recorded by the participants at 2 and 4 hours into their hospital stay will be compared with the scores recorded by nursing staff in the electronic record. The 11 point numerical rating scale is used for both measurements. The Numerical Rating Scale is a scale from 0-10 (whole numbers only, where 0 represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'worst pain ever').</description>

    <description>Uses a short (4 question) questionnaire designed for this study. Questions on ease of use, whether the monitor is a good idea, whether participants would use it again in the future and whether it improved their experience as a patient, plus a comments box.
Questions: 1) How easy was it to use the pain monitor? (very easy, easy, no opinion, difficult, very difficult) 2) I think that the pain monitor is a good idea (strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree) 3) I would use the monitor again in the future (strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree) 4) The pain monitor improved my experience as a patient (strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree)</description>

    <description>Short (4 question) questionnaire designed for the study. Questions on whether the display is practical to use in the Emergency Department, whether they think it is a good idea, whether it is likely to improve the patient experience and whether a patient used the display to get their attention for a reason other than pain. Also has a comments box.
