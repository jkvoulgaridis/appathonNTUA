  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the role of two endogenous inhibitory mechanisms; exercise-induced
      hypoalgesia (EIH) and a conditioning painful stimulus (CPM) on passive joint range of motion,
      passive resistive torque and pain sensitivity. The study is a randomized, repeated-measures
      cross-over study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increase in range of motion following stretching is related to changes in the tolerance
      to stretch. The mechanistic relationships behind these changes in subject sensation are
      however unknown but could be related to endogenous modulation of pain.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a randomized, repeated-measures cross-over study. Passive knee extension range of motion was measured three consecutive times with five-minute intervals between measurements. Both groups underwent a static stretch protocol consisting of two bouts of thirty-second constant-angle static stretching of the knee flexors with a one-minute rest between bouts. Subjects were instructed to keep the limb relaxed as the lower leg was passively moved towards extension. Following stretching, the post-stretch measurement was performed. Finally, subjects in the pain group were instructed to immerse their non-dominant hand into a container with circulating water at 1˚C to 4˚C and keep it there for 2 minutes. A Biodex system 4 pro dynamometer was used to quantify range of motion and passive resistive torque. Pressure pain thresholds was assessed using a handheld pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Hörby, Sweden).</intervention_model_description>
