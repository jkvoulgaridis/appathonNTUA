  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of simultaneous innervation to prevent
      graft bone resorption in maxillofacial reconstruction. It may provide basis for future
      clinical trials and new strategies for improving the functional reconstruction of large jaw
      bone defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of autograft is still the main method for reconstructing large defects of jaw bones.
      However, the spontaneous resorption of the graft bone is still severe, and hinders the
      success of dental implant(s) and chewing function even after microsurgical vascularization.
      But till now, there is no effective prevention method for this major problem. Based on
      previous studies, the investigators pioneered a simultaneous innervated vascularized iliac
      bone graft method, through neurorrhaphy between the nerves innervating iliac bone and
      recipient site. A clinical retrospective study showed that this new method significantly
      decreases postoperative osteoporosis, and ensures the success of dental implants (Refer to
      our published article Wang L*, Wei J, Yang X, Yang Z, Sun M, Cheng X, Xu L, Lei D, Zhang C*.
      Preventing early-stage graft bone resorption by simultaneous innervation: innervated iliac
      bone flap for mandibular reconstruction. PlastIc Reconstructive Surgery, 2017,
      139(5):1152e-1161e, Cover Featured Article).

      The investigators intend to randomly divide the vascularized iliac bone graft cases into
      traditional group without innervation and simultaneous innervation group (through
      neurorrhaphy between the nerves innervating iliac bone flap and recipient site). The efficacy
      of simultaneously innervated maxillofacial reconstruction for preventing graft bone
      resorption will be assessed using bone mineral density test of grafted bone, as a blinded
      method. The innervation and sensation of the internal oblique abdominis muscle island will be
      tested using neuroelectrophysiological examination. The recipient nerve having the best
      effect on preventing bone resorption, will be determined using hierarchical comparison
      method.

    <description>The decreased ratio of the graft bone hounsfield unit calculated by Spiral CT examination ( The hounsfield unit value before bone graft - the hounsfield unit value 1 year after bone graft). It is used to reflect the degree of bone resorption. The efficiency is defined as: the decreased ratio of graft bone hounsfield unit value is less than 10%.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 1 year follow-up after bone grafting.</time_frame>
    <description>The innervation and sensation in the muscle island of innervated graft bone flap will be tested using neuroelectrophysiological and needling response examination. The graft bone samples taken by hollow drilling technique during the dental implant(s) procedure will be observed by silver staining. If medullated sensory nerve fibers will be observed, then it indicates successful innervation.</description>
