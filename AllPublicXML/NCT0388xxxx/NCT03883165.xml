  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport-related concussion is a common and serious injury that can affect athletes of all ages
      in any sport. The purpose of this project is to study the effect of a 12-week manual
      resistance neck strengthening exercise program on participants' neck size and strength and
      how their heads and necks move during simulated sport-associated tasks. This study will help
      determine if greater neck strength may lower an athlete's risk of sport-related concussion.
      Each healthy male and female soccer athlete between the ages of 13-19 enrolled in the study
      will participate for approximately four months. Study participation includes routine visits
      with various assessments (i.e. certain body measurements, magnetic resonance imaging,
      ultrasound) in addition to the strengthening exercise program.

    <description>All subjects will exercise 2 days per week for 12 weeks under the direct supervision of a study-assigned strength coach with a minimum of 1 day of rest between exercise sessions.
Participants will perform a standardized set of general resistance exercises targeting the chest, shoulders, back, upper and lower extremities, and core. Additionally, they will also perform a higher number of repetitions of manual resistance neck strengthening exercises in sagittal plane flexion and extension, coronal plane lateral flexion in both directions, and axial plane rotation in both directions,as well as dumbbell shoulder shrugs.</description>
