  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with COPD and a history of recent exacerbation, to compare the quality of life
      after completing a joint program of health education and respiratory rehabilitation with
      those patients who only receive respiratory rehabilitation. To compare lung function, the
      distance traveled in the 6-minute walk test and in the test of the shuttle between both
      groups. Also, to compare between both groups adherence to inhaled treatment, physical
      activity, and emotional condition. Finally, to compare the number of visits to emergencies
      and hospitalizations, and on the other hand, the number of mild, moderate and severe
      exacerbations between both groups

    <textblock>
      In this trial we selected COPD patients with a history of recent exacerbation to be submitted
      to a respiratory rehabilitation program with or without a individualized program of health
      education. We try to demonstrate a better improvement in the quality of life after completing
      a joint program of health education and respiratory rehabilitation in this patients than
      those one who only receive respiratory rehabilitation. We also want to demonstrate an
      improvement in lung function, the distance travelled in the 6-minute walk test and in the
      test of the shuttle, the adherence to inhaled treatment, the physical activity, the emotional
      condition, the number of visits to emergencies and hospitalizations and the number of mild,
      moderate and severe exacerbations between both groups.

    <description>The education sessions will be given in 3 opportunities (15-30, 45 and at 90 days from diagnosis of the exacerbation) and it will be individualized. The program will include measures of self-care and self-management recommended in patients with COPD:
Plan of action in an exacerbation.
Education related to COPD.
Information on pharmacological medication.
Management of the exacerbation.
Management of stress and / or anxiety.
Nutritional recommendations.
Physical exercise recommendations.
Healthy lifestyle recommendations. The first session will last 90 minutes and will be explain according to the contents of the manual &quot;Controlling COPD&quot;.
