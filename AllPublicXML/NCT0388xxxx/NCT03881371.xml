  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the effects of 100 mg safinamide, administered orally once daily (OD), in Chinese
      Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, experiencing motor fluctuations while on stable doses of
      Levodopa (L-dopa) (alone or in combination with other anti-Parkinson drugs). Eligible
      patients are required to meet the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic
      Criteria. The study involves a placebo group. Placebo will be added to the standard
      stabilized treatment as a control of the safinamide group, hence patients on placebo will
      have benefit from other ongoing anti-PD medication. A total of 306 patients will be
      randomised into this study (153 in the safinamide and 153 in the placebo groups).

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 16 in the mean total daily &quot;OFF&quot; time, as assessed by 24-hour patient diary cards, of safinamide 100 mg/day compared to placebo, given as add-on therapy in PD patients with motor fluctuations on stable doses of L-dopa.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of primary efficacy parameter will be done using an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with treatment and centre as independent factor, baseline mean &quot;OFF&quot; time measurement as covariate and change from baseline as dependent variable. Results will be reported as Least-Square Means for treatment differences with associated two-tailed 95% confidence intervals and corresponding two-sided p-values. The main time point for comparison between treatment groups is week 16, but other available measurements at other visits will be analysed as well.</description>

    <description>The analysis of key secondary efficacy parameter will be done using an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with treatment and centre as independent factor, baseline NRS measurement as covariate and change from baseline as dependent variable. Results will be reported as Least-Square Means for treatment differences with associated two-tailed 95% confidence intervals and corresponding two-sided p-values. The main time point for comparison between treatment groups is week 16, but other available measurements at other visits will be analyzed as well. The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analogue scale (VAS) in which a patient selects a whole number that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain, ranging from '0' (&quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;).</description>

Part II: Evaluation of the activities of daily life. Part III: Evaluation of motor function. Part IV: Evaluation of complications of therapy. The UPDRS should be performed by the Investigator with points assigned to each item in the scale based on the patient's response as well as observation and physical examination. Together Parts I-III contain 44 items, with each item scored on a 5-point scale. Part IV contains 11 questions with a scale ranging from 0 to 23. Thus, the final total score may range from 0 (no disability) to 199 (total disability).</description>

    <description>The hypothesis of superiority of safinamide compared to placebo will be assessed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test stratified by centre, whilst point estimate of treatment differences will be reported as Hodges-Lehmann estimators together with associated two-sided nonparametric 95% confidence intervals. The CGI-S scale measures global severity of illness at a given point in time. It will be rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (normal, not ill at all) to 7 (extremely severe).

The CGI-C scale will measure the change in the patient's clinical status from baseline using a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), with a score of 4 indicating no change. The change from the patient's baseline condition will be assessed by the Investigator at all post-baseline visits. In completing the CGI-C, the rater will review all efficacy-related data, and assess its clinical meaningfulness.</description>

The PDQ-39 comprises 39 questions measuring eight dimensions of health: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication and bodily pain. Dimension scores are coded on a scale of 0 (perfect health as assessed by the measure) to 100 (worst health as assessed by the measure).</description>
