  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust is committed to improving patient experienceÍ¾ this
      research is being undertaken to try to develop a novel treatment for patients with Acute
      Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). Researchers aim to develop a new therapy which uses a patient's own
      immune cells called T cells to treat AML. In this study, numbers and properties of T cells
      which can be collected from the blood of patients with AML at various points throughout their
      treatment will be investigated. Blood samples will be collected at the same time as the
      patient's bone marrow test.

      If patients need further bone marrow tests during their course of treatment to assess the
      status of disease, the research team would ask that additional samples are taken at the same
      time as the bone marrow and blood will be collected at the same time as the routine blood
      draw.

      Following collection of blood samples, they will be used to purify a population of blood
      cells called Gamma Delta T cells which have been shown to have a potential role in control of
      cancers. In addition the researchers plan to determine whether it is possible to put a novel
      receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to potentially directly target leukaemia
      cells. Currently this is only an exploratory study and none of the samples collected will be
      used for treatment and is only to assess whether or not this strategy is feasible. This may
      however lead on to studies in the future looking at the safety and effectiveness of this
      strategy. This hopefully will lead in the future to improvements in treatment and outcome for
      patients with AML.
