    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide a new therapeutic theory which bases on the percutaneous sliding
      technique with three hemi-cuts in the tendon. In this study, Achilles tendon parenchymal at
      distal level is hemisected through the most distal incision, Achilles tendon parenchymal at
      proximal level is hemisected through the middle incision, then Achilles tendon lengthening is
      accomplished by the sliding tendon under forceful dorsiflexion. It can better achieve soft
      tissue balance and reduce the recurrence of Achilles tendon contracture when Achilles tendon
      strength in plantarflexion is weakened. Thus in this study, the partial aponeurosis of
      gastrocnemius is cut off at most proximal incision in order to weaken Achilles tendon
      strength in plantarflexion.
