    <textblock>
      This is one project of a larger ongoing study related to the immune system's response to the
      flu virus. This study is designed to investigate the immune response to a nasal flu
      immunization in tonsillar tissue compared to what can be measured in the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study of licensed influenza vaccines with up to 50 male and female
      volunteers, 2-49 years of age. Volunteers were patients undergoing tonsillectomy for
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other non-infectious indication as part of
      their routine medical care.

      The investigator intends to collect blood and lymphoid tissues routinely discarded during
      surgery from adults and children after routine seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccination
      (LAIV) to determine how immune memory develops at the actual site of infection, and how
      immunization may alter this process.

      The first research study visit will take place approximately 3-14 days prior to the scheduled
      date of tonsillectomy surgery. During this visit, 20 mL blood sample will be obtained and
      participants will receive FluMist (intranasal, quadrivalent, live-attenuated influenza
      vaccine). This is one of the routinely available and recommended vaccines for the age groups
      included in this study.

      The second study visit will take place on the same day of the scheduled surgery for the
      tonsillectomy. Another blood sample (maximum volume of 20 mL) will be collected along with
      the discarded tonsillar tissue. Blood and tissues will be sent to the lab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 2-49-year-old male and female patients undergoing tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep
             apnea or other non-infectious indication.

          2. Willing and able to complete the informed consent process

          3. Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study

          4. Acceptable medical history by review of inclusion/exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior off-study vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine within three months of
             study vaccination

          2. Life-threatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations

          3. Asthma (contraindication for receipt of LAIV4)

          4. Allergy to egg or egg products or to vaccine components including gentamicin, gelatin,
             arginine or MSG.

          5. Active systemic or serious concurrent illness, including febrile illness on the day of
             vaccination

          6. History of immunodeficiency (including HIV infection)

          7. Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function; may include significant liver
             disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin or moderate to severe renal disease

          8. Hospitalization in the past year for congestive heart failure or emphysema.

          9. Chronic Hepatitis B or C.

         10. Recent or current use of immunosuppressive medication, including systemic
             glucocorticoids (corticosteroid nasal sprays and topical steroids are permissible).
             Use of oral steroids (&lt;20mg prednisone-equivalent/day) may be acceptable after review
             by the investigator.

         20. Need for allergy immunization (that cannot be postponed) until after the last study
             visit.

         21. History of Guillain-Barre# syndrome

         22. Pregnant or breastfeeding woman

         25. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with
             volunteer safety, study objectives or the ability of the participant to understand or
