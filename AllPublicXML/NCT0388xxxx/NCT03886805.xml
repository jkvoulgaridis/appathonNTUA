  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of different modalities of dual-task training in the
      improvement of gait biomechanics, postural balance, falls episodes, executive functioning and
      quality of life in community-dwelling older adults. Half of the participants will be
      undertaken a dual-task protocol training with progression from variable-priority to
      fixed-priority instructions, while the other half will be undertaken a dual-task protocol
      training under variable-priority instructions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although dual-task training for improving postural balance is an emerging interest area, the
      effects of dual tasks and dual-task training on static and dynamic postural stability remain
      unclear. Even though variable (alternating) instructional priority dual-task training has
      been shown higher effect than fixed (concurrent) priority dual-task training approach to
      improving the balance impairments, we must consider in everyday pragmatic situations, motor,
      and cognitive tasks are often demanded simultaneously and this requires an individual's
      attention toward an external source of attention while performing a primary task. Then, our
      rationale for this study is older adults underwent a protocol training composed of a dual
      task with variable and fixed instructional priority will achieve better improvements
      regarding the studied variables in comparison to the group who will be submitted a protocol
      composed only by dual-task with variable priority training. Therefore, this protocol for a
      six-month, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with six-month follow-up post-training
      will examine whether a dual-task protocol training with progression from variable priority to
      fixed priority instructions is effective in improvement of gait biomechanics, postural
      balance, falls episodes, executive functioning and quality of life in community-dwelling
      older adults.
