      The researchers are trying to assess changes in physiological signals before and during
      seizures.

      Subjects that are undergoing video EEG monitoring in their home for their epilepsy at Seer
      Medical will be consented to participate in this study for a minimum of two days and/or the
      duration of their monitoring period for their clinical care. Subjects will be asked to wear
      up to 4 different commercially available seizure detection devices and complete surveys.

      When the subjects clinical EEG monitoring is completed data scientists will analyze the data
      to identify patterns.

    <measure>Multimodal Assessment of Physiological Signals During Seizure Events Measurable with Wearable Sensors</measure>
    <time_frame>2-7 days approximately</time_frame>
    <description>We will collect physiological signals with the three wearable, noninvasive biosensors in Seer Medical patients undergoing scalp-recorded video EEG-ECG as part of their clinical epilepsy evaluation. These signals include temperature, light level, EEG, heart rate, galvanic skin response, PPG, accelerometry. We will evaluate biosignals based on reliability to detect seizures.</description>

    <measure>Wearable Sensors Comfort Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2-7 days approximately</time_frame>
    <description>We will collect physiological signals with the three wearable, noninvasive biosensors in Seer Medical patients. We will evaluate subject comfort and ease of use for each device, measured through quantitative surveys.</description>

    <measure>Seizure Detection and Prediction using Multimodal Physiological Data</measure>
    <time_frame>2-7 days approximately</time_frame>
    <description>We will apply data mining and machine learning methods to identify patterns in the collected physiological signals and correlate these patterns with the timing of seizures identified by the patient's clinical video-EEG monitoring. We will use sensitivity and specificity measures to determine which signals are most useful in detecting and predicting seizure events.</description>
