  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia affects an average of 2% of the French population. Data from the literature
      report that low levels of magnesium could be associated with fibromyalgia. However, no study
      to date has investigated the effect of oral magnesium administration on stress in
      fibromyalgia.

      This trial therefore aims to evaluate whether magnesium could improve stress and the various
      disorders that contribute to the complexity of fibromyalgia, including pain, cognition, sleep
      disorders and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study of the use of
      magnesium in fibromyalgia. The effect of magnesium on stress measured by DASS-42 over 28 days
      after taking magnesium / placebo will be studied.

      The secondary objectives will evaluate the evolution of the scores of all the tests and
      questionnaires carried out before taking magnesium or placebo (D0: Visit 2), then at D0 + 28
      (visit 3) and D0 + 84 days (visit 4 corresponding to the end-of-study visit).

      Secondary parameters are the following :

      Impact of fibromyalgia, heart rate variability, pain intensity, cognition, feelings of
      patients, impression of change, sleep quality, fatigue intensity, social vulnerability,
      catastrophism, presence of small fiber neuropathy, concentration of magnesium, analysis of
      microbiota and evaluation of genetic factor.

      Blood magnesium and magnesuria will be measured.
