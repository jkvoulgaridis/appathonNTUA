    <textblock>
      This study evaluated whether patients with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) who
      received coordinated co-located behavioral health and primary care services were more likely
      to improve health outcomes after 12 months compared to SPMI patients who receive only
      behavioral health services from the local mental health authority (LMHA) Tropical Texas
      Behavioral Health (TTBH).The study employed a randomized control trial (RCT) design where
      intervention participants receiving integrated behavioral health were compared to control
      participants receiving the usual care provided within an LMHA for SPMI patients. Patients
      were placed in each group using a randomized number process. Demographic and health outcome
      data were collected from intervention and control participants at baseline. Health outcome
      data was subsequently collected at 6-month and 12-month follow-up points.

      were placed in each group using a randomized number process. Demographic and health outcome
      data were collected from intervention and control participants at baseline. Health outcome
      data was subsequently collected at 6-month and 12-month follow-up points. The primary outcome
      of interest was systolic blood pressure. Additional secondary outcomes of interest were
      diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, BMI, total cholesterol, depressive symptoms, and life
      functioning. These outcomes were analyzed as continuous variables using linear regression
      with backward model selection. Longitudinal analyses were also conducted using a
      likelihood-based approach to general linear mixed models.The intervention and control groups
      were patients with an SPMI diagnosis over 18 years of age who were not receiving primary care
      services prior to enrollment and were eligible to receive behavioral health services from
      TTBH. The participants resided in Cameron or Hidalgo County and had one or more chronic
      conditions: hypertension (blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher), poorly controlled
      diabetes (HbA1c over 8.5%), obesity (body mass index of 30.0 or higher), or
      hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol level above 200).
