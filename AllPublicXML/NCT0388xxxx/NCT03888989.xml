  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one project of a larger ongoing study related to the immune system's response to the
      flu virus. This study is designed to investigate the immune response to vaccination in
      pregnancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study of licensed influenza vaccines with up to 50 pregnant female
      volunteers, 18-49 years of age. Investigator intends to collect blood from pregnant women and
      then from the same women a year later when they are not pregnant after routine seasonal
      influenza vaccination. By studying the blood of immunized pregnant women and in these same
      women after pregnancy, the investigator will gain a better understanding of the immune
      response to vaccination in pregnancy and after pregnancy.

      Each volunteer will participate for approximately 4 weeks including enrollment, vaccination,
      and completion of sample collection in 2 consecutive flu seasons. The Study has a total of 6
      visits over 2 Flu seasons.

      Study procedures:

      Year One:

      First Visit: Procedures during this visit are: Informed consent process, enrollment, study
      assessments, 20 ml blood draw, and vaccination.

      2nd and 3rd visits: 20 ml blood will be obtained

      Year Two:

      First Visit: Study assessments, 20 ml blood draw, and vaccination. 2nd and 3rd visits: 20 ml
      blood will be obtained

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18-49-year-old pregnant woman

          2. Willing and able to complete the informed consent process

          3. Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study with the expected
             delivery date more than 28 days after vaccination

          4. Acceptable medical history by review of inclusion/exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior off-study vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine within three months of
             study vaccination

          2. Life-threatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations

          3. Allergy to egg or egg products or to vaccine components including gentamicin, gelatin,
             or arginine.

          4. Active systemic or serious concurrent illness, including febrile illness on the day of
             vaccination

          5. History of immunodeficiency (including HIV infection)

          6. Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function; may include significant liver
             disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin or moderate to severe renal disease

          7. Chronic Hepatitis B or C.

          8. Recent or current use of immunosuppressive medication, including systemic
             glucocorticoids (corticosteroid nasal sprays and topical steroids are permissible).

             vaccination prior to completion of last study visit (~ 28 days after study enrollment)

         17. Need for allergy immunization (that cannot be postponed) until after the last study
             visit.

         18. History of Guillain-Barre# syndrome

         19. Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to enrollment or planned use during
             the study.

             donation of platelets within 2 weeks of enrollment or planned donation prior to
             completion of the last visit.

         21. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with
             volunteer safety, study objectives or the ability of the participant to understand or
             comply with the study protocol.
