  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a complex and chronic inflammatory disorder which is associated with reversible
      airway obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. It is one of the most prevalent chronic
      diseases in children and prevalence further increases worldwide. Typical symptoms of asthma
      are breathlessness, cough, wheezing and chest tightness. These symptoms are particularly
      prevalent at night-time. Understanding and tracking these symptoms can lead to better
      management of asthma.

      Auscultation using a stethoscope is standard clinical practice, however there is currently no
      available solution to detect respiratory sounds throughout the day and night.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of detecting respiratory sounds in
      healthy children with the CoVa patch.
