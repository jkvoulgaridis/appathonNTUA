      This is a Phase 2 study using talimogene laherparepvec, nivolumab, and trabectedin as first,
      second or third line therapy for advanced sarcoma, including desmoid tumor and chordoma. The
      primary objective is to determine progression-free survival (PFS) at month 12. The secondary
      objectives are (1) To evaluate the best overall response (BOR) and duration of response (DOR)
      by RECIST v1.1 via CT scan or MRI at 6,12,18, and 24 weeks post treatment, (2) To determine
      progression-free survival rate (PFS) at 6 and 9 months, (3) To determine overall survival
      rate at 6, 9, and 12 months, (4) To determine the incidence of conversion of an unresectable
      tumor to a resectable tumor, and (5) To evaluate the incidence of adverse events related to
      TALIMOGENE LAHERPAREPVEC in combination with nivolumab and trabectedin. The exploraratory
      objective is to correlate response with immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment
      (TME) of resected tumors.

      The primary endpoint is Progression free survival at month 12. The secondary endpoints are:
      1) Best overall response (BOR) and duration of response (DOR) by RECIST v1.1 via CT scan or
      MRI at 6,12,18 and 24 weeks post treatment, 2) PFS rate at 6 and 9 months

      • Overall survival rate at 6, 9, and 12 months, 3) Incidence of conversion of an unresectable
      tumor to a resectable tumor, 4) Incidence of adverse events related to TALIMOGENE
      LAHERPAREPVEC in combination with nivolumab and trabectedin. The exploratory endpoint is
      correlation of response with immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment of
      resected tumors.

      Forty male and female subjects &gt; 18 years of age, of any ethnicity, with advanced sarcoma,
      including desmoid tumor and chordoma will be treated.
