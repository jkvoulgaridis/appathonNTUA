  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to investigate the effects of Trigger Point-Dry Needling Therapy
      (TP-DNT) on night pain and Shoulder Internal Rotation (SIR) in individuals with Subacromial
      Pain Syndrome (SPS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain seen intensely in the general population, many methods has been used for the
      treatment which has not been fully proven to be superior to each other. Before considering
      surgical approaches, trying conservative approaches is emphasized. While literature showed us
      that nighttime pain is an important musculoskeletal symptom, may be associated with local
      inflammation, it is an important feature during the treatment planning. TP-DNT had positive
      effects on night pain and SIR in SPS. It was seen that the treatment satisfaction level of
      participants was high. Despite these positive findings, there is need for further studies in
      which sample size is increased, control group is added, and long-term follow-up is planned.

    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS was used to measure the mean pain intensity of rest time activity and night time over the previous 3 days . The 10-cm scale was marked with &quot;0&quot; (no pain) and &quot;10&quot; (worst imaginable pain), and the patients were instructed on how to use the scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The goniometric measurement method measures the range of active internal movements of the internal rotation with pre-treatment and after 8 sessions. The movement is repeated 3 times and recorded with the average.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS aims to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression and consists of 14 items, seven items for the anxiety subscale (HADS Anxiety) and seven for the depression subscale (HADS Depression). HADS Anxiety focus mainly on symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and HADS Depression is focused on anhedonia, the main symptom of depression. Each item is scored on a response-scale with four alternatives ranging between 0 and 3. After adjusting for six items that are reversed scored, all responses are summed to obtain the two subscales.</description>

    <measure>Nothingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>NHP is a general quality-of-life questionnaire that measures health problems that a person perceives and how these problems affect normal daily activities. The questionnaire consists of 38 items and evaluates six dimensions of health status: energy (3 items), pain (8 items), emotional reactions (9 items), sleep (5 items), social isolation (5 items) and physical activity (8 matter). Questions are answered yes or no. Each section is scored from 0 to 100 points. 0 indicates the best health status, 100 worst health status. NHP score and total NHP score were evaluated. Total NHP score was obtained from the sum of the sub-scores</description>

    <description>Participants were administered trigger point dry kneedling technique 6 times for 1 month, once every 5 days. The subject was positioned prone and the arm position was slightly changed related with the muscle. After the skin inspection it was cleaned with the alcohol. .</description>

    <description>Deep friction massage was applied transversely unlike the superficial massage and sufﬁciently deep to the ﬁber direction of affected connective tissue to maintain the mobility. Totally 6 sessions were administered twice a week for 3 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Trigger Point Dry Needling Technique</intervention_name>
    <description>The type of needle and the depth of the entrance varied depending on the estimated muscle thickness (0.25 - 25 mm, 0.25 - 30 mm and 0.25-40 mm). The disposable stainless-steel sterile needles were inserted through the skin over the trigger point in the taut band of muscle using the fast-in/out technique. Forward and backward needling was repeated until the local twitch responses were obtained. The depth of the needle was changed depending on the muscle thickness. After the first local twitch response, the needle was moved up and down 3 to 5 mm in only vertical directions until no more local twitch responses were elicited. After removing the needle, the insertion area was compressed with a piece of cotton</description>

    <description>For supporting the normal healing conditions, the deep and transverse friction causes hyperaemia in the involved soft tissue, which results in increased blood ﬂow to the area.</description>
