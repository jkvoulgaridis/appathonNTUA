  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF) may experience
      feeding and swallowing difficulties, which result in stressful interactions between children
      and caregivers, and potentially impact the concerns of caregivers. The aim of this study was
      to assess concerns of caregivers of children with EA-TEF related to feeding-swallowing
      difficulties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with repaired esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF) experience some
      degrees of feeding and swallowing difficulties Feeding and swallowing difficulties cause
      aspiration-induced recurrent pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration and stressful interactions
      with their caregivers. There is lack of knowledge regarding the concerns of caregivers of
      children with EA-TEF related to feeding and swallowing disorders.Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to assess concerns of caregivers of children with EA-TEF related to
      feeding-swallowing difficulties.

    <measure>The Turkish Feeding/Swallowing Impact Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish Feeding/Swallowing Impact Survey (T-FS-IS) is used to describe the quality of life related to activities of daily living, worry and feeding difficulty of caregivers of children. It has 18 questions. Daily activities indicate caregivers' perceptions of time demands on daily activities. Worry is the worry of the caregivers about the children's well-being. Feeding difficulty is related to the challenges during delivery of care specific to feeding/swallowing. Each question of the instrument will be answered on a 5-point Likert scale between 1 to 5. A score of '1' indicates never, and a score of '5' indicates almost always. All scores from 18 questions in the T-FS-IS will be summed, and then divided by 18 to calculate an average total score. Scores within each subscale will also be added together, and then divided by the total number of questions in the subscale to calculate an average subscale score. Higher scores from the instrument represent decreased quality of life.</description>
