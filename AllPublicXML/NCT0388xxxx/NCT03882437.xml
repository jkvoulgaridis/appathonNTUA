  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open-label Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of gene
      therapy using a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) containing the human
      lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform B (LAMP2B) transgene (investigational product
      (IP), RP-A501) in male patients with Danon Disease (DD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized open-label Phase I clinical trial to characterize the safety
      and toxicity associated with infusion of a recombinant adeno-associated serotype 9 (rAAV9)
      capsid containing the human lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform B (LAMP2B)
      transgene (investigational product (IP), RP-A501) in male patients with Danon Disease (DD).

      During the course of the study, approximately 12-24 subjects will receive a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of the IP, with up to 4 specific cohorts receiving RP-A501 at
      sequentially higher dose levels. Two dose levels are planned to be investigated in 4 distinct
      cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Age 15 years and older: Low Dose (n=3-6 subjects)

        -  Cohort 2: Age 15 years and older: High Dose (n=3-6 subjects)

        -  Cohort 3: Age 8-14 years: Low Dose (n=3-6 subjects)

        -  Cohort 4: Age 8-14 years: High Dose (n=3-6 subjects)

      Pending determination of safety in Cohort I, concomitant enrollment in Cohorts 2 and 3 is
      permissible.

      The study will also enable an initial evaluation of whether or not the investigational
      therapy results in cardiomyocyte and skeletal muscle transduction and gene expression and
      preliminary assessment of the extent of cardiomyocyte and histologic correction.
      Additionally, a preliminary evaluation of clinical stabilization following infusion will also
      be made.

             within 90 days prior to enrollment.

          6. Significant (greater than moderate) valvular stenosis or regurgitation on
             echocardiogram.

          7. Requires mechanical ventilation.

          8. Anti-AAV9 neutralizing antibody titer &gt;1:5.

          9. Concurrent enrollment in any other clinical investigation involving use of an
             investigational agent for the treatment of congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy.

         10. Active hepatitis B or C infection (including patients with positive HBsAg, HBeAg or
             detectable HBV or HCV viral load). Patients with previous, adequately resolved HBV or
             HCV are eligible.

         11. Significant medical conditions including documented HIV infection, active viral or
             other hepatitis, poorly-controlled hypertension or diabetes, poorly controlled cardiac
             arrhythmia or uncontrolled viral, bacterial or fungal infection.

         12. Any concomitant medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator renders the patient unfit for study participation or at higher than
             acceptable risk for study participation.

         13. Active hematologic or solid organ malignancy, not including non-melanoma skin cancer
             or other carcinoma in situ. Patients with previously resected solid organ malignancies
             or definitively treated hematologic malignancies may be eligible if there has been no
             evidence of active malignancy during the prior 3 years.
