  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical radiotherapy is the main treatment of locally advanced lung cancer, and radiation
      pneumonia is the main toxic effects of radiotherapy. Among them, the fatality rate of severe
      radiation pneumonia can reach 50%, which is very harmful to tumor patients. At present, the
      treatment mode of radiation pneumonia is very few, and the therapeutic effect is poor. The
      prevention of radiation pneumonitis may be the best way to reduce the number of patients with
      Post-radiotherapy pneumonia. Previous small clinical studies have shown that the incidence of
      radiation pneumonia in inhaled beclomethasone group (2 /28) was significantly lower than that
      in oral prednisone group (8 /29) during radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to
      compare the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy between the therapeutic group (inhaled
      beclomethasone during radiotherapy) and the control radiotherapy group (patients received
      radiotherapy only), especially the incidence of radiation-induced pneumonia within half a
      year.

      To compare the incidence of radiation pneumonia, effect and side effects of radiotherapy in
      lung between beclomethasone inhalation therapeutic group and control radiotherapy group in
      patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during radiotherapy.
