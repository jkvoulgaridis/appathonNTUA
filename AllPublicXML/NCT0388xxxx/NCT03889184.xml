    <measure>EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5l)</measure>
    <time_frame>change after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>(EQ-5D-3L) is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions (5D): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
Each dimension has 5 levels (5L): from no problems (1 point), to extreme problems (5 points).</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with food-related quality of life questionnaire (SWFL)</measure>
    <time_frame>change after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SWFL consist of five items that can be measured independently, or grouped into a single dimension. The participants evaluate their degree of agreement, with five statements of answer possibilities (from disagree completely to agree completely), and a higher level means a better SWFL score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food related functional ability questionnaire (scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>change after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Food-related functional ability is assessed based on questions of ability (or inability) to handle shopping, table coverage, cooking, heating and eating, as well as being able to chew and swallow food without problems and to see, hear, smell and taste food. There are four response categories from 'yes, effortlessly' to 'no, not at all'. In addition, six questions regarding the extent to which the participant can master daily chores regarding today's main meals. There are five response categories from &quot;&quot; can not at all &quot;to&quot; to very much &quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meal quality questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>change after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>meal quality is assessed on the basis of the Nutrition and Health Education's culinary assessment schedule, which includes seven assessment criteria, as well as supplementary questions about the correspondence between the citizen's expectations and the appearance of the food. The assessment criteria include sensory factors regarding the appearance of the food, fragrance, taste, consistency, temperature, portion size and overall assessment. The criteria are assessed on a Likert scale (1-5), where 1 is defined as very poor and 5 is defined very well.</description>
