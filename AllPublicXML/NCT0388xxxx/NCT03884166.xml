  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients frequently suffer from stroke associated pneumonia. Pathophysiologically
      speaking, dysphagia and central nervous system (CNS)-injury induced immunosuppression largely
      contribute to the risk for pneumonia. In mouse models for stroke, the self-cleaning
      mechanisms of the lung are also affected by stroke, possibly further contributing to this
      risk.

      The investigators designed a pilot-study to examine the structural and functional integrity
      of the self-cleaning mechanisms of the lung in stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival and functional outcome of stroke is strongly depending on the occurence of pneumonia
      (stroke-associated pneumonia, SAP). Early diagnose and treatment of SAP is paramount in the
      treatment of stroke patients. While dysphagia strongly contributes to its pathogenesis,
      recent years have also shown a strong risk-modulation by CNS injury induced
      immunosuppression, making stroke patients more susceptible to SAP. Additionally, murine
      models of stroke showed changes in mucociliary clearance as possible contributors to SAP. It
      remains unclear, whether structural integrity and mucociliary clearance of the respiratory
      epithel change in stroke patients, and whether these changes might contribute to the
      occurence of SAP.

      Therefore, the investigators designed this exploratory observational pilot-study to examine
      the structural and functional integrity of respiratory epithel in severely affected stroke
      patients and correlate these findings to immune phenotyping and occurence of SAP. The
      investigators will conduct bronchoscopy in severely affected stroke patients to collect
      histological samples in order to evaluate multiple tissue predictors, as well as perform
      optical coherence tomography to examine ciliary kinetics in-vivo. The investigators will
      furthermore perform serum and plasma immune phenotyping, record occuring pneumonias and
      correlate these data in order to identify possible predictors of pneumonia.

        The population of the observational cohort consists of severely affected stroke patients,
        which require diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy, from within out academic stroke
        center (mostly from the interdisciplinary neurological-neurosurgical intensive care unit).
        The control group will consist of neurologically healthy individuals presenting for
        standard bronchoscopy for any reason, i.e. diagnostic exclusion of malignoma. These will be
        recruited from an academic pneumologic center. Our center is located in the metropolitan
        area of Berlin. Due to the exploratory, &quot;pilot&quot; characteristics of this study, there will
        be no targeted inclusion in terms of age or gender, but we aim for a representative sample.
