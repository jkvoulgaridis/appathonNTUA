  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is primarily a safety study to evaluate the safety of AIV001 when administered to
      subjects with rosacea. Exploratory efficacy measures will also be collected as well as
      pharmacokinetic profiles.

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 year with rosacea,
             10 to 30 papules and pustules (at least 5 lesions within the treatment area on each
             facial side), and &lt; 2 nodules

          -  Presence of moderate to severe persistent erythema

          -  Total body weight &gt;45 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

             assessment of rosacea

          -  Extremely dark skin type that would confound the digital analysis of erythema (eg,
             Fitzpatrick Skin Type 5 or 6)

          -  Excessive facial hair (eg, beards, sideburns, moustaches, etc.), birthmarks, or
             tattoos that would interfere with diagnosis or assessment of rosacea

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use an acceptable method of non-hormonal contraception as outlined in this
             protocol from at least 14 days prior to start of treatment.

          -  Hypersensitivity or allergy to axitinib or any other component of the study treatment

          -  Use within 6 months prior to baseline and during the study of oral retinoids (eg,
             Accutane®) or therapeutic vitamin A supplements of greater than 10,000 units/day
             (multivitamins are allowed).

          -  Use within 6 weeks prior to baseline and during the study of vasodilators or
             α-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents.

          -  Use within 1 month prior to baseline and during the study of 1) topical retinoids to
             the face, 2) systemic antibiotics know to have an impact on the severity of facial
             rosacea (eg, containing tetracycline and its derivatives, erythromycin and its
             derivatives, sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim), 3) systemic corticosteroids, or 4)
             facial light-based therapies
