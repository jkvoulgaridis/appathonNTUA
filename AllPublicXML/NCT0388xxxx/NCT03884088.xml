  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is many subjective balance tests to evaluate static and dynamic balance. But, there is
      no sufficient information about which balance test is the most sensitive test to evaluate
      balance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare of sensitivity of the subjective
      balance tests with an objective system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the clinical setting, many balance tests are used for evaluating balance in individuals.
      These tests are utilized to assess both static and dynamic balance. However, sufficient
      research has not been conducted to decide which subjective balance test is more sensitive
      than the other tests. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare of sensitivity of the
      subjective balance tests with an objective system.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Limits of Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Limits of stability test evaluates dynamic balance of participants. Computerized balance system measured limits of stability for forward, backward, right and left side movements. It calculates the maximum distance a person can lean without losing balance. The unit of measure is centimeters. The higher value is indicated the better balance</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and go test evaluates dynamic balance of participants. The timed up and go test measures the time that a patient needs to stand up from a chair, walk a 3-m distance, come back and sit back on the chair.Timed up and go test measure is second. The lower values indicates the better balance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional reach test evaluates dynamic balance by measuring the limits while the patient reaches forwards as far as possible. The test measure is centimeters. A higher score indicates better dynamic balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One-leg stance test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>One-leg stance test evaluates static balance of the participants. Participants would ask to maintain their static balance by standing one-lag stance. The test measure is second. A higher score indicated better static balance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Romberg test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Romberg test is used to evaluate static balance. Participants would ask to maintain their balance with their feet together (touching each other). The test measure is second. Higher score indicated better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Berg balance scale is used for functional balance. participants are asked to perform 14 tasks frequently used in daily life activities. The highest possible score is 56 points. A higher score indicates better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Balance scale which is developed by Tinetti is used to evaluate functional balance. This test has a gait score and a balance score. It uses a 3-point ordinal scale of 0, 1 and 2. Gait is scored over 12 and balance is scored over 16 totalling 28. The lower the score on the scale, the higher the risk of falling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Y balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Y balance test is used to evaluate dynamic balance. The Y balance test has the patient stand on one leg while reaching out in 3 different directions with the other lower extremity. They are anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral. The test measures in centimeters. The higher score indicates better balance</description>
