      The investigator proposes an open label pilot study to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      gamma interferon (γIFN) in patients with Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA). yIFN, an approved drug
      for treatment of granulomatous disease, has been shown to promote Frataxin expression in FRDA
      models in vitro and in vivo as well as in pilot human studies.

      Safety will monitored by clinical surveillance and biohumoral periodic assessment. Efficacy
      will be assessed by a combination of advanced neuroimaging techniques and established
      clinical indicators. The investigators intend to recruit over a 6 months period 12 subject
      with molecularly established FRDA. The protocol builds on a recently concluded observational
      study which established the pattern of clinical and neuroimaging abnormalities characterizing
      a cohort of patients with FA. The data already acquired through such study will constitute
      the T-6/-12 point, and together with T0 assessment, carried out at study entrance, will
      provide for each patient the exact appreciation of disease actual progression over a year
      time. Recruited patients will receive for 6 months yIFN at a final dose of 200 ug/three times
      a week. Patients will be evaluated clinically after 3 and 6 months (T3 and T6) of treatment
      and 6 months after treatment end (T+6) and by neuroimaging at T6 and T+6. The neuroimaging
      protocol, based on 3 Tesla scanner, consists in functional MRI, tractography. The clinical
      protocol consists on specific ataxia scales administration. Regular monitoring with for
      eventual adverse events will be provided. Frataxin levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells will also be evaluated at T0, T3, T6, T+6. Furthermore, the thickness of the cardiac
      ventricle and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness with optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) will be performed at T0, T6, T + 6.

    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects children and
      young adults. Patients become progressively unable to coordinate movements and walking until
      severe disability ensues. Most patients develop dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart
      failure. The disease is non remissive and significantly shortens lifespan expectancy. FRDA is
      a genetic disease inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. FRDA patients display abnormal
      GAA triplet expansions within the first intron of the frataxin gene that prevent proper gene
      expression. The levels of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism and
      energy production, are insufficient and cells undergo prolonged stress and premature death.
      Mostly affected by frataxin deficiency are peripheral neurons of the dorsal root ganglia
      (DRG) and neurons of the cerebellar nucleus dentatus.

      FRDA affects 1 in 50,000 individuals in western countries and has no approved therapy. It has
      recently been shown that interferon gamma (γIFN), a natural regulator of the immune response
      and iron metabolism, stimulates frataxin gene transcription and promotes frataxin
      accumulation in cells, including frataxin-defective cells derived from FRDA patients.
      Moreover, prolonged treatment of YG8R mice, an animal model for FRDA, with γIFN results in
      accumulation of frataxin in DRG neurons and significantly prevents the deterioration of the
      sensorimotor performances of the mice over time.

      Since γIFN is also a drug available on the market as a recombinant protein (γIFN - 1b, TD
      Imukin® and Actimmune®), and already approved for two pediatric indications (malignant
      osteopetrosis and chronic granuloumatous disease), it could represent a quickly accessible
      therapeutic option for FRDA patients.

      A major obstacle to efficiently establish efficacy of treatment in FRDA is the lack of
      reliable and sensitive biomarkers. Clinical indicators (disease specific scales, timed
      performance tests) are prone to inter-rater variability and, above all, while valid and
      sensitive to long term changes, they are very inefficient in capturing changes in the short
      time interval (months) typically used in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

      The advanced neuroimaging techniques such as Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM), Susceptibility
      Weighted Imaging (SWI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (fMRI) could offer objective indicators of the disease progression that could serve
      as paraclinical end point in therapeutic trials. Surrogate end-points based on neuroimaging
      indicators have been extensively used in other neurological diseases such as Multiple
      Sclerosis, and their introduction speeded up significantly the recognition of effective
      treatments and their longitudinal evaluation.

      In the last years, in vivo MRI studies have provided information relative to the damage of
      cerebellar, cerebral and spinal cord areas involved in FRDA and other genetically determined
      ataxias, which could be useful to monitor disease progression.

      With the advent of the VBM, it is possible to quantify the degree of atrophy, to monitor it
      in time and to identify various pattern typical of a specific form of ataxia. Various studies
      have evidenced a significant correlation between the degree of the cerebellar atrophy, the
      severity of the clinical picture and also the duration of the disease .

      A pilot study conducted in a cohort of 9 FRDA affected adolescents who underwent a 6 month
      treatment with deferiprone, demonstrated a significant reduction in the mean R2* signal in
      the cerebellar dentate nuclei, an iron tissue store index. Modifications of the fMRI pattern
      in response to specific tasks involving both the motor and the planning ability have also
      been demonstrated in FRDA patients, and fMRI based protocols could offer an adjunctive
      indicator of disease progression or of therapy induced modification.

      Aims and purpose of the proposed investigation:

        -  Test safety of γIFN treatment given for 6 months at final dose of 200 mcg three times
           weekly in FRDA patients.

        -  Test the effect of γIFN treatment on disease specifc clinical scale (SARA)

        -  Test the effect of such treatment on a set of secondary imaging, laboratory and clinical
           end-points:

        -  fMRI changes in FRDA patients performing the finger tapping protocol

             -  DTI parameters

             -  Thickness of ventricular wall as measured by Ecocardiogram (EcoCG)

             -  Thickness of RNFL as measured by OCT

             -  Frataxin levels in cell lysates prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
                (PBMC)

             -  Changes in quality of life and disability impact measure. What previous work is
                this project based on? Evidence for the possible efficacy of recombinant γIFN in
                FRDA has been gathered both in the animal model for the disease and in FRDA
                patients. In FRDA patients, a recently completed Phase II trial reported
                significant improvement on the FARS evaluation after 3 months treatment on a 100
                mcg, 3 times/weekly regimen. Moreover, another recently completed Phase II study
                suggests that the dosing of 200 mcg is reasonably well tolerated in FRDA patients.

      An articulated MRI protocol for FRDA patients aged 12-50 which included DTI, VBM, and fMRI
      following a selective motor paradigm has been tested, validated and implemented in the
      investigators Institute. By this protocol the investigators evaluated 22 FRDA patients and 15
      age and sex matched healthy controls, and found significant differences in DTI parameters (FA
      &amp; MD) in the cerebellar white matter, long sensory and motor tracts, major commissural
      tracts, and in BOLD signal intensity and distribution of BOLD signal during performance of a
      finger tapping test. These latter disease specific changes were most evident in the
      ipsilateral cerebellar cortex. The observed changes correlated with the degree of
      neurological and functional impairment as measured with validated scales.

      These preliminary results indicate that DTI and fMRI changes may function as efficient
      surrogate end-points in RCT for FRDA patients.

           for the following 22 weeks

           Imaging protocol

           The MRI examination will be administered at 4 T points:

           - T-12 to -6: for this point the data already stored along in the last year from the
           published invesitgators' MRI study on 18 subjects will be used

           - T0: at time of recruitment

           - T6: after 6 months of treatment

           - T+6: 6 months after treatment termination The protocol will be acquired on a 3 T
           scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil and will include morphological, structural
           (DTI) and functional (fMRI) sequences.

           A 3D T1-weighted TFE sequence (TR/TE=8.2/3.7, voxel size= 1x1x1 mm, 150 slices) will be
           acquired in order to obtain morphological data suitable for volumetric analysis for
           voxel-based morphometry.

           The DTI data will be acquired by means of a T2-weighted EPI sequence (voxel size
           =2.5x2.5x2.5 mm) along 32 non-collinear directions, with multiple b-values (0, 300, 1100
           sec/mm2) and will be evaluated off-line with the Tortoise dedicated software. Functional
           data will be acquired by means of a T2-weighted EPI sequence (TR/TE=2000/20,
           thickness=2.5mm, 40 slices) covering the whole brain and cerebellum.

           Functional images will be acquired during a task that implies manual coordination and
           precision, in order to test possible effect of the treatment over the functional
           organization of motor networks.

           Laboratory protocol Eco CG study will be performed at T0, T6, T+6 with established
           protocol. Frataxin levels monitoring will be performed at T0, T3 (after 3 months) and T6
           (after 6 months).

           Clinical measures and Safety monitoring A trained neurologist will visit each patient at
           T0, T3, T6 and T+6 and report all vital signs and register other objective findings
           including adverse event (AE).

           A detailed checklist with all the known AE reported with γIFN treatment will be
           presented to each participant at T0, T3, T6.

           The following blood test will be performed at T0, T3, T6 :

           -Cell Blood Count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Ca2+, Cl-, Na+, Mg2+, K+, Albumin,
           Globulins, Glucose, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Uric Acid, Creatinine, Aspartate Transaminase,
           Alanine Transaminase, Iron, Ferritin, Transferrin

           Statistical analysis For the MRI protocol, each dataset will be processed with a
           dedicated pipeline and appropriate software.

           The T1 volumes will be processed following the standard FMRIB Software Library (FSL)
           pipeline and performing VBM. As first step a study specific template of gray matter,
           using the routine &quot;buildtemplateparallel&quot; of Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs), that
           performs an iterative template construction with elastic transformations will be
           created.

           The DTI data will be corrected for eddy currents and motion artefacts and then the
           diffusion tensor will be computed using the non-linear mono-exponential diffusion model,
           obtaining maps of &quot;fractional anisotropy&quot; (FA), &quot;mean diffusivity&quot; (MD), &quot;radial
           diffusivity&quot; (RD) and &quot;axial diffusivity&quot; (AD).

           To quantify the statistical differences over time, the diffusion data of all subjects
           will be moved to a common space through rigid, affine and diffeomorphic registrations
           based on the diffusion tensor itself. Using the transformations computed on the tensors,
           3 different tests will be performed:

           - Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS);

           - Voxel-wise statistical analysis based on permutations;

           - Statistical analysis of regions of interest (ROI) with generalized linear models
           (GLM).

           The fMRI data will be processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8). A
           first-level Fixed Effect analysis will be performed on each subject using global linear
           model and motion parameters as confounds. For the group-level analysis a Random Effect
           Analysis with contrasts obtained in the single subject step analysis will be performed.
           A two sample t-test will finally be computed to check differences in activations over
           time.

           All time-dependent data (including ROI-wise neuroimaging results) will be analyzed using
           multivariate linear mixed models, including timepoints as a repeated within-subject
           factor and included sex, age at onset, disease duration, years of education and number
           of GAA1 repeats within the smaller FXN allele as covariates of no interest. N case of a
           statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) overall effect of time, pairwise comparisons between
           timepoints will be performed and corrected for multiple comparisons across pairs of
           timepoints. Correlation analysis will also be performed between possible modifications
           in SARA scores between consecutive time-points and the respective changes in the MRI
           derived structural and functional measures.
