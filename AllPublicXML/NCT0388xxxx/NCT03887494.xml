  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastases appear in many cancers. They are associated with severe pain that is
      refractory to standard treatment. Improving the quality of life and better pain relief is
      therefore an essential goal of the treatment of metastatic disease. The most common site of
      long bone metastases is the superior femoral epiphysis.

      The usual management of patients with bone metastases in the superior femoral epiphysis is
      based on gamma implant osteosynthesis when there is a known risk of fracture (Mirels score&gt;
      8). Nonetheless this surgery is only accessible to a few patients because of the associated
      morbidities.

      Percutaneous cementoplasty has been developed to treat patients who are not eligible for
      conventional surgery. It consists in a filling of the bone cavity created by metastasis using
      an acrylic resin. However, these approaches do not completely prevent the risk of upper
      femoral epiphyseal fracture due to the low mechanical resistance of the resin to shear
      movements.

      The Y-STRUT® implantable medical device was developed to overcome this risk of superior
      femoral epiphyseal fracture by the biomechanical strengthening of the proximal femur in
      addition to cementoplasty. It has been successfully tested in more than 70 patients with
      cancer but access to reimbursement and the APHP market have been postponed due to lack of
      sufficient clinical evidence.

      The investigators propose this prospective phase 2a study in order to provide evidence of the
      performance of the Y-STRUT® implant.

      The design consists in a multicenter national open simple arm trial.

      All eligible patients with a lytic bone metastases of the superior femoral epiphysis will be
      included.

      The main objective of this study is to describe the impact of the Y-STRUT® implant on the
      quality of life of patients with lytic bone metastases of the femoral neck by comparing
      quality of life scores before and one month after the intervention of implantation of the
      implant.

    <description>Measure of the Quality of Life score using the questionary of quality of life of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer BM-22.
Patients answer at 22 questions to describe their quality of life during the past week. For each question, patient must choose between 1.not at all, 2.a little, 3.enough, 4.a lot. A global score is calculated by adding the 22 score of each questions. The higher value of this global score represents the better outcome.</description>
