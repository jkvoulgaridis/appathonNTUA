    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, single center, randomized, double blind study evaluating the safety, efficacy, and
      immunogenicity of MVA NP+M1 in the H3N2 human influenza challenge model; on healthy adult
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an outpatient vaccination phase (155 participants), and at least 2
      months later an inpatient challenge phase (134 participants). Participants are randomized
      93:62 to receive either MVA-NP+M1 or Placebo. Up to 20 participants will be challenged over
      several 3-week blocks, and the remainder at the final 3-week block for a total of 80
      MVA-NP+M1 and 54 Placebo recipients challenged.
