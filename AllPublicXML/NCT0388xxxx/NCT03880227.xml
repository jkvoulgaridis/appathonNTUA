      This study investigates whether visual attention can be improved in individuals with
      schizophrenia by stimulating the brain via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia tend to display abnormal visual attention when performing
      visual tasks, typically spending less time on salient features of the stimuli (e.g. core
      facial features or body movement in social tasks), and instead focusing on idiosyncratic
      features of an image or video. Poor visual attention in schizophrenia has been directly
      linked to poorer social cognitive performance (e.g. recognizing emotional expressions or
      social cues) which can impact an individual's day to day functioning.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive neurostimulation
      which has been proposed as a therapeutic procedure in numerous psychiatric disorders. TDCS in
      schizophrenia has been demonstrated to improve a wide range of cognitive processes, and in
      healthy adults, tDCS has been demonstrated to improve aspects of social cognition. TDCS thus
      appears to be a promising therapeutic technique that may be useful for improving visual
      attention in patients with schizophrenia, and potentially impact social cognitive performance
      via an underlying mechanism tying the two. This study will compare visual performance in
      individuals with schizophrenia across two conditions: active anodal tDCS and sham tDCS, while
      also comparing between brain stimulation sites: rTPJ and dmPFC.

    <description>Visual attention measured via eye-tracking(percentage of time attending to investigator designated AOIs) when viewing videos of a single actor (stimuli: Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task).

    <description>Visual attention measured via eye-tracking (percentage of time attending to investigator designated AOIs) when viewing videos of two or more actors in a scene (stimuli: The Awareness of Social Inference Task Part 3, Version A). AOIs for this task will be defined as salient social and contextual stimuli (e.g. social stimuli are faces of actors, while contextually salient stimuli include items actors are talking about, such as a plate full of food or an empty wallet).</description>

    <description>Stabilization of visual fixation on fixation circle positioned in middle of screen. Stabilization will be measured via eye-tracking and defined as average scanpath length with increased scanpath indicating less stable fixation.</description>
