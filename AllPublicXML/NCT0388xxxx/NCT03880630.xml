      Background &amp; Objective: Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is known to improve strength and
      endurance of inspiratory muscles. However, clinical beneficial effects of IMT for patients
      with chronic respiratory disease remain inconclusive.

      The purposes of the study are to investigate in patients with chronic respiratory disease:
      (Year 1) main (diaphragm) and accessory inspiratory muscle (sternocleidomastoid muscle)
      activation pattern during various IMT loading using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM);
      and (Year 2) effectiveness of individualized IMT program (based on results of Year 1) on
      clinical outcomes. Methods: (Year 1) Patients with chronic respiratory disease with
      inspiratory muscle weakness will be recruited for the study. Patients will perform 3
      inspiratory loading tests (15%, 30%, and 50% of maximum inspiratory pressures) on 3 separate
      days with the sequence will be randomized. Surface electromyography (EMG) of diaphragm and
      sternocleidomastoid muscle will be used to use inspiratory muscle activation during various
      conditions. Other outcomes include maximum inspiratory pressure, and functional exercise
      capacity will be measured. Inspiratory muscle activation will be used for GBTM analysis.
      Patient will then be trained with individualized IMT program based on the GBTM analysis input
      form results of Year 1.
