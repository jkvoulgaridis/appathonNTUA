  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the indications, tolerance and side effects of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)
      performed at a University Hospital over 8 years
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indications were recorded from the patients electronic chart. Side effects were identified
      from the review of TPE monitoring forms completed prospectively by the nurse who performed
      the TPE during the course of the procedure
