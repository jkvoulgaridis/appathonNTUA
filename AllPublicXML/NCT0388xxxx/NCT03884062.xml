  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic HCV infection has relatively slow rate of progression. Liver fibrosis is the main
      sequlae and usually progressed to cirrhosis after long period (10 to 20 years) [6]. Once
      cirrhosis is established the disease progression remains unpredictable: cirrhosis can remain
      indolent for many years in some patients whilst progressing in others to HCC, hepatic
      decompensation and death. Overall once cirrhosis has developed there is a 1-5% annual risk of
      HCC and a 3-6% annual risk of hepatic decompensation. Following an episode of decompensation
      the risk of death in the following year is between 15% and 20% Treatment of chronic HCV has
      been dramatically changed in the last few years with introduction of direct acting antivirals
      (DAAs). The new therapies with excellent safety profiles, shorter duration of therapy and
      marked higher efficacy can be even used in patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis
