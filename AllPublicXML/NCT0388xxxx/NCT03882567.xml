  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There is evidence linking conditioned pain modulation (CPM) deficiency with
      musculoskeletal pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, Evidence shows that different physical
      therapies could activation situations of chronic pain there is no activation of CPM.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to measure the CPM response and determine whether
      Electro Neuro Adaptative Regulator in patients with Fibromyalgia is effective in the
      improvement of CPM, TS, pain intensity, disability.

      Design: Double-blind, randomized placebo clinical trial. Methods: Patients with fibromyalgia
      will be randomly allocated into two groups: the Electro Neuro Adaptative Regulator group
      (SCENAR) or the sham technique (ST) group.

      Main outcomes measures: Pain intensity (with visual analogue scale, Conditioned Pain
      Modulation (CPM), Temporal Summation (TS) and Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPT´s) were the
      primary outcomes and will be assessed at baseline and at 3-months follow-up. Secondary
      outcome measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire to measure disability, Pain
      Catastrophizing Scale and the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Jenkins
      Sleep Scale. Questionnaire of quality of life SF36.

      Participants will be selected if they met the following inclusion criteria: (a) fulfilled the
      1990 and 2010 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for FM; (b) reported
      an average pain intensity ≥ 4 on a 0 to 10 cm visual analogue scale during the previous week
      to study commencement; (c) were on stable doses of medication for FM ≥ 4 weeks; and (d) were
      aged between 18 and 65 years.

    <measure>Numerical pain ranting Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of pain intensity at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be asked to assess the subjective pain intensity of the painful in whole body by to marking the level of pain on the scale. Pain intensity was measured with the NRS of 11 points (interval from 0 to 10), where 0 corresponds to no pain, and 10 corresponds to the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQ, which is a validated self-reported questionnaire to measure multidimensional function/health-related quality of life, will be used.Scores in the FIQ range from 0 to 100, An improvement greater than 30% in the FIQ total score has been identified in clinical trials as sensitive to identify a positive response to treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of CPM at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After an interval of 5 minutes CPM was assessed by replicating the TS assessment associated with a conditioning stimulus for eliciting CPM. The conditioning stimulus was an occlusion cuff at the left arm inflated, at a rate of 20 mmHg/s until the subject reports &quot;the first sensation of pain&quot;. Acquired pressure at this point remained for 30 seconds. The subject described the intensity of pain, because of occlusion in the arm, on a verbal numerical rating scale (0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain). Then cuff inflation was increased or decreased until the intensity of pain will be 3/10 in verbal rating scale</description>

    <measure>Mechanical Hyperalgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of PPT at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPTs) were assessed using algometry in the thumb (dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx). The PPT is defined as the lowest pressure that, using standardized testing conditions, needs to be applied to cause the slightest sensation of pain. It is a reliable and widely used measure</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal Summation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of TS at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of TS or wind-up will be evaluated in response to 10 applications (pulses) of the algometer, with an approximate rate of pressure increase of 2 Kg/s, at the previously defined PPT at the dorsal surface of the right-hand middle finger midway between the first and second distal joints, and at the middle of the right-hand side upper trapezius belly. Participants were asked to rate the intensity and unpleasantness of the pain intuitively of the first, fifth, and tenth pulse on a numeric pain rating scale.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of pain catastrophizing at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was used to assess catastrophic thoughts about pain, which has shown appropriate psychometric properties.</description>
