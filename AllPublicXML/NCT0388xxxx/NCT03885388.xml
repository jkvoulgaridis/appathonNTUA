    <textblock>
      In this study, a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled study was conducted to
      compare the clinical efficacy and toxicity response of combination MTX+ACTD multi-course
      regimen in low-risk GTN patients with score 5-6 with standard MTX single-drug multi-course
      regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The improved prognostic scoring system has been in use for more than 20 years in GTN
      patients. However, there are also more and more clinical evidences showing that the
      International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology（FIGO）/world health organization (WHO)
      system is not so perfect. The main problem is that a considerable number of patients are
      resistant to initial chemotherapy, 25-35% occur in low risk (≤ 6 points), and 70-80% occur in
      patients with a score of 5-6 points. According to reference, the drug resistance factors
      include high HCG level before chemotherapy, metastatic foci, histological diagnosis of
      choriocarcinoma, etc. However, according to the score before 2000, there is a moderate risk
      score group with 4-6 points, i.e. most of the single drug resistance to the initial regimen
      occurs in the previous moderate risk score group.Therefore, most scholars believe that there
      are grey areas with a score of 5-6. According to the analysis of 5-6 scores in the scoring
      system, the prognosis of single-drug chemotherapy is poor, and the initial remission rate is
      only about 30-40%. Therefore, many authors call for the current staging scoring system to be
      revised to a more accurate model so that some patients who may be drug resistant can adopt
      more effective plans at the beginning of treatment.

      In this study, the investigators plan to conduct a prospective, multicenter randomized
      controlled study to compare the clinical efficacy and toxicity response of combination
      MTX+ACTD multi-course regimen in low-risk GTN patients with score 5-6 with standard MTX
      single-drug multi-course regimen. The experiment arm of the trial is multi-course combination
      of MTX and ACTD. The primary endpoint is complete remission rate of primary treatment or
      failure of primary treatment. Drug toxicity is surveillanced.
