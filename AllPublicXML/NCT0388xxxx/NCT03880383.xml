  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with, or at elevated risk for, brain-based developmental disabilities can experience
      lifelong consequences and challenges throughout their development. In particular, preschool
      years (3-6 years of age) can be stressful as families wait to get services and care for their
      child. Nationally and internationally, service delivery models during this critical period
      are not standardized, and differ within and across provinces and across patient conditions,
      leading to long wait times, service gaps and duplications.

      This study has two main hypotheses:

        1. A standardized approach to &quot;coaching&quot; (i.e. coach + online education tools + peer
           support network) is feasible in the real-life context, and acceptable to caregivers and
           can be delivered across multiple sites in urban/suburban/rural settings.

        2. A standardized approach to &quot;coaching&quot; enhances parental health (parents' empowerment and
           sense of competence, quality of life, and minimizes parenting stress), family health
           care experience (care coordination experience and process of care) at similar health
           care cost (economic analysis), when compared to usual and locally available care.

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale:

      Children with, or at elevated risk for, brain-based developmental disabilities experience
      chronic lifelong functional consequences with new challenges emerging at each stage of
      development. In the preschool years (3-6 years), needs arise from vulnerabilities linked to
      critical and newly emerging cognitive, speech, motor, behavioural and social skills. The
      preschool years are a time of stress for families as young child awaits assessment, or even
      as they receive services for brain-based disorders. Similarly, the system and society
      struggle to meet needs of families in a timely and appropriate manner in the face of
      escalating costs. Given these struggles, there is a need to examine whether a health-coach
      style of intervention coupled with parent education delivered through an online platform can
      be effective in empowering families, by delivering information, providing social (parent to
      parent) supports, and decreasing demand on health and developmental services. This innovation
      provides a significant service re-design in a system at critical point of transition.

      Study objective:

      To evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness (changes in parent health, developmental
      service utilization and cost effectiveness) of a self-management intervention (including
      developmental coach, online education tools and support network), when compared to usual and
      locally available care in service delivery practices, for parents of preschool children with
      suspected developmental delays.

      Methodology / Study design:

      This is a prospective, two-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a
      developmental coaching and e-health services intervention plus usual care to the control
      state in which children and their families receive usual and locally available care over an
      18-month time frame. The target population for this novel service delivery model is children
      aged 1.5 to 4.5 years old who are at a high risk for or suspected of having developmental
      delays, that are beginning to manifest impairments in developmental domains (e.g. motor,
      cognitive, speech, social and/or behavioural). In the first year, a technology-supported
      health coach service delivery model will be developed in conjunction with families. A
      feasibility/acceptability pilot study was conducted to ensure that the intervention is
      feasible in the real life context across 4 participating Canadian provinces.

      Participants:

      Eligible children and their families will be recruited to include children who are 1.5 to 4.5
      years at the age at enrolment. Children will be living in four diverse parts of Canada to
      ensure national representation and future scalability: Vancouver; Winnipeg; Montreal and
      Halifax. Participants' postal codes will be analyzed to ensure representation: rural/remote,
      small urban and large urban/metro representation with purposeful sampling as required. From
      the patient population perspective, two different groups that are likely to manifest new
      global developmental delays at this stage will be recruited. They are at high risk for
      brain-based developmental delays, however some will have no delay and others will have mild,
      moderate or severe delays.

      Study procedures: Intervention and control Recruitment begins with family contact. Families
      are contacted via the centre to which they were referred for developmental diagnosis and
      assessment. A member of the clinical team will ask if they are interested to learn more about
      the BRIGHT Coaching study. If interested, the families' contact information will be shared
      with the local research assistant (RA) overseeing the trial. The RA will speak to a parent by
      phone and follow up with an introductory letter by mail explaining the procedures of the
      study, together with the consent form and a self-addressed stamped envelope to return to the
      RA if interested in participating. After 2 weeks, if no consent form is received, the RA will
      call the family once again to determine their interest in participating. Once consent is
      signed, participants will conduct baseline assessments including documentation of their care
      and social networks, and be randomized using a computer-generated algorithm; randomization
      will be stratified by site. The allocation ratio for intervention or control will be 1:1 for
      each site.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Empowerment Scale (FES) - change is being assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes at each study visit (at baseline, 8 months post-entry [immediately post-intervention], 12 months post-entry [follow-up])</time_frame>
    <description>The FES is composed of 34 statements that describe how a parent or caregiver of a child with an emotional, behavioral and/or developmental challenges may feel about his or her situation (i.e. sense of empowerment). For each statement, the participant is asked to circle the response that best describes how the statement applies to him/her. The scale ranges from 1 (Not True at All) to 5 (Very True), for a maximum of 170 points and a minimum of 34 points. A higher score represent a higher sense of empowerment (i.e. better outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Sense of Competency (PSOC) Scale - change is being assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes at each study visit (at baseline, 8 months post-entry [immediately post-intervention], 12 months post-entry [follow-up])</time_frame>
    <description>The PSOC measures parents' sense of competence and is a 17-item scale, with 2 subscales. Each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale anchored by 1 = &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 6 = &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. A higher score indicates a higher parenting sense of competency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) - change is being assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>7-10 minutes at each study visit (at baseline, 8 months post-entry [immediately post-intervention], 12 months post-entry [follow-up])</time_frame>
    <description>36-question survey about parental well-being and health-related quality of life. The following domains are being assessed: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Participant is asked to rate his/her ability for each statement as &quot;Yes, Limited a lot&quot;, &quot;Yes, Limited a Little&quot;, or &quot;No, Not Limited at all&quot;. The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100; Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Stress Index - 36 (PSI-36) - change is being assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>7-10 minutes at each study visit (at baseline, 8 months post-entry [immediately post-intervention], 12 months post-entry [follow-up])</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI is a self-report screening tool that helps providers and families identify the sources and different types of stress that come with parenting. Parents report their level of agreement with 36 items that fall into three subscales:
Parental Distress (PD)—The extent to which parents feel competent, restricted, conflicted, supported, and/or depressed in their role as a parent.
Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI)—The extent to which parents feel satisfied with their child and their interactions with them.
Difficult Child (DC)—How a parent perceives their child to be, whether the child is easy or difficult to take care of.
Total Stress—indication of overall level of stress a person is feeling in their role as a parent.
For most items, parents should respond by circling SA (strongly agree), A (agree), NS (not sure), D (disagree), SD (strongly disagree). Raw scores are added and higher scores represent higher stress levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of Process of Care - 20 (MPOC - 20) - change is being assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes at each study visit (at baseline, 8 months post-entry [immediately post-intervention], 12 months post-entry [follow-up])</time_frame>
    <description>20-item survey measuring the extent to which care is family-centred. Participants need to select one option (ranging from 0-7 or &quot;Not applicable&quot; to &quot;A very great extent&quot;) that best applies to them for each statement. Raw scores are being summed (for a maximum of 140 points and a minimum of 0 points) and higher scores represent higher perceived family-centred care that the family is receiving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resource Utilization Questionnaire - Preschoolers (RUQ-P) - change is being assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes at each study visit (at baseline, 8 months post-entry [immediately post-intervention], 12 months post-entry [follow-up])</time_frame>
    <description>The RUQ-P collected data on resource use; service intensity; and out-of-pocket costs, such as hourly rates, costs of materials, and travel costs. The following services/resources are being assessed: Speech-Language or Communication Services; Occupational Therapy; Physiotherapy; Child-focused recreational activities; Intervention/Consultation for Challenging Behaviour; Structured/Systematic Teaching with Specific Goals (Optional); Relationship-Based Intervention ; Medication/Supplements and Special diet; Visits with additional Health Professionals; Parents' Use of Health Services and Medications and Other Resources; Purchased Materials, Equipment, etc.; Respite; Time Associated with Treatment and Care; Government Tax Rebates, Deductions, Subsidies and Other Supports; Insurance Plan. For each question/statement, a multiple choice of responses are provided and participant is asked to select one. Responses are analysed using descriptive statistics (frequencies of selected answers).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vineland)</measure>
    <time_frame>20-60 minutes, at baseline visit only.</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland is a survey that is conducted with parents or caregivers, measuring 4 domains of the child's adaptive behaviour (with 2-3 subdomains in each): the child's communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills. Eleven general subdomains are grouped into those four main domains. The scores of the subdomains are added to form the domain composite scores. The four domain composite scores then combine to form the adaptive behaviour composite.
Scoring: Each subdomain question is scored on a 3-point scale: score of 2 refers to &quot;Usually&quot;, 1 refers to &quot;Sometimes&quot; and 0 refers to &quot;Never&quot;. Higher scores indicate better outcome (i.e. higher adaptive behaviour in each domain).
The following interpretation tools/scores are provided: 1) Domains and Adaptive Behaviour Composite: Standard scores (M = 100, SD = 15), percentile ranks, adaptive levels. 2) Subdomain: V-scale score (M = 15, SD = 3), Adaptive levels, age equivalents.</description>

    <measure>Readiness to receive coaching</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes, at baseline visit only.</time_frame>
    <description>This eight-question/statement screening tool was developed in-house to assess the participants' readiness to receive the coaching intervention. Each statement (e.g. &quot;I am willing to talk, engage and share with my coach&quot;) will be rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;.</description>
