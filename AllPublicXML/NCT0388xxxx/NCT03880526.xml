  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed study is to enhance the investigators understanding of the
      comprehensive psychosocial and medical needs of rural cancer patients and survivors along the
      cancer continuum, ultimately allowing us to address these gaps by identifying areas of
      support that can be bolstered by a population health navigator focused on rural populations.

      Primary objectives

      To enhance understanding of the comprehensive psychosocial and medical needs of cancer
      survivors and caregivers in rural northwest North Carolina, focusing on their health needs,
      psychosocial concerns, perceived needs related to cancer and survivorship care,
      access/barriers to care, and knowledge/perceptions of clinical research using focus groups
      and semi-structured interviews. This aim is hypothesis-generating.

      To document rural cancer patient/survivors' reports of: a) health behaviors; b) psychosocial
      needs; c) current health-related information and supportive care needs; d) barriers to care;
      e) symptoms and health-related quality of life using a quantitative survey
