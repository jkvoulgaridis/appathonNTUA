  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main interest of this study is to investigate the influence of moderate alcohol
      consumption (beer) on salt-water homeostasis. Therefore, 10 healthy volunteers will
      participate in 4 Intervention:

        -  Beer alone

        -  Beer and water

        -  Beer and salt (stock/bouillon)

        -  Water alone During the study day, copeptin, sodium, osmolality and urinary
           sodium/osmolality will be measured at 6 timepoints.
