  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) have a range of needs that extend beyond
      traditional medical care, including behavioral, mental health, and social needs. While
      primary care does its best to address these needs, few practices can undertake a systematic
      approach without broader health system and coordinated community support. Fortunately,
      communities and health systems are investing in new models of care to address these needs.
      New tools are emerging that allow for enhanced care planning to identify and prioritize
      patients' needs based on their values, preferences, social, and clinical context.
      Additionally, support systems to promote partnerships between patients and clinical and
      community care teams are emerging. Building on work occurring as part of the Richmond
      Accountable Health Community, the investigators propose to (a) evaluate the implementation of
      an enhanced care planning approach, paired with community-clinical linkages support to
      address health behavior, mental health, and social needs; (b) determine within a randomized
      controlled trial the benefit of this approach compared to usual care; and (c) assess which
      person, family, community, and system contextual factors that influence MCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients in the United States with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is
      growing. Many patients with poorly controlled MCC also have unhealthy behaviors, mental
      health challenges, and unmet social needs. Medical management of MCC may have limited benefit
      if patients are struggling to address these basic life needs. Health systems and communities
      increasingly recognize the need to address these issues and are experimenting with and
      investing in new models for connecting patients with needed services. Yet primary care
      clinicians, whose regular contact with patients makes them more familiar with patients'
      needs, are often not included in these systems. Responding to the Special Emphasis Notice
      NOT-HS-16-013, Optimizing Care for People Living with MCC through the Development of Enhanced
      Care Planning, the investigators propose a clinician-level randomized controlled trial to
      study how primary care clinicians can participate in these community and hospital solutions
      and whether doing so is effective in controlling MCC. This study will build on the Centers
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)-funded Accountable Health Community (AHC) in
      Richmond, Virginia. Sixty clinicians in the Virginia Ambulatory Care Outcomes Research
      Network (ACORN) will be matched by age and sex and randomized to usual care (control
      condition) or enhanced care planning with clinical-community linkage support (intervention).
      From the electronic health record (EHR), clinicians will identify all patients with MCC,
      including cardiovascular disease or risks, diabetes, obesity, or depression. A baseline
      assessment will be mailed to 50 randomly selected patients; 10 respondents per clinician (600
      patients total) with uncontrolled MCC will be randomly selected, with over-sampling of
      minorities. The intervention includes two components. First, an enhanced care planning tool
      called My Own Health Report (MOHR) will screen patients for health behavior, mental health,
      and social needs. Clinical navigator support will help patients prioritize needs, create care
      plans based on preferences, and write a personal narrative to guide the care team. Patients
      will update care plans quarterly. Second, community-clinical linkage support will include
      community resource registries, personnel to span settings (clinical navigators, community
      health workers), and care team coordination tools (sharing MOHR content, secure messaging,
      and virtual visits). The investigators will compare patient-level intervention and control
      outcomes to assess improvements in MCC outcomes (primary outcome) and self-reported PROMIS-29
      measures (physical health, mental health, social wellbeing) six months and two years
      post-enrollment. the investigators will also conduct a mixed-methods, multilevel assessment
      of person-, family-, community-, and system-level contextual influences on implementation and
      effectiveness. Data sources will include EHR and MOHR data, chart reviews, patient surveys,
      field notes, and semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and community
      stakeholders. If effective, this study will help inform efforts by primary care clinicians to
      participate in the growing number of AHC-like systems as a strategy to better control MCC.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a clinician level randomized controlled trial. Sixty clinicians will be randomized to intervention (enhanced care planning for health behaviors, mental health, and social needs) or control condition (usual care). The investigators will randomly survey all patients with MCC from each clinicians' patient panel. Patients with at least one uncontrolled MCC will be randomly selected for inclusion until 10 patients are recruited from each clinician. The investigators will use hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to measure outcomes. Implementation outcomes include enhanced care plan completion; the prevalence of health behavior, mental health, and social needs; goals patients prioritize and how they want to address them; and the type, intensity, and follow-up of care team support provided to address patient goals. Effectiveness outcomes include the number of uncontrolled chronic conditions and patient reported physical, mental, and social health..</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Pre-post change in eight Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) domains for intervention patients versus usual care. Norm-based scores will be calculated for each domain on the PROMIS measures, so that a score of 50 represents the mean or average of the reference population. A score of 60 means that the person is one standard deviation above the reference population. Higher scores means that the patient is reporting greater symptoms. Scores will be calculated using the Healthmeasures Scoring Service (http://www.healthmeasures.net/score-and-interpret/calculate-scores).</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of two components - enhanced care planning and clinical-community linkages. The enhanced care plan is created using MOHR (https://myownhealthreport.org). MOHR screens patients for unhealthy behaviors, mental health needs, and social needs. Patients identify the needs they would like to address and create a care plan, which they update quarterly. A clinical navigator and community health worker (CHW) help patients address their care plans using clinical-community linkages, which has four components. First, clinicians and clinical navigators have a resource registry identifying community programs and support - No Wrong Door (NWD) and https://navigator.aafp.org/. Second, MOHR shares information (care plans, patient narrative, and patient progress) across clinical and community team members. Third, MOHR supports messaging and video visits for team members and patients. Finally, MOHR sends care team members quarterly patient progress updates.</description>

    <description>Clinicians randomized to the control condition will continue to provide &quot;usual care.&quot; This includes current non-systematic assessment of health behaviors, mental health needs, and social needs. Neither clinicians nor patients will be eligible to receive CHW support or have access to NWD. Clinicians may refer some control patients to community programs as part of their current usual care. Control clinicians will be blinded as to which patients are included in the study. At the end of the study, the investigators will share with control clinicians our lessons learned, access to MOHR, and lists of useful community resources.</description>
