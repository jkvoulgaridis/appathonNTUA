  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bacterial decolonization of the nares and
      skin prior to treatment with radiotherapy (RT) for patients with cancers of the head and neck
      or breast, can prevent high-grade radiation dermatitis (RD) and improve quality of life. This
      study is being conducted because prior studies from this research group have found bacterial
      colonization in the nose prior to initiation of RT to be associated with an increased risk of
      high-grade RD. Patients in the treatment arm will receive pretreatment with mupirocin
      ointment to the nares and chlorhexidine wash to the body while patients in the control arm
      will receive standard of care treatment. Bacterial cultures will be taken from the nares and
      skin, and participants will also complete a quality of life questionnaire before and after
      RT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of high grade radiation dermatitis rated by CTCAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Radiation dermatitis (graded by the CTCAE) will be assessed at the last treatment session (study week depends on patient's length of treatment, but ranges from 5 weeks to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>1. The primary goal is to determine if bacterial decolonization is associated with less severe radiation dermatitis. The primary endpoint is the incidence of high-grade radiation dermatitis (grade 2-5) at the end of treatment.
Radiation dermatitis grading will be assessed by photographs taken at the last radiation therapy visit, and a blinded dermatologist will view the images and assess for toxicity grading.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life rated by the Skindex</measure>
    <time_frame>Quality of life will be assessed at the first (week 1) and last week of treatment (study week depends on patient's length of treatment, but ranges from 5 weeks to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>2. The secondary goal is to assess if the intervention prevents decrease in quality of life compared to the control arm. The secondary endpoint will measure the change in quality of life from the beginning to the end of radiation therapy, to assess if patients receiving decolonization experience less impact on quality of life compared to standard of care radiation therapy treatment.
Quality of life will be measured by the Skindex-16, a validated 16-item self-administered survey instrument that measures the effects of skin disease on patients' quality of life. Scores vary from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time), and responses are aggregated in symptoms (four items), emotions (seven items), and functioning scales (five items). Higher scores correlate with highest quality of life, while lower scores correspond to poorer quality of life.</description>
