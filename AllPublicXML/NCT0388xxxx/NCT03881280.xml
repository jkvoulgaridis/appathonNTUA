  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test an evidence-based intervention, allocated to a mobile app
      designed to parents and their children with 3 to 6 years old, identified by family doctors or
      nurses at well-child care visits as overweight or obese for age.

      This intervention aims to improve parent's perceptions and attitudes regarding children's
      weight status and food intake, leading to better dietary intake and children's' eating
      behaviors through positive parental child-feeding practices. In this study, the investigators
      aim to assess the feasibility of the intervention and explore its impact on the beliefs and
      attitudes of parents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll parents and their children with 3 to 6 years old, identified by
      family doctors or nurses at well-child care visits as overweight/obese for age.

      Participant's eligibility will be assessed. Participants will be randomized to: 1) control
      group; 2) intervention group. The control group will receive treatment as usual. Parents in
      the intervention group will be provided with the app and invited to use it for 4 weeks.
      During the 4 weeks, the administrator monitors the app usage and call once to parents to
      improve it, if needed.

      Both groups will perform a pre- and post-test, evaluating parent's perceptions and attitudes
      regarding children's weight status and food intake; eating behaviors and parental
      child-feeding practices.

    <description>Increase Children's Satiety Responsiveness. This was evaluated by the mean score of 5 items of Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire.Satiety Responsiveness reflects the ability to regulate the amount of food eaten, based on perceived fullness. Parents answered in a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 5 = always), with higher values reflecting higher punctuation in each subscale. A version of this questionnaire has been previously validated and adapted to Portuguese children aged 3-13 years (Viana, Sinde, &amp; Saxton, 2008).</description>

    <description>Parenting education program through the app Fammeal. It includes educational content, tailored to parents and centered on positive parenting child-feeding practices. The app will also include a virtual-pet game for children, in order to help them self-regulate their intake.
Through the app, parents will:
Fill in a registration questionnaire, which will tailor recommendations.
Receive information and video content recommendations.
Set goals related to their child's lifestyle and tracking progress.
Earn points by watching the contents.
Invite children to play a serious game.
Exchange messages with other users.
The investigators created a support website that connects to the main server to get data gathered from the mobile app and game.</description>
