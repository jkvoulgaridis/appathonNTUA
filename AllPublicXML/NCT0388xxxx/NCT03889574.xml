      1.2. Aim(s)/Objective(s)

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of triple antithrombotic therapy in patients taking
           DAPT of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor in addition to either a NOAC or warfarin for the
           prevention of thromboembolic or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events in patients with
           non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), history of coronary artery disease (CAD)/stent
           placement or recurrent ACS event.

        -  To determine the Methodist Health System (MHS) prescribing practices and patterns in
           cardiac patients with a history of AF who are admitted for CAD or an ACS event requiring
           PCI.

      1.4. Hypothesis 1.4.1. Primary Hypothesis Cardiac patients with a history of AF and an
      indication for long-term NOAC who are also prescribed DAPT following an ASC event or
      revascularization with stenting will demonstrate a significant difference in cardiovascular
      outcomes and major bleeding events when compared with warfarin-based triple therapy.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrythmia in clinical practice that often
      requires stroke prevention with an anticoagulant. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with either
      warfarin or non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) significantly decreases the incidence
      of ischemic stroke and peripheral embolism in patients with AF.1 Approximately 10% of
      patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are found to have a history of
      AF. 1-3 In cardiac patients requiring PCI with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy
      (DAPT) has been associated with a decreased risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and
      stent thrombosis when compared with aspirin alone or the combination of a vitamin K
      antagonist (VKA) plus aspirin.2 Triple therapy is defined as the concurrent use of OAC, such
      as warfarin or NOACs, and DAPT with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel,
      prasugrel and ticagrelor.1-4 The most common clinical indication for triple therapy is stroke
      prevention with OAC in patients with non-valvular AF in the setting of an acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) event or PCI with stent placement.5

      Common practice reflects an increase in use of triple therapy for the potential reduction in
      ischemic events associated with stent placement and AF. Yet, there is limited evidence and
      guidance on prescribing triple therapy in high risk patients. In American and European
      guidelines, triple therapy of DAPT with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is the standard
      regimen for the prevention of stent thrombosis, MI, death, and stroke among stented PCI
      patients.6-8 Specifically, the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the
      management of AF recommends the use of triple therapy with warfarin, clopidogrel and aspirin
      in AF patients undergoing coronary stenting.9 The 2016 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/
      American Heart Association (AHA) focused update on duration of DAPT recommend the initiation
      of DAPT following an ACS event or stent placement and suggest triple therapy be kept as short
      as possible citing clopidogrel as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor.10 Prolonged triple therapy,
      from 1 month up to 6 months, has been recommended among AF patients at elevated ischemic risk
      or following an ACS. However, the 2017 ESC focused update on DAPT in patients with coronary
      artery disease (CAD) recommend for one-month duration of triple therapy or dual therapy using
      clopidogrel and OAC in patients with bare metal stent (BMS) placement or those with a high
      risk of bleeding. 11

      Managing OAC in patients on triple therapy is most challenging due to safety concerns with
      increased risk for major bleeds and clinically relevant non-major bleeds (CRNMB). Triple
      therapy carries a higher risk of bleeding than DAPT or dual therapy with OAC plus aspirin or
      a P2Y12 inhibitor. The risk increases as duration increases.5-8 Data from retrospective
      studies has demonstrated a 3- to 5-fold increase in bleeding rates associated with triple
      therapy compared with alternative antithrombotic regimens of dual therapy.2-3 Additional
      strategies hypothesized to decrease bleeding risk was shortening the duration of DAPT for AF
      patients prescribed triple therapy. The ISAR-TRIPLE trial evaluated the net clinical outcome
      of reduction in thrombosis and bleeding events in 614 patients requiring OAC undergoing
      drug-eluting stent (DES) placement after coronary intervention plus DAPT with clopidogrel for
      6-weeks versus 6-months.12 The study demonstrated an absolute reduction in Bleeding Academic
      Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding events among patients with a shorter 6-week duration of
      triple therapy when compared to a 6-month duration of triple therapy. Nonetheless, the study
      showed no reduction of net clinical benefit in death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, and major
      bleeding.

      Historically, increased bleeding complications among patients with AF who require PCI was
      associated with VKA-based triple therapy and prompted the investigation of alternative
      antithrombotic regimens to minimize bleeding risk.2-4 For AF patients following stent
      placement, NOACs were shown to be a safe and effective alternative to VKA-based therapy in
      the secondary prevention of thromboembolic events based on the results of the PIONEER AF-PCI
      and RE DUAL PCI trials.13-14 In the PIONEER AF-PCI trial, 2124 AF patients who had recently
      undergone stent placement were randomized to either receive rivaroxaban 15mg once daily plus
      a P2Y12 inhibitor, low dose rivaroxaban 2.5mg twice daily plus DAPT (P2Y12 inhibitor plus
      low-dose aspirin), or triple therapy with VKA plus DAPT (P2Y12 inhibitor plus low-dose
      aspirin).13 Patients on triple therapy were stratified to groups based on the duration of
      DAPT (1, 3, 6, or 12 months). While the rivaroxaban-based triple therapy regimens were
      associated with a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding compared with
      VKA-based regimens, the rates of CV death, MI, or stroke were comparable among all 3
      treatment arms.

      The RE-DUAL PCI trial randomized 2725 AF patients who had undergoing PCI to receive either
      dual therapy with low dose dabigatran 110 mg plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, dual therapy with full
      dose dabigatran 150 mg plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, or triple therapy with VKA plus DAPT (P2Y12
      inhibitor plus low-dose aspirin).14 The dual therapy treatment arms with both full and low
      dose dabigatran demonstrated a lower rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding
      when compared with VKA-based triple therapy. Again, the study showed no difference between
      groups for rates of the composite endpoint of all-cause death, MI, stroke or systemic
      embolism, or unplanned revascularization.

      The WOEST trial investigated 573 patients who had undergone PCI to either triple therapy (any
      OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin) or dual therapy (OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor without
      aspirin).15 The study demonstrated that dual therapy was associated with a significant
      reduction in both endpoints of bleeding complications and all-cause mortality. The study also
      showed no reduction in CV mortality and no increase in the rate of thrombotic events.15 It is
      worth noting that it is unknown whether the results of this study can be extrapolated to
      NOACs as the majority of patients were on warfarin for OAC.

      Although the various combinations of antithrombotic regimens are not well studied in regards
      to safety and efficacy, it is suspected that current prescribing patterns for triple therapy
      are not evidence based. According to the 2016 ACC/AHA guideline focused update on duration of
      DAPT, ticagrelor is preferred over clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in
      patients with ACS treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation. This update further
      complicates the antithrombotic triad that will be prescribed in clinical practice. As
      demonstrated in a single-center retrospective analysis of antithrombotic prescribing in AF
      following PCI, less than half of patients received non-evidence-based triple therapy which is
      suggestive of vast variability in prescribing patterns for triple therapy among
      cardiologists.16 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of triple
      antithrombotic therapy (Aspirin + OAC + P2Y12 Inhibitor) in patients with non-valvular AF
      following an ACS event or PCI requiring stent placement and to evaluate prescribing patterns
      of such therapy.

      1.3. Rationale for the study The rationale for this study is to evaluate the efficacy and 1-,
      3-, 6- and 12-month safety outcomes of patients treated with NOAC-based triple therapy
      following PCI with stenting compared with warfarin-based triple therapy. In order to assess
      prescribing patterns and practices at MHS, baseline demographics, the PCI procedural
      characteristics, and bleeding risks will be carefully defined.

      1.5. Potential Risks and Benefits of the study 1.5.1. Potential Risks Due to the
      retrospective nature of this chart review, clinical intervention will be unaffected by the
      investigator of this study. The risks include non-permitted disclosure of protected health
      information and private medical information.

      1.5.2. Potential Benefits Possible benefits include optimization of antithrombotic strategies
      and regimens in high risk AF patients requiring DAPT and long-term OAC to minimize adverse
      events related to major bleeds and negative cardiovascular outcomes.

      2. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES 2.1. Study Objectives 2.1.1. Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the incidence of thrombosis and readmission rates for major adverse
           cardiovascular events (MACE) in warfarin-based triple therapy treatment arm compared
           with NOAC-based triple therapy treatment arm.

        -  To identify the incidence of major bleeding events (defined as all bleeding events that
           led to hospitalization or presentation to an acute care facility) in patients discharged
           with warfarin-based triple therapy compared with NOAC-based triple therapy.

      2.1.2. Secondary Objectives:

        -  To identify differences in prescribing patterns and practices among prescribers who
           initiate DAPT in AF patients on OAC following PCI with stenting.

        -  To assess characteristics, management and outcomes in patients with AF who experience a
           major bleeding event while taking aspirin, an anticoagulant (NOAC or warfarin) and a
           P2Y12 inhibitor.

        -  To individually assess the incidence of thrombosis and readmission rates for MACE in the
           subgroups for each antithrombotic agent: P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel vs. prasugrel vs.
           ticagrelor) and NOACs (edoxaban vs. dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban vs. apixaban).

        -  To individually assess the incidence of major bleeding events in the subgroups for each
           antithrombotic agent: P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel vs. prasugrel vs. ticagrelor) and
           NOACs (edoxaban vs. dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban vs. apixaban).

      2.2. Study Outcome Measures 2.2.1. Primary Outcome

        -  To compare the incidence of MACE, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhage), MI (STEMI and
           NSTEMI), stent thrombosis, systemic embolism (VTE), death (all-cause, cardiac and
           non-cardiac) and CAD-associated hospitalizations/ED visits) in patients who received
           warfarin-based triple therapy versus NOAC-based triple therapy.

      2.2.2. Secondary Outcome(s)

        -  To compare incidence of major bleeding defined by a modified International Society on
           Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria17 including documented bleeding events in
           medical record/progress note, fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding into a critical
           organ, bleeding into a surgical site requiring reoperation, and bleeding that led to
           hospitalization or an acute care facility in patients who received warfarin-based triple
           therapy versus NOAC-based triple therapy at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months and 1 year.

      4.3. Premature Termination or suspension of study Due to the retrospective nature of this
      chart review, determination of premature termination or suspension of study is arbitrary.
      This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable
      cause. Written notification documenting the reason for study suspension or termination will
      be provided by the suspending or terminating party. If the study is prematurely terminated or
      suspended, the principal investigator will promptly inform the IRB and will provide the
      reason(s) for suspension or termination.

      Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:

        -  Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects

        -  Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements

        -  Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable

        -  Determination of futility

           5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1. Sample Size Considerations This is a retrospective
           observational study limited to only patients meeting inclusion criteria. Any correlation
           between the above-mentioned factors and safety or efficacy outcomes will be strengthened
           by larger cohort of patients. As this is a retrospective study with limited patients
           available for the cohort, all patients meeting inclusion criteria from April 1, 2017 -
           April 1, 2018 will be included to obtain the largest sample size possible. This study
           will include two group comparisons and will also generate a summary and overall
           evaluation of prescribing patterns of DAPT initiation in patients on OAC or vice versa.

      5.2. Statistical Analysis Plan Descriptive analysis will be performed for all continuous
      variables. Mean ± standard deviation will be presented for normally distributed variables and
      median ± interquartile range will be presented for non-normal variables. Count and
      proportions will be presented for all categorical variables. Normally distributed continuous
      outcomes will be analyzed with Student's t-test and non-normally distributed continuous
      outcomes will be analyzed with nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Categorical outcomes
      will be analyzed using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for smaller samples.

      6. ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 6.1. Ethical Standard The investigators will ensure
      that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set forth in The Belmont
