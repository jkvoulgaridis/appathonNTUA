  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether a 12-week neuromuscular rehabilitation
      program (NEMEX-TJR) combined with pain neuroscience education (PNE) provides greater pain
      relief, improvement in physical function and quality of life than PNE alone in a population
      of patients with chronic pain after primary total knee arthroplasty.

      Hypothesis: Rehabilitation involving neuromuscular training and PNE will provide greater pain
      relief, improved function and improved quality of life compared to PNE alone at the primary
      endpoint, which is follow-up 12months after the start of the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is considered the most frequent cause of disability and pain in the elderly
      population, and the knee joint is one of the joints most commonly affected.

      End-stage osteoarthritis is often treated with knee replacement, and total knee arthroplasty
      is considered an effective treatment for pain relief and improved function. However, several
      studies have reported less favorable outcomes after total knee arthroplasty, and systematic
      reviews found chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty at 12 months post-operative in
      13-17% of the patients and chronic pain rates at 2-7 years post-operative varying between
      8-27%. No randomized controlled trials evaluating exercise and pain education treatments to
      patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty exists, and this highlights the need
      for evidence-based knowledge of which treatment should be considered for this population.

Physiotherapists will instruct and supervise the participants during the neuromuscular exercises. The aim of the neuromuscular exercise program is to restore normal movement, improve sensorimotor control, re-establishing normal motor program strategies and muscle activation.
60min. of pain neuroscience education at the beginning of intervention period and after 6 weeks. Both sessions will take 60min. and will be conducted by physiotherapists. The aim of the pain neuroscience education is to increase the pain neuroscience knowledge of the patients leading to a better understanding of their chronic pain and thereby engaging the patients in the treatment of their chronic pain and impaired function.</description>
