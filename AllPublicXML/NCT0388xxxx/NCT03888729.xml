    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to determine the antiviral efficacy and evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) and sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir/
      voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) used to treat individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus infection
      in Rwanda adults.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-arm study that will examine the antiviral efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of 12 weeks daily therapy with fixed dose combination (FDC) of SOF/VEL and
      SOF/VEL/VOX administered respectively in HCV-infected treatment-naïve adult participants and
      in HCV-infected individuals with a history of virologic failure to SOF/LDV or other
      DAA-containing regimen. A total of 100 participants will be enrolled in this portion of the
      SHARED study, labelled the &quot;SHARED 3 study&quot;: 60 treatment-naïve participants and 40
      individuals with history of virologic failure to SOF/LDV or other DAA-containing regimen

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be assigned to one of the following two groups in parallel for the duration of the study, based on treatment indication to be put on SOF/VEL or SOF/VEL/VOX:
sofosbubir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) FDC once daily for 12 weeks will be administered to HCV-infected individuals naïve to DAA therapy regimen (in this group we consider also HCV-infected individuals who have failed interferon-based therapy) who meet other eligibility criteria;
sofosbubir/velpatasvir /voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) FDC once daily for 12 weeks will be administered to HCV treatment-experienced participants (i.e. HCV-infected individuals with a history of virologic failure to SOF/LDV or other DAA-containing regimen) who meet other eligibility criteria.</intervention_model_description>
