  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single blind, prospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the Silk'n ToothWave Power Toothbrush for stains reduction and improvement of teeth shade.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes 84 treatment sessions, twice a day, and 4 clinic visits over a period of 6
      weeks.

      One treatment group (Silk'n power toothbrush - ToothWave) and 1 control group (an ADA
      approved power toothbrush (PTB)) will participate in the study.

      For each patient, efficacy assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 6
      weeks. The average stain data will be calculated for each group.

      Treatment is defined as a timed, 2 minute brushing of the teeth according to the
      manufactur-er's instructions, twice daily (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken
      using the Silk'n toothbrush and standard fluoride toothpaste. The control group will use an
      ADA ac-cepted PTB and the same standard fluoride toothpaste.

    <description>Extrinsic Stains will be evaluated using the validated Lobene Stain Index (LSI)
Stain Intensity score range is between 0 and 3, where:
0 = no stain
= light stain
= moderate stain
= heavy stain
The mean stain intensity will be calculated for both the gingival and body regions of the incisor teeth for each subject.
Stain Area score rage is between 0 and 3, where:
0 = no stain
= stain covering up to one third of region
= stain covering up to two thirds of region
= stain covering more than two thirds of region
The mean stain area will be calculated for both the gingival and body regions of the incisor teeth for each subject.</description>
