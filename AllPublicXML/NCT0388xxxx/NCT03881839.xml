    <textblock>
      Over the years, there has been an increase in the flow of emergency rooms, which is gradually
      leading to an overcrowding of emergency unit. This overcrowding is multifactorial with, for
      example, a decrease in the outpatient care in family medicine and specialized medicine,
      emergency services unsuitable at the level of premises ... In parallel, investigator note in
      recent years facilitated access to internet and especially to GAFA which is the acronym for
      Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple. As a result, patients have 24-hour access to medical
      information via websites, blogs and social networks. This information of, often, unreliable
      medical information can lead to ambiguity among patients about the need for urgent or delayed
      intervention in the management of their symptoms. In fact, &quot;everything becomes urgent&quot;. To
      date, in France, no study has evaluated the impact and prevalence of consulting a website for
      medical purposes before consulting an emergency service. The objective of this research will
      be to assess, in patients presenting in an emergency department, the prior consultation of
      medical information on a website, the impact on the emergency consultation decision and the
      relevance of this consultation.

      It is an observational study, monocentric, prospective. This study consists in collecting
      data from an anonymized questioner given to patients presenting themselves at the emergency
      department of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. Answers to the questions will not change
      the patient's management. The questioner, containing 17 questions, requires answering &quot;yes&quot;
      or &quot;no&quot; by ticking boxes, or even specify when it is stipulated. This questionnaire will be
      given to the patient after his registration, and filled by the latter in the waiting room,
      pending medical care. Answering the questionnaire will take between 5 to 10 minutes. The data
      is anonymous.

      The patient arrives at the emergency department and registers at the entrance desks where a
      paper and computer file is created. Then, the Reception and Orientation Nurse takes care of
      the patient by welcoming him in the reception box, she realizes the taking of the
      hemodynamics constants, the collection of the reason of consultation with the grievances of
      the patient. During this phase, patient will be inform of the completion of this study and
      asked to participate in this study. If the patient agrees to participate, an anonymized
      questioner will be provided and explained by one of the investigating physicians or
      associated partners.
