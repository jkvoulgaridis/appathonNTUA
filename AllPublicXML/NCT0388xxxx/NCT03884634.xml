  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a systematic random sampling study of the effects of the Dabir Micropressure Overlay
      on perioperative pressure injuries during cardiac surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a simple pragmatic systematic quality improvement study aimed at real-world
      evaluation of a device claimed to reduce pressure ulcers in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.

      Data acquisition will be based on systematic sampling of cardiac surgery operations based on
      odd and even calendar dates. On odd dates the Dabir micropressure overlay will be functional
      on the operating room tables. On even dates the Dabir micropressure overlay will not be
      functional on the operating room tables. Data on baseline characteristics, operative
      parameters, and primary and secondary endpoints will be gathered from STS and wound care
      sources, which are routinely collected for all patients. There will be no additional patient
      information and data collected specifically for this study.

    <description>The study intervention is the use of the Dabir micropressure overlay on the operating room table during surgical operations. The device is positioned on top of a standard foam pad and gel heat exchanger. The overlay is already in use in some (but not all) adult cardiac operating rooms.
The overlay will be present on the operating room table for all adult cardiac operations. On odd calendar dates the device will be powered on, and on even calendar dates the device will be powered off.</description>
