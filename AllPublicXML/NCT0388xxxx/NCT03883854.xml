    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common problem with a prevalence of 1-2% in general population and a major
      cause of mortality,morbidity and impaired quality of life. Anemia is afrequent comorbidity in
      stable heart failure patients and it increases morbidity in terms of frequent hospital
      admissions,impaired exercise capacity,poor quality of life ,and increased mortality

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency with or without anemia has been commonly associated with heart failure
      .Although iron deficiency is the commonest nutritional deficiency worldwide ,affecting more
      than one-third of the population,its association with heart failure with or without anemia is
      of growing interest .As iron supplementation improves prognosis in patients with heart
      failure ,iron deficiency is an attractive therapeutic target.

      In 2012 ,the European society of cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
      acute and chronic heart failure recognized iron deficiency as a comorbidity in heart failure
      for the first time and recommended diagnosis of iron deficiency based on iron parameters in
      all patients suspected of having heart failure.

      Iron deficiency can be classified as absolute or functional. Absolute iron deficiency
      reflects depleted body stores caused by poor dietary intake, impaired gastrointestinal
      absorption,and chronic blood loss.

      Functional iron deficiency is thought to be caused by increased hepcidin production and
      subsequent inhibition of the iron exporter ferroportin ,leading to impaired absorption and
      utilization of iron.

      Chronic heart failure patients are susceptible to both forms iron deficiency

      Aetiology of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure:

      The aetiology is multifactorial and complex

        1. reduced dietary intake

        2. chronic blood loss

        3. chronic heart failure causes an inflammatory state which leads to increased hepcidin
           levels and subsequent iron deficiency due to reduced iron absorption and enhanced
           reticuloendothelial block
