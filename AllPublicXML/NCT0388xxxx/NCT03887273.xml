  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, partially blinded, sequential cohort,
      dose-escalation study designed to obtain preliminary data on the safety, tolerability, and
      early activity of Q-Cells® transplantation in subjects with Transverse Myelitis. For each of
      the dose levels, transplantation of Q-Cells® unilaterally into spinal cord demyelinated
      lesions will be evaluated. Subjects will be blinded to side of treatment.

      Idiopathic Transverse Myelitis is a monophasic disorder characterized predominantly by
      demyelination. Patients are left with disability from damage to ascending and descending
      white matter tracts. Q-Cells® are comprised of glial progenitor cells.It is postulated that
      the Q-Cells® glial progeny (healthy astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) will integrate into the
      spinal cord lesion site and remyelinate demyelinated axons as well as provide trophic support
      for damaged axons. Therefore, Q-Cells® have the potential to repair damage that has occurred
      and could be clinically useful for patients with disability caused by TM.

      The study is planned to enroll up to 9 subjects. Each subject will be followed for 9 months
      after transplantation of Q-Cells®. Each subject will receive a single time point
      administration of Q-Cells®: with transplantation foci targeted to posterior columns in the
      spinal cord (all transplantation foci below C7) on one side.

      Study participation consists of Screening, Pre-operative/Treatment, and Post-treatment study
      periods that will generally last from 9 to 12 months in total. The study data will be
      assessed for safety and activity until the last subject has completed the 9-month study
      visit. Following completion of the 9-month follow-up period, subjects who consent will
      continue to be followed for safety and activity in a separate long-term follow-up protocol.

    <measure>Scores on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale testing including motor and sensory evaluations</measure>
    <time_frame>9-months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's grade is based on how much sensation he or she can feel at multiple points on the body, as well as tests of motor function. Sensory grading is 0 (sensation absent), 1 (impaired sensitivity), or 2 (normal sensation) for each of light touch and pin prick sensation at each of 28 locations bilaterally: a maximum of 224 for total normal sensation. Motor function is graded from 0 (total paralysis) to 5 (normal active movement) for each of ten motor functions (e.g. knee extension; 10 total motions bilaterally) for a maximum of 100.</description>

    <measure>Score on Ashworth Spasticity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>9-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) will be used to measure spasticity. During the administration of the MAS the examiner passively moves the joint being tested and rates the perceived level of resistance in the muscle groups opposing the movement. The scale is single-item measures ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no increase in muscle tone and 4 indicates that the affected part is rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Latency and conduction velocities from tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>9-months</time_frame>
    <description>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs or SSEPs) are a useful, noninvasive means of assessing the somatosensory pathway functioning. Electrodes are placed on the lower extremity, the back, neck and head of a patient. A nonpainful electrical stimulus is applied to the lower extremity and the signal transduction is captured by the electrodes along the back, neck and scalp. The speed of signal transduction and amplitude of the signal is measured. Standardized values are recorded and can be monitored over time. Changes in the latency (conduction velocity) will be tracked from baseline to the 9 month outcome. Transverse Myeltitis decreases the conduction speed (an increase in latency); shorter latency (increased conduction velocity) would be an indication of recovery of function.</description>
