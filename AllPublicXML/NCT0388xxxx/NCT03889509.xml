      in systemic sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A systematic review was conducted to determine the risk/associated factors for pulmonary
      arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis, including clinical/disease characteristics,
      antibody status, test results and biomarkers. The frequency of publications featuring a
      risk/association were reported. The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, the
      Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and SCOPUS.

      The following search terms were used:

      ( essential pulmonary hypertension or familial primary pulmonary hypertension or
      hypertension, pulmonary or hypertension,lung or hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease or
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or lung arterial hypertension or lung artery
      hypertension or lung hypertension or primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary arterial
      hypertension or pulmonary artery hypertension or pulmonary fixed hypertension or pulmonary
      hypertensive disease or pulmonary hypertensive diseases or pulmonary hypertensive disorder or
      pulmonary hypertensive disorders )

      AND

      ( generalised scleroderma or generalized scleroderma or progressive scleroderma or
      progressive sclerodermia or progressive sclerosis,systemic or progressive systemic sclerosis
      or scleroderma, generalised or scleroderma, generalized or scleroderma, progressive or
      scleroderma, systemic or sclerosis,progressive systemic or sclerosis,systemic or
      sclerosis,systemic progressive or systemic progressive sclerosis or systemic scleroderma or
      systemic sclerosis,progressive or

      scleroderma, limited or limited scleroderma or limited cutaneous scleroderma or

      diffuse scleroderma or progressive diffuse scleroderma or scleroderma, diffuse )

      AND

      ( prevalence or prevalence study or relative risk or risk factors )

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Studies were included they were (1) in patients with SSc; and if they (2) determined
             PAH with right heart catheterization; (3) involved a comparison of SSc patients with
             and without PAH; and (4) had sample size larger than 20.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Studies were excluded if they were review articles, and if the study was written in
             languages other than English. When the same patients were used in more than one
             analysis, the most recent or largest sample-size study was included.
