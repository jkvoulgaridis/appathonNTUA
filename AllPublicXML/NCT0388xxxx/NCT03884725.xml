      The purporse of this study is evaluate whether fibrinogen concentrate reduces postoperative
      bleeding in pediatric cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary by-pass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery in children may be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding.
      Perioperative excessive bleeding is associated with need of transfusion with allogeneic blood
      products such as red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelet pools, and cryoprecipitate.
      Furthermore, bleeding may result in re-exploration, which is associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality.Recent studies have shown that patients and children undergoing
      cardiac surgery with pump often experience a significant drop in their levels and function of
      fibrinogen, and it would be in part responsible for the bleeding. Fibrinogen concentrate
      (Haemocomplettan P)may reduce perioperative bleeding, requirements of blood transfusion and
      clinical outcomes in children undergoing cardiac surgery with pump.
