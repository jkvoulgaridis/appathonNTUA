  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal Cancer is the commonest cancer diagnosed for both genders combined in Hong Kong.
      In 2015 16.6% of all new cancer cases registered on the Hong Kong registry were cancer of
      colon and rectum. With recent development in oncological and surgical treatments for rectal
      cancer, many patients are receiving sphincter-preserving surgery with low colorectal or
      coloanal anastomosis to avoid permanent stoma.

      Up to 80% of patients who has undergone low anterior resection (LAR), suffer from severe
      bowel dysfunction post operatively. Patients may suffer from a wide range of symptoms from
      incontinence, frequency, and urgency to constipation and feelings of incomplete emptying.
      This combination of symptoms after LAR is referred to as Low Anterior Resection Syndrome
      (LARS) which is associated with negative impact on quality of life (QoL). Originally, it was
      thought that these symptoms were due to early postoperative changes. Many studies report that
      the majority of patients experience longterm changes in quality of life after LAR. Therefore,
      a large number of patients worldwide are suffering from unpredictable, poor bowel function
      postoperatively affecting their day-to-day activity and quality of life. The cause of LARS is
      often multifactorial and difficult to define. Unfortunately, there is no cure for LARS at
      present. This trial is designed to use Fecobionics, a new Hong Kong based innovation of a
      simulated stool, to provide new mechanistic insights regarding anorectal physiological
      function post low anterior resection to understand the condition better to improve their
      treatment options.
