  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, prospective, comparative, open label sample size adaptive study.

      The study will be performed in two steps: A training step where up to 30 subjects will be
      enrolled to confirm uterine contraction performance level.

      The study will then be paused for around 45 days to complete validation and code freeze; a
      protocol amendment will be implemented if applicable.

      In the second step, performance of the uterine contraction detection algorithm will be
      validated. The validation phase will involve up to 80 subjects, as the study will follow a
      sample size adaptive design with one interim analysis planned to allow for sample size
      increase or completion per original sample size.

    <measure>To achieve high agreement in comparison between Invu TM and the IUPC monitoring in detecting uterine contractions (defined by time start and end, and duration).</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 hours per subject</time_frame>
    <description>Uterine contractions output data will be reviewed by 3 blinded assessors. The contractions will be marked upon the output strips. Time (start and end) and duration of contractions will be compared in order to evaluate the agreement between two parallel defined contractions from both different devices (Gold Standard IUPC and Study Device (Invu™) for the same subject. The total number of contractions collected from all subjects will be compared; recording will be performed during a 30-60 minutes session (number of contractions can vary for subject, but at least one contraction per subject is required).</description>
