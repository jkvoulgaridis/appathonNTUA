  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, multi-center, 2-way crossover Pharmacokinetic
      PK evaluation of a single inhaled dose of CVT-301 84 mg and a single oral dose of
      carbidopa/levodopa CD/LD 25 mg/100 mg (Sinemet®) under fed conditions in Parkinson's Disease
      (PD) patients who regularly take CD/LD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study duration includes a screening period followed by an overnight stay in the center (4
      days, 3 nights) to complete 2 treatments, including a 48-hour interval between the
      treatments, and a follow-up phone call 1-2 days after discharge from the center.

      On each of two treatment days, subjects will consume a standard high fat meal and then
      receive either (A) a single inhaled dose of CVT-301 or (B) a single dose of oral CD/LD
      followed by Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for 4 hours. A crossover design will be used such
      that each subject receives both Treatment A and Treatment B over the 2 treatment days,
      randomized 1:1 to the treatment sequence AB or BA.
