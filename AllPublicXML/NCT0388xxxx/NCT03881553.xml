  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot project will evaluate independently two non-pharmacological interventions, 1)
      Neurosensory, Environmental Adaptive Technology (NEATCAP) and 2) Stochastic Vibrotactile
      Stimulation (SVS), as adjuvant non-pharmacological interventions for improving sleep and
      cardio-respiratory function in hospitalized infants. Within-subject design allows subjects to
      serve as their own control and receive periods of routine care with and without intervention.
      One intervention will be evaluated per study session. Infants may participate in up to four
      sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants and children treated in the hospital often present with autonomic and sleep
      disturbances that may be related to prematurity, opioid and other drug exposures in utero,
      illness, surgery, medical procedures, and/or treatment medications. In addition, patients
      treated in neonatal and pediatric units often require prolonged hospitalization with medical
      monitoring and life-sustaining devices equipped with patient safety alarms. Such bedside
      equipment may result in patients being exposed to loud and/or persistent noises that may
      further disrupt sleep and autonomic function and compromise recovery and outcomes.

      This pilot study will study three separate pediatric populations being treated in neonatal
      and pediatric hospital units: 1) Premature Infants; 2) Opioid-exposed newborns requiring
      medication for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; and 3) Critically-ill infants treated for
      illness or surgery. Subjects will participate in up to 4 study sessions during their
      hospitalization, testing independent effects of two interventions complementary to routine
      care: 1) Neurosensory, Environmental Adaptive Technology (NEATCAP), and 2) stochastic
      vibrotactile stimulation (SVS). Within-subject design will allow for comparisons between
      periods, i.e., with and without the study-session intervention, separately for each device,
      for improving sleep and cardio-respiratory function in three independent groups of
      hospitalized infants.
