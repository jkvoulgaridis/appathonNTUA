          -  Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 and Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) of 24
             to 30 inclusive.

             acute lung injury (TRALI).

          -  Patients who do not want to receive blood transfusion for religious or cultural
             reasons such as Jehovah Witness Faith.

          -  Has a medical condition that would interfere with participation such as congestive

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension as defined by systolic/diastolic BP three times more than
             165/100.

          -  No venous access for plasma exchange therapy.

          -  Any neurological condition that could be contributing to cognitive decline such as
             Lewy body disease, front temporal dementia, strokes or other cerebrovascular disease,
             head trauma, substance abuse, multiple sclerosis, Vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid

          -  MRI showing acute or subacute hemorrhage, evidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus,
             hemispheric infarcts, glioma or other brain tumor that could contribute to cognitive
             decline.

             contraindication to having an LP is present. Examples are platelet count&lt;100,000,
             spine deformity or contraindication to come off blood thinner for the LP. Patients may
             still participate in the rest of the study without having and LP.

          -  Any unspecified reason that the investigator finds the patient unsuitable to take
             part.
