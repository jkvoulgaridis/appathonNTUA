  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves a randomized placebo controlled trial that aims to assess if a mouthwash
      (Listerine cool mint) is able to reduce the cumulative incidence of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and
      syphilis in men who have sex with men and receiving preexposure prophylaxis at the Institute
      of Tropical Medicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess if there is a difference in the incidence rate of gonorrhea,
      chlamydia and syphilis detected at any site whilst individuals are on daily and pre/post sex
      Listerine cool mint (LCM) vs. placebo mouthwash.

      The study has a double-blind, cross-over design, in which subjects will be screened at the
      ITM and, if eligible, will be enrolled and randomized to group 1 (LCM) or group 2 (placebo).
      After 3 months, a crossover will occur and subjects will switch to the other intervention.
      Each participant will therefore be enrolled for 6 months (2 x 3 months, no wash out period).

      Subjects will be recruited from the existing PrEP cohort at the Institute of Tropical
      Medicine Antwerp. A total of 320 subjects will be recruited (160 in each arm).

    <measure>Incidence rate of NG plus Ct plus Syphilis in each study arm for each period</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month period</time_frame>
    <description>The sum of new diagnoses of Ng, CT and syphilis in a 3 month period on LCM/placebo. Each participant can only contribute one diagnosis of Ct and one diagnosis of Ng per visit - regardless of number of sites infected. Thus each participant can contribute up to 3 diagnoses (Ct/Ng/syphilis) at each visit. The diagnosis of Ng and Ct will be made via molecular testing and syphilis via RPR and TPA tests according to currently used European case definitions</description>
