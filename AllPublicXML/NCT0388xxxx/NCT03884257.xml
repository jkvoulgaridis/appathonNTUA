  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BIOPACT RCT tiral investigates the efficacy and safety of stenosis, restenosis or
      occlusions in the femoropopliteal artery of patients presenting a rutherford classification
      2,3 or 4 with a Passeo-18 Lux drug-coated balloon of Biotronik. The Paclitaxel eluting
      balloons are designed for percutaneous transluminal angioplasties in which the balloon will
      dilate the artery upon inflation and deliver the paclitaxel locally.

      An expected total of 151 patients will be treated with the Passeo-18 Lux and compared to a
      control group of another 151 patients that will be treated with the IN.PACT Admiral
      drug-coated balloon of Medtronic. Assignment to the treatment groups will be at random. The
      study will be conducted in two phases. A first pilot study phase of 120 patients distributed
      evenly over both treatment groups and a second phase to formally test the non-inferiority
      hypothesis.

      The balloon is coated with Paclitaxel intended to avoid cellular proliferation. The drug is
      released by means of rapid inflation as to release a high dose in a short amount of time.
      Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 months post-procedure.

      The primary efficacy endpoints are defined as follows. Freedom from clinically-driven target
      lesion revascularization at 12 months. Freedom from device- and procedure-related death
      through 30 days post-index procedure, major target limb amputation through 12 months
      post-procedure and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization through 12 months
      post-index procedure. The secondary endpoints are defined as acute device success, acute
      procedural success , freedom from all cause of death, major target limb amputation and
      clinically driven target vessel revascularisation through 30 days post-procedure, sustained
      clinical improvement, no major adverse events through 6 and 12 months post-procedure, primary
      patency, target lesion revascularisation, target vessel revascularisation, binary restenosis,
      major target limb amputation, thrombosis at target lesion, change of walking impairment
      questionnaire score from baseline, change in target limb rutherford classification or ABI.

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the
      Passeo-18 Lux DCB for the treatment of stenotic, restenotic or occlusive lesions of the
      femoropopliteal arteries. Furthermore a non-inferiority hypothesis will be tested with the
      IN.PACT Admiral DCB as comparator.

      The patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should be geographically stable,
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study, and remain available for long term
      follow-up. The patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.

      Prior to the index procedure the following will be collected: an informed consent for data
      collection, demographics, medical history, medication record, physical examination, clinical
      category of acute limb ischemia (Rutherford category), the resting ankle-brachial index
      (ABI), blood sample test (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and if
      applicable pregnancy test) and a walking impairment questionnaire.

      During the procedure the guidewire will cross the entire study lesion after which the lesion
      will be assessed through angiography. A pre-dilatation with a standard non-drug-coated
      balloon will be performed followed by a dilatation of the lesion with either a Passeo-18 Lux
      (Biotronik) or an IN.PACT Admiral balloon (Medtronic). If dilatation was not successful (&gt;30%
      stenosis, perforation, occlusive or flow limiting dissection) prolonged inflation should be
      attempted after which bail-out stenting with a bare nitinol stent is allowed in case of
      inadequate results.

      The regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the results of
      the procedure. The patients will be invited for the following required follow-up visits at
      1,6 and 12 months. During these visit the following data will be collected: medication
      record, physical exam, target limb ABI and Rutherford classification, duplex ultrasound of
      target vessel, walking impairment questionnaire and possible adverse events.
