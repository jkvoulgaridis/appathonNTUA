  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol and/or drug abuse problems (ADAPs) have been consistently identified in the
      scientific literature as a risk factor of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW).
      Around 50% of IPVAW offenders referred to batterer intervention programs (BIPs) have ADAPs.
      ADAPs are also one of the main predictors of BIPs dropout. In Spain, the majority of BIPs do
      not fit the intervention to specific needs or characteristics of IPVAW offenders, such as
      those with ADAPs. The aim of this research is to assess the effectiveness of a new
      motivational strategy adapted to IPVAW offenders with ADAPs, aiming to increase treatment
      adherence and to improve BIPs outcomes. The motivational strategy will include an
      individualized motivational plan (IMP) developed for each participant with ADAPs (IMP-ADAPs).
      In these IMPs one of the main aims will be to reduce alcohol and/or drug consumption. The
      current study will use a randomized control trial. Participants with ADAPs will be allocated
      to one of two treatment conditions: experimental condition: Standard batterer intervention
      program (SBIP) plus individualized motivational plan focused in ADAPs (SBIP+ ADAPs-IMP), and
      control condition: Standard batterer intervention program plus individualized motivational
      plan (SBIP+IMP). Primary/final outcomes will be recidivism and ADAPs reduction.
      Secondary/proximal outcomes will include treatment adherence related variables, violence
      related attitudes and attributions, self-control and psychological adjustment. Outcome
      variables will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at six months
      after the intervention will be finished.

    <description>Standard batterer intervention program plus Individualized Motivational Plans adapted to alcohol and/or drug abuse problems. The SBIP consist of 70 hr of a cognitive-behavioral intervention including discussion topics such as sexism, sex roles, and gender equality. The intervention phase consisted of six modules in which different intervention techniques were applied (i.e., group dynamics, roleplaying, videos, training in cognitive restructuring, emotion management skills). The IMP included a set of motivational strategies to increase treatment compliance and motivation for change and had four main strategies: (a) five individual motivational interviews, to identify IPV related personal goals and follow up their achievement (in this case, one of the goals has to be related to ADAPs); (b) three group sessions where participants share their goals; (c) therapists follow-up and reinforcement of participants' goals; and (d) use of retention techniques.</description>
