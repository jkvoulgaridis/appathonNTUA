  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of traction decompression and neck muscle
      stretching on the magnitude of Flexor Carpi Radialis H-Reflex(HR), Neck Disability Index
      (NDI), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores in patients with cervical radiculopathy.

    <textblock>
      Cervical traction has long been used to relieve compression of nerve roots caused by
      intervertebral discs. Yet, there is lack of knowledge that compares the effect of traction
      decompression with neck muscles stretching in patients with cervical radiculopathy

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomly assigned into two groups; A and B. Patients within Group (A) will receive stretching protocols to the cervical musculature at the side of symptoms. Group (B) will be treated with traction from 15-degree flexion, 30-degree lateral bending, and 15-degree rotation toward the painful side.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>The Visual Analogue Scale Pain Scores(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline after 6-week of treament</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-cm VAS was used for assessing pain intensity. It is a line whose ends are labeled as the extremes of pain; no pain and very extreme pain. The line is marked at intervals 1 cm each without any label. Patients will be simply asked to indicate which point along the line that best represents the intensity of perceived pain. The distance from the &quot;no pain&quot; end to the mark made by the patient will be measured as the patient's pain intensity score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline after 6-week of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI will be measured on a 6-point scale from 0 (no disability) to 5 (full disability). The numeric response for each item will be summed for a score varying from 0 to 50. The NDI consists of 10 sections, each section the total possible score is 5, if the first statement is marked; the section score = 0, if the last statement is marked it = 5. The patients will choose the best choice that reflect his current state. If all ten sections are completed the score is calculated by dividing the obtained score on the total number of scores e.g. if the score recorded by the patients was (40) so the NDI=(40/50)x100=80%</description>
