    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, dose escalation study and will assess the safety and tolerability
      of ARV 110 in men with mCRPC who have progressed on at least 2 prior approved systemic
      therapies for their castrate resistant disease (one of which must be enzalutamide or
      abiraterone).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be male and at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Patients must present with histological, pathological, or cytological confirmed
             diagnosis of advanced or metastatic castration resistant adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          -  Patients must have progressed on at least 2 prior approved systemic therapies for CRPC
             (at least one must be abiraterone or enzalutamide).

          -  Patients with progressive mCRPC

          -  Patients must have ongoing ADT with a gonadotropin releasing hormone analog or
             inhibitor, or orchiectomy (surgical or medical castration).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids (above physiologic
             replacement doses)

          -  Major surgery (as defined by the Investigator) within 4 weeks of first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug or prior irradiation to
             &gt;25% of the bone marrow. Palliative radiation for the alleviation of pain due to bone
             metastasis will be allowed during the study

          -  Systemic anti cancer therapy within 2 weeks of first dose of study drug (6 weeks for
             bicalutamide, mitomycin C, or nitrosoureas and 4 weeks for abiraterone). Patients are
             ineligible if they received any other type of anti cancer agent (except agents to
             maintain castrate status) within 2 weeks before first dose of study drug.
