  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus DNAemia occurs frequently in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (allo-HSCT) recipients.Both high-level and persistent virus DNAemia are known risk factors
      for CMV end-organ disease and perhaps non-relapse mortality. CMV DNAemia is usually
      documented after engraftment, but it may occur before. The virological features and clinical
      consequences of these latter early-onset episodes remain largely unexplored. The U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved letermovir for prophylaxis of CMV
      infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive allo-HSCT recipients (PREVYMIS™, Merck &amp; Co.,
      New Jersey, USA). In accordance with the design of the phase III, double-blind trial the drug
      may be administered as early as the day of transplant and no later than 28 days
      post-transplant. Nevertheless, the timing of drug inception should be contingent on the
      clinical impact of very early episodes of CMV DNAemia. In a recent work from our group
      (single-center study) we found that a total 38 out of the 197 patients in our series
      developed CMV DNAemia before engraftment (cumulative incidence, 19%; 95% CI, 10-30.3%). Nine
      episodes of CMV DNAemia were detected prior to the time of donor progenitor cell infusion. A
      greater number of post-engraftment episodes required preemptive antiviral therapy compared
      with pre-engraftment episodes (62.5% vs 44.7%; P=0.05). The cellular content of the donor
      progenitor cell infusion and transplant characteristics of patients did not differ between
      patients with pre- or post-engraftment CMV DNAemia. The cumulative incidence of overall
      mortality by days 100 and 365, aGvHD by day 100 and relapse by day 365 were not significantly
      different between patients with pre-engraftment or post-engraftment CMV DNAemia. Our study
      was limited by the retrospective and single-center design and the scarce number of
      pre-engraftment CMV DNAemia episodes included; therefore, the results may not be extrapolated
      to other transplantation centers or patient cohorts. Further retrospective and prospective
      studies are thus required to validate the data presented herein.
