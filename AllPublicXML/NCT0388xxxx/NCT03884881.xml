  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to conduct the participants level, 1:1 randomized trial at the Central ICU
      and respiratory ICU of Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, China, from January 1, 2018 to December
      31, 2019. Participants with initial diagnosis of severe pneumonia will be first treated with
      empiric therapy, after 48-72 hours, the participants's condition will be evaluated, and
      participants who will have been initially cured and died should be excluded.The participants
      who will have failed the initial treatment will be then randomly divided into two groups: the
      NGS group and the conventional treatment group. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be taken by
      bedside bronchoscopy when the participants underwent nasal high-flow oxygen therapy,
      non-invasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation,or venous blood will be taken for
      examination. Participants in the NGS group will be tested for both NGS and conventional
      pathogens, however, the routine group will be only routinely tested. According to the
      pathogen results, participants with non-severe pneumonia will be excluded, and medication
      should be adjusted under the joint guidance of infectious and respiratory specialists. Then
      investigators will compare the first outcome: 28-day mortality, and secondary outcome: ICU
      hospitalization time, mechanical ventilation time, Hospitalization costs, antibiotic use
      costs, SOFA scores, CURB-65 scores, APACHE scores, and other clinical indicators.
