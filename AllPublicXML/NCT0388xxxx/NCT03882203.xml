  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with refractory acute leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only
      curative therapy. Only 20% of patients may achieve long-term survival mostly due to relapse
      or nor-relapse mortality (NRM). In previous study, we demonstrated that intensive leukemia
      debulking chemotherapy FLAG-IDA sequential with Flu-BU conditioning is feasible with ~40%
      long-term survival. In the study, we further modified the chemotherapy with cladribine
      replacing fludarabine aiming a more potent anti-leukemia effect. Meanwhile, we reduce the
      dose of busulfan for patients with poor performance status and age over 45 aim to reduce the
      NRM. All patients will also receive post-transplantation maintenance therapy with low-dose
      decitabine or combined with Interferon in case of positive minimal residual disease (MRD).

      For patients with refractory acute leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only
      curative therapy. Only 20% of patients may achieve long-term survival mostly due to relapse
      or nor-relapse mortality (NRM). In previous study, we demonstrated that intensive leukemia
      debulking chemotherapy FLAG-IDA sequential with Flu-BU conditioning is feasible with ~40%
      long-term survival. The most important cause of treatment failures were relapse and
      non-relpase mortality. The further analysis demonstrated that patients with higher bone
      marrow blast before allo-HSCT was associated with treatment failure and patients with poor
      perforce status or age over 45 had increased rate of NRM. To further optimization the
      protocol, we modified the chemotherapy with cladribine replacing fludarabine aiming a more
      potent anti-leukemia effect. All patients will also receive post-transplantation maintenance
      therapy with low-dose decitabine or combined with Interferon in case of positive minimal
      residual disease (MRD) to prevent the further reduce the relapse incidence. Meanwhile, we
      also reduce the dose of busulfan for patients with poor performance status and age over 45
      aim to reduce the NRM. The anticipate LFS at 2 years is 50% compared to historical control
      and most reference at 30%, we plan to recruit 50 patients.
