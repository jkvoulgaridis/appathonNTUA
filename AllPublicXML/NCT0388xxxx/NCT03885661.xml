  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 pilot/feasibility mechanistic experiment to help clarify the
      mechanism of action of an EPA-rich fish oil preparation, icosapent ethyl, on lipid changes in
      statin-treated patients with residual triglyceridemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled pilot/feasibility experiment in a small number
      of statin-treated patients with residual triglyceridemia assigned to chronic daily exposure
      to icosapent ethyl 4 g daily vs usual care to get preliminary data to ultimately design a
      definitive hypothesis-testing experiment to clarify the mechanism of action whereby icosapent
      ethyl alters lipoprotein kinetics. The formal statistical aim is to develop statistical
      parameters such as central tendency, dispersion, and distributional shape to design a robust
      hypothesis-testing study. The primary outcome is based around stable-isotope lipoprotein
      kinetics, specifically apolipoprotein B kinetics.

                  gestational or drug-induced diabetes is acceptable, but history Type I or Type II
                  diabetes are exclusionary.

                  2. Use of medications indicated for the treatment of diabetes within 6 weeks of
                  the first experimental visit (see Prohibited Treatments) 3. History of a

                  ischemic attack, carotid revascularization, endovascular procedure or surgical
                  intervention within 6 months of baseline.

                  4. Known inefficacy to TG-lowering doses of fish oils (e.g. &gt;= 4 caps daily of
                  prescription fish oil or &gt;= 6 caps daily of supplemental fish oil).

                  5. TG &gt; 500 mg/dL as the average of valid, statin-treated values 6. BMI &gt; 40

                  dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III).

                  10. Severe allergy to fish, unless non-allergic response to fish oil is
                  established (n.b. most fish allergies are to the proteins as opposed to the fats,
                  so with highly-purified oils the risk of a true allergy is remote).

                  11. Known intolerance or contraindication to Vascepa, and if the former is
                  unknown, known intolerance or contraindication to fish oil 12. Any surgical or

                  or excretion of EPA or DHA.

                  13. History of extreme triglyceridemia (TG &gt; 1000 mg/dL) or pancreatitis from
                  triglyceridemia, regardless of whether it is currently controlled.

                  14. Medical condition that would prohibit fasting (e.g. diagnosis of insulinoma
                  or postabsorptive hypoglycemia).

                  15. Significant disinclination to dairy products (e.g. lactose intolerance,
                  inviolable dietary restrictions). All participants will receive a test dose of
                  the fat challenge during the screening visit, which consists of heavy cream and
                  lactase enzyme. Many people with lactose intolerance successfully avert symptoms
                  by correcting their lactase deficiency with lactase supplements. We will allow
                  these people to participate because we will allow them to take their preferred
                  brand and dose of lactase supplement beyond the lactase in the fat challenge if
                  needed. However, we still require that they are able to tolerate the test dose
                  given during screening.

                  substances are per Federal law or regulations in effect at the time of first
                  approval of this protocol.

                  disease).

                  28. History of bariatric surgery or other major gastrointestinal surgery
                  associated with major disruptions to drug absorption.

                  29. Anticipation of major surgery during the screening or treatment periods of
                  the study 30. Participants with the following conditions will opt out of heparin
                  exposure for lipase determinations, but will be allowed to participate in the
                  overall protocol.

                  blood within 8 weeks prior to the first experimental visit. Participation in the
                  screening phase is permitted.

                  40. History of inherent unremediable risks for anemia, such as
                  hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic disorders, and bleeding disorders, regardless of
                  whether their hemoglobin is currently normal.

                  41. History of a large-volume gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, such as a bleed
                  that required ER evaluation or admission, required acute endoscopic or surgical
                  management, was managed by blood transfusion, or caused anemia.

                  42. History of NSAID-mediated peptic ulcer disease is excluded, irrespective of
                  current medical treatment. A history of peptic ulcer disease from H. pylori does
                  not exclude participation provided H. pylori was successfully eradicated. Other
                  causes of peptic ulcer disease may be allowable, especially if definitively
                  treated or the risk of recurrence is otherwise low.

                  43. Chronic, untreated conditions that predispose to anemia, such as significant

                  intermittent bleeding.

                  44. Participation in an investigational drug study concurrently; participants who
                  previously completed an investigational drug study cannot participate in the
                  first experimental visit until at least 6 weeks after the final dose given during
                  the previous investigational drug study. For the purposes of this exclusion, an
                  investigational drug is a new chemical entity or a pharmaceutical investigated to
                  support an initial new drug application. Furthermore, herbal or other supplements
                  already deemed &quot;generally regarded as safe&quot; or legally sold in the U.S. would not
                  be considered an investigational drug.

                  45. Use of medications indicated for the treatment of diabetes within 6 weeks of
                  the first experimental visit 46. Daily therapy with non-statin lipid-altering
                  medications within 6 weeks of the first experimental visit is exclusionary,
                  including long-term therapy with the agents listed below. Subjects may wash off
                  these medications so long as the first experimental visit occurs at least 6 weeks
                  after chronic therapy ceases. Following a washout period, fasting lipids will be
                  repeated prior to the first experimental visit to assure that these are not
                  exclusionary as defined above.
