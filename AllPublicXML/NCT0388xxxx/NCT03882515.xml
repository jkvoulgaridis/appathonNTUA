    <textblock>
      Introduction: Neck Pain (NP) is considered a common idiopathic disorder in the general
      population. Oriented from incorrect executions during daily activities the DPO compromises
      the trapezius muscle that has a viscoelastic coating called fascia, which, in turn, is a soft
      tissue component, belonging to the connective tissue, that permeates the entire human body.
      During some activities that generate muscle overload, the fascia may undergo energy demands
      in which the local blood supply may be decreased, causing tissue hypoxia to result in pain.
      Decreased tissue blood supply could limit or prevent slippage of myofascial tissues. However,
      myofascial release can influence mechanoreceptors within the fascia, contributing to changes
      in local fluid dynamics, reducing excessive muscle tension, capillary constriction, and
      increasing local blood flow. One of the tools available for hemodynamic evaluation is the
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), which can quantify and capture variations in hemoglobin
      levels. Aim: To investigate whether myofascial release improves peripheral muscle
      oxygenation, pain intensity, and functional capacity of individuals with trapezius muscle
      pain. Methods: It is a clinical, parallel, randomized, double blind controlled trial with
      three groups that will be divided into: experimental, Sham and control. The instruments to be
      used in the research will be: Pressure Algometer, Neck Disability Index Questionnaire, Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS), NIRS and Electromyograph. The experimental group will receive a
      myofascial release protocol for 20 minutes once weekly for six weeks. The Sham group will
      receive a continuous surface slip technique for the same time and frequency and the control
      will perform the evaluation and re-evaluation. Results: The present research is expected to
      increase peripheral muscle oxygenation, decrease pain threshold and improve quality of life
      after 6 weeks of intervention.

      This study will be a double-blind randomized controlled trial (evaluator and patient),
      parallel in three groups (experimental group, Sham and control). Participants will initially
      be evaluated by a trained investigator who will be blinded and assigned randomly (random
      numbers generated on the computer) block for the experimental, sham, and control groups by
      means of an opaque envelope draw. In group division, participants with pain may not be
      contemplated to participate in the myofascial release protocol intervention group. However,
      the research will count on a group that will be contemplated with the technique of continuous
      superficial sliding (massage), which in turn, the literature points out benefits and
      well-being in its application. Finally, a group of individuals without pain will be evaluated
      and reevaluated and evaluated as a means of preventing pain and reducing TM peripheral muscle
      oxygenation. When making the invitation to participate in the survey, individuals will not be
      required to participate if they do not agree, and therefore will not be penalized.
      Participants who agree to participate in the survey will sign a Free and Informed Consent
      Form (Annex I) and will be informed of the possibility of withdrawing from the survey at any
      stage, without penalty. The collection of the evaluation and intervention will be carried out
      in a salon Clinic School of Physiotherapy in the Center of Health and Sports Sciences (CEFID)
      of the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC) in the city of Florianópolis - SC. All
      personal identification data of the participants will be preserved according to resolution of
      the national health council, taking into account the possibility of scientific dissemination
      of the results obtained. The risks of these procedures will be medium, since the participant
      may present muscle pain after the intervention protocol. To minimize these risks will be
      available, if necessary, attendance at the Clinic School of Physiotherapy. Volunteers of both
      sexes, aged from 18 years neck pain more specifically, in TM during daily or work activities.
      The sample will be selected in a non-probabilistic way for convenience, and the individuals
      will be divided into three groups: experimental, Sham and control. The control group will be
      formed by healthy individuals and will be paired with the experimental group according to age
      and gender taking into account that they are two relevant variables when addressing the
      fascia.

    <measure>Change from baseline deoxyhaemoglobin, oxyhaemoglobin and tissue oxygenation index at six weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention and 6 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>For the measurement of peripheral muscle oxygenation, near-infrared spectroscopy (PortaMon®, Artinis, The Netherlands) will be used. Near infrared spectroscopy depends primarily on two characteristics of human tissue. First, the relative transparency of the tissue to light and, secondly, the light absorption characteristics dependent on the oxygenation of hemoglobin. By using several different wavelengths, relative changes in hemoglobin concentration can be displayed continuously. It is a non-invasive, accessible, continuous measure, and can be performed in the laboratory, or even in the field and without the need of special infrastructure, since it has the portable format (ARTINIS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, 2017).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline normalized EMG at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention, 3 weeks post intervention and 6 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The TeleMyo DTS Desk Receiver® (Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, USA) electromyograph will be used for acquisition and processing of the electromyographic signals of the trapezius muscle with 16-bit resolution digital analogue converter and RRMC&gt; 100 dB. The signals will be picked up at a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz, and stored by MR 3.2 software (Noraxon U.S.A. Inc., Scottsdale, USA). The electromyograph uses Direct Transmission System (DTS) technology, for surface EMG and other biomechanical sensors, which uses wireless technology for real-time data transmission. It has been used both to determine the time of onset of the muscular electrical activity as well as the intensity to which the muscle is active, that is, the amplitude of the activity (PERRY and BURNFIED, 1992).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline pain thresholds at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention, 3 weeks post intervention and 6 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate pressure pain thresholds, a digital algometer (JTech Commander Algometer®, USA) will be used to allow the actual measurement of pain thresholds and tolerances. The Pressure Algometer features an easy-to-handle design (a visor and a tip) and fine resolution for clinical identification of changes in pain sensitivity. It provides an objective and efficient assessment for treatment planning and evolution monitoring (JTECH MEDICAL INDUSTRIES, 2017).</description>

    <measure>Change from baselien Neck Desability Index at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention, 3 weeks post intervention and 6 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Desability Index is a ten-item questionnaire designed to assess functional disability and pain in the region of the cervical spine. The calculation of the scores is obtained by adding the points and then converting the result into value, considering only the items answered by the individual. For each section, the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked with the section score = 0, if the last statement is checked, 5. If all sections are marked the total score is calculated as follows: Example : 16 (total score) 50 (total score possible) x 100 = 32%. If a section is lost or not calculated: 16 (total score) 45 (total possible score) x 100 = 35.5%. Minimum Change Detectable (90% confidence): 5 points or 10% points.</description>
