  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a multi-center , open-label, singer arm study to explore the safety and efficacy of
      Z650 in advanced ESCC patients who had experienced systematic chemotherapy. Approximately 45
      subjects will be enrolled, each subjects will receive oral Z650, at dose of 350 mg/d,
      repeatedly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, each cycle is defined
      as 28 days.
