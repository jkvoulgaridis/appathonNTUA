  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of people with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, especially in the early
      stages of the disease, regularly consume cannabis. Cannabis use is associated with poor
      prognostic outcome; however, there are no effective interventions targeted at reducing
      cannabis use or its deleterious effects in this population. The present trial is designed to
      test whether cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid whose effects are in many ways antagonistic to
      those of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can reduce psychiatric symptoms, cognitive deficits,
      and cannabis use in people with recent-onset psychosis who regularly consume cannabis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, evaluating the effects of a
      12-week treatment course with CBD on psychiatric symptoms, cognition, and cannabis
      consumption in regular cannabis users with recent-onset psychosis. The study will be
      conducted at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (University of Maryland School of
      Medicine) and associated Early Intervention Programs in Baltimore, at the Sheppard Pratt
      Health System in Baltimore, and at the Psychosis Clinic of the University of California Los
      Angeles.

      The daily dose of CBD is 600 mg (p.o.), administered as adjunct medication. Any
      non-exclusionary antipsychotic, antidepressant, anxiolytic, or other medication prescribed
      prior to the trial will be continued. Participants may, but do not have to be taking
      conventional antipsychotic medication.

      The study will include 84 regular cannabis users with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder who
      experienced their first psychotic episode within the last 5 years (90). Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to either the CBD or the placebo group.

      Outcome measures include psychiatric symptoms, cognition, global functioning, and drug use,
      and will be assessed at baseline, and every 3 or 6 weeks thereafter (depending on the
      measure), until the end of treatment at 12 weeks. Outcome will be assessed again at a 3-month
      follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS consists of 18 items assessing a broad range of psychiatric symptoms, including positive, negative, and affective symptoms. Each item is scored 1-7. Total scores are the sum of all items and range from 18 to 126, with larger values reflecting worse symptoms. The BPRS total score has been used widely in clinical studies of psychosis and has demonstrated reliability in assessing psychopathology across diverse psychosis populations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MCCB is an FDA-approved assessment tool for trials of cognition-enhancing treatments in people with schizophrenia. The MCCB is comprised of the following domains: 1) Speed of Processing; 2) Attention/Vigilance; 3) Working Memory; 4) Verbal Learning; 5) Visual Learning; 6) Reasoning and Problem Solving; and 7) Social Cognition. The composite score is standardized to a T-scale (mean=50, standard deviation=10) based on healthy control normative data. Higher scores reflect better performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Serum concentrations of THCCOOH</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in BPRS positive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The average of four BPRS key positive symptom items (conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, unusual thought content, and hallucinatory behavior) will be analyzed as an index of antipsychotic effects of CBD. Possible values range from 1 to 7, with larger values reflecting more severe positive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
