      Phase II study investigating the safety, tolerability and effect on disease reccurence of
      Foxy-5 as neo-adjuvant therapy in resected colon cancer patients treated with FOLFOX
      chemotherapy regimen. It is a two-arm study and patients will be randomised to receive either
      standard therapy (surgery + FOLFOX 6 months regimen) or standard therapy + neo-adjuvant
      administration of Foxy-5 prior to- and following surgery (maximum of 39 administrations)
      until initiation of FOLFOX therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foxy-5 is a synthetic hexapeptide with a formylated N-terminus, derived from the protein
      sequence of the Wnt-5a protein. Low/no expression levels of Wnt-5 protein in primary tumour
      cells have been correlated to high risk of recurrent metastatic disease and shortened
      survival in several different types of cancer patients, including colon cancer.

      Current standard therapy involves surgical removal of the tumour followed by 6 months
      treatment with chemotherapy (FOLFOX). Foxy-5 is expected to decrease migration of cancer
      cells, in subjects with low/absent levels of Wnt-5a protein in their primary tumour and hence
      result in lower recurrence and a better overall survival. The trial intends to establish the
      safety and tolerability of Foxy-5 and to evaluate early signs of anti-metastatic activity in
      subjects with resectable colon cancer.
