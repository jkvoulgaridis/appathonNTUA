  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to determine the mechanisms of fatigue in older (&gt;70 yrs) men and women
      from dynamic contractions with a secondary goal of testing a novel and potentially
      translational exercise-training program designed to protect muscle performance during dynamic
      activities. The following specific aims and hypotheses will be tested:

      Aim 1. Determine the extent to which fiber function, the cross-bridge mechanism of muscle
      fatigue, and the economy of contraction differ in fast (type IIa and IIx) and slow (type I)
      fibers in young and older (&gt;70 yrs) men and women. Hypothesis 1. Slow type I and fast type II
      fiber peak isometric force (kN/M2), maximal shortening velocity (V0), and Ca2+ sensitivity
      are well maintained, but peak power and the transition from the low- to high-force state
      (ktr) are compromised in older adults especially women. Hypothesis 2. The economy of slow and
      fast fiber contraction declines in the older adults as reflected by a higher myofibrillar
      ATPase rate per tension developed. Hypothesis 3. Under fatigue conditions (low pH and high
      inorganic phosphate), slow and fast fibers from older adults show greater inhibition of
      maximal shortening velocity (V0) and peak power and decline in economy than fibers from young
      adults. Hypothesis 4. Aging reduces the content and phosphorylation of myosin binding protein
      C and myosin light chain 2 and the fraction of myosin heads in the ordered array.

      Aim 2. Determine the susceptibility of older (&gt;70 yrs) men and women to fatigue induced by
      dynamic contractions. Young and old men and women will perform dynamic fatiguing contractions
      with the knee extensor muscles. Peripheral and central fatigue will be quantified using
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Hypothesis 1. With dynamic contractions older men
      and women (&gt;70 yrs) fatigue more rapidly than young adults. Hypothesis 2. The increased
      fatigability in older adults is not caused by greater central fatigue than in the young.

      Aim 3. Determine the effectiveness of dynamic exercise training using velocities of
      contractions known to generate peak power. Older adults will perform 12 weeks training to
      determine the efficacy of this novel training. Before and after training the following will
      be assessed: fatigue during dynamic contractions, central and peripheral fatigue with TMS,
      whole muscle metabolism with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and single fiber function and fatigue of fibers from muscle biopsies.
      Hypothesis 1. Training at velocities known to elicit peak power (~ 30% of V0) will improve
      whole muscle and body performance, muscle fiber size and function in older adults to a
      greater extent than traditional high resistant contractions.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will participate in 8 weeks of leg extension exercise training (3 days per week) to determine the efficacy of slow velocity but low load resistance training exercise on one leg compared with traditional fast velocity and high load resistance training on the other leg. Before and after training the following will be assessed: fatigue of the lower limb muscles during 4-minutes dynamic contractions, neural and muscular fatigue using electrical stimulation of the muscles and TMS, whole muscle metabolism with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess muscle volume and single fiber function and fatigue from fiber taken from muscle biopsies.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in Central (Supraspinal) and Peripheral Fatigue after 8 weeks resistance training</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and 3-days after completion of resistance training intervention of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Central and peripheral fatigue are quantified using Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical stimulation during MVCs and submaximal contractions of the knee extensor muscles. Central fatigue is quantified as the reduction in voluntary activation. Supraspinal fatigue is a component of central fatigue and is quantified as the reduction of voluntary activation calculated from forces evoked via stimulation at the motor cortex. Peripheral fatigue of whole muscle is quantified as the amplitude of the superimposed twitch and its rate of change in relaxation. This can be reliably achieved with TMS.</description>
