      In the trial the effectiveness of pre-briefing physicians with the current guideline on
      Status epilepticus (SE) treatment or a consolidated &quot;one page&quot; guideline regarding quality
      enhancement of the physician's clinical performances is investigated.

      Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological emergency defined as a state of
      continuous seizure or multiple seizures without full recovery of sensory, motor and/or
      cognitive function for at least 30 minutes. To achieve high quality management of SE, the
      American Epilepsy Society published an evidence-based guideline for the treatment of SE,
      which serves as reference for most national guidelines, but analyses regarding
      practicability, strict adherence, correct translation into clinical practice, and
      identification of recommended treatment steps at risk of being modified or missed are
      lacking. Simulator-based studies offer a platform for the design of standardized clinical
      scenarios that enable detailed investigations regarding the effect of the implementation and
      practicability of treatment guidelines.

      This randomized controlled intervention study performed at the simulation center of the
      medical intensive care units (ICUs) at the University Hospital Basel is to investigate the
      effectiveness of pre-briefing physicians with both the current guideline on Status
      epilepticus (SE) treatment or a consolidated &quot;one page&quot; guideline regarding quality
      enhancement of the physicians' clinical performances..

      Physicians from different medical specialties and with different duration of clinical
      experience will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following
      three pre-briefing groups: (1) no pre-briefing prior to the simulation training; (2)
      pre-briefing with the current SE treatment guidelines; (3) pre-briefing with the consolidated
      &quot;one page&quot; SE treatment guideline.

    <description>GCS is a neurological scale recording the state of a person's consciousness ; The scale is composed of three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS (graded 1 in each element) is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person).</description>
