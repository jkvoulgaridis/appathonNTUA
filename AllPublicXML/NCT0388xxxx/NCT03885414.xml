  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality exposure therapy (VRET) is an efficacious treatment for anxiety disorders but
      has yet to be implemented in regular care settings. This is arguably due to the limitations
      of the past generation of VR technology, which was expensive, inaccessible, cumbersome and
      hard to use. With the advent of consumer VR technology, VRET is now ready for implementation
      in regular care. This multiple-baseline trial will examine the effectiveness of VRET for
      public speaking anxiety (PSA) when delivered under real-world conditions at an ordinary,
      non-specialized mental health clinic, by clinical psychologist with only brief VRET training.
      Participants will either be self-referred specifically for this treatment, or come through
      ordinary clinical channels. Self-rated PSA will serve as primary outcome measure and will be
      measured three times prior to treatment (at screening and twice after a diagnostic screening
      telephone interview) , four times after onset, at the end of the treatment period, and three
      months after treatment.
