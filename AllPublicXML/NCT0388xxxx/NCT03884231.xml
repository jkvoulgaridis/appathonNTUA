    <textblock>
      This is a study of subjects with the St. Jude Medical Infinity deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      system who undergo an MRI imaging procedure. Enrollment may occur before DBS implant, or when
      an MRI scan is planned in a subject with an existing implant. There will be a follow-up visit
      one month after the MRI procedure to document any adverse events and verify device
      functionality.

      This study will be conducted as an international, multicenter, observational, prospective,
      single-arm, post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF). The study will evaluate the safety of the
      Infinity DBS system with MR Conditional labeling when an MRI procedure is performed according
      to the approved guidance.

      The study will enroll subjects at up to 25 centers in geographies where Infinity DBS systems
      with MR Conditional labeling is approved, including the European Union and the United States.
      Subjects who have a leads-only configuration or a full system configuration will participate
      in the study. Subjects may be enrolled when an MRI procedure is used to confirm DBS electrode
      placement or prescribed for diagnostic purposes.

      Each subject will be limited to one MRI procedure during the course of the study. Data
      collected include MRI parameters and any adverse events that occur during or after the
      procedure. There will be an office visit to document any adverse events and verify device
      functionality for all subjects one month (30 days Â± 14 days) after the MRI procedure is
      performed.

        This clinical investigation will enroll subjects with levodopa-responsive Parkinson's
        disease, dystonia, or disabling tremor implanted with the Infinity DBS system with MR
        Conditional labeling. Subjects may be enrolled prior to implant, or may already have the
        DBS system implanted.
