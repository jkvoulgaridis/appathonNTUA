      The main objective of Trial Parts 1 and 2 is to investigate the relative bioavailability of
      two tablet strengths (low dose and high dose) of the intended Commercial Formulation of BI
      730357 (Test, T) versus with the corresponding tablet strengths of Trial Formulation 1
      (Reference, R).

      The main objective of Trial Part 3 is to investigate the relative bioavailability of two iCF
      side batches of BI 730357 with coarse milled Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)(Test
      coarse milled, Tc) and unmilled API (Test unmilled, Tu), respectively, versus the final iCF
      batch of BI 730357 with regularly milled API (Reference, R).
