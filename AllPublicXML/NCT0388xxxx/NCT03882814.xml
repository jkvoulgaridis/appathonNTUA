  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics had been used from time to time for treating labor pain. However, their use
      have been concerning. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of pethidine on
      duration of active phase of labor, labor pain and maternal-neonatal outcomes.In the present
      case-control study, the study group received a 50 mg pethidine intramuscular injection upon
      the start of active phase of labor, and the control group consisted of patients who receive
      placebo injeciton. In both groups, vital signs were measured before, and at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45
      and 60 minutes after the injection. Pain intensity was evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) prior to, and 1 hour and 2 hours after injection. Data regarding labor phase durations,
      maternal side effects, newborn APGAR scores and fetal respiratory problems were recorded.

    <description>Labor pain VAS scores were determined in both groups just prior to pethidine injection (0.hour), and 1st and 2nd hours after injection.
The VAS scale represents pain with a score of 1 to 10. patients scored points on this scale and these scores were recorded.
1 point shows the least pain, 10 points the most-irresistible pain.</description>

    <description>The patients who accepted pethidine use were included into the study group; A partogram was recorded throughout the labor. Digital cervical examination was performed and recorded at 2 hour intervals regularly. Pethidine 50 mg intramuscular (IM) injection was performed when cervical dilatation was at or greater than 4 cm and the cardiotocogram uterine contraction recordings of 200 Montevideo units was reached. Blinded clinicians recorded the durations of first, second and third stages of labor, maternal vital signs at 0-5-15-30-45-60 minutes following pethidine injection, maternal complications and neonatal APGAR scores</description>
