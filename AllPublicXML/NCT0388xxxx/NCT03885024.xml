  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to, through several aims, test the effectiveness of peer-driven
      intervention and inform methods to optimize engagement in research in people who use drugs
      (PWUD) in rural America.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on the National Rural Opioids Initiative (NROI), a multi-state consortium
      studying access to care, overdose, and infectious consequences of opioid use disorder (OUD)
      in Rural America. It includes counties in rural Oregon and Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio with
      high rates of drug overdose.

      Aim 1: Conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-driven study
      retention intervention for retaining PWUD in Kentucky, Ohio, and Oregon Rural Opioid
      Initiative sites.

      Aim 2: Elicit preferences of PWUD in the Kentucky, Ohio, and Oregon Rural Opioid Initiative
      sites Aim 2a: Administer baseline survey of discrete choice experiment preferences for
      participating in clinical trials of potential medical innovations (e.g. new treatments for
      OUD, HIV, and HCV vaccination). Aim 2a will be accomplished as part of the NROI studies. The
      data will then be merged for PROUD-RÂ² analyses.

      Aim 2b: Compare participant survey preferences regarding willingness to participate in
      clinical trials at baseline, 6, and 12 months.

      Aim 3: Explore participant perceptions of clinical research participation and retention among
      PWUD in rural America.

    <description>Participants the peer-driven retention arm will receive video-based and in-person training from Retention Specialists on how to encourage study retention. Participants will watch a 7 minute video that standardizes retention messages. A brief face-to-face conversation with the Retention Specialist follows the video viewing to answer questions and reinforce video messages. At the end of the training, participants receive information about their recruit(s) who consented to release their information to their recruiters. Peers remind their enrolled &quot;study buddy&quot; to attend their scheduled follow up assessments. Participants meet with a study Retention Specialist by phone or in person, at 3 and 9 months after enrollment to answer questions about peer retention strategies and remind participants of their peers' contact information and follow-up schedules.</description>

    <description>Control arm: At NROI enrollment, all participants provide detailed information to assist with retention and/or contact for future research, and contact information for up to three people who should know how to reach the participant if contact information changes. Participants randomized to receive the standard retention strategy are contacted at the mid-point of each follow-up interval (i.e., at 3-month post enrollment and 9-months post-enrollment) to update locator information and remind them about their follow-up appointment date. Study associates contact the participant using their contact information and, if not successful, will try to reach one of their contacts in the locator form.</description>
