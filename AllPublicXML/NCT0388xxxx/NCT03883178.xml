  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pudendal nerve and cluneal nerve entrapment can cause a neuropathic pain syndrome in one,
      many or all of the sensitive areas innervated by this nerve. In literature, several
      techniques for the liberation of the pudendal nerve have been described. Here, transvaginal,
      transperineal and abdominal laparoscopic approaches have been proposed, but none of the
      latter were able to visualize the entire course of the nerve or allowed to explore the main,
      currently identified sites of entrapment. Although there have been reports and series of case
      reports on different surgical approaches, until now, the transgluteal approach is the only
      one which is validated by a prospective randomized study comparing the medical treatment to
      these surgical approach.

      The investigators already performed a study to describe for the first time a new endoscopic
      minimal invasive technique using a transgluteal approach which permits to visualize all the
      nerve structures of the gluteal region. They performed an anatomic description of the region
      reachable with this minimally invasive approach, and described the anatomic landmarks for the
      visualization of the pudendal and cluneal nerve and their neurolysis.

      In this study, the investigators would like to put in clinical practice this minimal invasive
      approach for pudendal and cluneal neurolysis. They will perform this endoscopic approach, on
      patients suffering from pudendalgie or/and clunealgie, who are programmed for a surgical
      intervention by transgluteal approach.

      The investigators would like to test the feasibility of the transgluteal trocar positioning
      and if necessary, optimize this first important step. Secondly, they will put in practice the
      step-by-step surgical approach that they have worked out during their cadaver study. Finally,
      they will perform the entire neurolysis and nerve transposition under endoscopic control.

    <description>SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. It covers several health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions.The recommended scoring system for the SF-36 is a weighted Likert system for each item. The items in the subscales are summed to obtain a summary score for each subscale or dimension. Each of the 8 summary scores is linearly transformed on a scale of 0 (negative to health) to 100 (positive for health).</description>
