  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the satiation measures that
      influence human eating behavior in regard to intake of large portion sizes at a meal. The
      investigators hypothesize that satiation measures will influence the magnitude of the portion
      size effect at a meal. Additionally, other individual characteristics will be examined for
      their influence on the portion size effect. The portion size effect will be measured by
      serving a test meal once a week for four weeks in which the portion size of the entree will
      be varied.
