      The aim of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of patients with large scars or Cutis
      laxa treated with injections of autologous stromal vascular fraction cells (SVF) and
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC).

    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from cutis laxa senilis and scars (atrophic, hypertrophic, developed due
      to surgery, trauma, diseases such as acne vulgaris, post-burn scars) will be treated with
      product containing - human autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells and human
      autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC)
