      This study evaluates the safety of the EVOS SMALL Plating system in patients who have a
      fracture of the tibia requiring surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, post-marketing, observational, case series study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EVOS SMALL Plating System in subjects with proximal
      or distal (pilon or ankle) tibial fractures. Subjects will be recruited in the hospital
      emergency room or surgical department, at the point of identification of the need for ORIF
      surgery, and the decision is made to use the EVOS SMALL Plating System. The choice of medical
      and surgical treatment will be made independently by the Investigator in the regular course
      of practice and will not be influenced by this study protocol.

      Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure at least 90 evaluable
      subjects, with a minimum of 45 evaluable subjects having either a) proximal or b) distal
      tibial fractures.

      Safety monitoring will include documentation device- and surgery-related AEs. Efficacy will
      be monitored by assessment of post-operative fracture resolution according to standard
      radiological practice (X-rays), clinical complications, reoperation rate, DRI, EQ-5D-5L, and
      pain VAS.

        Subjects 18 years and older having either proximal or distal tibial fractures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subject who is 18 years of age or older at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          2. Subject provides an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent. The
             subject must have the physical and mental capacity to provide informed consent for
             him/herself.

          3. Subject has experienced proximal tibial fracture (OTA Type 41 A-C) or distal tibial
             fracture (OTA 43 Type A-C) with or without fibular/malleolar involvement (OTA 44 A-C)
             and are scheduled for ORIF using the EVOS SMALL Plating System.

          4. Subject is willing and able to attend all study visits including 1 year post-operative
             follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the EVOS SMALL Plating
             System or its components (316L stainless steel).

          2. Subject has a physical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude adequate implant support or retard healing, such as blood supply impairment,
             insufficient bone quality or quantity, previous infection, obesity, severe bow or
             gross bony distortion of the tibia, as detailed in the IFU.

          3. Subject has, in the opinion of the Investigator, an emotional or neurologic condition
             that precludes cooperation and compliance with the rehabilitation regimen.

          4. Subject is currently in another investigational drug, biologic, or device study or has
             been treated with an investigational product within the last 30 days.

          5. Subject is known to be at risk for loss to follow-up, or failure to return for
             scheduled visits.
