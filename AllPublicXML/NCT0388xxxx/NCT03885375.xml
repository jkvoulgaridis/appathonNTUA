    <textblock>
      Cardiac involvements in autoimmune diseases (AD) is common but underestimated and an early
      detection remains a clinical challenge for lacking of efficient imaging methods. The
      objective of the study was to investigate LV myocardial abnormalities in AD patients by
      multimodal cardiac imaging, including speckle-tracking echocardiology (STE), cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging (CMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).
