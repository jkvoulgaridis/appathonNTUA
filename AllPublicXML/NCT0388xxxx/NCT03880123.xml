  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to establish a safe and tolerable dose combination (the
      &quot;maximum tolerated dose&quot;) of selinexor and ixazomib when used together for the treatment of
      patients with certain types of advanced sarcoma. The study will enroll patients with advanced
      dedifferentiated liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, alveolar soft part
      sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Future studies to further evaluate the safety and anti-cancer
      efficacy of this treatment for sarcoma will use the dose combination determined in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoma is a rare form of cancer which originates from the soft tissues and bones of the
      body. There are more than 50 different types of sarcoma. The primary treatment approach for
      most types of advanced sarcoma involves chemotherapy, but newer treatment approaches are
      needed because chemotherapy is not curative, sometimes does not work well, and often has
      significant side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment for certain types of sarcoma. The
      new treatment involves two oral targeted drugs used in combination: selinexor and ixazomib.
      Selinexor inhibits the transport of certain proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of
      the cell. Ixazomib is part of a class of drugs called proteasome inhibitors. Currently,
      neither of these drugs is approved for the treatment of sarcoma. The researchers believe this
      combination treatment may work effectively for certain types of sarcoma based on encouraging
      laboratory research results. The types of sarcoma in which the treatment will be tested are:
      dedifferentiated liposarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath
      tumor, and Ewing sarcoma. The purpose of this study is to define doses of selinexor and
      ixazomib that are safe and tolerable for patients.

          1. Signed written informed consent.

          2. Age ≥ 14 years

          3. Body surface area ≥ 1.2 m2

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          5. Histologically confirmed de-differentiated liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve
             sheath tumor, alveolar soft part sarcoma or Ewing sarcoma. Liposarcomas with areas of
             well-differentiated disease are eligible if there is a biopsy-proven component of
             dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Pathology is reviewed at Columbia University Medical
             Center.

          6. Disease which is locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. Disease which may be
             resected but with an associated level of morbidity deemed unacceptable by the treating
             clinician is considered eligible.

          7. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST criteria version 1.1.

          8. Progression on, or intolerance to, at least one prior systemic regimen for sarcoma
             (including systemic treatment used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings). For
             alveolar soft part sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, there is no upper limit
             on the number of prior therapies that may have been received. For Ewing sarcoma and
             malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, patients may have received no more than 3
             prior lines of therapy (excluding systemic treatment used in the adjuvant or
             neoadjuvant settings).

          9. Acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below:

             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL Platelet count ≥
             100,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times
             upper limit of normal Aspartate Transaminase (AST) /Alanine Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0
             times upper limit of normal

               -  Upper limit of normal is defined by the clinical laboratory performing the test.

               -  Creatinine clearance is obtained using the lean body mass formula (Modified
                  Cockcroft Gault)

               -  If transaminase elevation and/or bilirubin elevation is attributed to the
                  presence of liver metastases, a total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of
                  normal and an Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and Alanine Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5
                  times the upper limit of normal are permissible. Patients with an elevated
                  bilirubin level that is attributed to an inherited disorder, such as Gilbert's
                  disease, may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.

               -  Patients may not receive platelet transfusions within 3 weeks of initiating
                  protocol therapy.
