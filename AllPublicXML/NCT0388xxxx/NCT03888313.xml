    <description>A questionnaire with questions on the patient's experience of the information received and their experience of participating in the pretreatment group consultation will be used to collect descriptive data. Some of the questions have been developed through semi-structured interviews with patients with colon or rectal cancer other are standardized questionnaires used in other studies.
The questionnaire includes questions on which information resources the patients have used (such as social media, patient organizations).Their experience of the pretreatment group consultation will be assessed by &quot;Would you recommend someone in the same situation as you to attend the pretreatment group consultation?&quot;. Possible answering options are &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Don't know&quot;. The EuroQol's EQ-5D-5L for assessment of health related quality of will be included mainly as a tool for assurance of external validity, and not as an outcome measure. Both the indices and the VAS-scale may be used.</description>
