    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to compare the daily living activities with a performance-based
      protocol in lung cancer patients and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the abnormal proliferation of cells in the lung tissue and a mass in the lung.
      The primary symptoms of this health problem include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis
      and sputum. In addition to these symptoms, muscle strength, respiratory function and effort
      level are decreased.

      Inadequate daily living activities in cancer patients are expressed.But studies evaluating
      the activities of daily living in patients with lung cancer are inadequate and patients are
      evaluated only using scales. For the measurement of functional status in daily living
      activities, these scales provide important information about the detection of symptoms and
      the progression of the disease. However, it is very difficult to determine the limitation of
      perceived difficulty in daily living activities with these scales. In addition, since these
      scales are a method of measurement, the objectivity is open to discussion. It is thought that
      a performance-based protocol will facilitate the detection of limitations and provide more
      objective findings. We think that the Londrina protocol fully reflects the activities of
      daily living and thus will give us an objective measurement.

      This study will show us the problem and its cause in daily life activities in patients with
      lung cancer.

    <measure>Activities Of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Daily Living Activities will be evaluated using the Londrina Protocol.The protocol consists of 5 stations. Stations are including organizing books on the table, 18 meters walking by carrying 10% of body weight symmetrically, arranging books by putting them on shelves, hanging the laundry in the laundry basket and walking 18 meters. İndividual will do these activities at his own pace and the time will be recorded at the end.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) The questionnaire consists of 30 questions and provides information on quality of life and symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength will be evaluated by force measuring dynamometer device 3 times. M.Quadriceps Femoris, shoulder abduction, shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, elbow extension and hand grip strength of all cases will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnoea</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnoea will be evaluated using the Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale. The Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale has a score of 0-4. İn this scoring system 0 indicates that there is no dyspnoea, whereas 4 indicates that the dyspnoea is too high.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory functions will be measured by spirometric measurement. This measurement will give us FEV1 FVC FEV1 / FVC values.</description>

    <measure>Exercise Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>6 Minute walk test will be used.In the test, the person will be asked to walk as fast as possible in a 30-meter corridor and the walking distance will be recorded in 6 minutes.</description>
