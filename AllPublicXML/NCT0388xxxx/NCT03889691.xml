  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Third molar extraction is the most common surgical procedure in the field of oral and
      maxillofacial surgery and usually cause anxiety. Although different informed consent methods
      have been used previously, the most effective information method that provide the optimum
      anxiety management is still not clear. Therefore, investigators planned a clinical study to
      explore the effect of different information formats (verbal information with written document
      and verbal information with written document subsequent to watching video from internet) on
      peri-operative anxiety of the participants who scheduled to undergo impacted lower third
      molar surgery. Also, investigators aimed to explore the effect internet usage before the
      third molar surgery on the level of anxiety.

      The participants were randomly divided into two groups. The control group consisted of
      participants who informed verbally about the surgical procedure and the potential
      postoperative complications,. Also, a written informed consent document was given.
      Participants in the study group were asked to watch a video which was previously uploaded to
      the internet and was showed procedural details of an impacted right lower third molar
      extraction (with permission and written consent). Participants in the study group were also
      informed verbally about the surgical procedure-possible postoperative complications and was
      given with a written informed consent document. In both groups questions of the participants
      were answered by the same surgeon. To evaluate anxiety; participants were asked to complete 3
      questionnaires one week before the procedure when taking appointment for surgery, just after
      watching video or informed verbally, immediately after the procedure and one week after the
      procedure.

    <measure>Anxiety change being assessed with Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>one week before the procedure when taking appointment for surgery, just after watching video or informed verbally, immediately after the procedure and one week after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>There are total 40 questions in STAI-S (20). For each question the patients score ranged from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) points. The sum of the scores range from 20-80. The score between 36 to 41 refer the mean anxiety level, and the values above 41 classified as high level of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety change being assessed with Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>one week before the procedure when taking appointment for surgery, just after watching video or informed verbally, immediately after the procedure and one week after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>MDAS consists of five questions in total which measures anxiety at different stages of dental treatment. 1 (no anxious) to 5 (very anxious) options are available for each question. The sum of the scores varies from 5 to 25 and the values between 19-25 indicates high dental anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>one week before the procedure when taking appointment for surgery, just after watching video or informed verbally, immediately after the procedure and one week after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>APAIS is a scale consisting of 6 items, 3 of them are related to anesthesia and the others related to surgical procedure. The scoring ranges from 6 to 30 in total. The value of &gt;11 is considered as high-anxiety level.</description>
