  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label prospective phase II clinical study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel and S-1 in patients with
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer. A total of 60 subjects who meet the criteria will be
      treated with nab-paclitaxel and S-1. The primary endpoint is 6 months progression free
      survival rate, and secondary endpoints include objective response rate, overall survival,
      progression free survival and toxicities.
