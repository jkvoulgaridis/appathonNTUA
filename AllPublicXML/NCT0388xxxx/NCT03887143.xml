      The purpose of this study is to evaluate recanalization treatments use, safety and efficacy
      at the acute phase of arterial ischemic stroke in pediatric patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial ischemic stroke outcomes benefited from the implementation of recanalization
      treatments (IV thrombolysis, endovascular treatments) and adapted management pathways in
      adult patients. Nevertheless randomized trials did not enroll patients under the age of 18
      years old and data concerning these treatments in children are scarce. As it is much less
      frequent than in adults, recognition of stroke is often delayed in children. Consequently,
      acute phase trials are difficult to set up and perform. The phase I multicentric
      international prospective trial TIPS (Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke) was prematurely
      stopped because of poor enrollment. Published retrospective regional (Paris-Ile-de-France
      region, France) and national (Switzerland) studies addressed the feasibility of such
      treatments but, because of small samples (less than 20 patients in each study), efficiency
      and prognostic factors could not be addressed.

      Exhaustive retrospective studies in a definite geographic area but with a sufficient number
      of patients in a limited inclusion period would provide these crucial data and address these
      questions with good relevance and limited bias.

    <description>initial imagine ASPECT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. score (units on an scale). The ASPECTS score is a 10-point quantitative topographic CT scan score used in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. I has also been adapted to be used with MR scans.
All scale ranges : Segmental assessment of the MCA vascular territory is made and 1 point is deducted from the initial score of 10 for every region involved (caudate, putamen, internal capsule, nsular cortex, M1(anterior MCA cortex=frontal operculum), M2(MCA cortex lateral to insular ribbon=anterior temporal lobe), M3(posterior MCA cortex=posterior temporal lobe, M4(anterior MCA territory immediately superior to M1), M5(lateral MCA territory immediately superior to M2), M6(posterior MCA territory immediately superior to M3)
For each scale, values better or worse :
In adults, an ASPECTS score less than or equal to 7 predicts a worse functional outcome at 3 months as well as symptomatic hemorrhage</description>

    <description>Association with :Modified Rankin Scale - mRS (Units on a scale)The mRS is a 6-point quantitative measure of functional independence.
All scale ranges:
0=No symptoms at all
No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance
Moderate
Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance
Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention

For each scales range, values better or worse :
In the literature, good outcome is usually considered for patients with mRS [0-2]. Very good outcome is considered for patients with mRS [0-1]. We will use the same thresholds</description>

- The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure - PSOM (Units on a scale) =scale has been designed and published to quantify functional consequences of stroke in children. The PSOM is a detailed neurological examination, with outcome scored in terms of degree of impairment in each of language, cognition, and sensorimotor. We wil use the PSOM-SNE version (PSOM-Short Neuro Exam version).
All scale ranges (0-0,5-1 or 2):
- Sensorimotor deficit, Language Deficit - Production, Language Deficit - Comprehension, Cognitive or Behavioural Deficit. Total score on 10
For each scale range, values better or worse:
Total impairment scores (out of a maximum of 10) will be considered as previously published, i.e. total score 0 or 0.5 representing good outcome, and poor outcome ≥1.
All subscales ranges (Normal, Anormal, Not Done):
Level of consciousness, Behaviour, mental status, Language, Cranial nerves, Motor testing, Tendon reflexes, Fine motor coordination, Sensory, Gate</description>
