      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of consuming processed and unprocessed red
      meat on gut microbiota in young healthy adults in a cross-over, randomized controlled feeding
      trial. The hypothesis is that compared to consuming a meat-free lacto-ovo vegetarian (LOV)
      diet, (1) consuming the LOV diet with unprocessed red meat or processed red meat (omnivorous
      diet) will shift the gut microbiota with greater abundance of the bacteria Lactobacillus and
      other SCFA producers such as Clostridium XIVa, and no increase of pathogenic bacteria. The
      concentration of SCFA in stools will also increase in subjects consuming the unprocessed red
      meat diet. Compared to consuming a meat-free lacto-ovo vegetarian (LOV) diet, (2) consuming
      the LOV diet with processed beef and pork (omnivorous diet) will result in a comparable shift
      in gut microbiota as unprocessed red meat, except for greater abundance of taxa
      Erysipelotrichaceae and lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 24-week randomized controlled, crossover, single-blind study. Following a 5-wk pre-intervention baseline period, subjects will be randomly assigned to consume a controlled diet that either does not contain any red meat (lacto-ovo vegetarian, LOV), or contains unprocessed lean red meat, or contains processed lean red meat, for 3 weeks. After a 5-week dietary 'washout' period, they will consume one of the alternative diets for 3 weeks. After the second 5-week dietary 'washout' period, they will consume the remaining alternative diet for 3 weeks. Stool and fasting-state blood samples will be obtained at the end of study weeks 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, and 24, which correspond to before and during the last 2 weeks of the three 3-wk controlled diet periods. Consecutive 4-day 24-hour urine samples will be collected within the assessment weeks of each dietary 'washout' period and control diet period (study weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24).</intervention_model_description>
