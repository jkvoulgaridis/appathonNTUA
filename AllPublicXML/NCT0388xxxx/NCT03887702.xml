    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well tenofovir alafenamide works in preventing liver
      complications in participants with current or past hepatitis B virus (HBV) who are receiving
      anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors. People with chronic or past HBV who are undergoing
      therapy for cancer are at an increased risk for changes in the liver which could be minor or
      severe. Tenofovir alafenamide is a drug that acts against infections caused by HBV and may
      help reduce the chance that HBV gets worse or comes back in participants receiving
      anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the effect of prophylactic tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) therapy versus upon
      indication TAF therapy on time-to-adverse liver outcomes of liver failure or liver-related
      death in patients with chronic HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen positive [HBsAg+]
      and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen positive [anti-HBc+]) receiving anti-cancer therapy
      for solid tumors.

      II. To compare the effect of upon indication TAF therapy versus usual care on time-to-adverse
      liver outcomes of liver failure or liver-related death in patients with past HBV infection
      (hepatitis B surface antigen negative [HBsAg-] and anti-HBc+) receiving anti-cancer therapy
      for solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Using time-to-event analysis, to compare the effect of TAF therapy versus upon indication
      TAF therapy on HBV reactivation, on the combined endpoint of adverse liver outcomes (liver
      failure or liver-related death) and HBV reactivation, and on HBV flare by arm in patients
      with chronic HBV infection receiving anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors.

      II. Using time-to-event analysis, to compare the effect of upon indication TAF therapy versus
      usual care on HBV reactivation, on the combined endpoint of adverse liver outcomes (liver
      failure or liver-related death) and HBV reactivation, and on HBV flare by arm in patients
      with past HBV infection receiving anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare baseline and changes in overall immune status and HBV-specific immune response
      in patients with solid tumors and chronic or past HBV infection receiving anti-cancer
      therapy, and to compare the differences in these immune responses by HBV reactivation status.

      II. To identify demographic and clinical predictors and correlative immunologic biomarkers of
      HBV reactivation after receipt of anti-cancer therapy in patients with solid tumors and
      chronic or past HBV infection.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP A (Cohorts 1a &amp; 2a): Participants receive TAF orally (PO) once daily (QD) immediately
      or within 28 days after initial dose of chemotherapy. Treatment continues for up to 6 months
      after the last dose of chemotherapy or a maximum of 24 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B (Cohorts 1b &amp; 2b): Participants receive TAF PO QD after HBV reactivation during
      chemotherapy. Treatment continues for up to 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy or a
      maximum of 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP C (Cohort 3): Participants receive TAF PO QD at the discretion of the physician during
      usual care. Treatment continues for up to 6 months after discontinuation of usual care or a
      maximum of 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 24 months.

The study will recruit patients with multiple different cancer types, but predominantly lung, breast, colon, prostate, gynecological, and head and neck cancers. Estimates of adverse liver outcomes at 1 year will be derived using cumulative incidence to account for the competing risk of death. The final analysis will rely on Cox regression, adjusting for the stratification factors.</description>

    <description>Estimates of HBV reactivation at one year will be derived using cumulative incidence to account for competing risks. Under this scenario, a sample size of n=222 patients for each randomized study will allow the investigators to estimate the confidence interval to within +/- 6% (based on the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval using an exact binomial in patients with complete follow-up), if the assumed incidence is at least 20%. Thus, this sample size will allow the confidence interval to be estimated to within +/- 31.1% of the assumed incidence (the ?relative accuracy?, defined as: (95% confidence interval [CI] upper bound ? p)/p], where p is the assumed incidence).</description>

    <description>The investigators will compare HBV reactivation rates by arm within each randomized trial. Based on a two-sample survival design accounting for the competing risk of death (~20% deaths at 1 year [hazard rate of 0.223]), and a one-sided alpha=0.05 test, then n=222 patients (111 per arm) will give 81% power to detect a hazard ratio for HBV reactivation for experimental to standard arms of 0.47, representing a 53% reduction in the hazard risk of HBV reactivation in the first year (from a hazard=0.223 down to hazard = 0.105), or an absolute reduction of 50% (from 20% down to 10%). Multivariable Cox regression will compare the effect of intervention assignment, adjusting for the stratification factors specified in the main clinical study.</description>
