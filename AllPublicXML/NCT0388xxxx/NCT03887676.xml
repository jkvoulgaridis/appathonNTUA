  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of arbaclofen vs. placebo on social function
      in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no pharmacologic treatments available for social function deficits in individuals
      with ASD. The data for pharmacologic treatment of repetitive behaviours in this disorder has
      also become difficult to interpret given that the last two large multisite trials of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism are reported to be negative for the
      treatment of repetitive behaviours. Only the associated symptom of irritability has 2 drugs
      with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications, whereas no systematic data exists on the
      pharmacologic treatment of anxiety in ASD, and response to rates to stimulants for
      hyperactivity are lower than what is seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
      In addition, there are no biological markers of treatment response identified in this
      population at this point. This study will examine the potential efficacy and safety of
      arbaclofen for social function, and will explore biological markers of safety and treatment
      response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatients 5-17 years of age inclusive.

          2. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
             DSM-5 criteria will be established by a clinician with expertise with individuals with
             ASD. Diagnosis will be supported by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second
             Edition (ADOS-2).

          3. Complex language to qualify for ADOS-2 modules 3 or 4.

          4. If already receiving stable concomitant medications affecting behaviour, have stable
             regimens with no changes during the preceding 6 weeks prior to Screening, and will not
             electively initiate new or modify ongoing medications for the duration of the study.

          5. If already receiving stable non-pharmacological educational and behavioural
             interventions, have continuous participation during the preceding 3 months prior to
             Screening, and will not electively initiate new or modify ongoing interventions for
             the duration of the study.

          6. Have normal physical examination and laboratory test results at Screening. If
             abnormal, the finding(s) must be deemed clinically insignificant by the Investigator.

          7. Ability to obtain written informed consent from the participant, if developmentally
             appropriate. If a participant does not have the capacity to consent, ability to obtain
             assent (if developmentally appropriate), as well as written informed consent from
             their parent(s)/legal guardian(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant females; sexually active females on inadequate birth control.

          2. Have a serious medical condition that, based on Investigator judgment, might interfere
             with the conduct of the study, confound interpretation of the study results, or
             endanger their own well-being. Have evidence of any significant hematological,
             endocrine, cardiovascular (including uncorrected symptomatic congenital heart
             disease), respiratory, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease, not including mild
             common pediatric diseases in these areas that are stable (e.g. mild asthma,
             constipation, etc.).

          3. Have unstable epilepsy (i.e. seizures occurring within the last 6 months), or have
             epilepsy and not on stable doses of antiepileptic medications (i.e. dose changes
             within the last 3 months).

          4. Have a history of drug abuse.

          5. Have hypersensitivity to arbaclofen or any components of its formulation.

          6. Unable to tolerate venipuncture procedures for blood sampling.

          7. Actively enrolled in another intervention study.

          8. Taking racemic bacblofen, vigabatrin, tiagapine, riluzole, clobazam or regular
             benzodiazepine use (prn and hs use is allowed).

          9. Unable to take oral medications.

         10. Known hypersensitivity to racemic baclofen.

         11. Inability to speak and understand English sufficiently enough to allow for the
             completion of all study assessments (parent/legal guardian; participant).
