      Objectives:

      Primary:

      • To characterize the infectivity of the new lot of Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 within
      the standard WRAIR CHMI model as compared to the current lot (historical data)

      Secondary:

        -  To assess safety of the new lot of P falciparum parasites

        -  To assess the kinetics of detecting parasitemia and parasite clearance by quantitative
           polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as compared to blood smear

        -  To obtain plasma samples to restore the testing control pool for malaria serology
           testing and for future malaria research

      This is a single center, open label CHMI study. CHMI will consist of exposure to Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoites through the bites of infected mosquitoes. After the challenge,
      subjects will be evaluated daily for the development of malaria infection using a blood
      smear. Unless previously diagnosed and fully treated, subjects will be required to stay in a
      hotel for a maximum of 12 nights starting on or around the evening of Day 7 post challenge.

      All subjects diagnosed with malaria infection based on smears will be prescribed a standard
      malaria treatment regimen to begin on the day that parasitemia is detected. Subjects who do
      not become parasitemic (via smear) by Day 19 will be empirically treated for malaria.

      After the hotel phase, all challenged subjects will have a final scheduled follow-up visit on
      Day 28 (±7 days).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for this study, you must meet ALL of the following conditions:

               -  You are willing and able to participate in all planned study visits for the
                  duration of the study.

               -  You are in good general health based on your medical history, physical
                  examination, EKG, and screening laboratories.

               -  You are able to understand and sign this informed consent.

               -  You pass the written test called the 'Assessment of Understanding' with a score
                  of at least 80% (8 out of 10 questions correct).

               -  You agree not to donate blood during the study and for 3 years after the malaria
                  challenge.

               -  You agree not to travel to place(s) where there is malaria during the time of the
                  study.

               -  If you are a female, you must agree to consistently use effective birth control
                  (e.g., oral or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm
                  with spermicide, abstinence, cervical cap) during the period from the day of
                  screening (today) through 3 months after the malaria challenge.

               -  You must be willing to take anti-malarial treatment after CHMI, if indicated.

               -  You must agree to stay in a pre-determined hotel near the NMRC CTC during the
                  designated post-CHMI follow-up period from approximately 7 days after malaria
                  challenge until antimalarial treatment is completed, if indicated.

               -  If you are an active duty military or federal employee, you must have approval
                  from your supervisory chain to participate. The appropriate approval form will be
                  provided to you.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  You must not have any of the following:

               -  Any history of malaria infection or having been given a malaria vaccine

               -  Any history travel to a country with falciparum malaria in the past 6 months, or
                  planned travel to such an area during the course of the study

               -  Any history of having lived in an area with falciparum malaria for more than 5
                  years.

               -  Any use of medications that prevent or treat malaria during the 1 month prior to
                  challenge or planned use during the study (outside of the drugs provided by the

                  kidneys

               -  Any significant risk for developing heart disease in the next 5 years. The risk
                  for developing heart disease in the next 5 years will be determined by a
                  combination of the following factors: high blood pressure, smoking, weight,
                  family history of heart disease and the presence of diabetes

               -  Any medical illness or condition involving your blood or immune system (to
                  include sickle cell trait or thalassemia trait)

               -  Any abnormal (as determined by a physician) screening laboratory test results

               -  Any history of neurologic disease (including migraines or seizures)

               -  Any history of psoriasis (itchy skin rash) or porphyria (rare disturbance of
