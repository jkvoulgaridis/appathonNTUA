    <textblock>
      Rib fractures pose a significant healthcare burden with its associated morbidity, long term
      disability, and mortality. Pulmonary morbidity is increased in these patients as a result of
      diminished gas exchange from fracture induced pulmonary injury and from inadequate analgesia
      compromising both ventilation and pulmonary mechanics. Adequate analgesia is paramount in
      enhancing pulmonary hygiene aimed at preventing atelectasis and pneumonia. Numbing the nerves
      to the fractured ribs by injecting local anaesthetic (LA) improves breathing and reduces the
      risk of complications. Two techniques of regional anesthesia (erector spinae plane block
      (ESPB) and paravertebral block (PVB)) will be compared regarding their efficacy for treating
      pain caused by rib fractures. The LA is injected near nerves at two different locations. The
      PVB is immediately adjacent to the vertebrae, whereas the ESPB is slightly further away from
      the midline. Both techniques use ultrasound to ensure the LA is directed to the intended
      place. Adult patients with &gt; 3 consecutive fractured ribs will be consented, then randomised
      to receive either a ESPB or a PVB. It is expected that both groups will significantly improve
      in terms of pain score, opioids need, and breathing ability, however it is unclear which
      technique will provide better results and less complications.

      Rib fractures occur most commonly because of blunt thoracic trauma and occur in up to 12% of
      all trauma patients. Rib fractures themselves pose a significant healthcare burden with its
      associated morbidity, long term disability, and mortality. Pulmonary morbidity is increased
      in these patients as a result of diminished gas exchange from fracture induced pulmonary
      injury and from inadequate analgesia compromising both ventilation and pulmonary mechanics.
      Various factors affect outcome and mortality after rib fractures. These include the number of
      ribs fractured, preexisting comorbidities, advanced age, and level of associated pain. Of
      these, pain is a significant modifiable factor.

      Adequate analgesia is paramount in enhancing pulmonary hygiene aimed at preventing
      atelectasis and pneumonia. Systemic analgesia is usually sufficient in younger patients with
      fewer undisplaced fractures without a flail segment. Regional techniques are particularly
      useful in elderly patients (&gt;65 years of age), patients with multiple rib fractures (MRFs),
      and in patients with severe pain or compromised pulmonary function. Conventional regional
      techniques used to manage rib fractures include epidural analgesia, paravertebral block
      (PVB), intercostal, and intrapleural block.

      In 2010 Truitt et al. introduced a novel technique whereby local anesthetic (LA) infiltration
      superficial to the posterior ribs via tunneled catheters successfully controlled rib fracture
      pain. Since then, multiple thoracic RA (Regional Anesthesia) techniques have been developed
      that use ultrasound-guided (USG) LA (local anesthetic) injections into fascial planes from
      the thoracic spinal lamina to the sternum to anesthetize various regions of the thorax.

      Some of the conventional regional techniques, particularly epidural analgesia and PVB, may
      not be feasible in the presence of anticoagulation, multisystem trauma, or in patients unable
      to be optimally positioned. Recently, several ultrasound-guided (USG) myofascial plane blocks
      (both single injection and continuous catheter techniques) have been described (e.g. The
      serratus anterior plane (SAP) block and the erector spinae plane (ESP) block) , which offer
      the advantages of being less invasive technique and provide adequate analgesia after rib
      fractures.

      ESP block is a novel myofascial plane block recently introduced into clinical practice. It
      has been successfully utilized in the management of pain after both rib fractures and surgery
      of the abdomen and thorax, and in the management of chronic thoracic pain. In contrast to the
      SAP block, the ESP block has the ability to provide analgesia to both the anterior and
      posterior hemithorax, making it particularly useful in the management of pain after extensive
      thoracic surgery or trauma (anterior, lateral, and posterior chest wall). Innervation of the
      ribs and adjoining tissue is primarily through thoracic spinal nerves. After emerging from
      the spinal cord and traversing through the intervertebral foramina, the thoracic spinal
      nerves split into ventral and dorsal rami. The ventral rami continue as intercostal nerves
      innervating the lateral and anterior chest wall, whereas the dorsal rami innervate the
      posterior chest wall after exiting the paravertebral space.

      The ESP block is directed at the erector spinae myofascial plane, which is located on the
      posterior chest wall between the anterior surface of the erector spinae muscle and oriented
      cephalocaudally to the posterior surface of the spinal transverse process. Local anaesthetic
      injected in this plane can block the dorsal rami as they traverse the erector spinae plane,
      producing anesthesia to the posterior hemithorax. Local anaesthetic also spreads anteriorly
      and cephalocaudally in the erector spinae plane. Ventral rami and intercostal nerves are
      blocked by anterior spread, providing analgesia to ribs and periosteum as well as large
      cutaneous areas of the lateral and anterior chest wall (by blockade of lateral and anterior
      branches of the intercostal nerves). Cephalocaudal spread provides anesthesia to at least
      three segments above and four segments below the injection site; a single injection can
      result in extensive thoracic anesthesia.

      PVB has been shown to be as effective as epidural analgesia in managing multiple rib
      fractures (MRFs). A recent randomized trial has shown that PVB is superior to intravenous
      patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) in providing better analgesia and improving pulmonary
      function with MRFs.

      Unilateral sensory, motor, and sympathetic block can be achieved when local anaesthetic is
      injected into the paravertebral space. As this space communicates with the intercostal space
      laterally and the epidural space medially, a 5-6 dermatome sensory block is possible with a
      single injection of 20 ml of local anaesthetic. Compared with epidural analgesia, PVB is
      relatively easy to perform, produces less sympathetic blockade, does not cause urinary
      retention or pruitis, and allows for an unimpeded neurological assessment. However, there is
      a small risk for pneumothorax, vascular puncture, pleural puncture and a possibility of
      toxicity due to the rapid absorption of Local Anaesthetic. TPB can be given by using surface
      landmarks, nerve stimulator guidance or Ultrasound Guidance (USG). A review suggested that
      USG blocks are more successful and safe than other techniques.

    <description>Normal diaphragmatic excursion should be 3-5 cm, but can be increased in well-conditioned persons to 7-8 cm. This measures the contraction of the diaphragm.
It is performed by asking the patient to exhale and hold it. The provider then percusses down their back in the intercostal margins (bone will be dull), starting below the scapula, until sounds change from resonant to dull (lungs are resonant, solid organs should be dull). That is where the provider marks the spot. Then the patient takes a deep breath in and holds it as the provider percusses down again, marking the spot where the sound changes from resonant to dull again. Then the provider will measure the distance between the two spots.</description>

    <description>ESPB will be performed in sitting or lateral decubitus position. The target vertebral level will be correspond to the approximate mid-point of the extent of fractured ribs. The tip of the transverse process of the target vertebra will be identified using the high-frequency linear placed in cephalocaudal orientation about 3 cm to the spinous process. The skin and subcutaneous tissue will be infiltrated with 2-3 ml of 2% lignocaine. With the transducer fixed over the targeted TP, a 22-gauge 88-mm needle (Spinocan, B. Braun, Germany) will be advanced in-plane to the ultrasound beam in a cephalo-caudal direction to contact the TP. Correct needle tip position will be confirmed by doing alternating aspiration to confirm lack of inadvertent vascular puncture with injection of 1-2 ml of saline and visualizing linear fluid spread deep to erector spinae muscle, separating it from the TP. A bolus dose (2ml/segment) of plain bupivacaine 0.5% plus 4mg of Dexamethasone will be injected.</description>

    <description>TPVB will be performed at a spinal level midway between the uppermost and the lowest fractured rib with the patient in sitting or lateral decubitus position (with patients lying on their unaffected side). The ultrasound-guided technique will be used. A high-frequency linear transducer will be used to confirm the levels of the fractured ribs. The most cephalad and most caudad fractured ribs will be identified first. The fractured rib in the middle will be then identified, and the rib will be then traced back medially. After skin and subcutaneous tissue infiltration with 2-3 ml of 2% lignocaine, a 22-gauge 88-mm needle (Spinocan, B. Braun, Germany) will be inserted in a lateral-to-medial direction until the needle tip entered the paravertebral space. 1-2 ml of Saline will be injected into the paravertebral space while observing the pleura being moved deeply. A bolus dose (2ml/segment) of plain bupivacaine 0.5% plus 4mg of Dexamethasone will be injected.</description>
