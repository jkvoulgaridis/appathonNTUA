      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the home-use device
      Silk'n toothbrush (ToothWave) for the improvement in dental health through the reduction of
      plaque, gingivitis, and calculus.

    <textblock>
      This is a single blind, prospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and effica-cy of the
      Silk'n toothbrush in reduction of gingivitis, dental plaque and calculus.

      The study includes 84 treatment sessions, twice a day, and 4 clinic visits over a period of 6
      weeks.

      One treatment group (Silk'n toothbrush - ToothWave) and 1 control group (an ADA approved
      power toothbrush (PTB)) will participate in the study.

      For each patient, assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 6 weeks. The
      average data sets will be calculated for each group.

      Treatment is defined as a timed 2 minutes of teeth brushing in a regular man-ner, twice a day
      (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken using the Silk'n toothbrush and standard
      fluoride toothpaste. The control group will use a regular PTB and standard fluoride
      toothpaste.
