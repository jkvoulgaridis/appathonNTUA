      A Phase 2b Study to Determine the Efficacy of Candidate Influenza Vaccine MVA-NP+M1 in Adults
      aged 18 years and over. To assess the effect of MVA-NP+M1 on the reduction of laboratory
      confirmed influenza when given as an adjunct to licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV)
      in adults
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, single-blind study in up to 6000 adults to
      compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MVA-NP+M1 when given as an adjunct to a
      standard, licensed adult dose of QIV. The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis and
      will run over two consecutive influenza seasons. It is aimed to recruit 2200 participants in
      Season 1 and 2800-3800 participants in Season 2.
