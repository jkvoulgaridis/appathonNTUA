    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program
      and the Living Well program, compared to a control group, to see if the programs might be
      associated with better immune function (response to current influenza vaccine), physical and
      emotional health, and well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A considerable literature documents that a wide variety of psychosocial interventions can
      lessen the psychological burden of family or spousal dementia caregiving. Some caregiver
      intervention studies have included measures of self-reported physical health and sleep, and
      others have focused on improving inflammation in caregivers. The current study will add to
      this literature by examining the effects of two behavioral interventions on adaptive immune
      responses, particularly, antibody response to influenza vaccination, in older adult family
      caregivers.

    <description>The MBSR program is an eight-week-long course designed to teach subjects how to develop their inner resources in the service of taking better care of themselves. MBSR training includes the learning and refining of a range of skills aimed at increasing relaxation and awareness of physical experiences and sensations related to physical symptoms, emotions, and thoughts. Special emphasis is placed on movement, meditation, and breathing.</description>

    <description>LW is an eight-week course of group presentations and discussions on topics related to the promotion of health and well-being in the context of dementia caregiving.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  55 years of age and older

          -  English-speaking (consent process and assessments will be conducted in English only)

          -  Currently living with or in proximity to, and the primary caregiver for, a loved one
             with dementia who lives in the community—for the purposes of this study, &quot;loved one&quot;
             refers to a family member such as a spouse, ex-spouse, significant other, sibling,
             in-law, parent, or other type of close established relationship (e.g., close friend)
             regarded as family; &quot;primary caregivers&quot; provide daily informal (non-paid) in-person
             care.

          -  Currently experiencing moderate to high levels of perceived stress (PSS-10 ≥ 12)
             and/or caregiver burden (MCSI ≥ 5)

          -  Participants will be asked to stabilize medications prior to beginning the trial, and
             for the duration of the trial (If medication dose changes do occur, analytic models
             will include those changes as time-varying covariates)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Loved one with dementia currently resides in a long-term care facility (e.g., nursing
             home) without the caregiver.

          -  Given the didactic and self-directed nature of the MBSR program, individuals with
             major, uncorrected sensory impairments and cognitive deficits, as determined by a
             Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 23 or lower 29, will be excluded, as
             will participants with other neuropsychological deficits deemed significant enough to
             interfere with study participation. Low literacy is not an exclusion criterion;
             questionnaires will be orally administered when necessary.

          -  Modules from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Exam (MINI 30) will be used to
             exclude subjects who have these psychiatric conditions: current alcohol dependence,
             current non-alcohol psychoactive substance use dependence, psychotic disorders
             (current and lifetime), bipolar disorder, and current mood disorder with psychotic
             features.

          -  Subjects will also be excluded for the following reasons: having completed an MBSR
             program in the past; allergy to eggs (the influenza vaccine is most commonly
             manufactured using an egg-based process); history of Guillain-Barré syndrome;
             immunodeficiency or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy; recent major surgery; and
             active neoplastic disease.
