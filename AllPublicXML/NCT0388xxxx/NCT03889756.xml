  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the intermediate-term efficacy and tolerability of a
      multiple-dosing ketamine infusion paradigm for the treatment of medication-refractory major
      depressive disorder (MDD). We are using a two-phase design. The first phase is a 3-week
      double blind parallel design clinical trial comparing 6 infusions of ketamine compared to 6
      infusions of midazolam in 24 adolescents with treatment resistant depression. The primary
      outcome of this phase will be Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) score at Day 18. The
      second phase is a 6-month open phase in which patients who received midazolam and remain
      depressed with be offered open ketamine treatment (6 infusions over 3 weeks). All
      participants will be followed weekly for 6 months and tracked for time to relapse.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the intermediate-term efficacy and tolerability of a
      multiple-dosing ketamine infusion paradigm for the treatment of medication-refractory major
      depressive disorder (MDD). The specific aims of the study are: To evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of a multiple-dosing ketamine infusion paradigm (2 infusions per week for 3
      weeks) compared to midazolam in adolescents with treatment resistant depression (TRD), . To
      test these aims we have designed a two-phase trial. The first phase is a 3-week double blind
      parallel design clinical trial comparing 6 infusions of ketamine compared to 6 infusions of
      midazolam in 24 adolescents with TRD. The primary outcome of this phase will be Children's
      Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) score at Day 18. The second phase is a 6-month open phase in
      which patients who received midazolam and remain depressed with be offered open ketamine
      treatment (6 infusions over 3 weeks). All participants will be followed weekly for 6 months
      and tracked for time to relapse. In those who initially responded to ketamine, symptom
      triggered maintenance infusions will be offered during this 6-month time period. All
      participants will receive standard of care treatment in addition to experimental procedures,
      and will be tracked monthly with extensive neurocognitive assessments.

    <description>Ketamine is an FDA-approved anesthetic agent that is commonly used to induce surgical anesthesia due to its low incidence of significant respiratory depression and hypotension. It as a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and glutamatergic modulator, and has been demonstrated in multiple controlled clinical trials to have rapidly acting antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects in adults.</description>

    <description>Midazolam, the active control in this study, is a medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a sedative for both children and adults.It is a benzodiazepine with a short half-life that was chosen so as to blind the psychotomimetic effects of Ketamine.</description>

    <description>The dose of ketamine established in prior research (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) will be used in this study to minimize risks. The maximum total single dose allowed in this study will be 40mg, corresponding to a weight of 80kg.</description>

    <description>The weight-based midazolam dosing established in prior ketamine trials in adults (0.045mg/kg) will be used to minimize risks, as this is considered a very low dose compared to the sedation literature. The maximum total dose allowed in this study will be 3.6mg per infusion, corresponding to a weight of 80kg.</description>
