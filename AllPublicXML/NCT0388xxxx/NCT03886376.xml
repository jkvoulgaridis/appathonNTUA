  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swimming is a sport that includes different styles and distances, which can expose the
      athlete to different stressors that can affect performance and generate conditions such as
      overtraining. This is due to the lack of integration of systematic recovery periods during
      training programs. A very used recuperative feature in swimming is massage. Recent studies
      have shown that the application of short duration is sufficient to obtain the desired effects
      and it is possible that its application systematized over a period of time may have greater
      effects on performance. The aims of this study was to evaluate the effects of massage and
      placebo on clinical, functional and performance issues; to identify its short-term effects on
      clinical and functional variables and to investigate the association between training load
      and the perceptions and sensations of the swimming athlete. The sample will contain 18 young
      athletes between 12 and 20 years old, randomized in blocks and cross-crossover to the
      sequences with the following interventions: i) passive recovery, ii) massage, and iii)
      placebo. The athletes will be submitted to 5 training sessions and 3 intervention sessions
      per week, between the physical training session and swim training and to a maximum test of
      100-meter crawl sprints. Data will be collected regarding training load (TRIMP), athlete
      perceptions (SPEQ), test time and technical index, stroke characteristics and physical
      evaluation (flexibility, power and proprioception).

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be composed of 18 apparently healthy male and female athletes aged 12 to 20
      who train regularly (six days a week) and are members of the Prudentina Athletic Sports
      Association (APEA) swimming team. The sample size was defined based on the study of Greenwood
      et al. who used active recovery with similar time and intensity. The research project was
      accepted by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Science and Technology of the
      Paulista State University &quot;Júlio de Mesquita Filho&quot; - FCT / UNESP. The study has a crossover
      design and the sample of 18 participants was randomized in blocks and allocated in three
      distinct intervention sequences to minimize possible adaptation biases. The sequences are i)
      passive recovery; ii) massage and iii) placebo massage. The study will be conducted over a
      period of eight weeks, consisting of five sessions of physical training and swimming. On
      Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays interventions between training sessions will also be carried
      out. At the end of each training week, participants will be subjected to a maximum test of
      two shots of 200 meters in crawl style conducted in a short indoor pool (25 meters), in which
      was collected the total time, technical index, effort perception, stroke characteristics and
      physical evaluation. Higher internal and external loads were observed by the TRIMP (Training
      Impulse) during three days of the week (Monday, Tuesday and Friday). At these days, athletes
      reported higher values of training intensity and inconvenient sensations, especially after
      physical training and the beginning of swimming training. the monitoring of the athlete's
      perceptions will be evaluated by the Swimmer's Perception of Effort Questionnaire (SPEQ)
      developed by the sports physiotherapy laboratory (LAFIDE). The physical evaluation will be
      composed of the tests of flexibility with the wells bench, power by the squat jump and
      supine, proprioception by the test of the movement assisted by laser-tip. Also, total time
      and stroke characteristics will be collected on the same day. For the control group,
      immediately after the physical training the athletes will be instructed to wait for 12
      minutes until the beginning of the swim training. The intervention group will receive 12
      minutes of massage on the legs, arms and the back with three different sliding pressures. The
      placebo group will receive superficial massage on the same sites than the intervention group.
      The statistical analyses will be performed was follows: Analysis of the distribution of data
      normality: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Analysis of the comparison between weekly training loads:
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) one-way with Bonferroni or Dunn post-hoc; Analysis of the
      cumulative effect of the intervention applied in a training week: Paired Student's T test for
      dependent samples; Analysis of the comparison between groups in relation to the cumulative
      effect of the interventions: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) one-way with post-hoc of Bonferroni
      or Dunn; Analysis of the effect of physical training: Paired Student's T test for dependent
      samples.
