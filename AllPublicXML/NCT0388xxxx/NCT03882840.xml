  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T effector cells and NK cells have mutual compensatory killing functions on various of cancer
      types. For those cancers that have no available targets for CAR-T cell generations, we
      established potent T cell-like NK cells (ITNK) with a specific conversion protocol for the T
      cells from the patient, to perform anti-cancer therapy, especially for those cancers that are
      lack of MHC-I molecule expression. We have finished pre-clinical investigations for the ITNK
      cell therapy and scheduled to start a clinical phase I study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One gene can be knockout of the T cells to produce a T-like NK cells which obtain killing
      function of both T effector cells and NK cells. We will collect appropriate patient's T
      cells, produce T-like NK cells (ITNK), and infuse the ITNK cells back to the patients to
      treat various of cancers.

    <description>Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients whose best response is either complete remission or partial remission by combining the data from the patients. To compare with historical data, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the response rate.</description>
