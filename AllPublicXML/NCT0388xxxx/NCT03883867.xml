  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanical demands placed on the pelvic floor structures during vaginal delivery often
      exceed physiological tissue limits, resulting in maternal childbirth trauma, considerable
      postpartum morbidity, and increased risk of pelvic floor disorders(PFD). Injury to the
      perineum, vaginal supportive tissues, and pelvic floor muscles cause pain, infection, and
      dyspareunia, as well as pelvic organ prolapse(POP).Pregnancy and vaginal delivery are
      considered as a main risk factors in weakening the pelvic floor support and development of
      SUI, AI, and POP. CS is not only available countermeasure to reduce occurrence of obstetric
      trauma. Tactile imaging allows acquisition of 3D stress-strain data and 3D elasticity imaging
      or soft tissues.

      The long - term of this project is to develop, validate, and integrate into clinical practice
      a new paradigm and a novel device to simultaneously measure the biomechanical properties of
      various pelvic structural components that are impacted during vaginal delivery, and to
      develop a risk prediction model of maternal birth injury. Ultimately, such a model will
      enable individualized patient counseling regarding the mode of delivery and/or the need for
      obstetrical interventions to reduce child birth trauma. The approach will utilize the vaginal
      tactile imaging technology that the investigators have developed and validated for clinical
      use.

      The benefits to physicians, patients and society are expected to be significant because the
      painful event in woman's life , given the large proportion of women suffer PFD caused by
      childbirth.

      This new system may open a new technical capability in woman's healthcare and change the
      established clinical practice.
