    <measure>Change in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) from pre-dose to 6 hours post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Change in TNSS from pre-dose to 6 hours post-dose for NKT vs placebo. The TNSS is the sum of the scores of four nasal symptoms (runny nose, congestion, itching, and sneezing) each scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe). The TNSS score ranges from 0 to 12.</description>

    <description>Change in TOSS from pre-dose to 6 hours post-dose for NKT vs placebo. The TOSS is the sum of the scores of three ocular symptoms (itching, tearing, and redness) each scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe). The TOSS score ranges from 0 to 9.</description>

             participation in the study

          -  Any history of malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of non-melanoma

             intermittent asthma is permitted (managed with short acting beta-agonist less than 3
             times per week). Isolated exercise-induced bronchospasm is also permitted

          -  Any infection or inflammatory condition within the 2 weeks prior to screening

          -  Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV)

          -  History of allergic reaction to ketotifen

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, subject would be unlikely to comply with required
             study visits, self-assessments, and interventions
