  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Participants in the colon and rectal cancer (CRC) screening program that have a
      positive result in the Fecal Immunological Test (FIT) are visited by the screening nurse who
      explains the meaning of the positive test and the need to perform a colonoscopy. Having a
      positive result in the screening test can have a negative psychological impact on patients
      causing anguish.

      Objective: To evaluate whether the use of iconographies to communicate the risks of possible
      diagnoses to patients with positive FIT improves the understanding of the information and
      reduces the degree of anguish.

      Methods: Quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study with a control group. 240 individuals
      (men and women between 50-69 years of age, with a positive FIT result attending the nursing
      visit) will be included in two non-concurrent study groups (120 individuals per group). The
      control group will receive the nurse visit as usual. For the intervention group, the nurse
      will use iconographies to communicate the risk of the different possible diagnoses and the
      risk of complications of the colonoscopy. The degree of distress (Distress Thermometer and a
      scale of emotion-faces) will be measured before and after the visit and the understanding of
      the information (visual analog scale) after the visit. The degree of distress between the
      control group and intervention group will be compared.

      If the results are favorable, the systematic use of iconographies can be implemented in the
      nursing screening visit and be extended to other Screening Units.

    <description>In addition of the regular nursing visit: the nurse will use iconographies specially designed to communicate the risk of the different possible diagnoses and the complications of the colonoscopy. Because the risks are different according to sex and age, specific iconographies will be developed from the data available in the first screening round.</description>
