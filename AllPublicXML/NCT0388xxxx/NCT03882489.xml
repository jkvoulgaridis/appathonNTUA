  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ambulatory surgery, the choice of the local anesthetic used is essential. The ideal local
      anesthetic must allow a quick installation of the spinal block, a duration of the sensory
      block adapted to the surgery with a minimum of side effects. These side effects include
      bradycardia, hypotension and block failure during the intraoperative period; bladder
      retention, transient neurological disorders during the post-operative period. The achievement
      of kinetic objectives associated with a reduction in side effects is related to the choice of
      local anesthetic and the dose administered. However, there are interindividual
      pharmacokinetic variations that make it difficult to predict the effective dose and the
      unfortunate occurrence of side effects.

      In this context, the height of the patient is a criterion involved in the level, the duration
      of the sensitive motor block and therefore the side effects

      The local anesthetic of the amino ester family, isobaric 2-chloroprocaine (2-CP) has been
      successfully used for spinal anesthesia since several decades. With a short duration of
      action, it is preferred to other anesthetics for the short-term outpatient surgeries.
      However, the effective dose 95 (ED95) of intrathecal isobaric 2-CP is currently unknown.

      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the ED95 of the spinal 2-CP using the
      continuous re-evaluation method (Continual Reassessment Method) (CRM) based on patient's
      height
