  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of Lace Up and Move (LUAM), a structured
      after-school exercise intervention, designed to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical
      activity (MVPA) and enhance sleep quality among Hispanic and African American (AA) boys and
      girls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized comparison-group pre-post-test design. Overall objectives of
      LUAM are to: (1) to increase the percentage of youth who meet 60 minutes of daily MVPA per
      week; (2) to improve the quality of sleep patterns (i.e., sleep efficiency and duration); and
      (3) to reduce percent body fat (%BF). It is hypothesized that compared to the control group
      (CG) participants, the experimental group (EG) participants will exhibit: (a) greater
      increase in percentage of children who meet 60 minutes of daily MVPA per week; (b) greater
      increase of sleep efficiency and duration; and (c) greater decrease in sleep latency and (d)
      greater decrease in %BF.

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to the experiential group (EG) will receive a 12-week structured exercise that will consist of two group fitness sessions (i.e. kickboxing, Zumba, fitness yoga, and other aerobic exercises) every week. Certified fitness instructors will lead each session and participants will learn strategies how to be more active during the daily routines at home. Parents or other relatives in the EG will participate in one 2-hour session every four weeks (total of 3 sessions) designed to help them support their children and entire family in being active and eat healthy at home. Parents will meet with a fitness instructor who will provide specific tips on how to increase physical activity at home as well as providing community resources to be active. A basic nutrition education and cooking demonstrations, and healthy recipes will be also provided to parents at these workshops. Data/assessments are collected, pre and post the 12 weeks intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to the control group (CG) will receive once a week recreational structured group play/game sessions led by trained BOUNCE interns/staff. The control group will receive 60 minute of structured free play sessions (i.e. recreational games) once a week for 12 weeks. Every 4 weeks, parents will be given (either sent home with their child or via email or mail) basic nutrition information, healthy recipes, and tips to promote physical activity at home as well as community resources to be active. Data/assessments are collected, pre and post the 12 weeks intervention.</description>
