      the investigators want to obtain a functional and radiological outcome of peroneus brevis,
      tertius and extensor digitorum longus muscles lengthening together with calcaneal osteotomies
      in the treatment of the spasmodic flat- foot.

    <textblock>
      One of the most common foot complaints is the &quot;flatfoot&quot; deformity. Clinical evaluation of
      flatfeet primarily focuses on differentiation between the two main types: flexible and rigid.
      The rigid flatfoot deformity is an uncommon diagnosis (occurring one-third as often as the
      flexible type) but often is symptomatic and requires treatment&quot;. Multiple causes of rigid
      flatfeet have been identified such as rheumatoid arthritis, tarsal coalitions (being the most
      common cause) that are excluded from that research. Triple arthrodesis is used for treatment
      of rigid flat foot but the patient satisfaction is not good as there is some stiffness in the
      foot .but here the investigators want to know what is the effect of extensor digitorum
      longus, peroneus brevis and tertius lengthening together with osteotomies in alignment of
      spasmodic flat- foot. In patient with rigid flat- foot or spasmodic flat- foot will often
      have the hind-foot alignment to the outside. Alignment of the heel influences how
      weight-bearing stress is applied to the foot, ankle, knee and hip. So, these patients may
      benefit from the calcaneal osteotomies and extensor digitorum longus, peroneus brevis and
      tertius lengthening to improve that alignment.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain. This tool was first used in psychology by Freyd in 1923</description>
