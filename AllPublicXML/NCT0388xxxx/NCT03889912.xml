    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab injected
      intralesionally in patients with recurrent CSCC.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in CSCC index lesions following
           intralesional injections of cemiplimab in patients with recurrent CSCC, according to
           modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria

        -  To describe the pathologic complete response (CR) rate in CSCC index lesions following
           intralesional injections of cemiplimab in patients with recurrent CSCC

        -  To describe the major pathologic response rate in CSCC index lesions following
           intralesional injections of cemiplimab in patients with recurrent CSCC

        -  To evaluate systemic exposure of cemiplimab following intralesional injections of
           cemiplimab in patients with recurrent CSCC

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of cemiplimab in patients with recurrent CSCC

        -  To establish a recommended dose of intralesional cemiplimab for further study in
           patients with recurrent CSCC

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  History of recurrent resectable CSCC that satisfies conditions as defined in the
             protocol

          -  Patient must have measurable disease in the index lesion, as defined by modified WHO
             criteria. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that is at least 1 cm
             in both of the longest perpendicular diameters.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤1

        Key Exclusion Criteria

          -  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for immune-related adverse events (irAEs)

          -  Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed cell death

             1 (PD-1)/ programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway.

          -  Prior treatment with other systemic immune modulating agent as defined in the protocol

          -  M1 or N1, N2 (a, b, or c), or N3 CSCC. Patients with history of metastatic CSCC
             (distant or nodal), are excluded unless the disease-free interval is at least 3 years

          -  Concurrent malignancies, other than those with negligible risk of metastasis or death.
             Patients with hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
             are excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of solid organ transplant

        Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.
