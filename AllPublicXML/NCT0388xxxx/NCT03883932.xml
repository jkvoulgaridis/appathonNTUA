  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of a novel intervention approach for
      fathers arrested for an initial episode of intimate partner violence (IPV) by systematically
      developing an alternate version of a standard, statewide, court-mandated Family Violence
      Education Program (FVEP) to focus specifically on the importance of fathering within a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention to be called Fatherhood Focused FVEP (F3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to modify the treatment as usual FVEP framework to be father focused.
      Materials will be developed to accommodate the change in scope of program focus for the
      purposes of training and supervising group leaders. An evaluation of the fidelity to the
      original FVEP model will be assessed through the review of service delivery.

      In addition, the acceptability of Fatherhood Focused FVEP (F3) will be compared to the
      treatment as usual, FVEP as it is presently implemented. To do this, fathers who participate
      in FVEP will be compared to men who participate in F3 around the constructs: group cohesion,
      motivation to change, satisfaction with the program and rates of successful completion.
      Tertiary outcomes will include the assessment of: aggression toward intimate partners and
      hostile-aggressive parenting behaviors as reported on assessment measures and subsequent
      arrest records.

    <measure>Group Cohesion</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Group cohesion will be assessed using Group Attitude Scale. Group Attitude scale is a self report instrument that consists of 20 items. The range of scores is from 20 to 180, where a higher score indicates WORSE cohesion.</description>

    <measure>Motivation to Change</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to Change will be assessed using University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA). URICIA is a self report instrument that consists of 32 items. The range of scores is from 32 to 160, where a higher score indicates GREATER motivation to change.</description>

    <measure>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IPV perpetration will be assessed using the Abusive Behavior Inventory (ABI). The ABI is a 30 item inventory that uses a 5 point Likert scale for each response. The greater the score, the greater the severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance Abuse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Substance abuse will be assessed using the Short-Michigan Alcohol Screening Test and the Drug Abuse Screening Test-10. This 10 item inventory characterizes behavior associated with alcoholism, the higher the score, the greater the severity of alcoholism in a respondent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parenting behaviors will be assessed with Parental Acceptance Rejection Questionnaire which includes 24 items on a 4 point likert scale. Higher scores mean greater negative parenting behaviors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Co-Parenting Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Co-parenting behaviors will be assessed using the Coparenting Relationship Scale.</description>
