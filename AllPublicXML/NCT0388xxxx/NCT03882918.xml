    <textblock>
      This open-label study (OV101-18-002) will evaluate the long-term (52 weeks) safety of OV101
      in subjects with AS and provide additional OV101 treatment to those subjects who completed
      Study OV101-15-001 (NCT02996305). Subjects with AS who completed the pharmacokinetic Study
      OV101-16-001 (NCT03109756) will also be permitted to participate, provided they meet all
      entry criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, long-term safety study for evaluation of further treatment with
      OV101 in subjects with AS who have completed previous Ovid studies (OV101-15-001 or
      OV101-16-001). There will be no placebo treatment. As this study will enroll subjects who
      have completed previous AS studies for different periods of time before entering this study,
      subjects will be required to complete screening and baseline visits before receiving OV101
      under this protocol.The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy of OV101 treatment assessed by changes in behavior, sleep, and functioning in
      individuals with AS.

             OV101-15-001 or OV101-16-001 study.

          3. Has a previous diagnosis of AS with molecular confirmation from the OV101-15-001 or
             OV101-16-001 study.

             respiratory, or cardiovascular system disease) or condition or any clinically
             significant finding at Screening that could interfere with the conduct of the study or
             that would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in this study.
