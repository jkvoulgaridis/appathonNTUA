      This study aimed to show the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and/or Risperidone in
      improving symptoms of autism

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are clinical disorders with multiple developmental
      disabilities in skills associated with overall behavior and communication. The term (ASD)
      includes Autistic Disorder (AD), Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified
      (PDD-NOS), and Asperger's Disorder .

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a treatment in which patients inside a hyperbaric chamber
      breathe a concentrated oxygen pressurized more than sea level (1 atmosphere absolute) .

      It was obvious that autistic children may have some benefits of HBOT by increasing in
      cerebral perfusion during treatment. Inhalation of more pressurized oxygen might elevate
      partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood, and increased oxygen that reaches the brain
      . Another mechanism of action of HBOT that it might have anti-inflammatory properties by
      reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukins 1 and 6, interferon-γ, and tumor
      necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, HBOT might enhance mitochondrial dysfunction, and upregulate
      the antioxidant enzymes production.

      Risperidone is a second generation antipsychotic, approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for treatment of autism-related irritability. Its approved in 2006 only
      for children not less than 5 years old . This trial aimed to study the effects of hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy and/or Risperidone in management symptoms of autism.

    <measure>Childhood Autism Rating Scale version 2 (CARS2)measured after one year and after two years to compare the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, Risperidone, both of them and the placebo effect</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>The CARS is a 15 items behavioral rating scale developed to identify autism as well as to quantitatively describe the severity of the disorder. The items are as follows: I. Relating to People; II. Imitation; III. Emotional Response; IV. Body Use; V. Object Use; VI. Adaptation to Change; VII. Visual Response; VIII. Listening Response; IX. Taste; Smell, and Touch Response and Use; X. Fear or Nervousness; XI. Verbal Communication; XII. Nonverbal Communication; XIII. Activity Level; XIV. Level and Consistency of Intellectual Response; and XV. General Impressions. Each item is scored from 1 (no pathology) to 4 (severe pathology) in 0.5 intervals. A total score of 15-29.5 is considered non-autistic to minimal; a score of 30-36.5 is considered mild to moderate autism; a score of 37-60 is considered severe autism (these are based on raw scores)</description>

    <description>This group consists of twenty autistic children received forty sessions of HBOT, the time of the session is one hour. The sessions were done at pressure 1.5 ATA (atmosphere absolute) and with 100% oxygen concentration, either in multiplace or monoplace chamber. The number of sessions per week allowed is five sessions per week, all participants were required to complete forty sessions within two months. After six months from the last session, another forty sessions would be taken in the same manner</description>

    <arm_group_label>The Risperidone group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group consists of twenty autistic children received Risperidone (dose: 0.25 mg per day in children weighing less than (20 kg); 0.5 mg per day in persons weighing more) for eight months.
The medication schedule in the initial 2 months was based on the child's weight and clinical response. Adjusting the total daily dose according to response and/or adverse effects, at the end of these eight months of treatment we began the discontinuation phase. In this phase, gradual placebo substitution occurs. The discontinuation reduced the maintenance dose by 25% per week. Thus, the dose was 75% of the last week in the eight months for the first week, followed by 50% of the last week for the second week, 25% of the last week for the third week, and placebo only by the fourth week.</description>
