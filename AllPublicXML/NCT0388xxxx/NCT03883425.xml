  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop frailty and complexity computation algorithms based on
      the French version of the interRAI-HC and, in doing so, to provide homecare nurses with valid
      and reliable screening tools for their routine practice. By relying on a prospective
      observational case-control longitudinal study, the study intends to assess the predictive
      validity of the proposed indices with respect to undesirable health outcomes. Repeated
      measurement occasions, separated by 6-month intervals, will also allow for estimation of
      intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. In the study, elders living in the
      community and aged 65 or older are the target population, and three samples will be
      considered based on the a priori risks of adverse outcomes (case 1: formal home service
      recipients; case 2: formal home care recipients; control: free of formal home care or
      service). These groups will be compared on the observed rates of frailty and complexity and
      on their evolution over time. Results will allow for identification of subgroups of the aged
      population for whom early screening of frailty and complexity appears most relevant. Based on
      the findings, practice guideline will be proposed. They will entail the interpretation of the
      scores and recommendations for mounting adapted preventive strategies. Finally, the study
      will contribute to enhancing knowledge on the relation between frailty, a well-known concept
      in gerontology, and complexity, a concept increasingly referred to in the care literature but
      that still deserves operational and consensual definitions.

    <ipd_description>Data and analytical codes will be shared in the form of computerized data files in SPSS format (*.sav, *.sps). Variable specification are written in SPSS syntaxes (*.sps files). Syntaxes define for each variable (raw or recoded) its short name, its type (date, string, numerical), its label, its response values and labels, the values associated with missing data and the measurement scale. Whenever relevant, the syntax is annotated, providing, for example, the reference of the published guideline for recoding. All variable specifications are summarized in a codebook (generated by SPSS), which is completed by specifications on the data collection procedure and on the sources used as references for recoding. The dataset is free of individual personal information (named, dated of birth, addresses, etc.); unique numerical codes are used to identify participants.</ipd_description>
