  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a pulmonary vascular disease that seriously endangers human
      health. It has the characteristics of high morbidity, high mortality, high misdiagnosis rate
      and low detection rate. The mortality rate in March is about 10%. The high-risk and high-risk
      PE mortality rate is greater than 15%. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
      is a serious sequelae after PE, with a poor prognosis and expensive treatment. Systemic
      thrombolysis is the preferred treatment for acute high-risk pulmonary embolism, which can
      reduce mortality, but the incidence of major bleeding is increased by 5 times and hemorrhagic
      stroke is increased by 10 times. Recent studies have concluded that interventional therapy is
      a viable approach with a high success rate, effective improvement of clinical outcomes, and
      minimization of major bleeding risks. However, there is no good prospective study of
      interventional therapy compared with systemic thrombolytic therapy. This study was enrolled
      in the diagnosis of high-risk and high-risk PE patients, randomized to the system of
      thrombolytic therapy or interventional therapy (including pulmonary artery catheter contact
      thrombolysis, catheter thrombectomy, thrombus aspiration and mechanical thrombectomy, etc.)
      Symptoms improved during surgery, right heart condition, mortality and complications, and
      were followed up to December to observe PE recurrence CETPH, survival and cardiopulmonary
      function. In order to provide new evidence for the treatment of fatal pulmonary embolism.
