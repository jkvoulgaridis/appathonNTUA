  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In nonmetastatic local advanced breast cancer patients, we are going to investigate whether
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection can reflect the tumor response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NCT) and detect minimal residual disease after surgery.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide, and chemotherapy is
      still the main method of breast cancer treatment. And for locally advanced breast cancer
      patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can further improve treatment efficacy, improve prognosis
      and increase the rate of breast conserving surgery. The persistence of a minimal residual
      disease at distant sites after the treatment of a localized breast cancer is a key parameter
      for posttreatment survival but cannot be reliably assessed by the current biological or
      radiological tools. Therefore, the prediction of the chemotherapy efficacy is very important.
      ctDNA, corresponds to fragmented DNA released into the blood stream by tumor masses, the
      detection and quantification of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a very promising tool that
      can assess tumor burden, response to therapy, and minimal residual disease. In this study, we
      wil collect breast cancer cases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, draw blood and
      evaluate the efficacy each time before chemotherapy and after surgery, then measure the
      concentration of ctDNA in each sample. We will also analyze the demographic data,basic
      treatment and follow-up data including relapse, metastasis and survival.
