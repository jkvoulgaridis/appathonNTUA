  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a hypnotherapy treatment program for
      functional dyspepsia that can be self-administered using on-line audio recordings. This is a
      non-randomized study. All patients will receive 7 sessions of hypnotherapy treatment
      administered over a 12-week period.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the
      self-administered hypnotherapy program. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of
      the treatment on participant reported symptom severity, quality of life, anxiety and
      depression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a very common health problem characterized by epigastric pain
      and/or postprandial fullness with no evidence of structural disease to explain the symptoms.
      There are few effective treatment options for FD, with medications having limited efficacy
      for the condition.

      The goal of the current study is to test a 7-session hypnotherapy treatment specifically
      targeting symptoms of functional dyspepsia. The intervention will be provided via the
      Internet with pre-recorded audio files. In this trial, 23 adults diagnosed with functional
      dyspepsia in accordance with the Rome IV criteria will be included. Patients will meet with a
      licensed health psychologist for an initial study visit to determine their eligibility for
      hypnotherapy treatment. Following this screening visit, patients will receive an email with
      information for accessing the password-protected online platform where they will complete
      pre-treatment assessment forms and access treatment materials. Participants will complete
      baseline questionnaire data prior to beginning the hypnotherapy sessions and follow-up
      questionnaires at mid-treatment (6 weeks), post-treatment (12 weeks) and 3 months
      post-treatment. Participants will complete a new hypnotherapy session every 2 weeks over the
      course of 3 months and utilize a shorter, practice session 5 times per week.

      The primary aim of the study is to assess feasibility and acceptability of the online
      treatment program by assessing the percentage of patients who log in to the web interface,
      utilize the materials sufficiently, complete the 12 week program, and report at least average
      satisfaction with the treatment. The secondary aim is to determine treatment effectiveness by
      measuring changes in pre- to post- treatment scores on a self-report functional dyspepsia
      symptom severity index (Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity Index;
      PAGI-SYM). Additional endpoints include changes in pre- to post- treatment scores on a
      measure of disease-specific quality of life and psychological indices.

    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction will be assessed with a single item at the end of treatment asking how satisfied they were overall with their assigned treatment (on a 7-point scale from &quot;Extremely dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;Extremely satisfied&quot;)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Web Platform</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of treatment, patients will be asked an open-ended question to obtain feedback on their experience using the web-based platform for treatment (&quot;Please describe any difficulties you had using the web interface and/or suggestions on ways we could improve the website&quot;).</description>

    <measure>The Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) will be used to assess changes in Functional Dyspepsia Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAGI-SYM is a 20-item self-report measure of functional dyspepsia symptom severity. The scale consists of 6 subscales (heartburn/regurgitation, nausea/vomiting, postprandial fullness/early satiety, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain). Each item is measured by a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (none or absent) to 5 (very severe). Subscale scores are calculated by averaging across items comprising the subscale with higher score representing more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The Short Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI-SF) will be used to assess changes in quality of life related to functional dyspepsia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI-SF is a 10-item self-report disease specific quality of life questionnaire. The scale consists of 5 sub-scales (tension/anxiety, interference with daily activities, disruption to regular eating/drinking, knowledge towards/control over disease, interference with work/study). Each item is measured by a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not applicable) to 4 (extremely). Individual items are aggregated to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater impairment in quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Visceral Anxiety Index (VSI) will be used to assess changes in gastrointestinal specific anxiety.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VSI is a 15-item self-report questionnaire with responses ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 6 (strongly disagree). The VSI is reverse scored (i.e., 1-6 becomes 5- 0) and totaled to yield a range of scores from 0 (no anxiety) to 75 (severe anxiety).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) will be used to assess changes in psychological distress.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BSI is an 18-item self-report questionnaire with responses on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not bothered by a symptom at all) to 4 (extremely bothered). Three subscales are calculated (somatization, depression, and anxiety) and the subscales can be aggregated to calculate an overall global psychological distress score. The overall score and subscale scores are converted to T-scores with higher T-scores indicating more psychological distress and T-scores ≥63 indicating clinically significant psychological distress.</description>
