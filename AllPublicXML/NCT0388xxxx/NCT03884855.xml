  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation is based on physical activity which, usually, associates combination
      of a cycle ergometer or treadmill completed by gymnastics.

      Some studies have been done with complementary physical activities such as tai chi or yoga
      integrated into the strategy of non-drug therapies. The tai chi study showed a tendency to
      improve the peak of VO2 in the tai chi group but which was not significant but also a
      significant improvement on secondary objectives such as quality of life, the increase in the
      6-minute walk test and a decrease in the level of natriuretic peptides. A study of the
      effects of yoga after coronary artery bypass surgery showed at one year an improvement of the
      ejection fraction, the lipid profile and the state of anxiety of the patients. This study
      showed that the addition of yoga to conventional cardiac rehabilitation could improve
      cardiovascular risk factors especially in patients with abnormalities such as low HDL.

      The physical activities offered in rehabilitation to improve physical performance are
      currently limited to cycling, treadmill or gymnastics. Many patients do not like cycling or
      treadmill, which limits their adherence to a cardiac rehabilitation program. Moreover, one of
      the main problems of rehabilitation is that after the rehabilitation cycle, a minority of
      patients continue the physical activity. Strategies for implementing home exercises have been
      tested to increase the level of physical activity after rehabilitation.

      Cardiac rehabilitation has several components: correction of risk factors, optimization of
      treatment, physical activity to improve the physical abilities to exertion that are directly
      correlated to mortality.

      Our hypothesis is that the implementation of a program of physical activity based on
      traditional karate would improve the physical abilities to effort and the quality of life of
      patients, to give a better psychological confidence to patients who, after a cardiovascular
      event such as acute coronary syndrome, bypass surgery or valvular surgery, have marked
      anxiety or depression. Rehabilitation, and especially physical activity, is one of the
      therapeutic means proposed. The interest of this study would be to be able to offer an
      additional activity for rehabilitation centers, to offer patients an activity in
      post-rehabilitation. In addition, interaction between patients could increase adherence to
      rehabilitation.

    <description>The following questions refer to patient's heart failure and how it may affect his life. This questionnaire quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS is a quantitative measure of distress along the 3 axes of depression, anxiety and stress. The scale will be completed at day 1. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = Did not apply to me at all, to 3 = Applied to me very much or most of the time). Sum the score of each item to get a total score. Higher scores indicate greater levels of distress.</description>
