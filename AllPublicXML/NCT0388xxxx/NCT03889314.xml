  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who previously were not able to tolerate being on a statin
      medication due to muscle-related side effects. Research has shown that many people who have
      muscle symptoms on statin therapy do not experience the same side effects if they try it
      again later. This study is part of a larger effort to:

        -  See how common it is for patients to still be intolerant of statin medication after
           trying it a second time; and

        -  For those patients who do tolerate being on a statin after trying it a second time, see
           how common it is for them to still be taking the statin 3 months after completing the
           main part of the study.

      Patients who agree to participate will be given a 5 month randomly allocated supply of statin
      and placebo and track their symptoms weekly.

      This study is a single center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial for patients
      eligible for statin therapy by current guidelines, but not on statin therapy due to a history
      of statin intolerance. Patients will be provided a &quot;DESIFOR&quot; kit which includes 5 randomly
      allocated 4-week blister packs of capsules containing either 20mg of rosuvastatin or placebo.
      While blinded to treatment, patients will document the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms
      every week using a numerical scale. The primary endpoint will be the difference between the
      mean musculoskeletal symptom score while randomized to statin therapy compared to the mean
      score while on placebo. After completion of the study, the results will be unblinded and
      reviewed at a 6 month follow-up visit with the patient and, for patients with symptoms found
      to not correlate with statin therapy, a trial of non-blinded statin therapy over the next 3
      months will be recommended. This study will serve as a pilot study to determine the
      feasibility and potential benefits of a larger multicenter trial with similar aims.
