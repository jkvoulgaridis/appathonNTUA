      This trial studies the risk of developing disorders associated with chronic opioid use
      post-surgery in patients with head and neck cancers. Clinical data collection may help
      doctors to learn how often and how likely disorders associated with the use of opioid pain
      medication may occur in patients with head and neck cancer who are having surgery as part of
      their treatment plan.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess prevalence of chronic opioid use and severity of symptom burden (M. D. Anderson
      Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck [MDASI-HN]) in patients undergoing surgery of head/neck
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the extent of association of chronic opioid use with risk of opioid use
      disorder (as assessed by Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain[SOAPP-14] and
      Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty and Eye Opener [CAGE] scores) and psychosocial factors (as assessed
      by MDASI).

      II. To assess frequency of positive risk of opioid use disorder as assessed by Screener and
      Opioid Assessment for Patients tool (SOAPP-14) and CAGE-adapted to include drugs (AID).

      III. Assess frequency of aberrant opioid use behaviors. IV. Assess frequency of
      post-operative complications.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires and quality of life assessments over 10-15 minutes at
      pre-surgery, after-surgery, at discharge, within 2-3 weeks after surgery, and within 90 days
      after surgery.
