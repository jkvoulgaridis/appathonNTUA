  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Despite a large and growing disease burden in osteoarthritis (OA), many
      pharmaceutical companies have abandoned OA drug development. This is mainly due to the lack
      of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patients that can benefit from a
      specific therapy. Different phenotypes of OA may benefit from different types of treatment.
      Therefore, novel markers to identify selected phenotypes of osteoarthritis may encourage drug
      development.

      Objective: To prospectively describe in detail pre-identified progressing phenotypes of
      patients with knee OA by use of conventional and novel clinical, imaging, and biochemical
      (bio)markers, and to validate and refine a predictive model for these (and new) progressing
      phenotypes based on these markers.

      Study design: APPROACH is an exploratory, European, five-centre, 2-year prospective
      follow-up, cohort study, with extensive measurements. In this study patients are treated
      according to regular care by their own physician with no study related treatment prescribed.
      Study related diagnostic and/or monitoring procedures are applied to the patients.

      Study population: Patients with tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis, according to the clinical
      ACR classification criteria, pre-identified based on demographic (e.g. age), clinical (e.g.
      Pain NRS) and tissue structure (e.g. radiographic joint space width) parameters.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Joint tissue structure based on radiographs, MRI, and
      biochemical (bio)markers as well as symptoms (pain, function) and quality of life by
      questionnaires.

      Secondary parameters: A multitude of (novel and conventional) clinical, imaging, and
      biochemical parameters related to osteoarthritis.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The participants will not have any direct benefit from their participation in
      this study other than that their OA is maximally diagnosed and followed in detail for up to 2
      years (screening, baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will stay in the hospital for 4-5 hours per visit (for screening about 30 min) for
      physical examination, blood draw, MRI scans, radiographs of knees and hands (only at baseline
      and 24 months), CT scan of the knee (only at baseline and 24 months), low radiation whole
      body CT scan (only at baseline and 24 months), HandScan (only at baseline and 24 months),
      motion analysis, and performance based tests. They will be asked to fill out questionnaires
      about knee, hand and hip osteoarthritis, and about general health and pain. The patient
      council in the consortium indicated that the load is acceptable. The patient council will be
      involved in the execution of the study. The assumed risk is minimal for an individual patient
      and minimal compared to the contribution to the development of knowledge of their disease.
      These risks include minimal events due to blood sampling itself (such as hematoma or
      localized bleeding), radiation exposure by radiographic imaging techniques (with a minimal
      increased healthcare risk), and exposure to MRI techniques (without known risks and without
      use of contrast agents).
