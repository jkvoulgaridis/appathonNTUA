      This research study is evaluating the effectiveness of video and web-based communication in
      clinical research compared to standard practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that many clinical trial participants are confused about clinical trials.
      Common participant misunderstandings include the idea of randomization, benefits to
      participants' health, the proven nature of the study intervention, and failure to recognize
      the primary purpose of the trial. There can sometimes be unintended miscommunication between
      the study doctor and/or nursing staff and participants. Thus, there is a clear need to
      identify ways to improve communication during clinical trials. The investigator's current
      culture of web-based information presentation, whether it takes the form of PowerPoint
      presentations, videos, websites, or audio tools, suggests that adding such technology to the
      cancer research realm may improve a participant's clinical trial experience and possibly
      improve participant understanding and safety while enrolled on a clinical trial. Video and
      web-based tools in cancer research have the potential to transform clinical trial practice.

    <description>Participants will be administered a brief questionnaire that asks questions about participant internet access, use, and understanding (Appendix B). This questionnaire will be used to determine eligibility.
In randomized into the Virtual Education Cohort:A video based, personalized web page will be created that has information related to the participants therapeutic clinical trial.
This web page will have videos of a research nurse explaining how to take study medication(s), how to fill out the study drug diary, and a description of the main side effects associated with the study drugs.

Participants randomized to the control cohort will follow standard of care procedures involving clinic visits that do not include the use of video or access to a personalized web page.
Participants from both groups will be asked to complete two surveys before each Day 1 clinic visit for Cycles 1-7.</description>
