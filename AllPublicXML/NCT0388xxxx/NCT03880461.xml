  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile health (mhealth)
      intervention to help overweight and obese women achieve appropriate gestational weight gain
      (GWG) for their pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). The goal of the intervention is to help
      women achieve GWG within the range recommended by the Institute of Medicine. The
      investigators propose an adaptive intervention that begins with an effective, yet low
      resource-intensive treatment and then provides incremental support and resources only to
      patients who need them. The intervention includes: 1) an mHealth tools allowing data to be
      automatically transmitted to a mobile website; 2) personalized text messages; and 3)
      personalized 1:1 telephone coaching sessions. The latter more intensive components are
      reserved for patients whose GWG is not within the IOM guidelines. The lifestyle intervention
      will be delivered through 1 telephone counseling session with a study dietician trained in
      motivational interviewing techniques, as well as through technology-based tools, automated
      text messages and weekly e-mails of core lifestyle intervention sessions. Personalized text
      messages and 1:1 telephone coaching sessions will be given to those who are not meeting the
      GWG guidelines. The lifestyle intervention will be compared to usual medical care. Maternal
      outcomes will be assessed shortly before delivery and at 6 weeks postpartum. Infant
      birthweight and weight at one year will also be assessed.

    <time_frame>Between 12 weeks and 33 weeks of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess change in moderate to vigorous physical activity between study assessments in pregnancy. The sports and exercise domain encompasses 10 PPAQ activities of moderate intensity (ranging 3.2 MET to 6 MET) and 2 PPAQ activities of vigorous intensity (6.5 MET and 7 MET). The volumes of all activities in the sports and exercise domain will be summed to arrive at an estimate of overall volume of moderate to vigorous intensity sports and exercise activity, expressed in MET hours per week. Higher levels of activity are generally associated with better outcomes. The distributions of all physical activity variables will be assessed for outliers.</description>
