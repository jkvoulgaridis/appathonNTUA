    <textblock>
      This study compared the effects of dynamic oscillatory stretch technique (DOS) and static
      stretching (SS) technique in order to improve hamstring extensibility in healthy individuals
      with asymptomatic hamstring tightness. Half of study participants received DOS whereas other
      half received static stretching technique.

      This was a single blind randomized control trial conducted at District Head Quarter teaching
      hospital Sargodha, Sargodha institute of health sciences Sargodha, Sadiq hospital Sargodha
      (march 2018-June 2018). Sample size of 83 individuals was calculated through Open Epi tool
      version 3 with 95 % confidence interval (CI), and power 80%. 83 individuals were screened out
      on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals of this selected population
      were randomly allocated as 42 individuals in Dynamic Oscillatory Stretch(DOS) group and 41
      individuals in Static Stretching(SS) group by sealed envelope method.

      After the application of hot pack treatment of 7-10 minutes to both groups dynamic
      oscillatory stretch technique (30 repetitions each of 2 seconds stretch duration in one
      session) was applied to DOS group and SS stretching (2 repetitions each of 30 seconds in one
      session) was applied to SS group.

      Assessment was done at baseline, immediate post-intervention levels (immediately) and
      post-intervention level after 1 hour. At baseline and immediately post-intervention level
      there was no dropout but after 1 hour post-intervention level there were two dropouts from
      DOS group and 1 dropout from SS group. 40 individuals were analyzed in each DOS and SS group.
      Data analysis was done through Statistical Package of Social Sciences(SPSS) version 20.
      Normality of different variables was assessed. Shapiro-Wilk test provided the basis for
      normality distribution of data.

    <measure>Active Straight Leg Raise Test(ASLR) Immediate effect</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline Active Straight Leg Raise Test(ASLR) was conducted with the participants in supine lying with both lower limbs initially extended. Then patient actively lifted the leg to be tested at hip joint while stabilizing the leg opposite to that of the testing side by using a stabilization belt. Knee on testing side was essentially sustained in full extension throughout the full testing range. Universal goniometer was used to measure range of motion available at hip joint.
Cut off score for the SLR to indicate hamstring tightness is 80 degrees. Therefore, values of SLR below 80 degrees was considered as hamstring tightness. Assessment was done Immediate after giving intervention(10 minutes).</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from Baseline Active knee extension test (AKE), is used to assess hamstring length. It was performed while the participant was in supine lying and involved leg was in 90 degree hip flexion. then participant was asked to extend the knee. For hamstring tightness cut off score AKE angle is 160째. Therefore normal individuals with angle &lt; 160째 were considered as individuals with hamstring tightness.Its reliability is 0.94.Assessment was done Immediate after giving intervention(10 minutes).</description>

    <description>Changes from Baseline Sit and reach test (SRT) is most commonly employed test to measure hamstring flexibility. This tool is used to measure range of hamstring muscle at knee joint.Each participant was instructed to sits on a couch in long sitting position. participants were seated with elongated legs, with hip flexed to 90 degrees and knees were fully extended and the ankles were in relaxed plantar flexion. A measuring ruler/tape was placed,between the feet with 38 cm score was marked tangent to the sole of the feet. Subjects were asked to reach forward with hands one above the other and palms of the hands facing down, while attempting to touch fingertips to toes or as far beyond on measuring tape while keeping the knees straight. Assessment was done Immediate after giving intervention(10 minutes).</description>
