  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, which occurs when insulin is
      inadequate or the body's produced insulin cannot be used effectively, but according to the
      World Health Organization 2016 Global Report on Diabetes, it is an important public health
      problem that is one of the four priority non-infectious diseases. In addition to high
      mortality rates caused by diabetes-related complications, it is known that it can cause low
      quality of life and many additional problems in individuals. These complications and damage,
      which may be caused by diabetes, may result in reduced blood flow combined with neuropathy;
      As a result, foot ulcers, infections and consequently the need for amputation may increase.
      In addition to the additional complications caused by diabetic neuropathy, protective plantar
      sensory loss and decreased joint position have been reported in the literature. In
      particular, investigators did not find any comprehensive studies examining the relationship
      between these sensory changes and the dual task performance in diabetic subjects. In this
      study, investigators aimed to investigate the relationship between joint position sense,
      plantar sensation, balance and dual task performance in individuals with type 2 diabetes and
      to contribute to the literature with evidence-based, objective results.

      The aim of this study is to investigate that the relationships between joint position
      sensation, plantar sensation, balance and dual task performance in type 2 diabetic patients.

      First of all, a general evaluation form including demographic information and physical
      characteristics of the individuals who voluntarily agree to participate in the study and
      approve the informed consent form, will be filled. Then, with the first findings to be
      obtained, determination of sample size was planned. Bilateral ankle joint position sensation
      with goniometer, bilateral knee joint position sensation with an analog inclinometer
      (BASELINE® Bubble inclinometer-USA), plantar sensation with Semmens-Wenstein monofilaments,
      equilibrium with Prokin Isokinetic Balance System, dual task performance will be evaluated
      with adding motor and cognitive secondary tasks to the Time Up and Go Test and single leg
      balance tests.

    <measure>The Evaluation of Ankle Joint Position Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, individuals are placed in the supine position with their eyes closed for prevent visual cues; measurements are performed with the plex of the goniometer, 1.5 cm below the lateral malleol, the fixed arm parallel to the long axis of the fibula and the movable arm parallel to the long axis of the 5th metatarsal. Desired target angles were defined as 10 ° dorsi flexion, 10 ° plantar flexion and 20 ° plantar flexion. Individuals are instructed to focus on the position of the ankle joints in space for 5 s by bringing the feet in neutral position to the target position by the researcher. This procedure is repeated 3 times and the patient is expected to learn this position. The target angle is then asked to repeat in the testing phase. The measurement is repeated 3 times for each target angle. As a result criterion; By recording the absolute value of the deviation amounts from the target angles; The averages of the deviations during the 3 repetitions are averaged.</description>

    <measure>The Evaluation of Knee Joint Position Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>1month</time_frame>
    <description>Bilateral knee joint position sensation will be evaluated in the literature with an analogue inclinometer(BASELINE®),which is a valid and reliable method for measuring joint position sensations.Measurements were planned to made in the sitting position,with the eyes of the individual closed and the joint to be evaluated bare,without any socks or shoes worn,fixing the inclinometer with a strap to the lower leg perpendicular to the knee flexion axis.In this measurement,the knees of the participants are passively shifted from the initial(90°flexion)position to the 30°flexion position,at this point 5 sec is waited and after they are told to keep this angle in mind,the starting position is returned.This procedure is repeated 3 times and the patient is expected to learn this position.After the individuals are rested for 5 s,they are asked to actively perform the target angle again.The same procedure was planned to be repeated 3times for each angle at 45° and 60°knee flexion target angles.</description>

    <measure>The Evaluation of Plantar Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>1month</time_frame>
    <description>In the plantar sensory evaluation of the participants, Semmes-Wenstein Monofilament, which is frequently used in the literature and to be a reliable method in the diagnosis of neuropathy, was aimed to be tested by touching 7 regions on the foot base .
In this evaluation, the individual is in the supine position, the physiotherapist is at the foot end of the patient; monofilament should be applied 90⁰ to the surface.
The filament thickness which is the first feeling of the individual is recorded by being asked whether the individual is feeling. The 3 most commonly used monofilaments for patients with diabetic neuropathy are 4.17, 5.07 and 6.10 monofilaments. The highest monofilament value is the hardest and most difficult bending monofilament.</description>

    <time_frame>1month</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate double task performances, it is planned to evaluate 1 dynamic and 1 static 2 different performances, including Time Up and Go Test (TUG) and single leg standing time. For each performance; the single task, the motor second task and cognitive seconder tasks separately, and again for each application to be performed in such a way that two trials, the average time was planned to record. Motor and cognitive tasks for each test are planned as described below.
Motor Task (TUG): Carrying cup full of water on tray.
