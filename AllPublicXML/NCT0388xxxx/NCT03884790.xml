    <textblock>
      Multi-center, international, prospective, open-label, single-arm, first-in-human clinical
      investigation. The Patients enrolled in this clinical investigation will undergo a scheduled
      surgery for the treatment of long bone defects up to 6 cm using GreenBone Implant. After the
      surgery, the Patients will be monitored at pre-scheduled visits up to 12 months. Adverse
      events, pain, quality of life and functional parameters, as well as X-ray and CT scan, will
      be evaluated at scheduled follow-up visits. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board
      (DSMB) will review the safety reports at regular intervals and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)
      as soon as reported, to protect Patients participating in the study. The initial phase of the
      study contemplates the treatment of bone defects up to 3 cm. An adaptive interim analysis
      will be performed when the first 7 Patients will have completed the 6-month follow-up visit.
      The DSMB will review the results of the interim analysis with respect to the primary endpoint
      (safety), and provide one of the following recommendations to the Sponsor: a) to stop the
      study for unacceptable frequency and severity of adverse events or b) to continue the study
      up to 25 Patients recruited and to include at least 5 Patients with a longer bone defect (&gt; 3
      cm up to 6 cm).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pre-market multi-centre, international, open label, single-arm, study to evaluate
      the safety and performance of a Class III medical device (GreenBone Implant) for the
      treatment of long bone defect. Bone defects can result from malformation, high-energy
      traumatic events, bone resection due to different pathologies such as tumors or infections,
      or from the treatment of complex non-unions. Current treatment of bone defects usually
      implies the use of bone grafts and/or biocompatible materials, to create a scaffold that
      bridges the defect. Autograft and Allograft are the treatments most currently used for large
      bone loss, but both treatments have significant disadvantages. These types of treatment carry
      the risk of transferring disease from animals and/or humans to the patient; there is also a
      risk of host local allergic reaction. Bone substitutes are devoid of the above risks and
      therefore they could be used alternatively to xenografts and allografts. GreenBone is a
      ceramic resorbable bone scaffold that has very similar structure to bone. It can be produced
      in large quantities, shaped easily and sterilised without losing its properties.
      Consequently, it is an ideal substitute that could be used to fill bone defects. This study
      will assess the safety of using GreenBone treatment of long bone defects up to 6 cm. Moreover
      it will assess its capacity of promoting new bone formation. The investigators will recruit
      25 patients with long bone defect and instead of bovine xenograft we will use the GreenBone
      implant for the long bone reconstruction. Patients will be followed up for 12 months in
      total.

    <description>Evaluation of the bone regeneration in the area of intervention in comparison to baseline (V1), by means of X-ray and/or CT scan examination, on visits V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 and V8. X-ray scoring systems have been implemented according to the criteria proposed by modified Lane and Sandhu Radiological Scoring System (Lane 1987). This scoring system evaluates bone formation, union and remodeling. To evaluate the bone formation, there is a scale with 5 points, from 0 to 4 (0=No evidence of bone formation-4=Bone formation occupying 100% of defect). To evaluate bone union and remodelling, there is a scale with 3 points, from 0 to 2 (0=Non-union-2=Radiographic union).</description>

Scores range from 0-100. Lower score=more disability, higher scores=less disability.

    <description>Current treatment of bone defects usually implies the use of bone grafts and/or biocompatible materials, to create a scaffold that bridges the defect, favoring the migration of cells from the neighboring tissues to fill the gap. Autograft and Allograft are the treatments most currently used for large bone loss, but both treatments have significant disadvantages. Different types of synthetic materials have been tested for repair of long bone gaps.
However, at the moment, there is not any bone substitute with the ideal/desirable osteoinductive, osteoconductive and mechanical properties. GreenBone Implant is a synthetic, acellular, reabsorbable, new generation bone graft, being suitable for surgical reconstruction of bone defects.</description>
