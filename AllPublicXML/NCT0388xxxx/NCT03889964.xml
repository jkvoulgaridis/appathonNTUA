      In this study, cardiopulmonary exercise will be assessed to characterize the relevance of
      severity of COPD and coexisting cardiovascular comorbidities for exercise capacity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the interpretation of dyspnoea
      also needs to consider coexisting cardiovascular disease. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
      (CPET) is used to characterize pulmonary and cardiac function and limitations during
      exercise. The investigators hypothesise that cardiopulmonary exercise is reduced in COPD
      patients with coexisting cardiovascular disease as well as in more symptomatic patients and
      in patients with frequent exacerbations. For this purpose, 100 patients with with stable COPD
      are characterized by clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, lung function,
      electrocardiography, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
