      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label phase II study evaluating the safety,
      anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant Dupixent given prior to radical
      prostatectomy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (this trial will enroll men
      with at least high risk prostate cancer defined by NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2017 = clinical
      stage ≥T3a or PSA &gt;20 ng/mL or Gleason score ≥8).

      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient Urology clinic. Men will be treated with
      dupilumab 600 mg subcutaneously (SQ) on day 1, and then 300 mg SQ on days 8,15, 22, 29, 36,
      43. They will then undergo surgery on day 57. 14 days after the last dose of Dupixent,
      prostate glands will be harvested at the time of radical prostatectomy, and prostate tissue
      will be examined for the secondary endpoints.

      Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30 days and 60 days after surgery.
      Patients will then be followed by their urologists according to standard institutional
      practices, but will require PSA evaluations every 3 (±1) months during year 1 and every 6
      (±2) months during years 2-3.

Degree of TAM infiltration will be analyzed using immunohistochemical staining for CD206.
