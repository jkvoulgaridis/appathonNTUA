  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 0/1 study of MS patients to determine the safety and potential efficacy of a
      novel, small human peptide designated as JM-4. The study will involve treatment for 5-7 days
      with JM-4 to determine the effects of Gadolinium(+) lesion number and volume in the brains of
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first study of JM-4 in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and is intended to
      show safety and potential efficacy in changing the size and/or number of GAD(+) lesions in
      the brain. The initial dose level of 1 mg/kg/ will establish safety of JM-4 treatment after
      5-7 days of treatment via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily in3-5 patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis. MRI examinations will be conducted prior to treatment with JM-4 and 8
      days after the initiation of treatment for the purpose of quantitating GAD(+) brain lesions.
      Once initial safety is established, the next group of 3-5 patients will receive 4 mg/kg/ of
      JM-4 daily for 5-7 days via 30 minute intravenous infusions, with MRI scans conducted prior
      to treatment and 8 days after the initial dose of JM-4. Once safety is established in this
      cohort of patients, a third group of patients may receive 9 mg/kg/ of JM-4 daily for 5-7 days
      via 30 minute infusions, with MRI scans conducted prior to the initial treatment and 8 days
      after the initial treatment.
