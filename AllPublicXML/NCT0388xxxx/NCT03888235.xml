  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60 participants with low back pain will be examined to determine the direction and extent of
      sacroiliac malrotation. If malrotation exists, they will be randomized to 3 treatment groups:
      1 will be taught how to use their thigh to push the ASIS backwards for an anterior
      malrotation and their sartorius and rectus femoris to pull their ASIS and AIIS forward for a
      posterior malrotation. 2: will be given a pelvic stabilization belt. 3: will return in one
      month. At the second visit at one month all participants will be treated with both exercise
      and belt. They will be reassessed at the third visit one month later: the scores for
      immediate and delayed treatment groups will be compared. Their response to these exercises
      and/or the pelvic belt will be tested at the first second and third visits, using the brief
      pain inventory pain and the Oswestry disability scores, filled out at every contact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants with low back pain will answer a questionnaire to eliminate lumbar or
      hip pathology, ankylosing spondylitis or major leg length discrepancy as cause. If they state
      they do not have these, they will be given an appointment to be assessed to eliminate the
      presence of these conditions and to determine if they suffer from sacroiliac malrotation. To
      this effect, they will be examined leaning on a counter with their their body horizontal to
      tilt the pelvis forward and lower the sacrum and their legs vertical to push the innominate
      bones upwards via the hip joints, to expose the posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs).
      Pressure below the PSISs will be used to assess their inferior limits which will be marked
      and their levels assessed using a carpenter's level. If there is tenderness under the higher
      PSIS, the ilium is malrotated anteriorly on the sacrum. If the area under the lower PSIS is
      tender, the ilium is malrotated posteriorly on the sacrum.

      Anterior malrotation is corrected by placing the foot on the malrotated side on a chair seat,
      flexing the other knee to touch the seat edge and pulling with both hands up on the seat
      while leaning back, to drive the thigh against the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), thus
      pushing it backwards.

      Posterior malrotation, is corrected by lying supine, thigh on the posterior side extended. On
      the anterior side knee flexed and foot on the assistant's sternum as he/she leans forward.
      This stabilizes and can correct an anterior malrotation if the chair exercise is too
      strenuous. Downward pressure on the sartorius and rectus femoris just above the knee causes
      the ASIS and the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) to be pulled on, rotating the ilium
      anteriorly.

      Each position is held for 2 minutes, with up to 2 repetitions as needed. Participants are
      then randomized into three groups: group 1 is taught how to assess the direction of the
      malrotation how to perform the appropriate exercise. At home, the procedure is repeated as
      needed for pain relief. Group 2 are given a pelvic stabilization belt and taught how to apply
      it as malrotation occurs as a result of pelvic instability. The belt is used for activities
      known to cause back pain. Group 3 are instructed to continue their usual treatment and given
      an appointment to return one month later to receive instruction for the exercise and given
      the belt At 1 month all are reassessed. Group 1: use and effectiveness of the exercises is
      recorded and they are given the belt. Group 2: use and effectiveness of the belt is recorded
      and they are taught how to examine and correct their sacroiliac joints. Group 3: use and
      effectiveness of their current treatment is recorded. They are then taught the examination
      and corresponding exercise and given the belt.

      At 2 months, all are reassessed.

      Data collected includes:

      at the first visit:Diagnoses associated with low back pain: lumbar spondylosis, hip
      arthritis, hypermobility, leg length discrepancy.

      At all visits:

      Brief pain inventory pain severity (BPI PS) and the Oswestry low-back disability scores (ODI)
      at intake, one month and two months visits. Together with the following:

      Use of pain medications alcohol and marijuana Use and effectiveness of other treatments for
      back pain relief Position of the malrotated sacroiliac joint or joints. Distance in
      centimetres between the levels of the PSISs before and after the corrective exercise. (Visits
      2 and 3 for all, visits 1, 2, 3 for group 1) Numeric rating scale pain score after the
      corrective exercise. Use of and satisfaction with the SI corrective exercise at first visit
      for group 1 and at the second and third visit for all.

      Use of and satisfaction with the pelvic belt at the first visit for group 2 and at the second
      and third visits for all.
