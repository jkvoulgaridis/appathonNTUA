  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between perineal body length and
      perineal laceration risk in primigravid patients.

      Primigravid women with singleton pregnancies in the first stage of labor at the 35th week of
      gestation were included in the study. The peineal body length of the patients was measured by
      the same physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After 35 weeks of gestation, nulliparous women with single gestation were included in the
      study and genital hiatus and perineal body measurements were taken.

      The presence and degree of perineal laceration after birth were determined. Correlation of
      genital hiatus and perineal body measurements with perineal laceration risk were evaluated.

      After birth, vaginal laceration, oxytocin use, fetal birth weight, the presence of episiotomy
      were recorded.
