  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth-leading cause of death. It is a
      progressive illness that requires life-long treatment.Promoting airway clearance (AC) using
      mucolytics together with airway clearance techniques (ACTs) form the basis for pulmonary
      therapy in COPD care.Therefore, new airway clearance modalities are required to decrease the
      detrimental effects of accumulated secretions in COPD.

      One of the devices used in AC is the high frequency chest wall oscillation (The Vest). HFCWO
      involves the use of an inflatable vest/jacket that covers the chest and is attached to an air
      pulse-generating compressor which rapidly inflates and deflates the vest, producing
      oscillations to the chest wall of 5-25 Hz.

      Another new airway clearance modality is oscillating positive expiratory pressure(Quake)
      which combines PEP therapy with high frequency oscillations.

      The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the extra thoracic oscillations via
      high frequency chest wall oscillation vest (HFCWO) versus the intra thoracic oscillations via
      oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) Quake device in COPD Group A: consists of 30
      patients will be treated by high frequency chest wall oscillation vest along with their
      prescribed medical treatment. This program will be performed 4 times per week for 6
      successive weeks.

      Group B: consists of 30 patients will be treated by vibratory PEP (The Quake) along with
      their prescribed medical treatment. This program will be performed 4 times per week for 6
      successive weeks.

    <description>it measure ventilatory functions.
Then the patients sat comfortably and upright while putting the nose clip and relax.
The patient was asked to inhale as deeply as possible, hold the breath, and then inserted the mouthpiece carefully into the mouth.
The patient held the mouthpiece tightly between the lips, and kept tongue down.
The patient was asked to exhale for as long as possible and blow for at least 6 seconds.</description>

    <measure>impulse oscillometry</measure>
    <time_frame>before and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient was in sitting position, Legs kept uncrossed The patient firmly supported his cheeks during measurement. The mouthpiece was at a comfortable height so that the neck is slightly extended and ensure that there is a tight seal between the mouthpiece and lips to prevent air leak.
The patient was instructed to perform normal tidal breathing in a relaxed state during the procedure.
The recording was performed for at least 30-45 s. During this period, around 120-150 sound impulses were pushed into the lungs from which the mean reactance and resistance values were determined at frequencies from 5 to 20 Hz.</description>
