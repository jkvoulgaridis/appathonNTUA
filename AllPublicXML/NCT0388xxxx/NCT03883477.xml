  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare recovery, scar, and patient satisfaction after
      retrograde endoscopic trigger finger release versus the standard open surgical treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients presenting with trigger finger interested in surgical release of the A1
      pulley will be randomized to treatment with endoscopic versus open surgical release of the A1
      pulley. Study measures will include scar assessment based on the Patient and Observer Scar
      Assessment Scale (POSAS) administered at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-operatively,
      overall satisfaction (scale of 1 to 10), days before return to work, duration of
      post-operative occupational therapy, pain medication use, operative time, and complication
      and recurrence rates.
