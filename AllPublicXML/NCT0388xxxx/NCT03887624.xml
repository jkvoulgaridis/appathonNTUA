  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ethosuximide in the treatment of refractory
      depressive disorder in adults. Half of participants will receive ethosuximide and
      escitalopram in combination, while the other half will receive a placebo and escitalopram.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ethosuximide is a inhibitor of low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channels(T-VSCCs). It has
      higher selectivity to T-VSCCs and can enter cerebrospinal fluid through the blood-brain
      barrier, inhibit T-VSCCs on the lateral habenular nucleus neurons, and then inhibit the
      cluster discharge of neurons, resulting in a rapid antidepressant effect.

    <masking_description>This study is a double-blind and double-simulation design. In the course of clinical study, all subjects, researchers and evaluators are blind to grouping information. The results of the study are audited by blind state data. The placebos are administered in capsules with no difference in appearance, color, weight or odor from the positive drugs. Both subjects and drugs are coded blindly.
In the study, the coding system for research drugs have an emergency blindness detection procedure, so as to quickly identify the drugs in emergency medical condition, without destroying the blind design of clinical research.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRS） score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Usual cutoff points are: 0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 20 to 34 - moderate depression, &gt;34 - severe depression.
Changes of MADRS score at therapeutic visit point compare with baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report(QIDS-SR） score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR is a psychological questionnaire used by clinicians to measure 16 factors across 9 different criterion domains for major depression. It is scored by summing the highest response in each of a set of questions relating to sleep, weight and psychomotor symptoms and then adding the remaining items. Scores range from 0 to 27 which may then be categorised as indicating none [0-5], mild [6-10], moderate [11-15], severe [16-20] and very severe [21-27] depressive symptoms.
Changes of QIDS-SR score at therapeutic visit point compare with baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale(HAMA） score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMA is a psychological questionnaire used by clinicians to rate the severity of a patient's anxiety. Scores range from 0 to 56. A score of 17 or less indicates mild anxiety severity. A score from 18 to 24 indicates mild to moderate anxiety severity. Lastly, a score of 25 to 30 indicates a moderate to severe anxiety severity.
Changes of HAMA score at therapeutic visit point compare with baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MADRS score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6.
Changes of individual score of MADRS at therapeutic visit point compare with baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Young manic rating scale(YMRS） score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is an eleven-item multiple choice diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of manic episodes in children and young adults. The scores from each question are added together to form a total score ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of symptoms. Extremely high scores increase the risk of the child having bipolar disorder by a factor of 9, while extremely low scores decrease the risk by a factor of 10. A score of 13 or higher indicates a potential case of mania or hypomania, while a score of 21 or above indicates a probable case. The average score for children with mania is 25, while the average score for children with hypomania is 20.
Changes of YMRS score at therapeutic visit point compare with baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficiency after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2 and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Efficiency means that the score of MADRS decreases by more than or equal to 50% compared with its baseline score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission rate after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2 and week 4</time_frame>
