    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies olaparib and temozolomide in treating patients with uterine
      leiomyosarcoma (LMS) that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) or
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA
      mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells
      can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving olaparib
      and temozolomide may work better than giving either drug alone in treating patients with LMS.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate whether combination treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) + olaparib shows
      preliminary evidence of clinical activity among patients with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma
      (LMS) as measured by the confirmed objective response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with the combination treatment. II. To
      evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) associated with the combination treatment.

      III. To evaluate what proportion of uterine LMS tumors exhibit homologous recombination (HR)
      deficiency as measured by (1) genomic alterations in HR components at baseline and (2)
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair protein RAD51 homolog (RAD51) foci formation at baseline
      and while on study treatment.

      IV. To evaluate the feasibility of these assays in human tissue, and to preliminarily
      evaluate for any association between presence of HR deficiency as measured by each assay and
      increased clinical benefit from the study treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate what proportion of uterine LMS tumors exhibit HR deficiency as measured by
      Schlafen family member number 11(SLFN11) protein expression at baseline.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of these assays in human tissue, and to preliminarily
      evaluate for any association between presence of HR deficiency as measured by this assay and
      increased clinical benefit from the study treatment.

      III. To evaluate MGMT protein expression in uterine LMS tumors, and to preliminarily evaluate
      for any association between MGMT expression and increased clinical benefit from the study
      treatment.

      IV. To perform an optional third tissue biopsy in patients who initially benefit from study
      treatment but later show early evidence of disease progression to evaluate for changes in the
      status of the RAD51 foci, MGMT, and SLFN11 assays at that time.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice per day (BID) and temozolomide PO once daily (QD)
      on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months until death or withdrawal of consent.

    <description>Will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria. A response rate of 10% is considered inactive and unworthy of further study. A response rate of 35% would be promising for further study among patients with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) treated with at least one prior systemic regimen. A response rate of 35% for the temozolomide (TMZ) + poly(adenosine diphosphate[ADP]-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) combination would also be suggestive of superior efficacy over TMZ monotherapy in sarcoma. Will be reported with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>Will be measured by genomic alterations in HR components at baseline and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair protein RAD51 homolog (RAD51) foci formation. The two integrated assays are genomics for alterations in HR genes and RAD51 foci formation. Both of these assays report binary results. The rate of response will be compared between binary variables using the Fisher's exact test. The log-rank test will be used to compare PFS between binary variables. Additional results from whole exome sequencing and ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on study samples will be reported in a descriptive fashion.</description>

          -  Patients must be able to swallow orally administered medication.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy &gt;= 16 weeks.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) will be eligible if
             they have a close caregiver or legally authorized representative (LAR) available to
             assist them.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the
             study, including undergoing treatment and attending scheduled visits and examinations.

          -  Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be enrolled on this
             study provided: (a) they are on a stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral
             therapy (HAART) with no medications otherwise prohibited by this protocol (e.g.
             drug-drug interactions) and (b) require no concurrent antibiotics or antifungals for
             the prevention of opportunistic infections and (c) have a CD4 count above 250 cell/mcL
             and an undetectable viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests
             within 1 month of initiation of study treatment. Other patients with clinically
             significant immunosuppression, e.g. organ transplant patients, are not eligible. If
             clarification is needed, this may be discussed with the medical monitor.

          -  Patients must be able to have temozolomide provided as a standard of care medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have had any previous treatment with any poly(adenosine
             diphosphate[ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including olaparib, or prior
             treatment with dacarbazine and/or temozolomide.

          -  Patients must have recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., may not have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1 or above baseline), excluding
             alopecia. Patients who have endocrinopathies associated with prior immunotherapy
             treatment but which are controlled with replacement therapy are eligible.

          -  Prior to initiating study treatment, at least 28 days must have elapsed from the last
             dose of systemic anti-cancer treatment (cytotoxic, biologic or immunotherapeutic) or
             radiation therapy (except for palliative radiation, in which case a 14-day washout
             applies).

          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment
             and must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery that occurred &gt; 2 weeks
             before starting study treatment.

          -  Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agent.

          -  Patients must not have been diagnosed with another malignancy unless curatively
             treated with no evidence of disease for &gt;= 5 years except: adequately treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal
             carcinoma in situ (DCIS), any other malignant condition considered indolent and
             unlikely to require active therapy.

          -  Patients must not have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
             bone marrow biopsy findings consistent with MDS and/or AML.

          -  Patients must not have active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal disease
             at the time of enrollment. Patients with a history of such disease previously treated
             with curative intent (such as with surgery or radiation) that have not progressed on
             subsequent imaging, have been clinically asymptomatic, and have not received systemic
             corticosteroids for at least 28 days, are eligible.

          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to olaparib or TMZ or any of the excipients
             of any study product.

          -  Patients must refrain from concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.,
             itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with
             ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or
             moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole,
             verapamil). The required washout period for strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors prior
             to starting olaparib is 2 weeks. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product.

          -  Patients must refrain from concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g.,
             phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine,
             carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g.,
             bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period for strong or moderate
             CYP3A inducers prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital
             and 3 weeks for other agents.

          -  Patients must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, or psychiatric illness
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with olaparib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this
             study.

          -  Patients must not have gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption
             of the study medication.

          -  Patients must not have had involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study.
