  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful transition to an adult diabetes clinic is an essential part of both clinical and
      psychosocial care for emerging adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Pediatric patients are
      generally very well supported by their parents, significant others, and multidisciplinary
      clinical care teams, however, these support networks tend to change once patients reach
      adulthood and are required to transition to a more independent clinical care model with their
      adult care providers. This change can often be an overwhelming adjustment with a potential
      impact on patient's clinical and psychosocial outcomes. As part of the proposed mixed methods
      study, in Phase 1, the investigators will develop online questionnaires for primary
      stakeholders in the transition process to improve understanding of their needs, expectations,
      and experiences around transition. Based on findings from Phase 1, up to 30 individuals from
      each of the six groups will be interviewed to discuss their responses and better understand
      their needs around the transition process (Phase 2). Subsequently, findings from the
      qualitative analyses of the semi-structured interviews will inform the preparation of
      recommendations that may help facilitate a successful transition for the various stakeholder
      groups (Phase 3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study has been designed to understand needs, expectations, and experiences of
      emerging adults, parents, and healthcare providers who have or currently are involved in the
      transition process in T1D. Although, a few previous studies have focused on exploring these
      aspects of the transition process, these have mostly been at a regional level focusing on a
      few clinics instead of an attempt to capture responses at a national level. Additionally, as
      part of this study, each responding stakeholder participant will be requested to invite other
      other stakeholder group members who they might know to complete the questionnaire (e.g. a T1D
      patient sharing study information with their parents and their endocrinologist). This would
      allow the investigators to get a comprehensive picture of the transition process. The study
      consists of three phases including an online questionnaire (specific to each stakeholder
      group) (Phase 1), semi-structured phone interviews with a few participants from each
      stakeholder participant group (Phase 2), and subsequently, developing recommendations for a
      transition process that aligns the needs and expectations of the various stakeholder groups
      (Phase 3).

      This project has the potential to highlight T1D patients', their families, and providers'
      concerns and expectations regarding the transition process from a national sample which,
      could help develop recommendations to implement a patient-centered, successful transition
      process for emerging adults with T1D.

      Specific aims:

      Phase 1: To explore needs, expectations, and experiences of emerging adults with T1D, their
      parents, and healthcare providers around the transition process.

      Phase 2: To conduct semi-structured interviews with participants from three stakeholder
      groups for in-depth understanding of the issues related to the transition process

      Phase 3: To develop recommendations for a patient-centered transition process for emerging
      adults with T1D
