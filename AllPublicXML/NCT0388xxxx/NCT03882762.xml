  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and
      tolerability profile of cebranopadol (GRT6005) in patients with varying degree of renal
      impairment and participants with normal renal function after an oral single dose
      administration.

      This study was a Phase 1, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, parallel group,
      single-dose study in up to 24 male and female patients with varying degree of renal
      impairment and participants with normal renal function.

      Within 14 days before the administration of cebranopadol the general eligibility of the
      participants for the study was assessed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined according to the Modification of
      Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

      A treatment period from Day -1 to Day 8 was performed, with participant confinement to the
      study site from Day -1 to Day 6 and an outpatient visit on Day 8. A single dose of
      cebranopadol 200 μg was administered on Day 1. Multiple blood and urine samples were drawn
      for pharmacokinetic evaluations and safety laboratory monitoring. Additional blood samples
      were taken prior investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration to assess serum
      creatinine concentration and protein binding.

      An End-of-Trial Visit was performed at the time, or within 7 days, of the final blood sample
      on Day 8 or at early withdrawal.

        Common criteria:

          -  Sign the informed consent form (ICF) and have the mental capability to understand it.

          -  Be male or female, aged 18 through 75 years.

          -  If female, have a negative result from a serum pregnancy test at screening and a
             negative result from a serum or urine pregnancy test on Day -1.

          -  If male, agree to use an effective method of contraception (i.e., condom plus
             diaphragm with spermicide or condom plus spermicide) and not have their partners
             become pregnant throughout the study, or have been sterilized for at least 1 year
             (with supporting documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate
             postvasectomy).

          -  If female of childbearing potential, agree to use an effective method of contraception
             (i.e., condom plus diaphragm with spermicide, condom plus spermicide, or nonhormonal
             intrauterine device) and not become pregnant throughout the study. Females who are at
             least 2-years postmenopausal (with supporting documentation from an
             obstetrician/gynecologist) or who have had tubal ligation or hysterectomy (with
             supporting documentation from the physician who performed the surgery) will not be
             considered to be of childbearing potential.

             allowable intra-subject variability based on the 2 determinations of eGFR at screening
             and Day -1 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation is +/- 30%.
             If eGFR falls in different categories at screening and on Day -1, the Day -1 eGFR will
             be used for assignment to the renal impaired group.

          -  If receiving concomitant medications to treat underlying diseases or medical
             conditions related to renal insufficiency, must be on stable dosages of these
             medications for at least 8 weeks before screening.

        Participants with Normal Renal Function:

        - Have an eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening and on Day -1. The
        maximum allowable intra-subject variability based on the 2 determinations of eGFR at
        screening and Day -1 using the MDRD equation is +/- 30 percent. If eGFR falls in different
        categories at screening and Day -1, the Day -1 eGFR will be used to assign participant to
        study group.
