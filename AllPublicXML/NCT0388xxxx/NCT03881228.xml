  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reduces the risk of tuberculosis in 60%. Young children
      are at higher risk of developing severe forms of TB, though this can be prevented with a full
      course of IPT. Preliminary data indicate that 60% of eligible children start IPT, and 30%
      complete it. Furthermore, children can be exposed to more than one case of TB in the
      household. Adults exposed to TB in the household setting are not necessarily aware of their
      risk. Uncertainties in the decisions of staff to prescribe IPT and limited health literacy
      among caretakers and families contribute to this. The investigators will determine the
      efficacy of an intervention package to increase IPT adherence and completion among children &lt;
      5 years old exposed to TB in the household. The investigators will assess the efficacy of the
      intervention by 1) measuring IPT completion at 6 months after treatment initiation and by 2)
      determining adherence to IPT by measuring isoniazid in urine at weeks 2, 8 and 24 in a random
      cluster sample of 10 health facilities and 20 control facilities with 10 children included in
      each facility (100 in intervention and 200 in control). The investigators will measure
      fidelity and reach, and acceptability among caretakers and health staff. The intervention
      package will consist of: 1) educational booklet for caretakers explaining why IPT needs to be
      given 2) a children's storybook, with weekly installments, over the 6-month course of IPT as
      a non-monetary incentive and 3) short messages services (SMS) reminders delivered to the
      caretaker for the weekly pick-up
