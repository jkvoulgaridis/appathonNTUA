  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if baseline levels of T cell associated
      biomarkers predict efficacy of abatacept during 24 weeks of treatment in patients with
      moderate to severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to
      conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs)
