  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are susceptible to postnatal growth restriction. Breast milk is the
      recommended source of nutrition for preterm infants. As preterm infants have enhanced
      nutritional requirements, multicomponent fortifiers are added to breast milk in order to
      establish adequate growth.

      Due to the various benefits of human milk feds to preterm infants, a human milk fortifier
      based on donor milk (Prolact+6 H2MF® Prolacta, City of Industry, California) has been
      developed. With this study, the investigators want to evaluate the effect of human milk
      fortification on weight gain in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW, &lt;1000g birth
      weight) in comparison to bovine fortification.

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are susceptible to postnatal growth restriction. Breast milk is the
      recommended source of nutrition for preterm infants. Many positive short-term health effects
      like prevention necrotizing enterocolitis , effects on gut development and immunological
      issues are associated with breast milk feedings.

      The composition of breast milk usually meets the nutritional demands of term infants. As
      preterm infants have enhanced nutritional requirements, multicomponent fortifiers are added
      to breast milk in order to establish adequate growth and proper neurodevelopmental outcome.

      Due to the various benefits of human milk feds to preterm infants, a human milk fortifier
      based on donor milk (Prolact+6 H2MF® Prolacta, City of Industry, California) has been
      developed. This human milk fortifier contains more energy and protein than bovine milk
      fortifiers. So far, accurate data on growth and weight gain under an exclusive diet with
      human milk and the human milk fortifier Prolact+6H2MF®are missing. With this study, the
      investigators want to evaluate the impact of a human milk based fortifier on weight gain in
      extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW, &lt;1000g birth weight) in comparison to bovine milk
      based fortifier.
