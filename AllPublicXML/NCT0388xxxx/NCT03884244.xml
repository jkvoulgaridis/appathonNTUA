  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The authors aimed to evaluate the effects of postoperative gum chewing on laparoscopic
      gynecological surgery, gastrointestinal function-intestinal mobility and early postoperative
      recovery. Patients undergoing elective gynecological laparoscopy were randomized. Demographic
      and characteristic features of the patients were recorded. Operation type, operation and
      anesthesia information were recorded. Patients underwent a postoperative routine regimen.
      Starting from the sixth hour, the sugar-free gum was crushed every 15 minutes until the gas
      was released. Postoperative follow-up was performed routinely. The first bowel movements,
      first bowel movements and first gas extraction and first decongestation periods were
      recorded.

      The team of the research team of the research team will listen and record the bowel sounds of
      the patients, using a stethoscope every two hours starting from the postoperative 3rd hour
      until the first bowel sounds are heard in each patient.

      Patients who were able to tolerate patients starting from the 8th hour after the surgery were
      allowed for mobilization. Also, they were allowed to take fluid regimen from the
      postoperative 12th hour. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by using visual analogue scale
      (VAS) on the day of discharge on chewing postoperative.

      The primary index for the return of GI functions was the first gas removal time. Secondary
      index was the time of first bowel sound, the first time of admission, hospitalization time
      and the presence of postoperative ileus.
