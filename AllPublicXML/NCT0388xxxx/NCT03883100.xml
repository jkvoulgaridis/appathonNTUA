  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HQP1351 in patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase (CML-AP) harboring T315I mutation. The efficacy of
      HQP1351 was determined by evaluating the subjects' major hematologic response (MaHR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of oral administrated of HQP1351(40mg, QOD) in CML-AP patients with T315I mutation in
      China. A total of 20 CML-AP patients will be included in this pivotal study. After screening,
      eligible subjects will receive oral HQP1351 40mg on a continues once every other day dosing
      regimen, until disease progression, drug intolerance, or meet other treatment conditions to
      discontinue the study. During the course of treatment, each subject will be assessed
      regularly for hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses. At the same time, safety
      information also will be evaluated.
