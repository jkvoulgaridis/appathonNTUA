    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study, that investigates men diagnosed with testicular
      cancer before and after treatment.

      The patients are included at their visit at the Fertility clinic in Horsens, where they
      deposit semen for cryopreservation prior to surgery and potential systemic treatment. Here
      the patients, who want to participate will perform a cognitive test and afterwards complete a
      questioner (T1). After 9 month the patients will be invited to perform the cognitive test and
      complete the questionnaire again (T2).
