  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, randomized phase 2 study.Patients with intermediate-risk and
      high-risk myelofibrosis were randomized via interactive voice/web response system 1:1 to
      receive either 100mg bid or 200 mg qd of oral Jaktinib Dihydrochloride Monohydrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Jaktinib Dihydrochloride Monohydrate is a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that demonstrated
      efficacy and safty in preclinical study and safty in a phase 1 in healthy volunteer.This
      phase 2, open-label, multicenter,randomized study evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral
      Jaktinib Dihydrochloride Monohydrate (100 mg bid or 200 mg qd) for the treatment of
      intermediate-risk and high-risk myelofibrosis.
