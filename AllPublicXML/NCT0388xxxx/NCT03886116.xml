  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of pre-operative exercise on hemodynamics in the
      fistula artery and vein, Pre and Post Arteriovenous Fistula Formation as well as the
      suitability of Cannulation of Arteriovenous Fistula at 12 weeks Post Surgery.

      This is a randomised control study with 20 patients each in the Control arm (Group A) or the
      Exercise arm (Group B). The subjects will be randomised into 1:1 into one of the two groups.

      The patients will have an ultrasound doppler vein mapping done prior surgery and the
      necessary follow up visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incident and prevalent population on renal replacement therapy for End Stage Renal
      Disease (ESRD) is steadily increasing in Singapore as well as other countries worldwide.
      Around 85 - 90% of the prevalent dialysis population is on Hemodialysis and Arteriovenous
      Fistula (AVF).

      AVF is considered the Gold standard for safe and effective vascular access for hemodialysis
      treatment due to its low rates of complication. However, Primary Failure rate of AVFs remain
      high at around 20 - 25% depending on the site of the surgery, contributed by several factors
      including the diameter of the artery and the vein used for AVF formation.

      If Pre-operative exercise improves the hemodynamics of the AVF and aids the maturation rate
      in our study, it can be incorporated into clinical guidelines to reduce the primary failure
      rate of AVF.

      Even though, there is sufficient evidence to support the beneficial role of the forearm
      exercises on fistula blood flow and maturation, there are no studies looking at the effects
      of Pre-Operative Exercise on AVF maturation. Our Study is aiming to fulfil this gap in
      knowledge.
