  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 500 total ankle prostheses are implanted each year in France. Wound healing issues are
      the most common complications after Total Ankle Arthroplasty (TAA). In 2010, a French
      retrospective study observed a wound infection rate of 8% among 592 prostheses implanted.
      Wound infection rate can vary up to 28% from the data available in the literature. Delayed
      wound healing is a known risk factor of surgical site infection (SSI). Even if it remains a
      rare event, its consequences for the patient can be severe and lead to removal and/or
      replacement of the prosthesis, arthrodesis, or transtibial amputation.

      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is an adjuvant therapy for wound management and
      healing: it delivers a controlled negative pressure (sub-atmospheric) applied topically onto
      the wound from a vacuum pump. The wound is filled with wound filler and sealed with an
      airtight adhesive drape. It allows creating a moist wound environment, removing exudate, and
      reducing edema and risk of infection.

      Incisional NPWT can accelerate wound healing regardless of the surgery performed, including
      orthopedics. A retrospective study compared the incidence of healing complications after TAA
      between the administration of the NPWT PICO™ (Smith&amp;Nephew) and the standard of care of
      postoperative wounds in 74 patients. A significant reduction of wound healing issues (3% vs.
      24%, respectively; p=0.004) and a non-significant reduction of SSI (3% vs. 8%, respectively)
      were observed.

      To the investigator knowledge, no randomized study has been conducted to assess the efficacy
      of the NPWT PICO™ for postoperative wound healing after TAA: Investigators propose to set up
      this study to obtain a high level of evidence in this population and investigators assume
      that the use of the PICO™ system after TAA would reduce delayed wound healing compared to the
      standard of care with conventional dressings.
