      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ixazomib administered
      intravenously in combination with multiagent reinduction chemotherapy in pediatric
      participants with relapsed/refractory ALL or LLy.

      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to determine
      the MTD or RP2D of intravenous ixazomib when administered in combination with multiagent
      chemotherapy (reinduction therapy) in pediatric participants with relapsed or refractory ALL
      or relapsed/refractory LLy.

      The study will enroll approximately 18 participants. Doses of ixazomib will be escalated
      according to a standard 3+3 dose escalation schema. Participants aged &gt;= 1 year will receive
      the starting dose of 1.0 mg/m^2 and participants aged &lt;1 year will receive the starting dose
      of 0.03 mg/kg. Ixazomib will be administered in combination with multiagent reinduction
      therapy. The dose escalation phase will determine the MTD and/or RP2D of ixazomib. Dose
      escalation will be based on the observed safety and tolerability data.

      Participants aged &lt;1 year will be assessed separately and will not contribute to the dose
      escalation assessment.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Spain. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will be followed up to Day
      60 after the first dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>DLT: Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity after first dose of ixazomib and is probably/definitely attributable to the ixazomib treatment regimen, with exceptions, example fever/infection with/without hospitalization, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms, hypofibrinogenemia, metabolic/laboratory abnormalities that resolve to less than or equal to(&lt;=)Grade 2 within 7 days. Any Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity after first dose of ixazomib that is possibly/probably/definitely attributable to the ixazomib treatment regimen and results in omission of subsequent dose of chemotherapy, with exception of fever/infection. Hematologic toxicities: Failure to recover a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥0.5*10^9 per liter (/L) and a platelet count ≥50*10^9/L due to documented bone marrow hypoplasia (cellularity &lt;10 20%) within 42 days after the beginning of systemic chemotherapy without evidence of active disease by bone marrow evaluation or active infection.</description>
