  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Demographic changes in the industrialized world are expected to prompt a need for better
      organized and more efficient health care services. In order to curb costs, health care
      providers in many countries are searching for viable alternatives to hospitalizations.
      Norwegian white papers and reform documents presume that the municipalities will play a
      central role in meeting the growth in demand for health services. Central public policy
      documents and national research strategies highlight that we need pathways characterized by
      good quality and safe care, and which are responsive to needs, based on user involvement,
      continuity of care and successful collaboration within and between service levels. The 2012
      Coordination Reform placed new responsibilities on municipalities in the delivery of primary
      health care services and on hospitals as deliverers of specialist services, as well as on the
      integration and collaboration between the two organizational levels. This reform mandates
      that all 428 Norwegian municipalities are obliged to establish or co-operate on establishing
      Municipal Acute Wards (MAW) (In Norwegian: Kommunale akutte døgnplasser), so as to alleviate
      pressure on hospitals. However, the research basis for these units is relatively weak. Hence,
      there is little information on the outcomes regarding the quality, cost-effectiveness,
      patient-reported as well as personnel-reported outcomes of this new level of care.

      This study aims at assessing the outcome of admissions to MAWs compared to a general hospital
      for patients in need of acute care, that can be treated at a lower and decentralized level of
      health care, with potentially less resources than traditional hospitalizations. The study
      will use a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design. It builds on previous research and
      systematic reviews, and aims to assess several outcomes, including health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL), patient experiences, cost-effectiveness, short-term mortality and morbidity,
      and draws on linkages to national registers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No other randomized, controlled studies have been conducted to compare healthcare services as
      offered in MAWs to those offered in hospital. The study will undertake an economic evaluation
      and study other outcomes of an intervention, using an RCT design, which is a strong study
      design. The study also includes measures of HRQoL and patient experiences. The project is
      interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral, and it represents research in, about and with support
      from the municipalities, which is a prioritized area of research, together with health
      services research, for the owners of the Østfold Hospital Trust, Helse Sør-Øst (HSØ). The
      project incorporates users in the planning of the project, which may contribute better
      acceptance of and a successful completion of the project. This proposal addresses key aspects
      of the CR and other national strategic documents. The CR has mandated the establishment of
      MAWs all over Norway as of 2016, without any strong scientific documentation of
      cost-effectiveness. The study builds on data from previous research, stating that there is a
      need for more solid documentation about new levels of acute hospital care. The proposed study
      will assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and several aspects of quality of care and
      will contribute useful information for evaluation and future planning of MAWs, as an
      alternative to hospitalization. Therefore the researchers think this project is timely. The
      MAWs in Østfold County are small to medium-sized and are expected to be representative for
      the majority of MAWs in Norway, and therefore of broad national interest. These outputs will
      be important for authorities, politicians, healthcare leaders, and professionals as well as
      researchers involved in developing, implementing and refining decentralized acute health care
      services as an alternative to hospitalization- to the best of the patients. Moreover, the
      project outputs will be of international interest, in particular in countries with national
      health insurance with broad coverage, as in the Nordic countries, the UK, Canada and
      Australia.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study will be change in HRQoL from inclusion to 4 weeks, as assessed with the EQ-5D Index utility measure.This questionnaire can be self-reported, administered by an interviewer, or by telephone.
The EQ5D3L consist of the EQ5D descriptive system that measures health-related quality of life in five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Responses are scored according to three levels: 0=no problems, 1=some problems and 3=severe problems. The score can be used as a descriptive system or as an overall EQ-5D-3L index score by assigning weights to each level of each dimension according to the Europe VAS value set. The higher the score, the lesser self- perceived health related quality of life.</description>
