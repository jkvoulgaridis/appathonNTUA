  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to assess safety and tolerability of intramuscular administration of
      two different doses of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) for treatment of
      lower extremity injury complicated by compartment syndrome injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to assess safety and tolerability of a high and low dose of
      autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells. Secondary objectives include evaluation of
      potential responses of the BM-MNC therapy.

      This is a two-stage, randomized, unblinded, multicenter (two sites), controlled phase 1
      clinical trial to evaluate the safety of two different doses of intramuscular injections of
      autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells, commonly known as a type of stem cell. Acute
      compartment syndrome injury is a mixed soft tissue injury due to a trauma that causes edema
      leading to excessive pressure in the muscle compartment. This type of injury frequently
      results in permanent reduction in function and disability.

      A total of 18 participants that have undergone a fasciotomy for treatment of a lower leg
      compartment syndrome will be enrolled with 6 assigned to the control (observational) group, 6
      to the low cell-dose group and 6 to the high cell-dose group. The treatment arm will receive
      a single dose (high or low) of autologous BM-MNCs 5 - 9 days post injury and fasciotomy and a
      minimum of 3 months of standard of care physical rehabilitation. An observational control arm
      will not receive cells post fasciotomy but will undergo a standard of care course of physical
      therapy and will be followed for comparison to assess early safety signals and potential
      benefit.
