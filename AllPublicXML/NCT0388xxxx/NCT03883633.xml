      Prospective study on patients enrolled in the ReCODE treatment protocol
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine if the ReCODE treatment has a measurable impact on
      the typical progression of neurocognitive decline observed in patients with Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) and patients who are exhibiting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is often a
      precursor to an AD diagnosis. For this study, there will be no distinction made between
      participants who have been diagnosed with AD and those who show signs of MCI.

          -  Adults of any gender, race or ethnicity

          -  Subjects must have cognitive impairment as demonstrated by a combination of AQ-21 over
             5 and either a MOCA 26 or below or a CNS Vitals screening assessment in the MCI in the
             bottom 70th percentile or 2 of the subtests in the bottom 50th percentile.

          -  Proficient in spoken and written English for consenting as well as for study
             participation.

          -  Willing and able to follow the protocol if the treating physician determines that is
             required for appropriate patient care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled major medical illness, seizures, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular
             instability.

             tumor.

          -  Experienced Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) that is severe enough that it has an ongoing
             impact on patient function on a regular basis.

          -  Lack of support (either family member or caregiver) to assist with following the
             treatment protocol.

          -  Active cancer, cancer within the past five years or any history of breast cancer.

             Body Disease, Frontotemporal Disease, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, Korsakoff's
             Syndrome).

          -  Diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease as the primary cause of cognitive impairment.

          -  Previous treatment or experience with ReCODE.
