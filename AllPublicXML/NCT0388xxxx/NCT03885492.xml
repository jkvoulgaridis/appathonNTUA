      To examine the usability, safety and acceptability of the BabySaver kit: a novel device for
      neonatal resuscitation in a low-income region in Africa
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BabySaver kit will be used for any delivery in which the baby requires resuscitation
      according to the hospital policy, national guidelines(Ministry of Health, 2016) and WHO
      policy(World Health Organization, 2014)

      The target sample size for observation will be 30 babies requiring resuscitation at Mbale
      Regional Referral Hospital Delivery suite.

      The researchers will observe midwives and mothers during the process of resuscitation. This
      will be a non-participant observation. The researchers will collect data on: demographics,
      the timing of cord clamping, time to establish ventilation, intervention provided on the kit,
      post-resuscitation temperature, need to move the baby to provide extra care, and notes of the
      ease of use or challenges experienced with the kit. The researchers will ask health workers
      for their views of the usability of the kit in comparison to the equipment in current use.

      The researchers have developed a usability checklist to assess how health workers are using
      the BabySaver kit.

        The BabySaver kit will be used for any delivery in which the baby requires resuscitation
        according to the hospital policy, national guidelines(Ministry of Health, 2016) and WHO
        policy(World Health Organization, 2014). These include

          -  Deliveries before 37 weeks of gestation

          -  Deliveries with evidence of fetal distress from fetal monitoring

          -  Instrumental deliveries

          -  Deliveries in which there is a possibility of a life-threatening malformation

          -  Deliveries in which meconium stained liquor has been noted.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  As this is the first delivery suite to use the kit in a clinical setting, we will
             include only low-risk babies in this study. Every low-risk birth that will need
             neonatal resuscitation will be selected and observations made for the use of the
             BabySaver resuscitation kit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  High risk deliveries will be excluded, namely

               -  babies born before 34 weeks' gestation,

               -  babies with life threatening malformations or significant intrapartum asphyxia
