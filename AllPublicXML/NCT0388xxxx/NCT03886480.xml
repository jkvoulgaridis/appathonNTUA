  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of the SaeboVR rehabilitation system for
      improving functional outcomes related to upper extremity motor recovery in stroke survivors.

      The specific objectives are:

        1. To explore the participants' level of performance and satisfaction with their
           performance in self-identified problem areas of daily functioning following a 4-week
           intervention using the SaeboVR rehabilitation system.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention protocol that emphasizes task-specific and
           goal-oriented virtual practice, reflecting the participants' self-identified goal
           priorities.

      This study will employ a multiple single-subject pre-post experimental design, with multiple
      pre and post measures, to evaluate the potential efficacy of a virtual reality-based
      treatment using the SaeboVR rehabilitation system in stroke survivors. Comprehensive
      measurement during the baseline and post-treatment phases will be completed, with each
      individual to serve as their own control. Participants will make 3 separate visits to the
      laboratory (approximately 2 days apart) on the Bannatyne Campus at the University of Manitoba
      prior to the 4 week intervention and again after the intervention. The Arm Activity Measure
      (ArmA) and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) will be used both pre and
      post intervention as well as the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) to measure
      participants' performance on self-identified occupational performance issues and their level
      of satisfaction with their performance. Two participants will be recruited upon discharge
      from inpatient stroke rehabilitation at the Riverview Health Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, and
      upon entry into this study, will receive one-to-one treatment and supervision using the
      SaeboVR rehabilitation system for approximately 1 hour per session, 2 to 3 times per week for
      4-weeks.

    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a valid and responsive measure of occupational performance and has been widely used in stroke research. The COPM uses a semi-structured interview format where performance and satisfaction scores will be identified for the participants' self-identified occupational performance issues.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline upper extremity impairment to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) is a widely used measure of motor impairment post stroke and is comprised of 33 items related to upper extremity movement. The FMA-UE has excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliability as well as construct validity in persons with stroke.</description>

    <measure>Arm Activity Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline upper extremity function to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm Activity Measure (ArmA) is a self-report tool designed for use with upper extremity spasticity management interventions. The ArmA was chosen because it provides a comprehensive assessment at the activity level of both active and passive upper extremity function; it is comprised of an 8 item passive function subscale and a 13 item active function subscale. Both subscales have been found to have high internal consistency and test-retest reliability.</description>

    <description>Use of the SaeboVR rehabilitation system for approximately 1 hour, 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Each intervention session will consist of the participant engaging in a series of virtual occupations involving their affected upper extremity and will include a 5 minute warm up activity followed by 3, 15 minute sessions of virtual occupation practice separated by 2, 5 minute breaks. The virtual occupations will include: grocery shopping, grocery storage, breakfast preparation, pet shopping, pet feeding, pet bathing, garden planting, garden harvesting, dinner preparation, closet organizing, and soup kitchen volunteering.</description>
