  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy (benefits) of an investigational
      drug LB-100, for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. LB-100 has previously been
      administered to patients with various solid tumors. In this study, LB-100 will be
      administered as an intravenous infusion over 120 minutes. This study will be conducted in 2
      phases. In phase Ib, escalating doses of LB-100 will be administered to patients to study the
      safety and to determine a safe dose of LB-100. In phase 2, patients will be administered
      LB-100 at the dose that was found to be safe in phase Ib. The efficacy (benefits) and safety
      of LB-100 will be determined in this phase of the study.

               -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or total bilirubin ≤
                  3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range only in patients with well
                  documented Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis or who required regular blood
                  transfusions

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (AST) and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3.0 x ULN

          3. Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          4. Documented diagnosis of MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) by World Health
             Organization (WHO) criteria that require treatment due to cytopenias and meet the
             International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) criteria for low or int-1 risk.

          5. For non-del(5q) patients, failed prior treatment with at least 2 cycles started of
             azacitidine or decitabine or lenalidomide defined as no response to treatment, loss of
             response at any time point while on treatment or within 6 months of treatment
             discontinuation, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy.

          6. For del(5q) patients, failed prior treatment with at least 2 cycles started of
             lenalidomide defined as no response to treatment, loss of response at any time point,

             cervix) may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis.

          4. Use of chemotherapeutic agents or experimental agents (agents that are not
             commercially available) for the treatment of MDS within 14 days of the first day of

          5. No concurrent use of erythroid stimulating agents, Granulocyte-colony stimulating
             factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is allowed
             during study except in cases of febrile neutropenia where G-CSF can be used for short
             term. Growth factors must be stopped two weeks prior to study.

          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LB-100 has not been studied in
             pregnant subjects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events
             in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LB-100, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LB-100.
