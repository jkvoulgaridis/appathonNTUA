  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of drug coated balloon (DCB)
      treatments on esophageal stricture.

      Up to 30 subjects are planned to be enrolled and treated with the study device at up to 5
      clinical sites outside of US. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment to one year and
      then annually for up to 5 years. The annual follow up after the first year is optional.

             infarction, severe pulmonary disease, bleeding diathesis, large thoracic aneurysm,
             recent laparotomy, pharyngeal or cervical deformity, etc.

         21. Currently participation in another pre-market drug or medical device clinical study.
