      Detrusor overactivity is defined as a urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary
      detrusor contractions during the filling phase that may be spontaneous or provoked. Detrusor
      overactivity is subdivided into idiopathic detrusor overactivity and neurogenic detrusor
      overactivity The International Continence Society (ICS) defines OAB as the presence of
      &quot;urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency
      urinary incontinence, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Neurogenic detrusor
      overactivity (NDO) can result in lower and upper urinary tract complications and eventually
      even in end-stage kidney failure. Since the driving force of this clinical cascade is high
      bladder pressure, controlling intravesical pressure in NDO patients improves both quality of
      life and life-expectancy in these patients. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) has proven its efficacy
      in reducing intravesical pressure and in reducing incontinence episodes. BTX-A also improves
      quality of life in patients with NDO. Both onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®, Allergan, Irvine, USA)
      and abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®, Ipsen, Paris, France) have a level A recommendation for
      NDO-treatment. The recommended dose for intradetrusor injections in NDO patients is 200 U of
      onabotulinumtoxinA or 500 U of abobotulinumtoxinA. The drug is generally administered
      extratrigonal in the detrusor muscle, via cystoscopic guided injection at 20 sites in 1 mL
      injections. Intradetrusor BTX-A injections are safe, with mostly local complications such as
      urinary tract infection and high post-void residual or retention. The effect of the toxin
      lasts for approximately 9 months. Repeat injections can be performed without loss of
      efficacy. Different injection techniques, novel ways of BTX-A administration, eliminating the
      need for injection or new BTX-A types with better/longer response rates could change the
      field in the future. Botulinum toxins are neurotoxins produced by the facultative anaerobe
      Clostridium botulinum that block the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic gap of the
      neuromuscular junction. Their injection near the nerves that supply the target organ
      selectively and temporarily paralyzes the organ. In particular, the subtype botulinum-A toxin
      is widely used in neurology to release spastic dystonia in adults. and children. In urologic
      disorders, botulinum-A toxin reliably diminishes external sphincter or detrusor overactivity.
