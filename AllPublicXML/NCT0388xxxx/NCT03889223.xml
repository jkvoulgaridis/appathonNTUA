  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prosperous neuraxial anesthesia positioning ensures a raised chance of successful needle
      placement. The primary aim is to compare &quot;Sitting Cross-legged Fetal Position -SCF&quot; with
      &quot;Lateral Decubitus Fetal Position-LDF&quot; anatomically via sonography.

      Secondary aim is to compare their comfort.

      Fifty participants were included to this prospective, randomized, consecutive controlled
      clinical study. Six parameters were evaluated in each position; subcutaneous tissue (ST),
      skin to spinous process (S-SP), transverse diameters of bilateral paraspinal muscles (left
      paraspinal muscle [LPM] and right paraspinal muscle [RPM]), interspinous gap opening (ISGO),
      mean of bilateral paraspinal muscles (MPM). The change of every measurement recorded via
      ultrasonography (USG) according to the positioning techniques were also calculated. The
      calculations are explained briefly in primary outcomes (including the change of SCF-LDF in
      ST, S-SP, LPM, RPM, MPM, ISGO). Stretcher comfort (SC), position comfort (PC), lumbar comfort
      (LC), and abdominal comfort (AC) were evaluated by the participants with the 7-point
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).

    <intervention_model_description>Systematic randomization was made from 150 volunteers, and 50 participants were chosen. All 50 participants were planned to sit on the stretcher in both of the two positioning techniques sequentially (one after another). The two positioning techniques are SCF and LDF. The investigator was planned to record all of the participants' anatomical measurements in both of those positioning techniques evaluated via ultrasonography. After each position participants were planned to evaluate each positioning technique's comfort by 7-point numerical rating scale from minimum
1 meaning &quot;very bad&quot; to maximum 7 meaning &quot;excellent.&quot;</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The ultrasonography was made by a consultant radiologist (M.D.) The consultant didn't know which position was for control and which was the one the study evaluates. Although investigators were trying to mask the outcomes assessor; the consultant saw the positions because there is no way to hide the sitting positions of the participants.</masking_description>
