  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers' mission is to promote healthier eating behavior and to reduce costs
      associated with healthcare. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of mailing
      randomly selected participants a letter promoting a plant-based diet. Depending on the
      experimental condition, participants may additionally receive a free documentary, Forks Over
      Knives, and they may also get letters which use commitment- or prevention-focused messages to
      encourage watching the documentary and changing their eating behavior. The researchers
      hypothesize that receiving the documentary will be associated with lower insurance claims and
      improved health outcomes one and two years later. The researchers also hypothesize that using
      either commitment- or prevention-focused messages will also contribute to lower insurance
      claims and improved health outcomes compared to experimental conditions where materials did
      not include these messages. This study will help the researchers design evidence-supported
      programs that can improve people's health.

      Note that participant selection and assignment will be done at the level of the household,
      but analysis of outcomes will include individual-level analysis. This analytic decision was
      made because the researchers assume that the intervention may potentially affect other
      members of the household. While one person in a household will be selected for matching the
      eligibility criteria, the mailed materials will be addressed to all adult members of the
      household (defined as adults 18+ who are the spouse or child of the selected member) who are
      members of the Geisinger Health Plan. Outcome data will be pulled from all adult members of
      the household who have data through the Geisinger Health Plan.

      The researchers will analyze the data using standard survey research analyses methods,
      including computing bivariate correlations, using general linear models, using non-parametric
      models for non-normally distributed insurance data, and entering variables as independent
      predictors in regression models to attempt to predict desired outcomes. The researchers will
      also use multilevel models to account for household- and individual-level data. The analysis
      of primary outcomes will focus on data one year after the intervention begins. Follow-up
      analysis on secondary outcomes will be conducted two years after the intervention begins. The
      researchers will conduct separate analyses of the selected participant (i.e., the individual
      who met the eligibility criteria) and other members of that participant's household. This
      will test whether there are any spillover effects of the intervention to other people in the
      household.

      For clarity in this record, any discussion of sample size and participants refers to
      households, as this is the primary level for participant selection and assignment.

    <intervention_model_description>One group of participants will not be contacted at all (n = 6200). One group will only received a letter promoting a plant-based diet (n = 2200). Twelve groups (n = 550 for each group) will receive the letter promoting a plant-based diet, along with the Forks Over Knives documentary. The documentary will be delivered through 3 different methods, and the accompanying letter will contain 4 different combinations of behavioral nudges.
1 primary control group (no contact)
1 group contacted by letter
3 groups (documentary distribution: online link, DVD, online link + DVD) x 4 groups (behavioral nudges in the letter: no nudge, commitment nudge, prevention nudge, commitment and prevention nudges)
Note: The control group size is an estimate of number of participants who match the eligibility criteria but were not randomly assigned to an experimental group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will be mailed the documentary Forks Over Knives, which provides scientific arguments promoting a plant-based and whole foods diet. The behavioral effect of this documentary comes from watching the documentary and potentially choosing to order a free cookbook (participants are given this opportunity in the letter accompanying the documentary). The effect of the diet itself is not a central part of the intervention, as people can choose to adopt or not adopt any part of the diet.</description>

    <description>At the end of the letter promoting a plant-based diet, participants will be asked to write dates and personal signatures committing to watching the documentary. They will be asked to mail back this written commitment. Stating one's intentions to implement certain behavior is meant to increase the likelihood of follow-up behavior. This request might nudge more people to watch the documentary and make some behavioral changes to prevent negative health outcomes.</description>

    <description>As part of the letter promoting a plant-based diet, one paragraph will describe the risks of not taking action. This phrasing reframes the status quo as contributing to future loss (e.g., costs of medication and operations). In effect, the letter encourages participants to focus on preventing this loss by taking action. This additional text might nudge more people to watch the documentary and make some behavioral changes to prevent negative health outcomes.</description>
