  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a 3-week treatment with an oral melt in mouth
      medical device, made up with hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate and magnesium trisilicate,
      can lead to a reduction of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease symptoms and to an improvement of
      the integrity of esophageal mucosa in patients who are to experiencing esophagus symptoms.
      The study is a randomized, double-blind cross-over placebo controlled study. Every patient
      will get both the active study device during one study period and placebo during another
      another period.

    <measure>ReQuest Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ReQuest score for GERD symptoms severity evaluated through ReQuest Questionnaire. ReQuest is a self-assessed, dimension-orientated scale designed to evaluate the treatment response in patients suffering from erosive GERD. It assesses seven dimensions of GERD (acid complaints, upper abdominal/stomach complaints, lower abdominal/ digestive complaints, nausea, sleep disturbances, other complaints and general well-being). The intensity is measured on a 100-mm visual analogue scale and the frequency (except general well-being) on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to more than 10 times per day. It asks for the occurrence of symptom descriptions known to be typical of the corresponding dimension</description>
