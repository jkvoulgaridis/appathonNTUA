      High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has not been well evaluated for treating hypercapnia The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) can decrease
      hypercapnia and improve respiratory distress parameters in Emergency Department patients with
      acute hypercapnic respiratory failure related to cardiogenic pulmonary edema and to compare
      its efficacy to that of non invasive ventilation.

      This is a prospective observational study conducted as a preliminary study to the randomized
      controlled OPTICAP trial (NCT02874339).

      Prospective observational exploratory study including ED patients with a suspected diagnosis
      of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure related to cardiogenic pulmonary edema who require
      NIV according to the joint recommendations from the French society of anaesthesia and
      intensive care and the French society for intensive care.

      Patients will receive a 1hr treatment session by either NIV or HFNT, depending on the
      attending ED physician expertise in using HFNT Repeat evaluation of arterial blood gases and
      respiratory parameters and dyspnea will be performed before and after treatment sessions
      according to current guidelines.

      Improvement in PaCO2 and other respiratory parameters after 1hr treatment by HFNT will be
      analysed and compared to that of NIV.

Initial gas flow rate will be set at of 60 l/min and adjusted to 40-50 l/min based on patient's tolerance. FiO2 will be adjusted to maintain an SpO2 ≥ 92%. Initial temperature will be set at 37° and reduced according to patient's tolerance</description>

    <description>NIV will be delivered through a face mask connected to a dedicated ventilator with pressure support applied in a noninvasive ventilation mode (Monnal T75, Airliquide Medical Systems, Antony, France).
The Pressure-support level will be adjusted to obtain an expired tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg of predicted body weight and a respiratory rate of 25-30 b/min. PEEP (range 5-10 cm of water) and FiO2 will be adjusted to maintain an SpO2 ≥92% and to patient's comfort.</description>
