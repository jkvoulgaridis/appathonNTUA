  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical standard for treating traumatic burn injury scarring is to wait one year following
      the initial assault prior to beginning treatment. This study investigates the use of
      fractional ablative CO2 laser when begun within 3 months of a traumatic burn injury and it's
      impact on scar formation compared to the control. We hypothesized that early intervention
      would substantially mitigate the formation of scar tissue and help restore more normal
      appearing skin.

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The treatment and control areas were randomized in advanced such that the investigator did not choose which sections to treat. Control areas were covered during the treatment so the investigator/provider could only see areas to be treated. Outcomes assessors evaluated photographs without knowledge of the identity of each area. The participant could not be masked due the experience of receiving treatment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Manchester Scar Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of the first treatment prior to intervention and at 6 months following the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The sum total of the Manchester Scar Scale to assess the change in scar characteristics. The scale includes the following categories: Color, matte vs shiny, contour, distortion, and texture. Scales for color, contour, distortion, and texture are rated on a 1-4 scale with 1 being most normal and 4 being most abnormal. Matte vs shiny is rated on a 1 to 2 scale with 1 being matte and 2 being shiny. Assessments completed by blinded evaluators. A decrease in score indicates improvement in scar characteristics.</description>

    <measure>Changes in scar characteristics such as dermal and epidermal character as well as vascular structure and organization assessed through histology.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of the first treatment prior to intervention and at 6 months following the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Some patients elected to do optional biopsies for deeper evaluation of changes in skin structure. Biopsies were taken prior to treatment and 6 months following treatment to assess dermal and epidermal character as well as the size and organization of vasculature. Evaluation was done qualitatively.</description>

    <measure>Optical Coherence Tomography</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of the first treatment prior to intervention and at 6 months following the final treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Treatment Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment time was measured at each of the three treatments conducted on day 0, day 60, and day 120</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Post treatment response was assessed immediately post treatment at each of the three treatments conducted on day 0, day 60, and day 120</time_frame>
    <description>Cutaneous responses including purpura, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, blistering and scarring were assessed following each treatment. Areas were rated on a 1-4 scale where 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>
