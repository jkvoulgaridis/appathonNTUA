  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective non-interventional single-center study aimed to evaluate the influence of
      participation in international randomized controlled trials (RCT) of cardiovascular patients
      on their compliance and adherence to medicines' intake and regular visits to the doctor in
      comparison with those patients, who had never participated in RCT within the outpatient
      registry PROFILE (prospective, observational study).

    <time_frame>on enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The specially designed questionnaire for the study group includes 9 questions. Based on the data obtained, we will be able to draw conclusions about the motives for participating in RCTs, the level of trust towards a doctor, and adherence to treatment after the end of the RCT.
The questionnaire for the control group includes 8 questions with 3 possible answers as well. Based on the data obtained, we will determine the level of patient awareness of RCTs and the willingness to participate in the trial in the future. This questionnaire is exploratory, each question is considered individually, which allows us to make a more detailed analysis of various aspects of our study.</description>
