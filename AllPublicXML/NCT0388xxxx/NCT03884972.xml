      This phase I/Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of trabectedin and venetoclax in
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma that is
      resistant or intolerant to a BTK inhibitor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as trabectedin
      and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability, and to determine dose and schedule of trabectedin in
      combination with venetoclax in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) resistant or intolerant to a BTK inhibitor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the best response achieved by patients treated with combined trabectedin and
      venetoclax.

      II. To determine the progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated
      with combined trabectedin and venetoclax.

      III. To investigate the effects of trabectedin on CLL cells and on the components of the CLL
      microenvironment.

      IV. To investigate associations between baseline characteristics (including fluorescence in
      situ hybridization [FISH] status, IGHV mutation status and mutations responsible for
      resistance to BTK inhibitors) and response to the combination of trabectedin and venetoclax.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (BTK-REFRACTORY): Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning
      on day 1 for 5 weeks (cycle 1). Beginning in cycle 2, patients receive venetoclax PO QD and
      trabectedin intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1. Cycles 2+ repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II (BTK-INTOLERANT): Patients receive trabectedin IV over 3 hours on day 1 of a 3-week
      cycle (cycle 1), then receive venetoclax PO QD beginning on day 1 of a 5-week cycle (cycle
      2). Beginning in cycle 3, patients receive trabectedin IV over 3 hours on day 1 and
      venetoclax PO QD every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
