    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients who have completed the treatment period without premature
             discontinuation in the previous BI 655130 trial and are willing and able to continue
             treatment in the current trial

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be ready and able to use highly effective methods
             of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per
             year when used consistently and correctly. A list of contraception methods meeting
             these criteria is provided in Section 4.2.2.3 as well as in the patient information.
             Note: A woman is considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following
             menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent
             sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral
             oophorectomy. Tubal ligation is not a method of permanent sterilization. A
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
             medical cause.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent for the current trial 1368-0025, in
             accordance with ICH-GCP and local legislation prior to admission to the current trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any restricted medication, or any drugs considered by the investigator
             likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the study since the last visit of the
             previous BI 651330 trial and during the screening period for the current trial

          -  Severe, progressive, or uncontrolled hepatic disease, defined as &gt;3- fold Upper Limit
             of Normal (ULN) elevation in AST or ALT or alkaline phosphatase, or &gt;2- fold ULN
             elevation in total bilirubin.

          -  Patients with congestive heart disease, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Relevant chronic or acute infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
             viral hepatitis. A patient can be re-screened if the patient was treated and is cured
             from acute infection.

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered trial medication
             agent or its excipients.

          -  Any documented active or suspected malignancy at screening, except appropriately
             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in
             situ carcinoma of uterine cervix.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial.
             Women who stop nursing before the study drug administration do not need to be excluded
             from participating; they should refrain from breastfeeding up to 16 weeks after the
             study drug administration

          -  Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed since the
             last visit of previous BI 655130 trial or planned during the current trial, e.g. hip
             replacement, aneurysm removal, stomach ligation), as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Evidence of a current or previous disease, medical condition (including chronic
             alcohol or drug abuse or any condition) other than GPP, surgical procedure,
             psychiatric or social problems, medical examination finding (including vital signs and
             electrocardiogram [ECG]), or laboratory value at the screening outside the reference
             range that in the opinion of the investigator is clinically significant and would make
             the study participant unreliable to adhere to the protocol, comply with all study
             visits/procedures or to complete the trial, compromise the safety of the patient or
             compromise the quality of the data.
