    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well enasidenib works in treating in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia with an IDH2 gene mutation that has come back or has not responded to
      treatment. Enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. In this study we are investing if enasidenib can be used as
      maintenance therapy post salvage induction chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of IDH2 inhibition following conventional high dose salvage
      chemotherapy with detectable IDH2 mutations on event free survival (EFS) in patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of IDH2 inhibitor maintenance therapy following intensive salvage
      therapy: i.e., rate of hematocrit (HCT), duration of maintenance therapy and overall survival
      in patients with IDH2 mutant relapsed/refractory AML.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the changes in IDH2 mutational variant allelic frequency and deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) methylation signature while on enasidenib therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) 7-14 days after treatment.
      Within 30-100 days following the transplant, patients receive enasidenib QD. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients receive enasidenib PO QD. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then yearly for
      5 years.
