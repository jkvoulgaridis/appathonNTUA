  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase III study of PLX-PAD for CLI patients with minor tissue loss who are unsuitable for
      revascularization has been initiated (PLX-CLI-03, PACE study). In parallel, this expanded
      access program (EAP) will be conducted to allow the treatment of patients who are ineligible
      to be enrolled in the PACE study.

      The EAP treatment is administered in addition to standard of care of the subjects.PLX-PAD
      300×106 cells in a mixture containing 10% DMSO, 5% human serum albumin and Plasma-Lyte, will
      be administered via 30 IM injections (0.5 mL each) delivered into the leg twice,at 8 weeks
      interval. The locations of injections of the PLX-PAD are detailed in Appendix 1.

      Antihistamine treatment should be given at least 1 hour and no more than 1.5 hours prior to
      PLXPAD administration to ensure coverage for 24 hours, and as long as necessary post PLX-PAD
      treatment. Consider treatment with second generation H1 inhibitors such as Cetirizine 10 mg
      once per day.Subjects will be followed-up until 12 months after the 2nd treatment according
      to the schedule of routine medical visits at the medical institutions. In addition to this
      routine follow-up, a phone call will be made 12 months after 2nd treatment to inquire on the
      occurrence of subsequent intervention, amputation, or death.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male or female subjects between ages 45 to 99 years of age at the time of
             screening.

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of PAD due to atherosclerosis at the stage of CLI, with
             minor tissue loss up to the ankle level (ulcer/s and/or necrosis).

          3. Ankle pressure (AP)≤70 mmHg or toe pressure (TP)≤ 50 mmHg in the index leg or
             transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2)≤ 30 mmHg.

          4. Subject unsuitable for revascularization (by any method) in the index leg based on
             unfavorable risk-benefit assessment of the physician investigator. Unsuitability to
             revascularization should be based on any of the following:

               1. Anatomic considerations as: inappropriate target artery, diffuse/extensive tibial
                  and/or peroneal artery lesions, inadequate distal run-off.

               2. Technical considerations as: inappropriate bypass conduit, failed recent
                  revascularization.

               3. Medical considerations: subject's comorbidities.

          5. Signed informed consent form.
