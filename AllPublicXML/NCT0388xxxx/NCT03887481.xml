  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Language deficits are a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, and are the primary
      deficit in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a syndrome accounting for approximately 2/3
      fronto-temporal lobar dementia (FTLD) variants, and at least one Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      variant. Language deficits dramatically impair communication and quality of life for both
      patients and caregivers. PPA usually has an early onset (50-65 years of age), detrimentally
      affecting work and family life. There are no disease-modifying pharmacological agents for PPA
      and the only treatment available is a few sessions of compensatory speech-language therapy.
      In the first cycle of this award the investigators asked the question of whether language
      therapy effects could be augmented by electrical stimulation. The investigators conducted the
      largest to-date randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover, clinical trial to
      determine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in PPA. The
      investigators found that tDCS over the left inferior frontal gyrus (L_IFG), one of the major
      language hubs in the brain, significantly augments the effects of a written naming and
      spelling intervention. However, the investigators found great heterogeneity in the effects of
      tDCS. Surprisingly, patients with the largest tDCS effects in the therapy task and the
      largest generalization effects to other tasks were the non-fluent variant (nfvPPA) group,
      with an epicenter of atrophy in the L_IFG. Although the investigators showed that those who
      improved naming the most, after stimulation of subjects' L_IFG, were those who have atrophy
      there, a key question remains. What is the explanation: (1) the great plasticity of the L_IFG
      (as recently shown in post-stroke aphasia) or (2) a general principle of neuromodulation,
      i.e., stimulation is most effective over atrophied and compromised areas. The latter
      hypothesis is strengthened by the absence of correlation between atrophy and functional
      connectivity (FC), which was shown to be one of the mechanisms of tDCS effects, the other
      being changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

      Therefore, to address the above question, the investigators will stimulate another major area
      of atrophy in PPA, the parietal cortex. The anterior inferior parietal cortex, and in
      particular the left supramarginal gyrus (L_SMG), specialize in phonological processing,
      namely phonological verbal short-term memory (vSTM), i.e., the ability to temporarily store
      phonological (and graphemic) information in order. The domain of vSTM affects many language
      tasks (repetition, naming, syntax), which makes it an ideal treatment target and the L_SMG an
      ideal stimulation target, since generalization of tDCS effects to other language tasks is
      driven by the function (computation) of the stimulated area. The proposed research
      capitalizes on the investigators' extensive experience with tDCS in PPA (18 published and 7
      under review papers from the previous clinical trial) and will experimentally address the
      fundamental question of whether stimulation over atrophied and compromised cortex is most
      effective. By testing a fundamental principle of neuromodulation in a devastating
      neurodegenerative disorder, the investigators will significantly advance the field of
      neurorehabilitation in early-onset dementias.

      Aim 1: To determine whether vSTM treatment ('RAM', for 'Repeat After Me') combined with high
      definition (HD)-tDCS over the L_SMG will be more effective for patients with the local
      epicenter of atrophy there than for patients with frontal atrophy.

      Aim 2: To understand the mechanism of tDCS by measuring tDCS-induced changes in network FC
      and GABA over the L_SMG. The investigators will carry out resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (rsfMRI), (MPRAGE), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging
      (pCASL), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), before, after, and 3-months
      post-intervention.

      Aim 3: To identify neural, cognitive, physiological, clinical and demographic characteristics
      (biomarkers) that predict sham, tDCS, and tDCS vs. sham effects on vSTM and related language
      tasks in PPA. The investigators will evaluate neural (functional and structural connectivity,
      cortical volume, neuropeptides, and perfusion), cognitive (memory, attention, executive) and
      language functions, clinical (severity), and demographic (age, gender) characteristics, and
      the investigators will analyze the effects on vSTM and other language/cognitive outcomes
      immediately after intervention and at 3 months post-intervention.

      This proposal will extend the investigators' previous award, that provided the first evidence
      from a clinical trial (double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover), on the beneficial effects
      of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left inferior frontal gyrus
      (L_IFG) in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder
      affecting primarily language functions. The investigators' previous studies, although it
      established the augmentative effects of tDCS in PPA and shed light into its possible
      mechanisms, the investigators also revealed a fundamental gap in the investigators'
      knowledge, namely the effect of patient heterogeneity on tDCS effects; the individuals who
      improved the most had atrophy at the area of stimulation (i.e., epicenter of atrophy at the
      L_IFG). In this present Phase 1/Phase 2 study, the investigators will directly address this
      knowledge gap by stimulating another major area of atrophy in PPA, the parietal cortex, to
      optimize the tDCS effects in PPA, uncover the mechanisms, and estimate tDCS predictors.
