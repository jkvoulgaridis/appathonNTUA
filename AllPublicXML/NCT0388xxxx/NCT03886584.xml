    <textblock>
      the investigators will measure source-monitoring ability in patients with several
      neuropsychiatric condition and in healthy controls appaired in age, sex and educational
      level. Source-monitoring will be measured thanks to internal- and reality-monitoring
      informatic tasks.The investigators hypothesized patients with fronto-temporal abnormalities
      would show more marked deficits than patients with only frontal abnormalities.

    <textblock>
      Source-monitoring abilities will be measured thanks to reality-monitoring testing (i.e. the
      ability to distinguish internal-generated events from external ones) and internal-monitoring
      testing (i.e. the ability to distinguish an imagined source from a performed one). A
      source-monitoring deficit have been demonstrated in patients with psychiatric conditions such
      as schizophrenia and seems linked to frontotemporal abnormalities (frontotemporal
      dysconnectivity and temporal hypoactivity). With a total of 150 patients, the investigators
      will include 30 patients per group: patients with pre-dementia stage Alzheimer, Alzheimer,
      Fronto-Temporal dementia, Lewy Body dementia or Parkinson and Bipolar Disorder, with the
      hypothesis that Bipolar Disorder patients will present less marked deficit. The investigators
      will recruit 150 healthy controls.
