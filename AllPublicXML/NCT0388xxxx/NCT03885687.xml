  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test whether the individualized music-enhanced exercise playlist (Exercise
      with Music intervention) can prevent further physical and psychological deterioration and
      motivate ICU survivors to more actively participate in their rehabilitation.

    <measure>Acceptability of intervention as measured by a questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day five</time_frame>
    <description>A self-designed 8-item questionnaire is administered to assess subjects' feedback regarding the intervention. Five questions are likert-scale questions (strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree, strongly agree); three questions are yes or no questions. If the results of the questionnaire show that majority of patients answer &quot;agree or strongly agree&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, this would indicate that the intervention is acceptable. If the results of the questionnaire show that majority of the patients answer &quot;strongly disagree or disagree&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, this would indicate that the intervention is not acceptable.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants that complete the intervention as prescribed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Count of participants who exercise twice daily for five days (upper and lower extremity exercise). Each session includes five movements. The number of movements and sessions of the intervention delivered within and beyond the 5-day mandatory regimen will be documented.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants that complete the intervention beyond the 5-day mandatory sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>

    <measure>Changes in activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Activity will be monitored using an Actiwatch (Philips Respironics) placed on subjects' wrists at enrollment. The Actiwatch is a small, lightweight, limb-worn activity monitoring device. It contains an accelerometer that is capable of sensing any motion with minimal acceleration of 0.01g to measure long-term gross motor activity and intensity of motion.</description>
