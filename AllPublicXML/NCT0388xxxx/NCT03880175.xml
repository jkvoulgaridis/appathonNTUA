  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa has left millions of children orphaned. These
      children, who are potentially infected with HIV themselves, are highly vulnerable and face
      some serious risks to their health and overall well-being.

      A variety of health and economic interventions to help orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs)
      (and the households in which they live) are being carried out in Mozambique by World
      Education Inc./Bantwana (WEI/B), funded by USAID. The program is known in Portuguese as Força
      à Comunidade e Crianças or FCC (in English, &quot;Strengthening Family and Communities&quot;).

      This study will collect survey and administrative data to assess the impact of the FCC
      program on OVCs and the households in which they live. A baseline survey was administered to
      define a sample of households and individuals to follow over time through the upcoming
      follow-up survey and to measure baseline household characteristics.

      Follow-up data collection will begin in March 2019. It has several components:

        1. Household survey The follow-up survey will provide measurements of the rich set of
           intermediate and final outcomes for the estimation of treatment effects of the FCC
           program.

        2. Data collection on HIV testing and school attendance This study will supplement
           survey-reported HIV testing rates with an objective, administrative measure of HIV
           testing at health clinics. At the time of the follow-up survey, the survey team will
           recommend that eligible individuals in the household be tested for HIV at a specified
           local health clinic. To allow tracking of those who follow through with testing,
           consenting individuals will be given coupons redeemable for a small financial incentive
           once they have completed an HIV test.

           In addition to self-reported data on school participation by children, this study will
           also measure school participation directly. Both school enrollment (presence in school
           registration records) and school attendance (physical presence of children in school
           during unannounced school visits by research staff) will be measured. Project staff will
           visit schools in study communities to check attendance rates of specific school-aged
           children who were listed in the baseline survey in their community.

        3. Informational treatments aimed at raising HIV testing rates To allow insight into the
           mechanisms through which the FCC program has its effects, this study will provide
           additional simple treatments in the context of the follow-up survey to explore possible
           FCC mechanisms: stigma reduction, HIV/AIDS information, and HIV treatment
           (antiretroviral therapy, or ART) information.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Indicator for HIV testing coupon redemption at the household level</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days following the date coupons are distributed to a household.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a household-level binary variable. It takes value 1 if at least one of a household's coupons is redeemed, and 0 otherwise.
The researcher will distribute coupons at the household survey. A subject is eligible for a coupon if s/he is not reported HIV+ and has not had an HIV test within 3 months before the visit. A coupon for an adult will be distributed to themselves. A coupon for a child (age &lt;18) will be distributed to their primary guardian. Each coupon has a value of 50Mts (0.83 USD) and is valid for 14 days.
To redeem a coupon, a coupon holder must show up in the designated clinic and provide proof of testing dated within the coupon-validity window.
There is a unique barcode on each coupon to allow the researcher to track the use of each coupon. A coupon will be scanned when distributed and redeemed to link to a subject.
The analysis sample for this outcome of interest is all households that have received at least one coupon from the researcher.</description>

    <measure>Indicator for school attendance at the child-level</measure>
    <time_frame>The time when the research team is conducting the school visit, which lasts 4 to 8 hours in each school</time_frame>
    <description>This is an individual-level binary variable. It takes value 1 if a school-aged child (6 -17 years of age) is physically present at school on the date the research staff conducts an unannounced school visit; it takes the value of 0 otherwise.
The research team will make an unannounced school visit to check the attendance of all school-aged children in the study sample. All school-aged children will be checked regardless of his or her guardian-reported school attendance status. The study team will visit all public primary and secondary schools located in the study community. All unannounced visits will happen on regular school days. Each child will be checked in all neighboring schools. Each child will only be checked once in one school.
The analysis sample of this outcome of interest is all school-aged children living in the study households.</description>
