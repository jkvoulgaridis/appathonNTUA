  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies, people with inflammatory bowel disease reported that the disease had a
      large impact on the psychosocial aspects of eating and drinking, and a high proportion of
      people felt excluded from social interactions that involved eating and drinking (for example
      religious, family) and there was considerable uncertainty around how eating will affect bowel
      function together with feelings of reduced autonomy and high levels of stress and anxiety.
      These patient experiences may lead to reduced food related quality of life.

      This randomised control trial will examine the feasibility of using a web based intervention
      to improve the food related quality of life of people with inflammatory bowel disease. Fifty
      eligible participants will be randomised to receive either a 3-month website based
      intervention or usual care. The feasibility of study design, an estimate of the efficacy of
      the website intervention and patient experience of the intervention will be assessed after
      three months.

      Patients will be recruited from inflammatory bowel disease outpatient clinics at Guy's and St
      Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and Bart's Health NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.

      The intervention. The web based intervention has been developed based on the outcomes of a
      previous study. The website is partially populated with several pages which contain
      educational material designed for patients newly diagnosed (within the last 12 months) with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The education material provides information related to different
      problems, short video clips of patients talking about their problems and ways of managing it,
      or a patient and health care professional consultation in relation to a particular problem,
      as well as question and answer fact sheets. In order to make the intervention relevant and
      acceptable to patients and health care professionals, both these groups were actively
      involved at each stage of the intervention development. During the 3 month intervention
      patients will have free and unlimited access to the website. Use of the website during the
      intervention phase will be monitored by the researcher and weekly emails will be sent to
      participants who do not engage in the intervention. Monthly emails will be sent to all
      intervention group patients to encourage engagement with the intervention.

      Usual care. The patients randomised to usual care will have access to all usual care,
      including scheduled appointments and nurse-led telephone helpful. They will not have access
      to the intervention website.

    <measure>Change in food-related quality of life score as measured using validated questionnaire FR-QoL-29</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using validated questionnaire Food-Related Quality of Life (FR-QOL), consisting of 29 questions. Each question is answered on a 5 point Likert scale. The sum of which is the overall score. The minimum score is 29 (low food related quality of life) and maximum 145 (high food related quality of life). A score of less than 90 suggests poor food related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in United Kingdom inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using validated questionnaire the United Kingdom inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (UK-IBDQ). This is a global disease specific quality of life questionnaire composed of 32 questions which are scored on a 4 point scale. Minimum score is 32 which indicates very poor quality of life and maximum score is 128 which is optimal quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disease activity index as measured using validated questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using validated disease specific questionnaires Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) if patient has Crohn's disease. This questionnaire contains five questions. If the patient has ulcerative colitis the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) questionnaire will be used. It contains six questions. The minimum scores for both questionnaires is 0 and indicates disease is in remission. There are no maximum values but the higher the number the greater severe the disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in presence of anxiety and depression score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using validated questionnaire the hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS). The questionnaire contains 14 questions which are scored from 0 to 4. Seven questions relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. An anxiety or depression sub-score of 0 suggests absence of anxiety or depression and a sub-score of eight or greater suggests borderline presence of anxiety or depression. A sub-score of 10 or more suggests presence of anxiety or depression.</description>
