  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Most patients develop colorectal
      liver metastases (CLM), and for such patients hepatectomy combined with chemotherapy may be
      curative. Nevertheless, in the era of precision medicine there is a critical need of
      prognostic markers to cope with the heterogeneity of CLM patients. Tumor-associated
      macrophages (TAMs) pave the way to tissue invasion and intravasation providing a nurturing
      microenvironment formetastases. The quantification of immune landscape of tumors has provided
      novel prognostic indicators of cancer progression, and the quantification of TAMs might
      explain the heterogeneity of CLM patients. Here, we will investigate the development of a new
      diagnostic tool based on TAMs with the aim to define the causative role of TAMs in CLM
      patients. This will open new clinical scenarios both for the diagnosis, therapy and
      prognosis, leading to the refinement of the therapeutic output in a personalized medicine
      perspective.

    <textblock>
      Some preliminary data produced by the research team from Humanitas Clinical and Research
      Center in Milan (ITALY) have shown that TAMs in CLM are heterogeneous and that their
      diversity can be distinguished based on their morphology and functionality. Therefore, TAMs
      may represent an additional tool in the definition of the biology and prognosis of CLM
      patients. This preliminary finding provides us with the rationale to undertake a prospective
      study on a large series of CLM patients surgically resected by our unit aimed at validating
      the promisingcorrelation between different TAMs phenotypes and patients prognosis. The
      characterization of the diversity of TAMs in CLM will be refined using state of the art
      technology, including multi-parametric flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
      transcriptional profiling, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses. The expected findings will
      allow us to develop a new diagnostic tool based on TAMs features, which will open the way to
      new criteria for patient stratification and for the design of new targeted therapies in a
      personalized medicine perspective.
