  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underutilization of behavioral health services for mood and anxiety disorders by Latinos
      is a public health concern warranting intervention development. Perceived stigma associated
      with the pursuit of behavioral health services disproportionately restricts mental healthcare
      in Latinos. The current study empirically tests an intervention aimed at improving
      perceptions of behavioral health services for mood and anxiety disorders, ultimately
      improving Latinos' mental health through access to treatment. The experimental intervention
      is based on the Entertainment-Education (E-E) model, a popular media campaign that
      incorporates health and educational messages in an entertaining, story-telling narrative. The
      E-E model incorporates characters who have characteristics, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors
      that are similar to those of the targeted audience to maximize social validity. Using data
      gathered in focus groups with Latinos a 3-minute E-E video (in Spanish) that aims to reduce
      stigma towards mental illness and behavioral health services was developed. Sixty adult
      Latinos pursuing care at a Federally Qualified Health Center, who screen positive for anxiety
      and/or depression will be invited to participate in the study. Participants will be
      administered a structured demographic interview and measures that assess stigma and attitudes
      towards mental health and behavioral health services and then randomized to the E-E video or
      control (structured discussion about depression and anxiety) condition. Participants will
      then complete the study measures and be invited to attend a Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)
      group for depression or anxiety. Consumer satisfaction will also be evaluated.

    <measure>Change in score on Generalized Anxiety Stigma Scale (GASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The GASS is a twenty-item scale used to measure stigma associated with anxiety disorders and was developed by Griffiths et al, (2004). It consists of two subscales, which measure two different types of stigma: personal and perceived. Responses to each item are measured on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (4). Scores on each subscale can range from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of stigma against generalized anxiety. A Spanish-language version of the measure is being tested for validity and reliability (Benuto &amp; Gonzalez, In Progress).</description>

    <measure>Change in score on Depression Stigma Scale (DSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The DSS is an eighteen-item scale used to measure stigma associated with depression and was developed by Griffiths et al, (2004). It consists of two subscales, which measure two different types of stigma: personal and perceived. Responses to each item are measured on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (4).Scores on each subscale can range from 0 to 36. Higher scores indicate higher levels of stigma against depression. A Spanish-language version of the measure is being tested for validity and reliability (Benuto &amp; Gonzalez, In Progress).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Attitudes Towards Seeking Professional Help Scale (ATSPH)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ATSPH is a 20-item item measure that is intended to reflect an individual's attitude toward professional behavioral health treatment. It is a modified version of the Attitudes Towards Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (Fisher &amp; Turner, 1970). Responses to each item are measured on a four-point scale ranging from disagree (0) to agree (3). Items (including some that are reverse-scored) are summed; total scores can range from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate more positive attitudes toward seeking treatment. A Spanish-language version of the measure is being tested for validity and reliability among a sample of Spanish-speaking individuals (Benuto &amp; Gonzalez, In Progress).</description>
