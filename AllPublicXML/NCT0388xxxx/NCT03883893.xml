    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective study to compare the post-operative analgesic efficacy
      of intravenous acetaminophen 15 mg/kg to an equal volume of 0.9% normal saline when all other
      analgesic interventions have been standardized for all patients enrolled.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 5 minutes after awake in recovery room for 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) behavior scale Each area measured is graded 0 - 2 and then totaled. Total score will range from 0 - 10. A total score of 0 - patient is relaxed and comfortable, 1 - 3 - patient is mildly uncomfortable, 4 - 6 - patient is in moderate pain, 7 - 10 - patient is having severe discomfort/pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of emergence from anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>When first spontaneous eye movement occurs in recovery room</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale (PAED)
This scale uses 5 criteria to determine the extent of emergence delirium in children. &quot;The child makes eye contact with the caregiver&quot;, &quot;The child's actions are purposeful&quot;, The child is aware of his/her surroundings&quot;, The child is restless&quot; and &quot;The child is inconsolable.&quot; Each of these 5 catagories are scored on a 0-4 scale. The higher the total number the greater the extent of the emergence delirium.</description>
