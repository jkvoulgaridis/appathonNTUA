  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the antibacterial effect of probiotic bacteria in
      yogurt in decreasing streptococcus mutans count in saliva and plaque, decreasing bacterial
      adherence and increasing salivary pH compared to xylitol-containing chewing gum after three
      months.

    <textblock>
      The subjects will be assigned randomly into two equal groups to receive either probiotic
      yogurt or xylitol-containing chewing gum for three months. The probiotic yogurt is (Activia;
      Danone, Egypt) containing Bifidobacterium (7x107 CFU/g). The subjects assigned to probiotic
      yogurt group will be instructed to eat 100 g of the provided yogurt 10 minutes after dinner
      and not to brush their teeth until one hour later. The subjects assigned to the
      xylitol-chewing gum group will be instructed to chew the provided gum three times daily for
      five minutes after each meal.

    <masking_description>Allocation concealment: Operator H.M. will choose between numbers in an opaque sealed envelope, which will be arranged by D.K. who will not be involved in any of the phases of the clinical trial. Data will be recorded on a computer by H.M. and O.S. and all records of all patients will be kept with the main supervisor M.I.
Implementation: D.K. will generate the allocation sequence, enroll participants, and assign participants to interventions.
Blinding: The assessors M.A. and R.E. will be blinded to the material assignment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>streptococcus mutans count in saliva</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The samples will be transported to the laboratory and cultured on selective media (dry Mitis Salivarius Agar with potassium tellurite medium and bacitracin) after serial dilutions. The plates will be incubated at 37ºC in 5-10% CO2 jar. then number of Colony Forming Units (CFU/ml) of Mutans Streptococci in saliva will be determined</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>streptococcus mutans count in plaque</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The samples will then be dispersed and spread over the culture media plates (mitis salivarius-bacitracin Agar), and the plates will be incubated under aerobic conditions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>salivary pH</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All the saliva samples will be tested on the same day for salivary pH using digital pH meter. The equipment will be calibrated with distilled water to reach pH 7 every time before measuring each sample</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>bacterial adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After applying disclosing agent over teeth, standard photographic images of the maxillary and mandibular facial surfaces of teeth will be taken. Digital plaque image analysis will be used to analyze plaque coverage. Images will be converted into pixels to calculate the percentage of the tooth covered with plaque divided by the total tooth area (both tooth areas with and without plaque) as follows:
plaque area coverage = [plaque pixels / (tooth pixels + plaque pixels)] × 100 The computer analysis results will be checked for consistency and accuracy by an expert in image analysis who is blinded to the assigned treatment</description>
