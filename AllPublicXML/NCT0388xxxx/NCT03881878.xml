    <textblock>
      This study was phase IB-II clinical trial that designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of docetaxel + atezolizumab + Herceptin sc plus pertuzumab(TAHP) plus adjuvant therapy of
      atezolizumab + trastuzumab + pertuzumab(AHP) after surgery in female patients with
      HER2-positive early breast cancer.

      Adjuvant AHP (atezolizumab + Herceptin SC + pertuzumab) will be continued for remaining 1
      year.

      For non-p CR patients, they are going to treat with 4 cycles of AC rather than Taxane only
      before AHP adjuvant therapy.

             or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain
             abstinent or use single or combined contraceptive methods that result in a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the
             last dose of study drugs. Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,

             ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined
             oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices.
             Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical
             cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Barrier methods must

         18. Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, including, but not limited to,
             hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia. Signs
