    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized in a 2:1 ratio, controlled, clinical trial with two
      parallel arms will be conducted to compare irinotecan dose escalated FOLFIRI according to
      UGT1A1 genotyping plus 120 mg regorafenib with 120 mg regorafenib alone in previously treated
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

      duration of treatment and adverse events

      Number of Subjects: 153 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib
      and FOLFIRI as a third- or fourth-line setting.

      Plan of the Study:

        1. This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized in a 2:1 ratio, controlled study.

        2. Study Schedule Study date: the time getting approval letter issued by both regulatory
           authority and institutional review board (IRB). Duration of the study: 4 years.

    <description>Regimen for treatment consists of irinotecan (180 mg/m2 as a 120-min IV infusion for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA6) and UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA7); 120 mg/m2 as a 120-min IV infusion for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA7/TA7)), followed by Leucovorin (400 mg/m2 IV infusion over 2 hours), and fluorouracil (5-FU) (2800 mg/m2 IV infusion over a 46-hour period), repeated every 2 weeks.
After every 2 cycles of each different dose of irinotecan, if adverse events (AEs) are under the grade 2, we will escalate the dose of 30 mg/m2. The estimated maximal dose of irinotecan is 260 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA6); 240 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA7); 180 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA7/TA7).
Regorafenib is administered at adjusted dosage of 120 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle.</description>
