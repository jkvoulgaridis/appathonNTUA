      Pragmatic cluster-randomized clinical trial. An open, multicentric, parallel-group trial with
      a control group, and with a follow-up period of 1 year. Randomization unit: health care
      professionals. Analysis unit: patients and health care workers. Scope: primary care (PC)
      health centers in the Community of Madrid (Spain). Population sample: patients of 40 to 75
      years of age with DM2, HbA1c ≥7.5%, on oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) treatment, who had
      attended PC consultation during the last year. Sample size: 250 patients (125 per group).
      Main objective: assess the effectiveness of an intervention based on person-centered
      interviewing (PCI) to improve metabolic control and increase OAD treatment adherence in
      patients with DM2. Intervention: four-component intervention including 1) Training of health
      care professionals (doctors and nurses) on PCI, 2) Practice of PCI techniques, 3) Information
      card for patients and family members, 4) Instructions sheet on drug prescription. Control
      arm: usual clinical practice. Variables: 1) Patients: Main: metabolic control (difference of
      HBA1c ≥0.5%), and OAD treatment adherence (average increase of 50-75%); Secondary:
      cardiovascular risk, compliance with clinical practice guidelines, complications related to
      DM2, satisfaction with treatment, adverse effects of medication, usage of health care
      services. 2) Healthcare workers: professional burnout. Follow-up period: 1 year. Analysis:
      multi-level models.
