  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke patient will undergo one month (20 sessions) of physical therapy and anodal
      tDCS.

      Patients will undergo functional outcomes measured at 48h post onset, 7,14,21,28 days, 3 and
      6 months and one year post onset.

      Recruitment :

      Patients with acute stroke (24-48h after stroke) who have upper and / or lower sensorimotor
      deficits

      • Treatment : After being selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this
      study, patients will be randomized and placed in one of two groups: placebo (P) or
      transcranial anodic stimulation (A).

      Once placed in one of two groups, patients will all receive intensive physiotherapy for
      functional improvement in order to increase motor, postural and motor control. This
      physiotherapy will be established 5 times a week (Monday to Friday).

      In addition to physiotherapy, the patient will have electrodes placed on his head, attached
      via a system of straps, to deliver either a continuous current (A) or no current (P) and at a
      rate of 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Neither the physiotherapist nor the patient will know
      what treatment he will have received.

      • Evaluations and measurements:

      Patients will be required to perform functional tests of the upper limb (Wolf Motor Function
      Test (WMFT)), filmed and timed, a test of spasticity (Tardieu) as well as to answer certain
      questionnaires concerning their perception of the evolution of the disease and their
      disability (Stroke Impact Scale, Barthel Index), their emotional state (HADS), if they have
      experienced side effects, sensitivity test with monofilaments or Semmes and Weinstein test,
      the Fugl Meyer, the timed up and go, the test of 10m, the four step square test, the berg
      balance scale, the postural assessment scale and the trunk impairment scale. These
      evaluations will take place at Day 0 (corresponding to the first day after the 48h of strict
      bedtime), Day 7, 15, 30, 90, 6 months and 1 year. They will be done in two stages, on two
      successive days, so as not to exhaust the patient.
