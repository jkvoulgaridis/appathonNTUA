    <textblock>
      This clinical study will evaluate the short-term (1- and 2-year) and medium term (5-year)
      safety and performance of the ANTHEM™ CR Total Knee System in patients with non-inflammatory
      degenerative joint disease of the knee requiring total knee replacement. Clinical,
      radiographic, Health Economic Outcomes and safety outcomes will be evaluated.

      To assess the safety and performance of the ANTHEM™ CR Total Knee System in patients with
      degeneration of the knee by demonstrating non-inferiority in the revision-free survival rate
      at 5 years compared to a literature reference rate of 96.6% (Australian Orthopaedic
      Association annual report 2016).

    <description>The ANTHEM CR Total Knee System is a CE marked device. It is a cruciate retaining (CR) total knee system. It is intended to be used in patients for primary total knee replacement surgery where the posterior cruciate ligament and collateral ligaments remain intact. It is a comprehensive system which allows surgeons to address simple to complex knee arthroplasties.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a candidate for primary total knee arthroplasty due to degenerative joint
             disease.

          2. Subject is willing to sign and date an EC-approved consent form.

          3. Subject has posterior cruciate ligament and all collateral ligaments intact in the
             index joint.

          4. Subject is 18 to 75 years old at time of inclusion.

          5. Subject plans to be available through five (5) years postoperative follow-up.

          7. Subject has achieved skeletal maturity as deemed by enrolling investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject would receive the ANTHEM™ CR Total Knee System on the affected knee as a
             revision for a previously failed (TKA) or unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA).

          2. Subject received TKA on the contralateral knee as a revision for a previously failed
             TKA or UKA.

          3. Subject has a history of patellar fracture, patellectomy, or patello-femoral
             Instability.

          4. Subject has inflammatory arthritis.

          5. Subject possesses a contralateral or ipsilateral revision hip arthroplasty.

          6. Subject has ipsilateral hip arthritis resulting in flexion contracture.

          7. Subject has one or more of the following arthroplasties that are not fully healed and
             well-functioning, as determined by the Investigator:

               -  Contralateral primary TKA or UKA.

          8. Inadequate bone stock which would make the procedure unjustifiable including but not
             limited to: severe osteopenia/osteoporosis or family history of severe
             osteoporosis/osteopenia as deemed by the enrolling investigator.

         10. Subject has an active infection or sepsis (treated or untreated) or previous
             intra-articular infections.

         11. Subject has presence of malignant tumor, either primary or metastatic, or benign tumor
             on leg with the knee to be treated.

         12. Subject has conditions that may interfere with the TKA survival or outcome (e.g.
             Paget's or Charcot's disease, vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus [i.e. not under treatment with oral/injectable medications to
             control blood glucose levels], fibromyalgia, moderate to severe renal insufficiency or
             neuromuscular disease).

         13. Subject has contralateral lower extremity condition causing abnormal ambulation (e.g.
             ankle fusion, ankle arthroplasty, previous hip fracture).

         14. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or of child-bearing potential who are not utilizing
             highly effective birth control measures.

         15. Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability
             or willingness to participate in the study, including mental illness, mental
             retardation, drug or alcohol abuse.

         16. Participation in the treatment period of another clinical trial within thirty (30)
             days of Visit 1.

         17. Any subject that meets the definition of a Vulnerable Subject per ISO14155:2011:
             individual whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly
