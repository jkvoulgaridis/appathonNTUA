  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      6 patients with jaw-closing dystonia will be treated with neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation over 8 weeks. The distance the mouth can be opened voluntarily and the
      oro-mandibular dystonia questionnaire (OMDQ-25) will be employed to determine whether there
      is any objective change in jaw opening or evidence of functional improvement.

    <description>Questionnaire that assesses quality of life in oromandibular dystonia patients. There are 25 questions total, and each question may be answered as never, seldom, sometimes, often, always. Minimum score is 0, maximum score is 100. A higher score indicates worse quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Omnistim® FX² is a neuromuscular stimulation device that provides patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation (PENS) via cutaneous electrodes placed over relevant musculature. It will be applied for 20 minutes per session. For each patient, there will be 2 sessions per week, spaced 3 to 4 days apart. Each patient will participate in 16 sessions over the 8 weeks of the study. There will be 6 patients total.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Jaw-closing dystonia, which may be primary or secondary to a neurodegenerative disease
             or medications.

          -  Unable to voluntarily open jaw fully on examination.

          -  Evidence of functional impairment resulting from dystonia including inability to
             completely open the jaw during speaking or eating to such an extent that it interferes
             with these tasks.

          -  Patient interested in participating, and willing to attend multiple treatment sessions
             in the neurology clinic.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, or other implanted
             electronic device.

          -  Inability to provide consent (either by the patient, spouse, or an identified power of
             attorney).

          -  Age under 18 years.

          -  Pregnancy.
