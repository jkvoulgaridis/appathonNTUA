    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a simulated hippotherapy system controlled by
      electromyography (EMG) signals and investigate its effectiveness in children with cerebral
      palsy. In order to investigate its effectiveness evaluation of gross motor functions, lower
      extremity joint movements, spasticity of the lower extremities, functional independence, body
      movements, sitting and standing balance, muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity level,
      analysis of the walking are planned.

    <textblock>
      Hippotherapy is a therapeutic method in which a real horse is used for therapeutic purposes.
      It is widely used in many countries in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases (Multiple
      Sclerosis, stroke, Cerebral Palsy, etc.). Although the use of hippotherapy is widespread,
      many people can not reach and use this method effectively because of many reasons such as the
      high cost of caring, feeding, and sheltering horses or fear of people from horses. In recent
      years, hippotherapy simulation devices (mechanic and robotic horses) have been developed to
      overcome these problems. These devices aim to create the effects of hippotherapy on people by
      simulating a real horse's movement. The aim of this project is to develop and produce a
      simulated hippotherapy system, which can be controlled by electromyography (EMG) signals
      coming from the rider, movements programmable (for different musculoskeletal problems),
      rehabilitation-specific, providing evaluation during therapy, integrating virtual reality
      system and therapy games and investigate its effectiveness in children with cerebral palsy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional level from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional level will be defined with Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS). GMFCS defines movements such as sitting, walking and use of mobility devices. It provides a clear description of a child's current gross motor functional level. Level I can climb stairs without the use of a railing. Level II can walk in most settings and climb stairs holding onto a railing. Level III needs usage of a hand held mobility device, may climb stairs holding onto a railing with assistance. Level IV requires physical assistance or powered mobility in most settings. Level V children are transported in a manuel wheelchair in all settings, they are limited in their ability to maintain antigravity head and trunk postures and control leg and arm movements.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in spasticity from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity will be defined with Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The MAS measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching. Scoring: 0= normal tone. 1= slight increase in muscle tone, minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM) when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension. 1+= slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder of the ROM. 2= more marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved. 3= considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult. 4= affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gross motor functional level from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gross motor function will be assessed with Gross Motor Function Measure-88. It consists of 88 items and contains 5 subdivisions: (A) reaching and turning; (B) sitting; (C) crawling and notebook; (D) standing; (E) walking, running and jumping. The total score and the scores of each sub-section are calculated. In our study, sections B, D and E will be evaluated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in postural control from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk movements will be assessed with Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS). It will be used to evaluate the postural control. The scale is developed to evaluate the people with stroke and has been adapted and validated for the children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). The TIS assesses static and dynamic sitting balance and trunk coordination in a sitting position. The static subscale investigates the ability of the subject to maintain a sitting position with feet supported, while the legs are passively crossed, and when the subject crosses the legs actively. The dynamic subscale contains items on lateral flexion of the trunk and unilateral lifting of the hip. For each item, a 2, 3 or 4-point ordinal scale is used. On the static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination subscales the maximal scores that can be attained are 7, 10 and 6 points. The total score for TIS ranges between 0 for a minimal performance to 23 for a perfect performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional independence from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence will be defined with The Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFim). WeeFim consists of 6 parts: self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication and social communication. Each item is scored from 1 to 7 depending on whether it receives help when performing the function, whether it is on time, or whether the auxiliary device is required. &quot;1&quot; means fully dependent, &quot;7&quot; means fully independent. According to this, the highest score a child can get is 126 and the lowest score is 18.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional balance from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be defined with Pediatrics Balance Scale (PDS). It is an assessment tool adapted from the Berg Balance Scale (BDS) to evaluate the functional balance of children in daily living activities. The scale consists of 14 chapters and each section is scored between 0 and 4; the highest score is 56. PDS is a high-reliability scale between groups and test re-testing in school-age children with mild to moderate motor impairment. The scale is valid in children with Cerebral Palsy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in soft tissue from baseline, week 8 and week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Soft tissue assessment will assessed with Myoton® PRO device. It is an evidence-based device that evaluates the bio-mechanical properties of soft biological tissues in a non-invasive, objective, reliable, inexpensive, quick and easy manner. Myoton® PRO is used in studies to evaluate superficial skeletal muscles, connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments, and other soft tissues. It is a highly reliable method for assessing the tone, stiffness, elasticity of muscles.</description>

    <description>Neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT) is a hands-on treatment approach used by physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists. NDT was developed to enhance the function of children who have difficulty controlling movement as a result of neurological challenges, such as cerebral palsy and head injury. During treatment interventions, repeated experience in movement ensures that a particular pattern is readily accessible for motor performance. The more a patient performs certain movements, the easier these movements becomes.</description>
