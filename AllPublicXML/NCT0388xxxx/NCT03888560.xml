    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to compare orthodontic treatment duration from start until the completion
      of orthodontic treatment and to investigate the presence of root resorption, gingival
      recession,anchorage loss, black triangle and pain assessment after orthodontic treatment
      duration between micro-osteoperforations group and control group.

    <textblock>
      Prolonged treatment time in orthodontics is an undesirable side effect for both the patient
      and clinician. Usually, an average course of comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed
      appliances requires less than 2 years to complete (19.9 months). This prolonged treatment
      time may cause adverse effects such as root resorption, gingival recession, caries &amp; enamel
      demineralization. Micro-osteoperforations is safe, minimally invasive technique which
      perforations are performed through the gum tissues, penetrating the bone without the need to
      raise a ﬂap.Control group will not received any MOP and will receive standard orthodontic
      treatment.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Method of randomization using online software at www.randomizer.org and the 30 participants will be randomly allocated into 2 intervention groups with a 1:1 allocation. Patient will be grouped into either group 1 (control group, no micro- osteoperforations given) or group 2 (micro-osteoperforations with frequency interval 4 weeks maxilla and mandible) . Thus, each group will have a total of 15 participants. In order to reduce bias during allocating the participants into group 1 or 2, the 30 numbers will subsequently cross match with the computer generated random numbers list also using www.randomizer.org. concealment of the allocation sequence will be done by concealing the sequence in opaque envelopes,shuffled and chosen by patient prior to the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

However, blinding can be ensured during data processing, analysing stages and data collection for secondary outcomes on total volume of root resorption, radiographic assessment on black triangle, pain and measurement of anchorage loss.</masking_description>
