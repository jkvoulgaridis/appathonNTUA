    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MDT-1118 VAD in a patient population for
      destination therapy (long term support) of advanced heart failure. The collected data will be
      used to support Japan regulatory application in expanding market approval for destination
      therapy.

    <description>Therapy will be considered a success if, at the end of 12 months in the study:
The subject is alive; and
The subject has not had a stroke of Modified Rankin Score ≥ 4; and
The subject retains the originally implanted device, unless the device was removed due to heart recovery, or the patient is electively transplanted.
Therapy will be considered a failure if, within the 12 months in the study:
The subject dies; or
The subject has a stroke of Modified Rankin Score ≥ 4; or
The device malfunctions or fails, requiring exchange, explantation, or urgent transplantation.</description>
