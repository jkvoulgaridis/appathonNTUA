  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on accumulating evidence showing that impaired cardiac energetic metabolism plays
      important role in the mechanism of cardiac diastolic dysfunction,the study is designed to
      evaluate whether metabolic modulator treatment with trimetazidine could have beneficial
      effects on patients with coronary heart disease(CHD) and ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction.This study is a prospective,randomised,open-label trial to assess the efficacy of
      trimetazidine treatment in improving diastolic function in CHD patients with diastolic
      dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the 24-week trimetazidine
      therapy, as an adjunct to routine treatment for CHD, would improve diastolic function in
      patients with ischemic heart disease compared to the routine treatment.
