  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and preliminary
      efficacy of MEDI5395 in combination with durvalumab in subjects with selected advanced solid
