      our aim is estimating the Prevalence and predicting risk factors for developing chronic oral
      graft versus host disease in pediatric patients subjected to hematopoietic stem cells
      transplantation

      The study will be held in Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt for pediatric patients who
      underwent bone marrow transplantation.

      this study describes oral conditions, detect possible oral pathological manifestations and
      evaluate their prevalence as well as correlating it to assumed risk factor as age, sex, type
      of the transplant , previous acute attack of graft versus host disease and other organ
      involvement . A standardized Transplant Database Questionnaire will be completed Clinical
      examination will be performed then findings will be recorded for oral mucosal lesions ,
      salivary flow rate in milliliter , mouth opening in milliimeter.

      Sample size estimation :

      The aim of this study is to screen pediatric patients at least three months after they
      undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation to detect any risk factors for
      developing oral manifestations of chronic graft versus host disease during this period. Every
      patient fulfilling inclusion criteria in the hospital will be recruited consecutively in a
      period of six months starting from April 2019.
