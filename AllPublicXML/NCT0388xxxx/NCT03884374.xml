  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mechanistic clinical trial proposes to test whether a five-day course of mindfulness
      meditation training (MMT) and tDCS, and their combination, can enhance pain modulatory
      balance and pain-related brain function, reduce clinical pain, among African Americans and
      non-Hispanic whites with knee osteoarthritis (OA). This approach will provide evidence that
      targeting stress and pain-related brain function will reduce OA-related pain and ethnic group
      differences therein.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unilateral or bilateral symptomatic knee OA based on American College of Rheumatology
             Clinical criteria

          -  Participant reports primary ethnic/race group as either African American or
             non-Hispanic white

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Systemic rheumatic disease/condition (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, fibromyalgia).

          -  A history of clinically significant surgery to the index knee.

          -  Daily use of opioids. Patients using opioids daily as both continued use and temporary
             withdrawal from these medications this could affect pain perception and response to
             interventions will be excluded. Other medications being used will be recorded and
             controlled in statistical analyses as needed.

          -  Use of sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers and NMDA receptor
             antagonists, because these medications can block tDCS effects. Other medications can
             potentially influence response to tDCS (e.g. SSRIs, beta-blockers); therefore,
             consistent with recent recommendations, the investigators will assess use of these
             medications and include them as covariates in our statistical models.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. SBP/DBP of &gt; 150/95), cardiovascular or peripheral
             arterial disease. These exclusions are in place primarily for safety reasons, because
             the cold pressor task represents a cardiovascular challenge. However, uncontrolled
             hypertension can also affect pain perception, which is another reason for excluding
             these individuals.

          -  Neurological disease (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy) or evidence of
             previous brain injury, including stroke and traumatic brain injury.

          -  Serious psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization within the past 12 months or
             characterized by active suicidal ideation.

          -  Current substance use disorder or history of hospitalization for treatment of
             substance use disorder.

          -  Diminished cognitive function that would interfere with understanding of study
             procedures.

          -  Presence of non-removable magnetic material or devices (e.g. pacemakers, aneurism
             clips) or claustrophobia, which could pose a risk for injury in the MRI scanner
