      HPV vaccination coverage is at lower levels than the national goal. This study will evaluate
      the effectiveness of quality improvement strategies for increasing HPV vaccination coverage
      among adolescent within the context of large integrated health care delivery systems.

      The University of North Carolina (UNC) will evaluate the impact of a quality improvement (QI)
      model for increasing HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents in primary care settings. UNC
      will partner with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to evaluate the effectiveness of their
      Vaccinate Adolescents against Cancer (VACs) model for HPV vaccine QI within the context of
      integrated healthcare delivery systems (IDSs). The VACs model includes the development of a
      QI action plan and a QI team. The QI team is made up of health care providers from
      participating clinics within the IDSs. The team then helps implement specific QI activities
      in participating primary care clinics. The model also includes vaccination coverage
      assessments in participating clinics at multiple time points to assess the impact of QI
      activities. Specific QI activities that will be offered to participating clinics will be
      chosen from a menu of options that will include the Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention's AFIX model and physician-to-physician engagement. AFIX (Assessment, Feedback,
      Incentives and eXchange) consists of brief quality improvement consultations that
      immunization specialists from state health departments deliver to vaccine providers in
      primary care settings. Using immunization registry data, the specialist evaluates the
      clinic's vaccination coverage and delivers education on best practices to improve coverage.
      Physician-to-physician (P2P) engagement consists of an in-depth training about how to make
      strong and effective HPV vaccination recommendations to primary care providers. The
      investigators will compare changes in HPV vaccination coverage between the quality
      improvement arm or wait list control arm.

    <description>The VACs (Vaccinate Adolescents against Cancer) model for HPV vaccine quality improvement is a strategy developed by the American Cancer Society to improve HPV vaccination coverage in large integrated health care delivery systems. It includes the development of a quality improvement (QI) action plan, the formation of a QI team of health care providers, education for the QI team about HPV-related disease burden and vaccine efficacy, HPV vaccine coverage assessments at several time points that are shared with individual clinics within the health are system, and the adoption of specific QI strategies by participating clinics in the health care system.</description>
