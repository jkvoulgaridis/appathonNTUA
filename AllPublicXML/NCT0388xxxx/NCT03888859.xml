    <textblock>
      Clinical study to evaluate safety (primary objectives) and efficacy (secondary objective) of
      ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T cells in patients with alpha fetoprotein positive (AFP+ ) hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecular target for ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 is human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A02 complexed
      with a HLA-A02-restricted peptide of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is expressed on 60-80
      percent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ARTEMIS™2 is a second generation ARTEMIS™ receptor
      engineered with a human antibody domain against the anti-HLA-A02/AFP complex. This clinical
      study evaluates the safety and pharmacokinetics of ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells in patients
      with HCC who have no available curative therapeutic options and a poor overall prognosis.

      Patients with lesion(s) localized in liver will be enrolled in the intra-hepatic artery (IA)
      arm or Intratumoral Injections arm, with the ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells administered via
      intrahepatic artery catheter. Patients with extrahepatic metastasis will be enrolled in the
      intravenous (IV) arm, with the ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells administered through intravenous
      infusion.
