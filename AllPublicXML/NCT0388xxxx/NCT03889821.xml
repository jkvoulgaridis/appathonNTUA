  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) report higher levels of depression
      and distress than caregivers of typically developing children as well as children with other
      developmental disabilities. The proposed work tests a novel treatment paradigm that blends
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) with an empirically supported and manualized parent
      training program (Parent-Implemented Early Start Denver Model [P-ESDM]). We hypothesize that
      directly treating parental distress, while simultaneously providing evidence-based parent
      training, may greatly enhance child-focused intervention and provide benefits that resonate
      across the family.

    <description>The Parenting Stress Index - Short Form, Third Edition (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1995), is a 36-item measure that yields three subscale scores (Parent Child Dysfunctional Interaction, Parenting Distress, Difficult Child) used in present analyses. Each item is rated as by parents as: SA (strongly agree), A (agree), NS (not sure), D (disagree), SD (strongly disagree). Scores are converted to percentile ranks, with higher scores indicating higher levels of stress. Percentile ranks of 15-80 considered typical, and ranks of 81 and above are considered high.</description>

    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2012) is a standardized clinical observation system for use with people with developmental ages of 12 months and older. Each child completes one module based upon age and language level. This module yields a Calibrated Severity Scores (CSS; range: 1-10). Higher scores reflect higher levels of autism symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Parent-implemented Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM; Rogers et al., 2012) consists of 12 consecutive sessions, each session approximately 1 hour long, that promote parental ability to support and interact with their young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Intervention sessions are conducted in the clinic setting by therapists trained to fidelity by ESDM-certified parent trainers. The manualized intervention has a detailed parent-training curriculum, a specific coaching intervention method, and a therapist fidelity measure. Therapists introduce skills through descriptions, interaction, modeling, coaching, and feedback.</description>

    <description>The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocol is derived from the work by Dykens et al. (2014), which is based on the stress reduction and relaxation program (Kabat-Zinn, 1982, 1990). In this study, it is offered as 6 weekly sessions that run concurrent with the P-ESDM intervention. Participants work one-on-one with a therapist for instruction and practice in mindfulness skills as well as discussions of stress, coping, and homework assignments.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data sharing procedures will adhere to guidelines established by the NIH sponsored National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). NDAR is a scalable informatics platform for ASD relevant data. NDAR was developed to share data and facilitate collaboration across the ASD field. We will participate in this system for sharing data in hopes that such sharing will accelerate research progress by allowing re-analysis of data, as well as re-aggregation, integration, and rigorous comparison with other data, tools, and methods. We will submit both descriptive and experimental data (http://ndar.nih.gov/).</ipd_description>
