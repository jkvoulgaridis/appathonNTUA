  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of V114 in healthy children who are either pneumococcal vaccine-naïve or who
      previously received a partial or full regimen of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).
      Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either V114 or Prevnar
      13®. Randomization will be stratified by age (7 months to 11 months, 12 months to 23 months
      [&lt;2 years], ≥2 years to &lt;6 years, and ≥6 years to 17 years [inclusive]). The primary
      objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of V114 and to evaluate the
      anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPs) serotype-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Geometric
      Mean Concentrations (GMCs) at 30 days following the last dose for each vaccination group.
      There is no formal hypothesis.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants that Report at Least 1 Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event (AE)</measure>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study vaccine or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. The parent/guardian of the participant are to record the presence of any vaccination report card (VRC)-prompted injection-site AEs that occur in the 14 days after any vaccination. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (erythema, pain, and swelling) will be summarized.</description>
