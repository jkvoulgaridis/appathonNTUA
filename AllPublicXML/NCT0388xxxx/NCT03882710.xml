  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In contrast to the treatment of HF with reduced EF, information to guide the pharmacological
      therapy of patients with HFNEF are lacking and there is no evidence based treatment for
      patients with HFNEF. Thus, present treatment strategies for HFNEF are largely based on
      assumptions regarding its pathophysiological mechanisms and on extrapolations from proven
      strategies used in systolic HF. Till now, no study enlightens the efficacy and safety of beta
      blockers in HFNEF in a randomised controlled manner although the role of beta blockers in HF
      with impaired systolic function has been sufficiently time tested leading to their
      therapeutic approval in that condition. Keeping in view the small reported benefit of beta
      blockers in HFNEF as mentioned above, there is a need to provide a conclusive proof of their
      role in this condition as well. Hence, investigators planned to test the efficacy and safety
      of metoprolol CR in patients with HFNEF in a randomised double blind placebo controlled
      trial.
