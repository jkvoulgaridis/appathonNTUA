    <textblock>
      The introduction of a modified perioperative patient blood management protocol with
      intravenous iron intervention for iron deficiency anaemic patients would reduce the need for
      allogenic blood transfusion and reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient blood management (PBM), refers to &quot;the timely application of evidence based medical
      and surgical concepts designed to maintain haemoglobin concentration, optimise haemostasis
      and minimize blood loss in an effort to improve patient outcome.

      PBM relies on three corresponding aspects:

        1. Optimising haemopoiesis,

        2. Minimising bleeding and blood loss

        3. Harnessing and optimising physiological tolerance of anaemia.

      Therefore, this randomised control trial aims to study the effect of applying a modified
      patient blood management protocol on the perioperative allogenic blood transfusion incidence,
      mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing major surgery in gynaecology, intraabdominal
      surgery and orthopaedics comparing with current practice.

    <description>To assess patient's quality of life using Short Form (12) Health Survey(SF-12) is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight domain scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

For each domain, either presence or absence of morbidity is recorded on the basis of objective criteria.</description>
