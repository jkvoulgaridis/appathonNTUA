      standard asthma care, will improve asthma symptoms and lung function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects 25.7 million people in the US. Many people report symptoms despite taking
      high-doses of inhaled asthma medications. This difficult-to-treat group accounts for more
      than 50% of asthma related healthcare visits and hospitalizations. The purpose of this study
      is to see if a medicine called Cysteamine, given along with standard asthma care, will
      improve asthma symptoms and lung function.

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of cysteamine. A placebo
      arm will be included to determine the comparative effectiveness of cysteamine in this
      population. Eligible participants will be assessed 1, 4 and 8 weeks post randomization and
      followed for an additional 4 weeks post treatment.

      In order to enroll in this study, participants must be between the ages of 18-45 and have
      uncontrolled asthma.

      This study will include 4 visits and weekly phone calls, and will be in the study for 3-4
      months.

      During the treatment period, participants will be placed in one of two treatment groups:

        -  Cysteamine

        -  Placebo

      Participants will not be able to choose which group they are assigned. This assignment is
      random and by chance, much like flipping a coin. Participants will not know if they are
      receiving Cysteamine or placebo. Investigators will compare the study results between the
      participants of each group.

    <measure>Change in the Asthma Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-Treatment), V1 (4 weeks), V2 (8 weeks), Study End (4 weeks post-treatment, Follow-up Phone Call)</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom severity score will be classified using the Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) criteria for untreated asthma. The level of impairment is based on the most severe indication of the following criteria: 1. Symptoms, 2. Nighttime awakenings, 3. Short-Acting Beta Agonist (SABA) use for symptom control, 4. Interference with normal activity, and 5. Lung Function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (miniAQLQ) scores Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Visit 2 (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The miniAQLQ will be used to measure the impact that asthma has on participants quality of life. The miniAQLQ will ask questions in the following domains: symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. There are 15 questions, each with a 7-point scale. An answer of 1 on a question represents the greatest impairment possible and a 7 represents the least impairment. Individual questions are equally weighted. The overall miniAQLQ score is the mean of the responses to each of the 15 questions.</description>
