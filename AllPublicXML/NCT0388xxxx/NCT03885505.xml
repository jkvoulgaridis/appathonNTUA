      Objective: To investigate the quality of life and sexual quality of life and its influencing
      factors in cervical cancer undergoing radiotherapy patients.

      Methods:The cervical cancer cancer scale (FACT-Cx4.0) and the female sexual function index
      (FSFI) in the cancer treatment function evaluation system were used. The quality of life and
      sexual quality of life of cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy in PUMC Hospital
      were analyzed and scored to analyze the effects of age, education level, clinical stage and
      treatment methods on the quality of life and sexual quality of life of cervical cancer
      radiotherapy patients

    <description>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix V4.0 (FACT-Cx V4.0) was used to evaluate patients'quality of life. The scale is composed of general cancer quality of life assessment scale (FACT-G) and cervical cancer specific module (CCS). It contains 5 dimensions and 42 subjects. The higher the score of positive questions, the better the quality of life. The higher the score of reverse questions, the worse the quality of life. If it is a reverse question, the original score of this question is subtracted by 4. The higher the total score, the better the quality of life. The study was conducted by face-to-face investigation of specialist nurses. All patients'investigation data were kept strictly confidential.
And follow the principles of medical ethics.using spss to analysis the data.</description>

    <description>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to measure the quality of sexual life. The higher the score of positive items, the worse the quality of sexual life. If the reverse items were negative, the original score of the item could be subtracted by 5. The higher the total score, the better the quality of sexual life. The study was conducted by face-to-face investigation by specialist nurses.
