      The purpose of this study is to determine how often heart or chest surgery in children leads
      to problems with the movement of the vocal folds.

    <textblock>
      Pediatric vocal fold motion impairment (VFMI) is a well-known cause of dysphonia and
      dysphagia. Previous studies have demonstrated the most common etiology for pediatric VFMI is
      cardiothoracic surgery which is possibly due to a variety of mechanisms.The investigators
      hypothesize that universal screening of neonates for VMFI following congenital cardiac
      surgery (CCS) will lead to a more accurate incidence and earlier diagnosis of VFMI. They
      believe that earlier identification will lead to changes in feeding regimens that may
      decrease length of stay (LOS), decrease time to oral feeding, earlier otolaryngologic
      intervention if indicated, and decreased rates of readmission for pulmonary or feeding
      complications. The investigators will also use this information to design a refined algorithm
      for targeted screening of patients who are more likely to have VFMI based on patient and
      surgery characteristics.

    <description>Medical records of all children 18 and under who underwent CCS (as defined by ICD-9-CM congenital heart disease procedure codes) from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016 will be reviewed. Those who developed VFMI following CCS as diagnosed on flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy will be identified. Inpatient, outpatient and emergency department (ED) records will be studied for details on postoperative length of stay, time to diagnosis of VFMI, time to initiation of oral feeding, ED visits and readmissions for feeding/weight gain or respiratory issues, and otolaryngology intervention.</description>
