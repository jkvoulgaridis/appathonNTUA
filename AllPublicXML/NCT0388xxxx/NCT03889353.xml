  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb's phantom pain, due to amputation or to injury of the brachial plexus are possibly
      due to maladaptive CNS (central nervous system facility) plasticity and thus could be
      decreased by retraining the sensorimotor cortex using Mental Motor Imaging guided through a
      novel BCI-RV feedback system : &quot;Ghost&quot;. The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of this BCI pain treatment developed by our team.

    <description>the intensity of paroxysmal pains This scale measures the intensity of paroxysmal pain. It is a self-assessment. Scores measured with Visual Analog Score.
The scale is graded from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most intense pain the patient can imagine).
The value 10 (maximum) is the worst result. There is no combination of sub-ranges to compute the score</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, 12, 90, 180</time_frame>
    <description>HAD questionnaire : Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale It includes 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), resulting in two scores (maximum score of each score = 21).
To detect anxious and depressive symptoms, the following interpretation can be proposed for each of the scores (A and D):
7 or less: lack of symptomatology
8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology - 11 and more: definite symptomatology.</description>
