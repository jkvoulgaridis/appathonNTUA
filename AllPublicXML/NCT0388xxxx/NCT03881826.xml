  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study aims to investigate the composition and activity of the gut microbiota of
      patients newly diagnosed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in relationship with their food
      habits and cachectic hallmarks. The recruitment for this study is currently ongoing with the
      help of clinicians, nurses and data managers at the Saint-Luc clinics, University Hospital
      Leuven (Campus Gasthuisberg) and University Hospital Gent.

      Primary Objective

      •To assess the composition and activity of the gut microbiota in patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) compared to matched control subjects.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To investigate correlations between the gut microbiota, cachectic hallmarks and gut
           microbiota-related markers in the blood (gut permeability markers, microbial compounds,
           microbial metabolites).

        -  To characterize the changes in the gut microbial ecosystem that are induced by
           chemotherapy and associated with colitis.

        -  To assess whether the composition of the gut microbiota can predict the severity of
           chemotherapy-related colitis.

      Study Design

      This is an academic multi-centric prospective study. The study is composed of two cohorts
      (Fig. 1). In Cohort A, patients are included before any chemotherapy. Biological samples
      (urine, feces, blood) are collected, alongside information on nutritional habits, appetite
      and medical records. Muscle strength and body composition are also measured. Only patients
      receiving a standard chemotherapy are included in Cohort B. In Cohort B, biological samples
      are collected and body composition, muscle strength and appetite are evaluated at 2 different
      time points, at the end of the chemotherapy (T1) and at discharge (T4).
