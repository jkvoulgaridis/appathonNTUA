  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test whether infrared thermal imaging using a non-touch, non-ionising,
      thermal camera system is feasible and reliable as an independent technique for thermal
      comfort assessment in older people and frail older people living in a care home and with or
      without mild cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thermal comfort (TC) is a complex interaction involving physiological, social, cultural and
      clothing factors. In hospital and in care homes, health-issues (frailty, dementia,
      immobility) can affect a person's perception of TC.

      In the UK 18,000 care homes provide living-communities for approximately 400,000 people. Many
      are old/frail and vulnerable to indoor chilling. A quality indicator for a good ''home''
      environment is related to TC. However, in multiplyoccupied rooms TC varies between
      individuals. The challenge in health-assessment is in identifying ''uncomfortable'' residents
      (too hot/too cold). As TC is a subjective perceptionÍ¾ a carer cannot reliably predict TC in
      another person.

      The objectives are to use infra-red thermal imaging (IRTI) to 'see' the body temperature map,
      to demonstrate prevalence of TC/thermal discomfort, to demonstrate whether there is
      correspondence/dissociation between TC self-report and IRTI-measured body/extremity (hand)
      temperature.

      The study aims to establish if TC can be predicted by an independent non-invasive imaging
      device

      Expected achievements are a two-way pathway to health impact:

        1. identification of eligible adults via NHS intermediary care- and awaiting care home
           residency

        2. expert guidance and collaboration with NHS partners

        3. translation of results from community to NHS setting e.g. stoke/aged care medicine for
           improved thermal care on the hospital wards Longer-term the expected achievement (5-7
           years)-working with NHS colleagues and design/product development teams is expected to
           lead towards a commercialisation pathway.
