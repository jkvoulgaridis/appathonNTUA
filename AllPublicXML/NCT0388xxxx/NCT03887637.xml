      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study. This study was aimed to assess the
      real-world effectiveness and safety of treatment with listed DAAs in patients with CHC and
      cirrhosis in Southern area of China.

      The primary objectives of this study is as follows:

      To access the effectiveness and safety of 12-week/24-week treatment with listed DAAs in
      patients with CHC and cirrhosis in real-world clinical practice in Southern area of China.
      The proportion of participants with SVR12(Undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after treatment
      completion RNA:Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid) was evaluated.

      This study aims to enroll 30 patients with CHC and cirrhosis in each treatment group.

      Patients with CHC and cirrhosis who fulfills the indication of antiviral therapy will be
      administered with DAAs treatment. After 12-week/2-week treatment, all the patients will be
      followed up for 12 weeks.
