  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Biofreeze® versus a placebo on
      walking gait characteristics and pain during walking in individuals with cLBP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A convenience sample of 20 participants, 18 years or older with cLBP will be recruited for
      this study. Participants must have cLBP and be able to perform all study procedures. All
      interested participants will report in comfortable clothing and sneakers. After explanation
      of the study and consent, participants will complete the demographics questionnaire, NIH cLBP
      Minimal Dataset, 10-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and the Roland-Morris Low Back
      Pain and Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Participants will then complete a 3-minute walking
      baseline assessment. Following the assessment, participants will rate their pain and be
      randomly assigned receive a blinded topical of either Biofreeze® or a Placebo. Both the
      participant and the investigator will be blind to assigned products. The dose of both gels
      will be 5 mL per side of the low back. The participant will wait 15 minutes, rate their pain,
      and repeat the 3-minute walking assessment and rate their pain again. Next, there will be a
      minimum of a 24-72-hour washout period at which time the participants will return and repeat
      the same protocol using the other topical.

    <measure>Change in Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain will be measured at baseline, immediately following the 3 minute walk, 15 minutes after topical application, and after the second 3 minute walk for both topical applications</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measures on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no pain at all and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>Knee Flexion Range of Motion will be measured for both topical applications at initial walk (T1) and post-topical walk (T2) in one session, lasting 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Flexion Range of Motion will be measured using the Woodway Walker View Treadmill which utilizes a 3D camera and will be measured during the last 30 seconds of the 3 minute walk.</description>

    <description>The Biofreeze® gel will contain 3.5% menthol while the placebo will be the same formula with menthol removed and a menthol fragrance added so it is non-distinguishable from the real Biofreeze® gel. The dose of both gels will be 5 mL applied to low back, which is consistent with previous studies who reported a treatment effect for topical gels containing menthol (1 mL of gel for every 200 cm2 of surface area). The treatment will be applied by the investigator using a gloved hand and syringe containing 5mL of gel. The gel will be applied to the low back from the lower ribs to the SI joint and iliac crests. The participant will wait 15 minutes, rate the pain in their low back.</description>
