  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of disability and mortality
      worldwide. This systemic disease progressively leads to dyspnea and exercise capacity
      impairment. Pulmonary rehabilitation effectively improves exercise capacity, dyspnea and
      quality of life in patients with COPD. However, its benefits progressively fade over time due
      to several factors such as the lack of regular exercise activity, dyspnea, airway secretions,
      hematosis impairment and acute exacerbations which can lead to hospitalization and
      accelerated muscle wasting.

      Nasal high flow (NHF) is a support used to deliver heated and humidified high flow air (up to
      60 L/min) through nasal canula providing promising physiological benefits such as positive
      airway pressure or upper airway carbon dioxide washout. It can be used in association with
      oxygen and offers the advantage to overtake the patient's inspiratory flow, providing a
      stable inspired fraction of oxygen. Nasal high flow has widely been studied in pediatric and
      adult intensive care units and seems better than conventional oxygen therapy and as effective
      as noninvasive ventilation with regards to mortality to treat hypoxemic acute respiratory
      failure.

      More recently, several studies have shown that long-term nasal high flow could contribute to
      improve exercise capacity, dyspnea, airway secretion removal, hematosis, reduced acute
      exacerbations and subsequent hospitalizations in patients with COPD.

      Based on these results, the primary aim of this study is to assess whether long-term nasal
      high flow treatment can help COPD patients to better maintain their endurance capacity
      following a course of pulmonary rehabilitation.

      Experimental design:

      Patients achieving their last pulmonary rehabilitation session will be approached to
      participate in this study.

      Eligible patients who agree to participate in the study and sign informed consent will
      perform two baseline visit assessments:

      First visit: Incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Second visit: Other baseline
      assessment (see outcome section), including a constant workload exercise testing at 75% of
      the maximal workload achieved during the incremental exercise testing.

      Then, patients will then be randomized to one of the following two arms:

        -  Nasal high flow,

        -  Usual care.

      After 6 months, patients will be invited to perform the same assessment as during the second
      baseline visit.

    <description>Following baseline assessment, patients randomized to the nasal high flow arm will be equipped with a nasal high flow device (myAIRVO2) administrated through the Optiflow nasal canula. Flow will be set at the highest flow tolerated (20-30 L/min): initially 30 L/min, progressively decrease if not tolerated. Temperature will be set between 34-37°C according to the tolerance : initially 37°C and decreased if not tolerated. Patients will be asked to use the device 8h per day.
Patients under long-term oxygen will preserve their usual flow. The usual prescribed oxygen flow will then be titrated during nasal high flow to maintain the same baseline transcutaneous oxygen saturation as their conventional oxygen therapy (≥ 90%) to prevent any oxygen dilution effect of nasal high flow.</description>
