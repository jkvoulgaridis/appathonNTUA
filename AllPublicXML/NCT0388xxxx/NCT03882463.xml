  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is essentially insulin therapy
      using insulin pump, allowing the improvement of the glycemic balance.

      However, the risk of hypoglycaemia inherent to the treatment persists. Hypoglycemia is an
      acute complication in the management of diabetes. It can be manifested by warning signs
      (tremors, sweats, feelings of hunger ...) but also occur during sleep and be ignored. It can
      be responsible for asthenia, difficulty concentrating and attention and memory problems.

      In order to decrease time spent in hypoglycemia, insulin pump therapy can be coupled with a
      continuous glucose measurement system with a stop insulin pump function in case of
      hypoglycemia.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy of the predictive system for stopping before
      hypoglycaemia &quot;medtronic Minimed with SmartGuard technology&quot; in type 1 diabetic children,
      especially on the time spent in hypoglycemia .
