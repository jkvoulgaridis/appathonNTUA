      Skin Sensitization Test (Modified Draize-95 Test) to Support a Low Dermatitis Potential Claim
      for a Blue Non Sterile Powder Free Nitrile Examination Gloves. This study is a RIPT (Repeat
      Insult Patch Test) to evaluate whether residual chemical additives at the level that may
      induce Type IV allergy in the nonsensitized general user population are present in a finished
      Blue Non Sterile Powder Free Nitrile Examination Glove.

    <measure>Irritation scored by Erythemal Scoring Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Basic Score and Description:
0 - No visible reaction. 0.5 - Doubtful or negligible erythema reaction. 1.0 - Mild or just perceptible macular erythema reaction in a speckled/follicular, patchy or confluent pattern (slight pinking).
2.0 - Moderate erythema reaction in a confluent pattern (definite redness). 3.0 - Strong or brisk erythema reaction that may spread beyond the test site.
If a subject develops a positive reaction (a score value of 1.5) to the test material or shows signs of irritation after patch applications, further patching on those individuals are stopped.
In order to qualify for the claim of a reduced sensitization potential, all 200 individuals completing the study should exhibit a score value of no more than 1.5 based on the scoring criteria.</description>
