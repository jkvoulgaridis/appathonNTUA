  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to collect prospective data and evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in Indian patients with
      NVAF when used in clinical practice under real-life conditions.

      The study will be conducted in routine clinical practice settings. Approximately 1000
      patients from India will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be observed for maximum
      period of 12 months after the start of Xarelto treatment or until it is no longer possible
      (e.g. lost to follow-up, death, withdrawal) before the end of the observation period.

      The decision by the investigator to start with of Xarelto must be independent of the
      inclusion of a patient to the study.
