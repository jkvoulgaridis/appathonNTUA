  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative wound complications such as wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, persistent wound
      drainage, delayed healing, and superficial skin infection could have devastating
      consequences, leading to arthroplasty failure and patient morbidity requiring additional
      operations and prolonging hospitalization with substantial burden in cost of care. Recently,
      interest and research on central sensitization (CS) have been increasing. CS is closely
      correlated with excessive pain. It has two main characteristics: allodynia and hyperalgesia.
      CS is an abnormal and intense enhancement of pain mechanism by the central nervous system.
      One of the mechanisms by which this excessive pain occurs in CS is reduced activation of
      descending inhibitory pathway associated with deficiency in pathways primarily in response to
      serotonin and norepinephrine. Serotonin plays an important role in normal wound healing by
      affecting the formation of neovascularization, inflammatory reactions, fibroblasts and tissue
      proliferation essential for wound healing. Norepinephrine is also closely related to wound
      healing by controlling chemotaxis of macrophage essential for normal wound healing. CS is a
      risk factor for the development of postoperative wound complication after primary Total Knee
      Arthroplasty (TKA). Preclinical models of central sensitization suggest that duloxetine is
      effective in the treatment. Investigators will compare the wound complication following TKA
      of central sensitization patients in duloxetine group (n=40) with those in non-duloxetine
      group (n=40). Investigators will classify the central sensitization patients by central
      sensitization inventory and divide the central sensitization patients in to 2 groups
      (duloxetine and non-duloxetine group) randomly. Investigators checks the wound complication
      after primary TKA and visual assessment scale at preoperative, postoperative 2 days and 1,
      2,6,12 weeks. All participants will receive postoperative pain control after TKA using the
      same pain control regimen and wound dressing regimen except duloxetine.
