    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of LY3074828 when given as an
      injection just under the skin by two different devices. The study will last about 12 weeks
      for each participant.

    <description>The pain VAS is a participant-administered single-item scale designed to measure pain using a 0-100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. Overall severity of participant's pain is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal 100 mm scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (severe pain)</description>
