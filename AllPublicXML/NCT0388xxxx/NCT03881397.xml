    <textblock>
      For this study there will be three time points of data collection and participant contact by
      Qualtrics:

      Time 1: Baseline

      Participants (teen and parent dyads) will be randomized into one of two tracks:

      Track A: Family Media Use Plan intervention Track B: Awareness intervention (delayed start
      intervention)

      The track A group will complete a survey regarding technology rules, tech use, and health
      behaviors, as well as the Family Media Use Plan embedded into the survey. Track B group will
      only complete the baseline survey.

      Time 2: Follow Up Survey: 4-6 weeks after baseline

      Track A group will complete a follow-up survey similar to the baseline with additional
      follow-up questions around their use of the family media use plan.

      The track B group will complete a similar survey and receive the Awareness Intervention,
      providing resources available regarding youth and media use .

      Time 3: Follow Up Survey: 3-4 months after baseline

      All participants will be asked to complete their corresponding tracks (track A or track B)
      survey again to understand use media use and health behaviors change over time.

      Track A or B designated questions are labeled within each uploaded survey.

    <time_frame>4 months after initial baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Increases in the number of positive responses to technology and media rules followed or maintained</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in sleep behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 months after initial baseline (Time 2 and 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in sleep as measured by the 8 item Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS). Participants will assess their sleep behaviors by answering each item with &quot;never&quot;, &quot;seldom&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;frequently&quot;, or &quot;always&quot;. Items are scored from 0-4 (never= 0; seldom=1; sometimes=2; frequently=3; always=4) with a score above 16 indicating poor sleep behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in risk for Problematic Internet Use</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 months after initial baseline (Time 2 and 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in problematic internet use symptoms as measured by the 18-item Problematic and Risky Internet Use Screening Scale (PRIUSS). For each item participants will select from &quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, or &quot;very often&quot; in relation to their internet use over the last 6 months. Each option is coded with &quot;never&quot; equal to 1 and &quot;very often&quot; equal to 5. An overall composite score is calculated at the end, with an overall score of 25 indicating a risk for problematic internet use.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 months after initial baseline (Time 2 and 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Reported physical activity as measured by the 3 item Physical Activity Scale. Response options range from never (1) to 4 times or more a week (5) for each item. Higher scores indicating greater physical activity.</description>
