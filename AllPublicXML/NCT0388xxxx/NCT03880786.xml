  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pudendal nerve release surgery in case of pudendal impingement syndrome is well described in
      literature.Pudendal nerve modulation in case of chronic perineal pain is also a promising
      technique and some small studies exist. However, in the latter group, patient inclusion
      criteria are very heterogenous and so conclusions about efficacy are difficult to draw. In
      the surgery group, outcome results also vary between the different approaches but in general,
      there is room for improvement. After pudendal nerve release in chronic perineal pain
      syndrome, it can take up to 6 months before improvement for the patient is recorded. This is
      partially due to the complex chronic pain syndrome mechanism.

      Nothing is known about the possible effect of early neuromodulation at the level of the
      pudendal nerve after his release.

      Recently, two cadaveric studies were published which described a minimal invasive trans
      gluteal approach for pudendal nerve decompression and a pudendal electrode placement.

      In the present trial, the investigators would like to combine the endoscopic trans gluteal
      pudendal release with pudendal neuromodulation to improve the outcome for patients suffering
      from pudendal impingement syndrome.

      The aim is to improve the results of pain score and quality of life of patients undergoing
      surgery for pudendal release in case of chronic perineal pain syndrome.

    <description>SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. It covers several health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions.The recommended scoring system for the SF-36 is a weighted Likert system for each item. The items in the subscales are summed to obtain a summary score for each subscale or dimension. Each of the 8 summary scores is linearly transformed on a scale of 0 (negative to health) to 100 (positive for health).</description>

    <description>All patients eligible for release surgery will be implanted a PNE test lead (Medtronic) which will be placed (transforaminal or transgluteally) next to the pudendal nerve, at the level of the ischial spine, after surgical release and connected to an external stimulation device. The PNE lead will be fixed at the ischial-spinal ligament with an absorbable suture to prevent dislocation. If a bilateral dissection is needed, bilateral test leads will be placed. Stimulation will be switched on at the second postoperative day, according to the sensory threshold described by the patient. After three weeks the PNE test lead will be removed at the outpatient clinical visit.</description>
