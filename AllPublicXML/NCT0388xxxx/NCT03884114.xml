    <textblock>
      This study, focusing on the management of pediatric asthma exacerbations, assesses the
      clinical skills of medical students using three different evaluation tools: (i) the
      simulation game &quot;Effic'Asthme&quot; developed to train individuals on the management of pediatric
      asthma exacerbations; (ii) a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) on the same subject
      developed for the purpose of the study and (iii) high fidelity (HF)-simulation, considered as
      the gold-standard for its enhanced realism.

      Its objective is to determine which of the simulation game or the MCQ reflects the best the
      clinical competence of medical students evaluated on a HF simulator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of medical students' clinical competence has long been of concern to
      educational institutions. Objective structural clinical examination (OSCE) and assessments in
      high-fidelity (HF) simulation settings represent interesting evaluation modalities but are
      associated with huge costs, especially when they are used for large-scale standardized
      assessments. Multiple choice questionnaires (MCQ) remain the most common evaluation tool in
      medical schools.

      Simulation games may represent an interesting compromise between the cheap but limited
      assessment allowed by MCQs, and the comprehensive but highly expensive assessment allowed by
      OSCE and HF simulation.

      This study, focusing on the management of pediatric asthma exacerbations, assesses the
      clinical skills of medical students using three different evaluation tools: (i) the
      simulation game &quot;Effic'Asthme&quot; developed to train individuals on the management of pediatric
      asthma exacerbations; (ii) a MCQ on the same subject developed for the purpose of the study
      and (iii) HF-simulation, considered as the gold-standard for its enhanced realism.

      Its objective is to determine which of the simulation game or the MCQ reflects the best the
      clinical competence of medical students evaluated on a HF simulator.

    <description>This score uses a scale designed for the purpose of the study, the &quot;Asthma exacerbation performance score&quot;, ranging from 0 to 19, 19 being the highest rate meaning that all the actions were correctly performed (1 point per action correctly performed).
This score will allow to calculate the degree of correlation calculated by Kappa coefficient for each action performed or answer provided, between the simulation game and the high fidelity simulation session on the one hand; and between the multiple choice questionnaire and the high fidelity simulation session on the other hand;
Then, we will compare the median Kappa coefficients for each condition, and determine which of the multiple choice questionnaire or the simulation game reflects the best the clinical competence of medical students observed during a high-fidelity simulation session.</description>

    <description>The total scores of this checklist will allow to calculate:
the degree of correlation of the scores using this checklist between the simulation game and the high-fidelity simulation session using spearman correlation,
the degree of correlation of the scores using this checklist between the simulation game and the multiple choice questionnaire using spearman correlation
It will also allow to compare the median scores of the students between the three modalities of assessment (high fidelity simulation, simulation game and multiple choice questionnaire), and the dispersion of the scores between the three modalities.</description>

    <description>All participants are evaluated on a scenario of pediatric asthma exacerbation using three different evaluation tools: (i) the simulation game EfficAsthme developed to train individuals on the management of pediatric asthma exacerbations; (ii) a MCQ on the same subject developed for the purpose of the study and (iii) HF-simulation, considered as the gold-standard for its enhanced realism.</description>

    <description>The first evaluation modality studied is high fidelity (HF) simulation. In our study, this modality is considered to be the gold-standard assessment method of clinical assessment, because HF simulation corresponds to the modality which reflects the best clinical competence in hospital settings. The HF pediatric manikin used (SimBaby), is able to reproduce all the signs of an asthma exacerbation (coughing, wheezing, tachypnea, chest indrawing, seesaw respiration, cyanosis). In the simulation room, participants can use the same items that those present in the simulation game (a glass of water, paracetamol, short acting beta-agonist, controller treatment (Fluticasone), an asthma spacer with a facial mask, saline nose drops to perform nasal irrigation, oral steroids in tablets (prednisone), and a phone).</description>

    <description>EfficAsthme is a simulation game used on a tablet computer. This simulation game was developed to train parents on the management of asthma exacerbations of their children. For the purpose of the study, EfficAsthme is diverted from its original use to assess students' clinical skills. The training scenario &quot;A polluted atmosphere&quot; is used in this study. Participants need to observe the signs presented by the child, and to determine the severity of the asthma exacerbation. From a menu on the right of the screen, the participant can choose several actions, especially to provide the short acting beta-agonist.</description>

    <description>The third evaluation modality corresponds to a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) including 15 questions. As for HF-simulation and the simulation game, the MCQ starts with the same briefing and continues with 15 questions regarding the management of a moderate asthma exacerbation.</description>
