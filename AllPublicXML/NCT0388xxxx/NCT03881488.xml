  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study of CTX-471 monotherapy in patients with
      metastatic or locally advanced malignancies that have progressed while receiving an approved
      PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation and
      Part 2 Dose Expansion.
