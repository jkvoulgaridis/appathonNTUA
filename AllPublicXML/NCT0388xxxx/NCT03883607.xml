      The study is being conducted in order to assess the pharmacokinetics and the safety of
      elafibranor following once daily administration of two dose levels of elafibranor (80 mg and
      120mg) during 3 months in children and adolescent population (8 to 17 years of age) with

    <measure>Change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL™) 4.0 Generic Core Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>From day 1 to day 85</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a modular approach to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. CHILD and PARENT Reports for Children (ages 8-12), Teens (ages 13-18) are used in the study. The PedsQL model integrates generic core scales (Physical 8 items, Emotional 5 items, Social 5 items and School functioning 5 items) into one measurement system (23 items).
Item scaling: 5-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0.
Psychosocial Health Summary Score is the sum of the items over the number of items answered in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Scales. Physical Health Summary Score is the same as the Physical Functioning Scale Score. Total Scale Score is the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales.
Higher scores indicate better HRQOL.</description>
