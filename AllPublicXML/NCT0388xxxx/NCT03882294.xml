  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be aimed to investigate the effect of probiotic intervention and its
      associated factors on aflatoxin biomarkers among healthy subjects in Serdang and Kajang,
      Selangor
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention that
      conducted for 12 weeks and followed-up for 4 weeks among healthy adults under living
      condition in Serdang and Kajang, Selangor. 164 subjects will be recruited for the
      intervention study, where 82 subjects will be randomly allocated to the probiotic or placebo
      group. Probiotic and placebo drinks (80 ml) will be prepared in the form of bottle. Placebo
      drink will have similar taste, colour, physical appearance, and nutritional value as
      probiotic drink but contain no LcS. Morning urine samples (15 ml), weight status, and dietary
      intake will be collected every two weeks from week 0 to week 12 and follow up until week 16
      at community centre. Whereas, fasting blood samples (5 ml) and physical activity will be
      collected every four weeks for 16 weeks at the community centre.

    <time_frame>From week 0 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of serum AFB1-lysine adducts will be done using elisa kit through HPLC.</description>

    <measure>Changes in body mass index (kg/m^2) over 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in weight and height will be measured using weighing scale and body meter respectively. Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in waist circumference (cm) over 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The parameter will be measured using measuring tape.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity level (MET-min/week) over 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The parameter will be examined using questionnaire based on the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in dietary intake over 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary assessment will be recorded via food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The conversion of food frequency to the amount of food intake is carried out using the following formula:
Amount of food (g/day) = frequency of intake (conversion factor) × serving size × total of serving × weight of food in one serving (Wessex Institute of Public Health, 1995).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) on aflatoxin over 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>KAP will be examined using questionnaire in bilingual (English and Bahasa Malaysia). Knowledge towards aflatoxin is scored into two groups: know and do not know. Attitudes and practices are categorized using likert scale with 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=agree and 4=strongly agree.</description>
