  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of oral HMPL-004 in subjects with active moderate Crohn's disease (CD) -
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 220 to 400 - on stable doses of CD medications who had
      not received anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) for at least 3 months prior to
      start of treatment. HMPL-004 (or placebo) was added to the subject's existing CD medications.
      Subjects were observed for an 8-week treatment period and a subsequent 4-week follow-up
      period.

    <measure>CDAI Clinical Response -100 at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects with CDAI clinical response -100 at Week 8 based on ITT population using the WOCF method to impute missing CDAI scores at Week 8.
Clinical response -100 was defined as CDAI score decrease of ≥100 points from baseline in subjects who had no change in concomitant medications for Crohn's disease except for steroids, which could be tapered after Week 8.
The CDAI consists of eight variables, including Liquid or very soft stools, Abdominal pain, General well-being, Features of extra-intestinal disease, Oplates for diarrhea, Abdominal mass, Hematocrit and Body weight below standard, each weighted according to its ability to be predictive of disease activity. The total score ranges from 0 to over 600 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity or worse outcome.</description>

        <title>CDAI Clinical Response -100 at Week 8</title>
        <description>Percentage of subjects with CDAI clinical response -100 at Week 8 based on ITT population using the WOCF method to impute missing CDAI scores at Week 8.
Clinical response -100 was defined as CDAI score decrease of ≥100 points from baseline in subjects who had no change in concomitant medications for Crohn's disease except for steroids, which could be tapered after Week 8.
The CDAI consists of eight variables, including Liquid or very soft stools, Abdominal pain, General well-being, Features of extra-intestinal disease, Oplates for diarrhea, Abdominal mass, Hematocrit and Body weight below standard, each weighted according to its ability to be predictive of disease activity. The total score ranges from 0 to over 600 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity or worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Remission at Week 12</title>
        <description>Percentage of subjects achieving remission (CDAI&lt;150) at week 12. Remission was defined as CDAI score &lt;150 in subjects who had no change in concomitant medications for Crohn's disease except for steroids, which could be tapered after Week 8.
The CDAI consists of eight variables, including Liquid or very soft stools, Abdominal pain, General well-being, Features of extra-intestinal disease, Oplates for diarrhea, Abdominal mass, Hematocrit and Body weight below standard, each weighted according to its ability to be predictive of disease activity. The total score ranges from 0 to over 600 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity or worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Complete Remission at Week 12</title>
        <description>Percentage of subjects achieving complete remission (clinical response -100 plus CDAI&lt;150) at week 12 (WOCF).
Complete remission was defined as CDAI score decrease of ≥100 points from baseline and CDAI score &lt;150 in subjects who had no change in concomitant medications for Crohn's disease except for steroids, which could be tapered after Week 8.
The CDAI consists of eight variables, including Liquid or very soft stools, Abdominal pain, General well-being, Features of extra-intestinal disease, Oplates for diarrhea, Abdominal mass, Hematocrit and Body weight below standard, each weighted according to its ability to be predictive of disease activity. The total score ranges from 0 to over 600 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity or worse outcome.</description>
