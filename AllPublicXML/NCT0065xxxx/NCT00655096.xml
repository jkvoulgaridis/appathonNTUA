      This study will allow National Eye Institute (NEI) doctors the opportunity to examine people
      with eye disease, whether the diagnosis is known or not, to determine if they are eligible
      for other NEI research studies. No treatment is offered in this study.

      People of all ages with various eye conditions, including genetic conditions, eye movement
      disorders, inflammatory eye diseases, retinal diseases and external eye diseases, may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo various tests and procedures to diagnose or evaluate their eye disease.
      The procedures may include the following:

        -  Personal and family medical history

        -  Physical examination and blood tests, including genetic testing.

        -  Eye examination with dilation to measure visual acuity and eye pressure and to examine
           the front and back parts of the eye.

        -  Questionnaire about vision and daily activities.

        -  Conjunctival swab or lacrimal bland biopsy, or both: A sample of cells from the eyes is
           collected by swabbing the surface of the eye or by surgically removing a small sample of
           the surface of the eye or tear gland.

        -  Electroretinogram to examine retinal function: The subject sits in the dark with his or
           her eyes patched for 30 minutes. The patches are removed, the surface of the eyes is
           numbed, and contact lenses that can sense signals from the retina are placed on the
           eyes. The subject then watches flashing lights.

        -  Fluorescein angiography to examine the blood vessels in the eye: A dye is injected into
           a vein in the arm. The dye travels through the veins to the blood vessels in the eyes. A
           camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels.

        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness: A machine used to examine the
           eyes produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina.

        -  Microperimetry to test how sensitive different parts of the retina are to changing
           levels of light. The subject sits in front of a computer and presses a button when he or
           she sees a light on the screen.

        -  Oculography to record eye movements: Eye movements are measured by contact lenses or
           goggles that the subject wears while watching a series of spots on a computer screen.

      This protocol is designed for the screening of potential research participants with or
      without a defined diagnosis. This protocol will serve as a point of entry for individuals who
      may be eligible and wish to participate in the National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical research
      studies. Participants referred or self-referred for a second opinion will be also screened
      and evaluated during the screening process to determine whether they are suitable
      participants for any of the ongoing NEI research studies. The screening process will include
      past and current medical history, a physical examination, routine diagnostic procedures and
      required testing as needed to help determine a participant s eligibility for research
      participation and diagnosis. Other routine diagnostic procedures and tests may also be done
      to help determine a participant s eligibility. Once the screening process is complete,
      participants will be informed of their options to participate in one or more of the NEI s
      current clinical research protocols. If no suitable research protocol for their participation
      is identified, recommendations for other treatment options may be given to the individual,
      their primary provider or referring physician.

      This protocol s secondary aim is to collect and store human biospecimens and health
      information for basic science laboratory research. Basic science research may be both
      hypothesis generating and/or hypothesis testing. Biospecimen samples such as blood, body
      fluid (e.g., urine), genomic, and tissue (e.g., skin or hair) may be collected from affected
      or unaffected adult participants as well as affected pediatric participants; biospecimen
      samples can be collected at the time of screening or anytime thereafter. These samples may be
      used for basic science laboratory research or stored and used in future research studies.
      Through such studies, the investigators hope to find possible new ways to detect, treat and
      possibly even prevent or cure ophthalmological diseases. Biospecimen sample collection will
      be voluntary for all participants, and participants will be consented using the Screening and
      Biospecimen Collection consent prior to their participation in this arm of the study.
