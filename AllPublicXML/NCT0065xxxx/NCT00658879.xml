  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this surveillance is to collect information about 1) adverse drug reaction
      not expected from the LPD (unknown adverse drug reaction), 2) the incidence of adverse drug
      reactions in this surveillance, and 3)factors considered to affect the safety and/or efficacy
      of this drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes the first Somavert (Pegvisomant) should be
      registered consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to
      extract patients enrolled into the investigation at random.

    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Somavert in a participant who received Somavert. A treatment-related serious adverse event was a treatment-related adverse event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to Somavert was assessed by the physician.</description>
