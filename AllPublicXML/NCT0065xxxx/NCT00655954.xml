      Evaluation of OPG level as disease markers has also been reported. It has been showed that
      patients with coronary artery disease had higher serum OPG levels than healthy volunteers.
      Moreover, serum OPG levels correlate with the number of stenotic coronary arteries

      Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein containing 401 amino acids. It is a member
      of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. It was firstly discovered as a
      protein regulating bone metabolism, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, consequently, inhibiting
      bone resorption OPG is detected in lung using Northern blot analysis. It is likely that OPG
      would contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD and could be an effective disease marker of the
      disease

        Participants were recruited from the outpatient department of Royal Brompton Hospital and
        local general practices. Patients with COPD were diagnosed using the GOLD (Global
        Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria. 25 Patients with COPD who had an
        exacerbation during the last 2 months prior to the visit were excluded. Patients with
        asthma were diagnosed using the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) guidelines for asthma.
        26 Patients with any other lung diseases were excluded from the study. This study was
        reviewed and approved by the Hounslow and Hillingdon Research Ethics Committee. Written
        informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
