  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with PTSD have high rates of smoking (34%-86% vs. 18% in the general population) and
      have substantial difficulties with quitting tobacco. Despite the significant morbidity and
      mortality associated with smoking, no smoking cessation treatments exist that intensively
      target PTSD symptoms as an obstacle to quit smoking, although this is a significant barrier
      to quitting for many Veterans. In addition, no smoking cessation treatments have a large
      emphasis on improving the functioning of Veterans with PTSD and tobacco dependence, although
      both PTSD and tobacco use negatively affect functioning across physical, mental health, and
      social domains.

      The goal of this SPiRE project is to evaluate Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Veterans
      with PTSD and Tobacco Use (ACT-PT), which is an acceptance and mindfulness-based smoking
      cessation treatment for Veterans with PTSD and tobacco dependence. ACT-PT specifically
      targets smoking cravings related to PTSD symptoms and memories of trauma, in addition to
      difficulties managing PTSD symptoms. negative affect and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during
      quit attempts. ACT-PT includes structured intervention components that guide Veterans to
      replace smoking as a coping strategy for PTSD symptoms and memories with alternative coping
      strategies (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance). And healthy living activities (e.g., engaging in
      work, expanding social networks, engaging in physical exercise) that are consistent with
      Veterans' values.

      This project involves a small randomized clinical trial study of Veteran smokers with PTSD
      and tobacco dependence randomized to one of two different types of psychosocial treatment:
      ACT-PT versus the American Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking Program [FFS]. This study
      has two primary aims: 1) evaluate the relative feasibility and acceptability of the two
      interventions (including ease of recruitment, randomization proportion, staff and Veteran
      acceptance of the treatment, retention rates, treatment adherence, fidelity, ease of the
      assessment process), and 2) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ACT-PT vs. FFS with the
      primary outcomes of tobacco use, PTSD symptoms, health-related quality of life, and
      functional impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with PTSD have high rates of smoking (34%-86% vs. 18% in the general population) and
      have substantial difficulties with quitting tobacco. Only 23% of individuals with PTSD quit
      smoking compared to 50% of the general population. As a result, Veterans with PTSD are at
      high risk of developing severe health problems and poor physical functioning. Fifty percent
      of these long-term smokers will die of a smoking-related cause and on average, will lose 25
      years of their life compared to non-smokers. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality
      associated with smoking, no smoking cessation treatments exist that intensively target PTSD
      symptoms as an obstacle to quit smoking, although this is a significant barrier to quitting
      for many Veterans. In addition, no smoking cessation treatments have a large emphasis on
      improving the functioning of Veterans with PTSD and tobacco dependence, although both PTSD
      and tobacco use negatively affect functioning across physical, mental health, and social
      domains.

      The goal of this SPiRE project is to evaluate Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Veterans
      with PTSD and Tobacco Use (ACT-PT), which is an acceptance and mindfulness-based smoking
      cessation treatment for Veterans with PTSD and tobacco dependence. ACT-PT specifically
      targets smoking cravings related to PTSD symptoms and memories of trauma, in addition to
      difficulties managing PTSD symptoms. negative affect and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during
      quit attempts. ACT-PT includes structured intervention components that guide Veterans to
      replace smoking as a coping strategy for PTSD symptoms and memories with alternative coping
      strategies (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance). And healthy living activities (e.g., engaging in
      work, expanding social networks, engaging in physical exercise) that are consistent with
      Veterans' values. This emphasis on substantially improving health-related quality of life and
      functioning across several areas makes ACT-PT particularly innovative and different from
      existing treatments. However, research is needed on the relative feasibility, acceptability,
      and efficacy of ACT-PT compared to standard smoking cessation treatments.

      This project involves a randomized clinical trial study of Veteran smokers with PTSD and
      tobacco dependence randomized to one of two different types of psychosocial treatment: ACT-PT
      versus the American Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking Program [FFS] with all
      participants. This study has two primary aims: 1) evaluate the relative feasibility and
      acceptability of the two interventions (including ease of recruitment, randomization
      proportion, staff and Veteran acceptance of the treatment, retention rates, treatment
      adherence, fidelity, ease of the assessment process), and 2) evaluate the preliminary
      efficacy of ACT-PT vs. FFS with the primary outcomes of tobacco use, PTSD symptoms,
      health-related quality of life, and functional impairment.

    <description>The PCL-5 is a brief, self-report symptom checklist that assesses the 20 symptoms of PTSD outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) and was designed to assess symptom changes during and after treatment in addition to screening. The PCL has shown satisfactory temporal stability, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity. The minimum value of the PCL-5 is 0, and the maximum value is 80. Higher scores indicate more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item self-report measure of current physical, mental health, and social functioning. We are reporting the mental health functioning outcome. A total score was computed by summing and transforming the five-item scores into a score between 0 (lowest mental health) and 100 (highest mental health). Lower scores indicate more severe functioning related to mental health problems.</description>

    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire is a commonly used self-report measure to assess quality of life in several domains: general activities, physical health, subjective feelings, leisure time activities, social relationships, work, and household duties. Higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfaction with life. The scoring of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire involves summing the first 14 items to yield a total score. The total score ranges from 14 to 70 and is expressed as a percentage based on the maximum total score of the items completed (0-100).</description>

Lower scores indicate more severe functioning related to mental health problems.</description>

ACT-PT includes structured intervention components that guide Veterans to replace smoking as a coping strategy for PTSD symptoms and memories with alternative coping strategies (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance).

Higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfaction with life. The scoring of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire involves summing the first 14 items to yield a total score. The total score ranges from 14 to 70 and is expressed as a percentage based on the maximum total score of the items completed (0-100).</description>
