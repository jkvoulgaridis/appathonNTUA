      The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of modeling-based bone
      formation in the femoral neck in participants who have received denosumab and are undergoing
      total hip replacement (THR).

    <description>Femoral neck bone samples were prepared according to standard procedures for bone histology and bone histomorphometry at a central bone histomorphometry facility.
Modeling based formation units in active bone‐forming, tetracycline‐labeled surfaces were identified by a smooth cement line.
The percentage of participants with fluorochrome labeling present in the cancellous or periosteal, or endocortical surfaces of the femoral neck indicative of modeling-based bone formation is reported.</description>

        <description>Femoral neck bone samples were prepared according to standard procedures for bone histology and bone histomorphometry at a central bone histomorphometry facility.
Modeling based formation units in active bone‐forming, tetracycline‐labeled surfaces were identified by a smooth cement line. The number of modeling based formation units was evaluated at the cancellous, periosteal, and endocortical regions and is reported in units per mm of bone surface.</description>
