      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief, behavioral treatment for insomnia
      is effective in addressing social and occupational functioning and overall health among
      Veterans with insomnia disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of a telephone-based, brief insomnia treatment
      in primary care in order to accomplish the goal of improving psychosocial functioning in
      Veterans who meet criteria for Insomnia Disorder. The primary outcome for the trial will be
      psychosocial functioning, with insomnia severity serving as the secondary outcome. Additional
      goals include evaluating durability of treatment gains and obtaining feedback from
      participants about the utility and feasibility of the proposed insomnia treatment.

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from 1/6/16 to 8/9/18 through local advertisements, referrals from other research studies or VA clinicians and direct mailings to veterans that had established care at the San Francisco VA (SFVA) or that lived within a 40-mile radius of the SFVA.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 157 people provided consent for screening, 119 completed screening and 93 were eligible, enrolled and randomized to treatment. Of the 93, two were withdrawn during treatment or 6-month follow-up due to no longer meeting eligibility and two were pilot subjects that didn't meet inclusion criteria and weren’t included in data analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

BBTI consists of two in-person sessions, with the two other sessions conducted via telephone. BBTI emphasizes behavioral elements of insomnia treatment.

Next, a series of interventions are employed that are derived from sleep restriction and stimulus control techniques.

          <title>Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia</title>
          <description>Participants will receive 4 weeks of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI). BBTI consists of two in-person sessions, with the two other sessions conducted via telephone. BBTI emphasizes behavioral elements of insomnia treatment. Treatment begins with sleep education and discussion of the biological rhythms that influence sleep cycles. Next, a series of interventions are employed that are derived from sleep restriction and stimulus control techniques.

          <description>Participants will receive 4 weeks of progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT). PMRT consists of two in-person and two phone sessions. Treatment begins with training on muscle tensing and relaxing, and advances to progressively more efficient tensing-relaxing and passive relaxation exercises. Sessions are employed that teach techniques and problem-solve barriers to the use of PMRT.
