      This is a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study efficacy
      and safety of the Viaskin® Milk Patch for children with milk induced Eosinophilic Esophagitis
      (EoE). 20 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to Viaskin® Milk or placebo patch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study the efficacy and safety
      of Viaskin® Milk, an allergen extract of milk administered epicutaneously using the Viaskin®
      epicutaneous delivery system (EPIT) in subjects from 4 to 17 years old with a milk induced
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio into two different
      treatment groups, to receive EPIT with Viaskin® Milk (500 µg of milk proteins) or placebo.

      Subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period (approximately 11 months), will
      automatically rollover into an open label treatment period (additional 11 months). All
      subjects will receive the 500 µg (micrograms) Viaskin Milk patch.

    <description>Esophageal biopsy samples will be obtained prior to randomization and after completion of treatment. Intraepithelial eosinophils will be counted in all high powered fields (HPFs) using light microscopy. A HPF will be counted only if at least half of the field is occupied by tissue. The maximum eosinophil count per HPF will be reported for each esophageal biopsy site (at each of 2 levels).
The maximum eosinophil count for each patient will be calculated from either level. For the final outcome, mean from each individual patients maximum eosinophil count/hpf along with standard deviation will be calculated.</description>

        <description>Esophageal biopsy samples will be obtained prior to randomization and after completion of treatment. Intraepithelial eosinophils will be counted in all high powered fields (HPFs) using light microscopy. A HPF will be counted only if at least half of the field is occupied by tissue. The maximum eosinophil count per HPF will be reported for each esophageal biopsy site (at each of 2 levels).
The maximum eosinophil count for each patient will be calculated from either level. For the final outcome, mean from each individual patients maximum eosinophil count/hpf along with standard deviation will be calculated.</description>

        <description>Upper endoscopies with biopsies (2 each of proximal and distal, plus any inflamed areas) will be completed before and after each treatment period. Each endoscopy will be scored using a validated standardized measure which examines 4 major esophageal features (rings, furrows, exudates and edema) and the presence of minor features of narrow caliber esophagus, feline esophagus, stricture and crepe paper esophagus. Each feature is graded: 0-none, 1 mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe. The scores are summed including both minor and major criteria.
Total score is presented and lower score is better. The range is from 0-12</description>
