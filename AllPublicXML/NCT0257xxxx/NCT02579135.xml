    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an educational web-based intervention designed to increase adolescent
      girls' motivation and skills to engage in safer sexual behavior (Project HEART: Health
      Education and Relationship Training). Half of participants will receive Project HEART and
      half of participants will receive Project Growing Minds, an attention-matched control website
      focused on growth mindsets of intelligence and self-regulation. The ultimate goal of this
      work is to help girls reduce their risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and to
      avoid unplanned pregnancies.

      Primary outcomes for this study include 1) acceptability of the program, 2) communication
      self-efficacy, and 3) communication intentions.

    <measure>6-item Self-report of Program Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-test at completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Program acceptability was assessed through a questionnaire that was adapted from prior acceptability surveys. Specifically, six items were included to assess six aspects of acceptability: (i) an intent to return to the website, (ii) whether one would recommend the program to a friend, (iii) whether one would use information from the program in the future, (iv) how much one liked the program, (v) how much one learned from the program and (vi) how much one felt the program kept their attention. The first three questions were coded with dichotomous response options (yes/noâ€”unsure), whereas the last three items used a four point Likert-type scale ranging from 1=not at all to 4=a lot. For analyses, these last 3 items were dichotomized into 1=a lot and 0=not a lot.</description>

    <measure>7-item Self-report of Sexual Communication Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-test at completion of intervention and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>We used the validated Self-Efficacy for HIV Prevention Scale to assess communication self-efficacy. Seven items assessed confidence communicating about sexual topics (e.g., &quot;How sure are you that you could talk to your partner about safer sex?&quot;). Participants responded from 1 for &quot;couldn't do it&quot; to 4 for &quot;very sure.&quot; Scores were averaged with higher scores indicating greater confidence in communicating about sex (alpha = 0.82).</description>

    <measure>3-item Self-report of Sexual Communication Intentions Over Next 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-test at completion of intervention and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed intentions to communicate about sex with items from the AIDS Risk Behavior Assessment. Three items captured the likelihood of communicating with a partner in the next 3 months about (1) sexual limits and boundaries, (2) STDs and pregnancy, and (3) condom use. Options ranged from 0% to 100% to indicate the likelihood of communicating with a partner. We averaged scores to create a composite (possible range 0-100); higher scores indicated greater likelihood of sexual communication (alpha = 0.84).</description>

          <description>Program acceptability was assessed through a questionnaire that was adapted from prior acceptability surveys. Specifically, six items were included to assess six aspects of acceptability: (i) an intent to return to the website, (ii) whether one would recommend the program to a friend, (iii) whether one would use information from the program in the future, (iv) how much one liked the program, (v) how much one learned from the program and (vi) how much one felt the program kept their attention. The first three questions were coded with dichotomous response options (yes/noâ€”unsure), whereas the last three items used a four point Likert-type scale ranging from 1=not at all to 4=a lot. For analyses, these last 3 items were dichotomized into 1=a lot and 0=not a lot.</description>

Participants responded from 1 for &quot;couldn't do it&quot; to 4 for &quot;very sure.&quot; Scores were averaged with higher scores indicating greater confidence in communicating about sex (alpha = 0.82).</description>

        <description>We assessed intentions to communicate about sex with items from the AIDS Risk Behavior Assessment. Three items captured the likelihood of communicating with a partner in the next 3 months about (1) sexual limits and boundaries, (2) STDs and pregnancy, and (3) condom use. Options ranged from 0% to 100% to indicate the likelihood of communicating with a partner. We averaged scores to create a composite (possible range 0-100); higher scores indicated greater likelihood of sexual communication (alpha = 0.84).</description>
