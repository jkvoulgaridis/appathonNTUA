  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational
      product (3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced High Endurance Skin Protectant) for the treatment of
      incontinence associated dermatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluated the product performance of a new skin protectant
      formulated to protect damaged and denuded skin even in the presence of exposure to the most
      potentially damaging body fluids, such as liquid stool and gastric fluid. The product is
      expected to intimately adhere to damaged and denuded skin and provide better protection from
      further damage than commonly used products such as moisture barrier pastes, thereby making it
      easier for nursing staff to cleanse the skin after incontinence episodes, thus saving time
      and also materials.

      The denuded sites on buttocks/thighs will be scored for skin loss and degree of redness. Over
      the course of time, with the skin protected, it should re-epithelizes. The skin improvement
      will be scored and the change in baseline over time monitored.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to End of Study in Incontinence Associated Dermatitis (IAD) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 21 days depending on length of hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint was percent decrease in Incontinence Associated Dermatitis (IAD) score from baseline to end of subject's participation. A negative value indicates increased IAD score; a positive value indicates decreased IAD score. IAD scores were calculated for 6 anatomical zones for color, presence of lesions, and skin loss using 3M's Skin Condition Assessment Tool. Skin condition assessed for 1) epidermal loss depth &amp; area involved; 2) skin color intact skin &amp; % area if not normal color. Intensity scored based on % area involved. Epidermal loss intensity rating scores ranged from 0 (none) - 4 (76-100%) partial (skin open, not weeping) or complete (skin open &amp; weeping). Color of intact skin rating scores ranged from 0 (skin color normal) - 4 (76-100%) skin color pink or red. Scores for each of the 6 body zones were combined to obtain a single IAD score for each subject. IAD scores ranged from 0 (best) - 720 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Pain Scores During Incontinence Management</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 21 days depending on length of hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores during incontinence management were measured on a 0-10 scale, and analyzed only for subjects from the intent-to-treat dataset who could report pain. Adult pain was measured on 0-10 Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Scale Visual Analog to see if there is pain reduction (0 - no pain; 10 - worst pain). Pain in pediatric patients was measured with the 0-10 FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Behavioral) Tool. FLACC tool scores pain based on 5 categories, each scored on 0-2 scale and a total score calculated from the sum of the 5 categories for a total possible 0 (no pain) - 10 (worst pain) score. Data from the 2 scales were combined for analysis. Reduction in pain scores collected during product application were reported and least squares means adjusted for baseline pain score as a covariate were calculated. Negative value indicates reduction in pain score; positive value indicates increased pain score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to End of Study in Incontinence Associated Dermatitis (IAD) Scores</title>
        <description>Primary endpoint was percent decrease in Incontinence Associated Dermatitis (IAD) score from baseline to end of subject's participation. A negative value indicates increased IAD score; a positive value indicates decreased IAD score. IAD scores were calculated for 6 anatomical zones for color, presence of lesions, and skin loss using 3M's Skin Condition Assessment Tool. Skin condition assessed for 1) epidermal loss depth &amp; area involved; 2) skin color intact skin &amp; % area if not normal color. Intensity scored based on % area involved. Epidermal loss intensity rating scores ranged from 0 (none) - 4 (76-100%) partial (skin open, not weeping) or complete (skin open &amp; weeping). Color of intact skin rating scores ranged from 0 (skin color normal) - 4 (76-100%) skin color pink or red. Scores for each of the 6 body zones were combined to obtain a single IAD score for each subject. IAD scores ranged from 0 (best) - 720 (worst).</description>

        <population>Analysis was done using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, using all subjects who had at least one dose of their assigned product.</population>

        <title>Pain Scores During Incontinence Management</title>
        <description>Pain scores during incontinence management were measured on a 0-10 scale, and analyzed only for subjects from the intent-to-treat dataset who could report pain. Adult pain was measured on 0-10 Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Scale Visual Analog to see if there is pain reduction (0 - no pain; 10 - worst pain). Pain in pediatric patients was measured with the 0-10 FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Behavioral) Tool. FLACC tool scores pain based on 5 categories, each scored on 0-2 scale and a total score calculated from the sum of the 5 categories for a total possible 0 (no pain) - 10 (worst pain) score. Data from the 2 scales were combined for analysis. Reduction in pain scores collected during product application were reported and least squares means adjusted for baseline pain score as a covariate were calculated. Negative value indicates reduction in pain score; positive value indicates increased pain score.</description>
