  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to stratify a frailty population based on nutrients
      profiling (amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids) and metabolic profiling (low
      molecular weight metabolites in urine and plasma) at baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study will investigate ways to better characterize the frailty phenotype by
      a combination of i) geriatric assessment (here only: frailty criteria according to Fried),
      ii) clinical surrogate markers (including those of inflammation), iii) body composition, iv)
      nutritional profiling, v) metabolite profiling using a metabolomics approaches.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Unless otherwise specified, subjects who fulfill all of the following will be included:

          1. Caucasian

          2. Male or female between the ages of 65 and 79 years old

          3. Three or more Fried Frailty Criteria (as diagnosed by investigator)

          4. Informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following criteria would render a subject ineligible for inclusion:

          1. Dementia (previously diagnosed by general practitioner)

          2. Hb1c (glycate Haemoglobin) &gt;7.5% (&gt;58 mmol/mol).

          3. End stage disease (1 year after last chemotherapy treatment for cancer)

          4. Drug abuse (alcohol - assessed by investigator)

          5. Medications: no antibiotic treatment (for at least 4 weeks), immune suppressants, and
             or chronic use of corticosteroids

          6. Currently participating or having participated in another clinical or nutritional
             intervention trial during the last 3 month

          7. Chronic active inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, lupus
             erythematosus and Crohn's disease)

          8. Chronic Active hepatitis

          9. Kidney failure in Dialysis treatment

         10. Any other condition that in the judgment of the lead investigator would not allow the
             subject to complete the study protocol
