    <textblock>
      IMCgp100-102 is a Phase I/II study of the weekly intra-patient escalation dose regimen with
      IMCgp100 as a single agent in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). According to
      this regimen, all patients in the trial will receive 2 weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose
      level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II dose (RP2D-QW) and then a dose
      escalation will commence at the third weekly dose at C1D15. The Phase I testing of the
      intra-patient escalation dosing regimen is designed to achieve a higher exposure and maximal
      plasma concentration of IMCgp100 after doses at Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) and thereafter .

      This is a Phase I/II clinical study of IMCgp100 in patients with advanced uveal melanoma.

      This is a Phase I/II study of IMCgp100 administered on a weekly basis with an intra-patient
      escalation dosing regimen. The intra-patient escalation occurs at the third weekly dose on
      Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15). According to this regimen, all patients in the trial will receive 2
      weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II
      dose (RP2D-QW) and then a dose escalation will commence at the third weekly dose at C1D15
      with the goal to achieve a long-term dosing regimen at a dose higher than that identified for
      the straight weekly dosing regimen (RP2D-QW). The dose escalation will identify the
      intra-patient escalation regimen (RP2D-IE).

      The Phase I portion of the study was a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. The Phase 1
      portion of the study is now complete. The recommended Phase II dose of the intra-patient
      escalation dose regimen (RP2D-IE) was identified and the 2 expansion cohorts in metastatic
      uveal melanoma will be completed. The cohorts will enroll patients with metastatic uveal
      melanoma and are defined based on prior therapy The expansion portion will enroll
      approximately 150 patients.

             intra-articular or inhaled medications) are acceptable

         14. Major surgery within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug (minimally invasive
             procedures such as bronchoscopy, tumor biopsy, insertion of a central venous access
             device, and insertion of a feeding tube are not considered major surgery and are not
             exclusionary)

         15. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug, with the exception of
             palliative radiotherapy to a limited field, such as for the treatment of bone pain or
             a focally painful tumor mass

         16. Use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (eg, G-CSF, GMCSF, M-CSF) â‰¤ 2
             weeks prior to start of study drug. Patients must have completed therapy with any
             hematopoietic colony-stimulating factor at least 2 weeks before the first dose of
             study drug is given. An erythroid stimulating agent is allowed as long as it was
             initiated at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and the patient
             is not red blood cell transfusion dependent

         17. Pregnant, likely to become pregnant, or lactating women (where pregnancy is defined as
             the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation)

         18. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or patients currently requiring chronic, systemic
             corticosteroid therapy at any dose for longer than 2 weeks. Local steroid therapies
             (eg, otic, ophthalmic, intraarticular, or inhaled medications) are acceptable

         19. Patients may not have been included in any prior IMCgp100 trial, regardless of
             treatment cohort
