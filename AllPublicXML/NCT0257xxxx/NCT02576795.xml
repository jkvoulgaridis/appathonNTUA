        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males that are 18 years or older with established severe Haemophilia A as evidenced by
             their medical history. Patients will be considered as severe if their base FVIII level
             is 1 IU/dL or less

          2. Treated/exposed to FVIII concentrates or cryoprecipitate for a minimum of 150 exposure
             days (EDs)

          3. Greater or equal to 12 bleeding episodes only if on on-demand therapy over the
             previous 12 months. Does not apply to patients on prophylaxis

          4. Able to sign informed consent and comply with requirements of the trial

          5. No history of inhibitor, and results from a modified Nijmegen Bethesda assay of less
             than 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) 2 consecutive occasions at least one week apart within
             the past 12 months

          6. Sexually active patients must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             such as double barrier, including hormonal contraception for at least 6 months
             post-treatment. After 6 months, subjects may stop contraception use only if they have
             had 3 consecutive semen samples below the limit of detection of the test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Detectable pre-existing immunity to the AAV5 capsid as measured by AAV5 transduction
             inhibition or AAV5 total antibodies

          2. Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder.

          3. HIV positive

          4. Significant liver dysfunction as defined by abnormal elevation of:

               -  ALT (alanine transaminase) to 3 times the upper limit of normal;

               -  Bilirubin above 3 times the upper limit of normal;

               -  Alkaline phosphatase above 3 times the upper limit of normal; or

               -  INR (international normalized ratio) ≥ 1.4.

          5. Potential participants who have had a liver biopsy in the past 3 years are excluded if
             they had significant fibrosis of 3 or 4, as rated on a scale of 0-4.

          6. Evidence of any bleeding disorder not related to Haemophilia A

          7. Platelet count of &lt; 100 x 10^9/L

          8. Creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL

          9. Liver cirrhosis of any etiology as assessed by liver ultrasound

         10. Hepatitis B if surface antigen is positive

         11. Hepatitis C if RNA is positive

         12. Treatment with any IP within 30 days prior to the end of the screening period

         13. Any disease or condition at the physician's discretion that would prevent the patient
             from fully complying with the requirements of the study including possible
             corticosteroid treatment outlined in the protocol. The physician may exclude patients
             unwilling or unable to agree on not using alcohol for the 16-week period following the
             viral infusion.

         14. Prior treatment with any gene transfer agent

         15. Major surgery planned in the 16-week period following the viral infusion

         16. Use of systemic immunosuppressive agents or live vaccines within 30 days before the
             viral infusion
