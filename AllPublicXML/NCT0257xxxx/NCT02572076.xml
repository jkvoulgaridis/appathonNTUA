      The Motus GI Colon Cleansing device is intended to facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a
      poorly prepared colon by irrigating the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid and feces.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Boston Bowel Preparation Scale( BBPS) &gt;1 in All Colon Segments After the Use of MCS</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours- During the colonoscopy procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The rating of the cleansing quality was evaluated by using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), Segment score of 0-3 given to each of the 3 segments of the colon (Left side, Transverse and right side):
Score 0- Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.
Score 1- A portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen, but other areas of the colon segment are not seen well due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid.
Score 2- A minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool, and/or opaque liquid are visible, but the mucosa of the colon segment are seen well.
Score 3-The entire mucosa of the colon segment is seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool, or opaque liquid.

    <description>The MCS enables colon cleansing during standard colonoscopy using a standard colonoscope. The cleansing device, which is attached to the tip of the colonoscope and is connected to an external workstation, generates fluid jets within the colon thus dissolving the feces into small parts. The fecal matter &amp; fluids are drained through the evacuation pipe of the cleansing device into a collecting reservoir.</description>
