      Background:

      Allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is when stem cells are taken from one person s blood or
      bone marrow and given to another person. Researchers think this may help people with immune
      system problems.

      Objective:

      To see if allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant is safe and effective in treating people
      with primary immunodeficiencies.

      Eligibility:

      Donors: Healthy people ages 4 or older

      Recipients: People ages 4-75 with a primary immunodeficiency that may be treated with
      allogeneic blood or marrow transplant

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

      Participants will have urine tests, EKG, and chest x-ray.

      Donors will have:

      Bone marrow harvest: With anesthesia, marrow is taken by a needle in the hipbone.

      OR

      Blood collection: They will have several drug injections over 5-7 days. Blood is taken by IV
      in one arm, circulates through a machine to remove stem cells, and returned by IV in the
      other arm.

      Possible vein assessment or pre-anesthesia evaluation

      Recipients will have:

      Lung test, heart tests, radiology scans, CT scans, and dental exam

      Possible tissue biopsies or lumbar puncture

      Bone marrow and a small piece of bone removed by needle in the hipbone.

      Chemotherapy 1-2 weeks before transplant day

      Donor stem cell donation through a catheter put into a vein in the chest or neck

      Several-week hospital stay. They will take medications and may need blood transfusions and
      additional procedures.

      After discharge, recipients will:

      Remain near the clinic for about 3 months. They will have weekly visits and may require
      hospital readmission.

      Have multiple follow-up visits to the clinic in the first 6 months, and less frequently for
      at least 5 years.

      Background:

        -  Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are conditions associated with major
           quantitative or qualitative immunologic abnormalities that are, in most cases, due to
           defects in cells of hematopoietic origin

        -  Patients with PID can have life-threatening complications including malignancy,
           recurrent infection, and autoimmunity/immune dysregulation

        -  Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (allo BMT) has the potential to cure the
           immune defect in PID and thereby reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with
           these diseases

      Objectives:

      -To estimate the acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD)-free, graft failure-free survival at
      day +180 after allo BMT, analyzed separately by conditioning arm/cohort

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years

        -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two
           criteria below:

        -  PID as defined by monogenetic mutation or, in the absence of a mutation, patients with
           an immune defect potentially amenable to allo BMT who meet the clinical history criteria
           below may be eligible

        -  Clinical history of at least two of the following:

             -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection

             -  Protracted or recurrent infections

             -  Infection with an opportunistic organism

             -  Chronic elevation in the blood of a latent virus

             -  Evidence of immune dysregulation

             -  Hypogammaglobulinemia/dysglobulinemia

             -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder

             -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion

        -  At least one 9-10/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an HLA-haploidentical
           related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Consensus opinion by the investigative team that the patient has the potential to
           benefit from transplant despite existing, non-hematopoietic organ dysfunction

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  HIV negative

        -  Disease status: patients with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation,
           except in the case of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any time

      Design:

        -  The study will have two arms that vary in mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) duration.

        -  RIC and RIC-MMF arms: pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days -11 and -7, low-dose
           cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically
           dosed, on days -3 and -2.

        -  Bone marrow is the preferred graft source. Peripheral blood stem cells are permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis:

           -- High-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4, sirolimus
           on days +5 through +90, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on days +5 through +35 for all
           arms except the RIC-MMF arm. The RIC-MMF arm will receive MMF of varying durations based
           on a duration de-escalation schema.

        -  Patients with DNA repair/telomere defects/familial cancer syndromes may receive a
           reduced dose (25 mg/kg/day) PTCy on days +3 and +4, in addition to sirolimus and MMF.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:

          -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years

          -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two
             criteria below:

               1. PID as defined by monogenetic mutation or, in the absence of a PID-associated
                  genetic mutation, patients with an immune defect potentially amenable to allo BMT
                  who meet the clinical history criteria below may be eligible upon discussion with
                  the PI

                    -  Mutations should be confirmed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, if such
                       testing is available.

                    -  Patients without a mutation must be deemed eligible and appropriate for allo
                       BMT by the PI. Some patients may meet the clinical history criteria listed
                       below, but will not be eligible if it is thought that their clinical history
                       is due to a condition apart from an immune defect. In addition, patients
                       with a PID of mild severity, such as those with selective IgA deficiency,
                       may meet at least two of the clinical history criteria, but may be deemed
                       inappropriate for allo BMT by the PI if it is felt that the risks of the
                       procedure outweigh the severity of the disease.

               2. Clinical history of at least two of the following:

                    -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection

                    -  Protracted or recurrent infections requiring unusually long or repeated
                       courses of antibiotics

                    -  Infection with an opportunistic organism

                    -  Chronic elevation in the blood (greater than or equal to 2 documented
                       elevations over a period of 6 months or longer) of a latent virus (EBV, CMV,
                       HHV6, HHV8, etc.)

                    -  Evidence of immune dysregulation, as manifested by autoimmune disease,
                       atopy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome,
                       granulomas, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy

                    -  Patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation
                       syndrome related to an underlying lymphoma with no other clinical history
                       suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency will not be eligible

                    -  Hypogammaglobulinemia, dysglobulinemia, or impaired response to vaccination

                    -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder

                    -  Tissue diagnosis should be confirmed by NCI Department of Pathology, if
                       prior biopsies are available

                    -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion

                    -  Tissue diagnosis should be confirmed by NCI Departmentof Pathology, if prior
                       biopsies are available

          -  Availability of at least one 9-10/10 HLA-matched related (excluding an identical twin)
             or unrelated donor, or an HLA-haploidentical related donor

          -  Consensus among the PI, key AIs, and consultants (as necessary) that correction of the
             patient s immune system through BMT has the potential to improve the patient s health,
             quality of life, and/or life expectancy, after taking into consideration the patient s
             existing non-hematopoietic, potentially irreversible organ dysfunction

          -  Adequate end-organ function, as measured by:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 40% by 2D
                  echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA, or left ventricular shortening fraction greater
                  than or equal to 20% by ECHO for patients receiving RIC or RIC-MMF, or LVEF
                  greater than or equal to 30% if the patient has radiologic evidence of aortic,
                  renal, or coronary artery vasculitis.

               -  Pulmonary function tests: DL(co) (corrected for hemoglobin) and FEV(1) greater
                  than or equal to 40% of predicted for the RIC and RIC-MMF arms; or in pediatric
                  patients, if unable to perform pulmonary function tests, there should be no
                  evidence of dyspnea at rest, no requirement for supplemental oxygen, and oxygen
                  saturation &gt;92% on room air. Calculations will be based on the values reported in
                  CRIS.

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert s syndrome or
                  hemolysis) for patients receiving RIC or RIC-MMF; ALT and AST less than or equal
                  to 10 times ULN for patients receiving RIC or RIC-MMF. Patients who are above
                  these bilirubin, ALT, or AST thresholds may be eligible for the RIC or RIC-MMF
                  arms if evaluated by a hepatologist who deems the liver function test
                  abnormalities to be potentially reversible with bone marrow transplant.

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 40 mL/min/1.73 m(2),
                  calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for adults and Schwartz formula for
                  pediatric patients, for patients with creatinine levels above the institutional
                  upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate central venous access potential

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of greater than or equal to 60% or ECOG
             performance status of 2 or less

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document

          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful
             to a fetus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for at least one year post-allo BMT. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in the study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Disease status: Patients with malignancy are to be referred in remission for
             evaluation, except in cases of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any
             time. Should a patient have progressive disease or a donor becomes unavailable after
             enrollment, the patient will be referred back to his/her primary
             hematologist-oncologist for treatment. If this course of action is not in the best
             interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient
             may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study,
             although this should only occur as a bridge to transplant. If under either of these
             settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to
             transplant, then he/she must come off the study. Patients receiving standard therapy
             will be told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits, alternatives to
             the proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere,
             outside of a research protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of
             virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation
             prior to allo BMT.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to agents (cyclophosphamide, busulfan, pentostatin, sirolimus, MMF, G-CSF)
             used in the study

          -  Active psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with the transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy, except in cases of
             virus-associated malignancies with CNS involvement in which case the patient may
             benefit from the transplant to control the malignancy.

          -  MAGT1 mutation and active need to take anti-platelet agents and/or therapeutic
             anti-coagulation that cannot be interrupted during aplasia.

          -  HIV positive or other acquired immunodeficiency that, as determined by the PI,
             interferes with the assessment of PID severity and/or the attribution of clinical
             manifestations of immunodeficiency to a PID.

        Inclusion Criteria (Related Donor):

        -Related donor deemed suitable and eligible and willing to donate per clinical evalations
        who are additionally willing to donate blood, urine, and marrow specimens for research.
        Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing Standard Policies and
        Procedures for determination of eligibility and suitability for clinical donation. Note
        that participation in this study is offered to all related donors but is not required for
        clinical donation, so it is possible that not all related donors will enroll on this study.

        Exclusion Criteria (Related Donor):

        None

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:

        -Unrelated donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and
        Procedures, available at:
        http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplant-network/Standards/, except for the
        additional requirement of EBV serostatus testing. Note that participation in this study is
        offered to all unrelated donors but not required for clinical donation, so it is possible
        that not all unrelated donors will enroll on this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:

        -Unrelated donors: failure to qualify as a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donor per
        current NMDP Standards, available at:
