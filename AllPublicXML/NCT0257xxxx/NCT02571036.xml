    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) dose-escalation study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      preliminary antitumor activity of DCC-2618, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with
      advanced malignancies. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase and an
      expansion phase.

             Eligible patients include the following:

               1. GIST patients must have a KIT and PDGFRA mutation and must have progressed on or
                  had an intolerability to at least 1 line of systemic anticancer therapy.

               2. SM patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of advanced SM according to 2016
                  World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SM and must have documented KIT

                  progressed on or were intolerant to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients with
                  advanced SM must present with at least 1 eligible C-Finding (organ damage) per
                  2013 International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and
                  Treatment (IWG-MRT) &amp; European Competence Network on Mastocytosis consensus
                  response criteria; please see below for MCL exception.

             i. Aggressive SM (ASM)

             ii. SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), wherein the AHN does not require
             immediate alternative therapy. AHNs that are eligible include: low grade
             myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a high SM burden who require treatment for SM
             only, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN, unclassifiable MDS, and HES/CEL.

             iii. MCL

             â€¢ Patients with histopathologically-confirmed MCL without a C-finding are eligible.

             iv. Symptomatic SSM

             â€¢ By definition, SSM patients must have at least 2 B-findings, and clinically
             significant symptom burden (eg, flushing, diarrhea, etc.) despite maximal treatment
             with approved agents to treat mediator symptoms, such as antihistamines and cromolyn
             sodium.

             v. Patients with hematologic malignancies featuring clonal expansion of eosinophils
             driven by genomic alterations of KIT or PDGFRA (eg, HES or CEL) are eligible if they
             have progressed on or are intolerant of imatinib therapy. Patients with de novo
             imatinib resistant mutations, such as but not limited to KIT D816V or PDGFRA D842V,
             are eligible without prior imatinib therapy.

             c. Malignant glioma patients with genomic alterations potentially conferring
             sensitivity to DCC-2618 including, but not limited to, amplification and/or mutations
             of PDGFRA and/or KIT.

             Other solid tumor patients that have alterations in genes encoding kinases that are
             targets of DCC-2618. This includes:

               -  Melanoma

               -  Soft tissue sarcoma patients (including but not limited to: malignant peripheral
                  nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT), and
                  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tumors (DFSP)

               -  Other solid tumor patients (non-melanoma, non-STS; specifically germ-cell,
                  penile, and non-small cell lung carcinoma)

               -  Renal impairment cohort

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of â‰¤2.

          4. Adequate organ function and bone marrow function.

        Exclusion Criteria (Escalation and Expansion Phases)

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. GIST patients with wild type or unknown KIT or PDGFRA status.

          2. Patients with SM or other hematologic malignancies will be excluded if the following
             apply:

               1. SM patients with neutropenia accompanied by fever or infection, or
                  thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding.

                  â€¢ Patients with an infection that is well controlled with antibiotics are
                  eligible if there is an immediate need for treatment.

               2. SM-AHN patients diagnosed with:

             i. SM with MDS who require treatment for MDS. ii. Patients requiring immediate

             surgeries &gt;4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, all surgical wounds must be

         10. Any other clinically significant comorbidities.

         11. Illnesses that could affect oral absorption.

         12. Known human immunodeficiency virus or active hepatitis C infection only if the patient
