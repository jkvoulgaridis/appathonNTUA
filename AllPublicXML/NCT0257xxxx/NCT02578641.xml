    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open label, Phase III clinical trial for advanced
      Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma(NPC) Patients.

      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and carboplatin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving an infusion of a person's cytotoxic T cells (CTL) that have been treated in
      the laboratory may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Giving combination chemotherapy together with laboratory-treated T cells may kill more tumor
      cells. This Phase III trial is to assess if combined gemcitabine-carboplatin (GC) followed by
      adoptive T-cell therapy would improve clinical outcome for patients with advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). It is also the world's first, and largest, Phase 3 T-cell
      therapy cancer trial ever conducted, and enrollment is ongoing for 330 patients from 30
      hospital centers across Asia and the United States.

      This clinical trial is conducted on the back of a successful Phase 2 NPC trial involving 38
      patients at the National Cancer Centre, Singapore. This trial produced the best published
      2-year (62.9%), and median overall survival (OS) data (29.9 months) in 35 patients with
      advanced NPC who received autologous EBV-specific CTL. Kindly see
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978790/ for the Phase 2 publication titled
      &quot;Adoptive T-cell Transfer and Chemotherapy in the First line treatment of Metastatic and/or
      Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma&quot;.

      330 patients will be randomized after their eligibility status has been fully determined and
      informed consent has been obtained. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either Arm
      A (Gemcitabine and Carboplatin (GC) x 4* cycles and EBV-specific CTL) or Arm B (GC x 6 cycles
      alone) in a 1:1 ratio using a stratified block randomization scheme. The stratification
      variables are country and disease stage (metastatic vs locally recurrent). *Additional 1-2
      chemotherapy cycles (up to total 6 chemo cycles) might be given upon discretion of
      Investigator, if EBV-specific CTL infusions are not available in time for the 1st scheduled
      infusion.

      After randomization, patients in Arm A will have their peripheral blood taken for the
      establishment of cytotoxic T cell line and EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (CTL).
      Within two weeks of enrollment, patients will commence combination GC chemotherapy for a
      total of 4 cycles. Patients in Stage 2 of study will receive the EBV-specific CTL
      immunotherapy.

      As of 1 May 2020, patients who have not received the first infusion of EBV-specific CTLs,
      will instead continue to receive a total of 6 cycles combination of Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2)
      and carboplatin (AUC2) on Days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days
