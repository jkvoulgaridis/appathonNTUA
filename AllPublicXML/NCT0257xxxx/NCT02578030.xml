    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Vital signs included blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. ECG was analysed as 12-lead ECG. Clinical laboratory test is considered for biochemistry, Hematology and Urinalysis.</description>
