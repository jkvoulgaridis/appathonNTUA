    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPRIV therapy (60 units per
      kilogram [U/kg] every other week [EOW]) in treatment-naive participants with type 1 Gaucher
      disease on change from baseline in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score as
      measured by DXA after 24 months of treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 103 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the results will be converted to Z-scores appropriate for age, sex, and race. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range, race and with the same sex. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 51, 103 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow burden (BMB) score is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system for assessing the extent of bone marrow involvement in Gaucher disease. BMB scores will be calculated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the LS and femurs, and will be converted to between 0 and 8. A higher BMB score indicates more severe bone marrow involvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Severity of Bone Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 51 and 103 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone pain will be measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (short form). The BPI is developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. It will assess pain on scales for the severity of pain (0=No pain to 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine), impact of pain on daily function (0=Does not interfere to 10=Completely interferes), location of pain (area that hurts the most), pain medications (if any), and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week (0=No relief to 100=Complete relief).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 51 and 103 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall fatigue will be measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI is a 9-item questionnaire developed to assess subjective fatigue. Each question asks the respondent to rate the level of their experienced fatigue over the past 24 hours on an 11-point (0-10) scale. The first three questions measure fatigue severity at current, usual, and worst levels, respectively, with 0 indicating &quot;no fatigue&quot; and 10 indicating fatigue &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The following six questions assess the level fatigue interference with daily activities including general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work (both inside and outside the home), relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. A score of 0 corresponds to no interference while a score of 10 indicates complete interference.</description>

    <description>As per WHO BMD Classifications, bone mineral density will be classified based on LS T-scores as Normal for score &quot;-1.0 or greater&quot;; Low bone mass (osteopenia) for score &quot;Between 1-.0 and .2.5&quot;; Osteoporosis for score &quot;-2.5 and below&quot; and Severe osteoporosis for score &quot;-2.5 and below + fragility fracture&quot;.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has a documented diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease, as documented by
             deficient GCB activity in leukocytes (whole blood only) or cultured skin fibroblasts.
             Diagnosis by only dry blood spot test is insufficient. Diagnosis may be based on
             results obtained prior to screening if documented in the participant's medical
             history.

          -  Participants must have a LS BMD Z-score less than (&lt;) -1 or BMD T-score of &lt; -1 as
             measured by DXA during the screening phase.

          -  Participant is treatment-naive, that is (ie,) has not received ERT or SRT in the 12
             months prior to enrollment.

          -  The participant is greater than or equal to (&gt;=)18 and less than or equal to (&lt;=) 70
             years of age.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable
             method of contraception at all times during the study.

          -  The participant, or participant's legally authorized representative(s), if applicable,
             understands the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study and has provided
             written informed consent that has been approved by the Institutional Review
             Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).

          -  The participant must be sufficiently cooperative to participate in this clinical study
             as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Neurological symptoms indicating that the participant may have type 3 Gaucher disease.

          -  A significant comorbidity, which, as determined by the investigator, might affect
             study data or confound the study results (eg, malignancies, primary biliary cirrhosis,
             autoimmune liver disease, etc).

          -  Any osteoporosis-specific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with
             erythropoietin (or erythropoietin-like substances) during the past year.

          -  Structural, joint-associated bone damage of such extent and severity that the
             investigator deems it could impact participation in the study and assessment of
             relevant study endpoints (example, pain).

          -  The participant is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The participant has had a splenectomy.

          -  The participant is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical
             investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or device) within 30 days
             prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study.

          -  Severe vitamin D deficiency to the level that would be expected to result in
             osteomalacia (vitamin D &lt; 10 nanograms per milliliter [ng/mL] [25 nanomoles per liter
             {nmol/L}]). If there is mild vitamin D insufficiency at screening (vitamin D greater
             than [&gt;] 10 and &lt; 30 ng/mL) treat with 4000 IU vitamin D per day for 1 month and
             rescreen.

          -  The participant has previously interrupted ERT for safety reasons.

          -  The participant has had hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the
             excipients.
