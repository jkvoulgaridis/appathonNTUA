  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of V501 [quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (Type 6, 11, 16 and 18) L1
      virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine] in healthy Japanese boys. This study will consist of two
      periods. Period I of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of V501 up
      to Month 7. Period II of the study is to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety
      from Month 7 to Month 30. Two analyses are planned. The first analysis will be conducted when
      all subjects have completed their Month 7 visit or have been discontinued before that time.
      The second analysis will be conducted at the end of study. The primary hypothesis tested in
      this study is that seroconversion rates for the vaccine HPV types will be &gt;90% at 4 weeks
      postdose 3.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Seroconversion for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Antibodies to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were measured using a competitive luminex immunoassay 4 weeks after 3rd vaccination (Month 7). Antibody titers were expressed as milli Merck units/mL (mMU/mL). Seroconversion was defined as an anti-HPV 6 titer ≥20 mMU/mL, an anti-HPV 11 titer ≥16 mMU/mL, an anti-HPV 16 titer of ≥20 mMU/mL and an anti-HPV 18 titer of ≥24 mMU/mL.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated Oral Temperature (&gt;=37.5° C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 5 after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The parent/guardian of the participant was to record the participant's oral temperature in the evening after each study vaccination and daily for 4 days after each study vaccination. Elevated temperature was defined as ≥99.5°F (≥37.5ºC). The percentage of participants that had an elevated temperature was summarized.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Injection-site Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 5 after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. The parent/guardian of the participant was to record the presence of any vaccination report card (VRC)-prompted injection-site AEs that occurred in the 5 days after any vaccination. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (erythema, pain, and swelling) was summarized.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Systemic Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 15 after any vaccination</time_frame>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs an existing hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is a cancer, is an overdose, or is another important medical event. The percentage of participants that experienced 1 or more SAEs was summarized.</description>

    <time_frame>Four weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Antibodies to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were measured using a competitive luminex immunoassay. Antibody titers were expressed mMU/mL. GMTs obtained for each anti-HPV from this study were compared to each of the ant-HPV GMTs obtained in study V501-122 (NCT NCT01862874) in which Japanese males 16 to 26 years received V501 in the same 3 dose regimen, to test a hypothesis that would demonstrate non-inferiority.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. The parent/guardian of the participant was to record the presence of any vaccination report card (VRC)-prompted injection-site AEs that occurred in the 5 days after any vaccination. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (erythema, pain, and swelling) was summarized.</description>

          <population>All participants that received all 3 vaccinations within acceptable day ranges, were seronegative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1, did not have protocol violations that could interfere with evaluation of the immune response, and provided Month 18 data within an acceptable date range of 12 months postdose 3.</population>

          <description>Serum antibodies to HPV types were measured with a competitive luminex immunoassay. The serostatus cutoffs (mMU/mL) for HPV types were as follows: HPV Type 6: ≥20; HPV Type 11: ≥16; HPV Type 16: ≥20; HPV Type 18: ≥24.</description>
          <population>All participants that received all 3 vaccinations within acceptable day ranges, were seronegative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1, did not have protocol violations that could interfere with evaluation of the immune response, and provided Month 30 data within an acceptable date range of 24 months postdose 3.</population>
