  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell
      lymphoma (rrPMBCL) or relapsed or refractory Richter Syndrome (rrRS) will receive
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The efficacy of pembrolizumab in the treatment of rrPMBCL and rrRS
      will be evaluated. The primary study hypothesis is that intravenous (IV) administration of
      single agent pembrolizumab to the rrPMBCL cohort will result in an Objective Response Rate
      (ORR) of greater than 15% using the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria
      (Cheson, 2007) by independent central review.

      Effective with Protocol Amendment 04, enrollment into the rrRS cohort was closed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue for a maximum of 35 administrations (approximately
      2 years) or until documented disease progression by investigator assessment, unacceptable
      adverse event(s) (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of
      treatment, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with
      study treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 27 months (Database Cutoff: 28MAY2019)</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was assessed by independent central review utilizing the International Working Group [IWG] response assessment criteria per Cheson 2007 of pembrolizumab in participants with relapsed or refractory PMBCL. For participants with rrRS, IWG criteria with special considerations for RS was used for progression. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a response (complete response, CR or partial response, PR) prior to disease progression. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is the regression of measurable disease and no new sites. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. In the rrPMBCL cohort, an exact binomial test was conducted versus a fixed historical control rate. For the rrPMBCL cohort, the ORR was estimated as well as a 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method whereas the rrRS cohort was estimated with a 90% 2-sided CI.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on International Working Group (IWG) Response Assessment Criteria Per Independent Central Review</title>
        <description>The ORR was assessed by independent central review utilizing the International Working Group [IWG] response assessment criteria per Cheson 2007 of pembrolizumab in participants with relapsed or refractory PMBCL. For participants with rrRS, IWG criteria with special considerations for RS was used for progression. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a response (complete response, CR or partial response, PR) prior to disease progression. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is the regression of measurable disease and no new sites. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. In the rrPMBCL cohort, an exact binomial test was conducted versus a fixed historical control rate. For the rrPMBCL cohort, the ORR was estimated as well as a 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method whereas the rrRS cohort was estimated with a 90% 2-sided CI.</description>

          <description>The DCR, defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease response prior to disease progression. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is the regression of measurable disease and no new sites. Stable disease is the failure to attain CR/PR or PD. Progressive disease is the appearance any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% of previously involved site from nadir. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders.</description>
