  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CSJ137 in chronic hemodialysis
      patients. It is hypothesized that treatment with CSJ137 may improve the level of hemoglobin
      in patients on chronic hemodialysis with iron-restricted anemia while reducing the need for
      dosing with erythropoietin and intravenous iron in these patients.

      This posting discloses information about Part 1 of CCSJ137X2201. Another part, Part 2, of
      this trial was planned for conduct subsequent to the initiation of Part 1 and would have a
      different design than Part 1. However, due to internal strategic non-safety related decision,
      Part 2 is not going to be conducted and the trial will be terminated after Part 1.

          3. Receiving erythropoietin (EPO) therapy.

             indwelling vascular catheter (central venous line or non-tunneled/acute hemodialysis
             catheter) or active infection requiring antibiotic therapy at any time during the 2
             weeks prior to screening. Tunneled hemodialysis catheters, and other &quot;permanent&quot;
             catheters are permitted.

          8. Blood transfusion administered within 4 weeks prior to baseline.
