      The main purpose of this study is to assess the effect of smoking status on the success of
      Etanercept therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis was based on the following rationale:

        -  Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with several extracutaneous
           manifestations and significant comorbidities (among others cardiovascular disease,
           metabolic syndrome, obesity and depression).

        -  An increased prevalence of smoking among psoriasis patients, as compared with healthy
           subjects, has been observed in several studies

        -  More recent studies suggest that cigarette smoking may trigger the development of
           psoriasis through oxidative, inflammatory and genetic mechanisms.Furthermore, smoking is
           associated with the clinical severity of psoriasis

        -  Smoking also contributes to higher morbidity and mortality from smoking related
           disorders in these patients There is now some evidence that patients with psoriasis who
           smoke tend to be less responsive to treatment

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Assessment and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Body divided into 4 sections (head and neck [h], arms [u], trunk [t], legs [l]); each area scored by itself and scores combined for final PASI score. For each section, percent body surface area (A) of skin involved was estimated on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100 percent involvement), severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), scaling (S) on a 5 point scale: 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked involvement). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

    <description>PASI is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.

Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4). PASI75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Assessment and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>PASI is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Body divided into 4 sections (head and neck [h], arms [u], trunk [t], legs [l]); each area scored by itself and scores combined for final PASI score. For each section, percent body surface area (A) of skin involved was estimated on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100 percent involvement), severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), scaling (S) on a 5 point scale: 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked involvement). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4).</description>

Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) Response at Week 12 and 24</title>
        <description>PASI is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Body divided into 4 sections (head and neck [h], arms [u], trunk [t], legs [l]); each area scored by itself and scores combined for final PASI score. For each section, percent body surface area (A) of skin involved was estimated on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100 percent involvement), severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), scaling (S) on a 5 point scale: 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked involvement). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weighing factor (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4). PASI75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</description>
