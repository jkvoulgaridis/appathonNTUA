      The total study duration for each participant was between approximately 29 and maximum of 30
      weeks, consisting of a screening period of 5 weeks and optional up to 7 additional days, a
      treatment period of 12 weeks, and a post-treatment period of 12 weeks.

      Participants who completed the treatment period could be eligible to participate in an
      open-label extension study.

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 6 through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO is a surrogate marker for airway inflammation. FeNO was analyzed using a NIOX instrument or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s, and reported in ppb.
The average change in FeNO from baseline to Week 6 through Week 12 was calculated as follows: For each participant the change in FeNO from Baseline to Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12 was calculated (value at Week X - value at baseline). Subsequently the weekly mean of these 4 &quot;change from baseline&quot; values was determined (Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12). Using these weekly mean values the overall arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the average change in FeNO from baseline to Week 6 through Week 12 was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs: AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during between the first administration of study medication to the end of the 12 week Post-treatment Period. Serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 16 sites in 6 countries. A total of 133 participants were screened between January 2016 and January 2018. Of which, 42 participants were randomized. 91 participants were screen failures mainly due to exclusion criteria met and inclusion criteria not met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) and placebo q2w by using Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS). Randomization was stratified by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dose (medium and high) and region (North America and Europe).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Average Change in Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) From Baseline to Week 6 Through Week 12</title>
        <description>FeNO is a surrogate marker for airway inflammation. FeNO was analyzed using a NIOX instrument or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s, and reported in ppb.
The average change in FeNO from baseline to Week 6 through Week 12 was calculated as follows: For each participant the change in FeNO from Baseline to Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12 was calculated (value at Week X - value at baseline). Subsequently the weekly mean of these 4 &quot;change from baseline&quot; values was determined (Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12). Using these weekly mean values the overall arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the average change in FeNO from baseline to Week 6 through Week 12 was calculated.</description>

          <title>Average Change in Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) From Baseline to Week 6 Through Week 12</title>
          <description>FeNO is a surrogate marker for airway inflammation. FeNO was analyzed using a NIOX instrument or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s, and reported in ppb.
The average change in FeNO from baseline to Week 6 through Week 12 was calculated as follows: For each participant the change in FeNO from Baseline to Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12 was calculated (value at Week X - value at baseline). Subsequently the weekly mean of these 4 &quot;change from baseline&quot; values was determined (Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12). Using these weekly mean values the overall arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the average change in FeNO from baseline to Week 6 through Week 12 was calculated.</description>

        <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs: AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during between the first administration of study medication to the end of the 12 week Post-treatment Period. Serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
          <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs: AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during between the first administration of study medication to the end of the 12 week Post-treatment Period. Serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on safety population which consisted of all participants randomized and exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount of treatment administered.</population>
