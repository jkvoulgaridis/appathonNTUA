  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the objectives are to determine the efficacy and toxicity of induction
      chemotherapy (IC) with nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin (Arm 1: AP) and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm 2:
      A) alone in patients with HNSCC, and to compare these data to nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
      5-FU (APF). The investigators also hypothesize that the high anti-tumor efficacy of
      nab-paclitaxel in HNSCC is due to the upregulation of macropinocytosis, a result of the
      frequent presence of Ras and PI3K (and epidermal growth factor receptor -EGFR) activation in
      this cancer.

      Amendment to Add Arm 3:

      In this amendment, the investigators retain the AP + concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT)
      backbone but de-escalate the dose of radiation therapy (RT) from 70 Gy to 42 Gy. The
      investigators also plan to administer one dose (vs three) of cisplatin during RT. This novel
      treatment approach will be evaluated in patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell
      carcinoma (OPSCC) (Arm 3), a sub-group with a very favorable prognosis.

If complete response (CR)/partial response (PR), three more weeks of nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT)
If &lt;PR, move directly to CRT if not surgical candidates.
CRT includes cisplatin which will begin 1 to 35 days after the completion of cycle 3. The first dose of cisplatin will be given during the initial 5 days of definitive radiation therapy, the second on approximately Day 22 of radiation, and the third on approximately Day 43 of radiation.
It is strongly recommended that intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) begin within 21 to 42 days (no later than 56 days) after the start of cycle 3. The total dose will be 7000 cGy in 35 fractions of 200 cGy each over 7 weeks. A dose of 6300 cGy in 35 fractions is optional and may be delivered to areas considered to be an intermediate risk.</description>
