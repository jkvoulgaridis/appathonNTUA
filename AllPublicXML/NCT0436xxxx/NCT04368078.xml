      This trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study of targeted
      therapy combined immunotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      It is estimated that 76 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in Peking Union
      Medical College Hospital(PUMCH) and treated with Lenvatinib and Toripalimab. The
      investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data monthly to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of treatment, including overall survival and time to progression. Multi-omics data
      analysis will be used to find potential biomarkers of treatment response.
