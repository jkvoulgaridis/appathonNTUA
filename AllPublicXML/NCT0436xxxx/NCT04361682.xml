  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Particularly, pancreatic fistula is the most common and serious complication after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and is reported in up to 40% of cases. The aim of this
      retrospective single-center study was to investigate the utility of the combination of
      preoperative inflammation biomarkers (PIBs) with postoperative day 1 drains amylase
      (POD1-d.a.) levels in predicting grade C Pancreatic Fistula (PF).

    <textblock>
      Data from a prospective collected database of 317 consecutive PDs performed at the University
      Campus Bio-Medico di Roma during the years 2005-2019, have been retrospectively analyzed.
      Local Ethical Committee approved the study.

      Patients undergoing PD for periampullary neoplasms were included in the study. All patients
      underwent to PD with pancreaticojejunostomy reconstruction. Two surgical drains were always
      placed at the end of the surgery.

      Data regarding PIBs, as full blood count including white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocytes,
      neutrophils and platelets counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and POD1-d.a.
      levels were collected and Positive Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values
      (NPV) were computed to investigate the probability to develop PF combining PIBs and drains
      amylase values.

        According to the inclusion criteria, 227 patients were eligible for the study. The median
        age of all the series was 69 years (IQR= 60.25-74). Male patients were 131 (57.7%), the
        median BMI was 24.06 Kg/m2 (IQR= 22.15-27.59). Biochemical leak, grade B and grade C PF
        have been detected in 67/227 (29.5%), 21/227 (9.25%) and 22/227 (9.7%) of the cases,
        respectively.
