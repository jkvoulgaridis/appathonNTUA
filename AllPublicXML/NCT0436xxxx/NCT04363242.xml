      A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Trial of SYN125 Single Agent and in Combination With Fixed Dose
      SYN004 in Patients With Advanced Colorectal and Head and Neck Cancer

    <textblock>
      Humans have an immune system that can protect and fight infections and abnormal cells.
      T-cells are a type of cell produced by the body that can attack and kill cancer cells.
      Unfortunately, many cancer cells have ways preventing T-cells from working properly. SYN125
      and SYN004 can make T-cells work again. This is a study to find the maximum tolerated dose of
      SYN125 when it is used as a single treatment (Part A), and when it is used as a combined
      treatment with a fixed dose of SYN004 (Part B), in patients with advanced colorectal cancer
      and head and neck cancer.

               2. History of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the past 12 months;

               3. Antiretroviral therapy &lt;4 weeks and HIV viral load &gt;400 copies/mL.

          -  Have participated in another investigational drug or device study within 4 weeks of
             the first dose of study drug.

          -  Have signs or symptoms of organ failure, major chronic illnesses other than cancer, or
             any concomitant medical or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             make it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, or that could
             jeopardize compliance with the protocol.
