  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis,
      which is the main cause of transfer from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. Guidelines for
      International Society for peritoneal dialysis（ISPD）published in 2016 recommend that timely
      and adequate use of antibiotics is the most important part of treatment. Empiric treatment
      should be initiated as soon as possible after obtaining microbiological specimens，then adjust
      the antibiotics according to culture results and drug sensitivity of bacteria.
      Intraperitoneal antibiotic can ensure antibiotic concentrations at the local sites of the
      infection are maximized，however, in patients with renal failure, the investigators should pay
      attention to the nephrotoxicity caused by the reduction of renal excretion，being guided by
      Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic Principle on antibiotic can develop dosing recommendations
      to optimize antibiotic efficacy and minimize toxicity. In this study, the investigators aim
      to detect the concentration of ceftazidime and cefazolin in CAPD patients，so as to analyze
      the pharmacokinetics parameters and evaluate the rationality of the treatment.

      The dose of cefazolin and Ceftazidime co-administered were 20 mg /kg，they were given
      intraperitoneal twice daily in the first bag and the fourth bag for 5 days，and given 1g once
      daily in the fourth bag for 9 days. Total treatment duration was 2 weeks.

      At least 1-mL serum and 5-mL dialysate samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14 days
      after complete instillation of the first dialysis bag containing antibiotic into the
      peritoneal cavity. The samples were then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, all study samples were
      stored frozen (-80℃) within 1 hour after collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Maintained on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) for at least 1 month,all patients received 4
        exchanges per day with dialysate volumes of 2 L per exchange.

             diagnostic criteria: (with the following two can be diagnosed) A. Clinical
             manifestations of peritoneics, such as abdominal pain and/or turbid flow of fluid from
             peritoneal dialysis; B. Perital dialysis discharge of liquid pathogen culture
             positive. C. The white blood cell count of perital dialysis outflow liquid were more
