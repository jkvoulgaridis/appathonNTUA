  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe whether PARP inhibitors have an effect on serum
      creatinine level, and whether this reflects a change in creatinine secretion or a true change
      in kidney function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PARPi medications interact with transporters along the renal tubules involved in the
      secretion of creatinine and an increase in serum creatinine is often observed in patients
      treated with these agents; however, it is not known whether PARP inhibitors are associated
      with an actual change in the glomerular filtration rate, or if the observed elevations of
      serum creatinine are a result of a drug effect on creatinine secretion unrelated to changes
      in kidney function. The investigators therefore propose a prospective observational study to
      examine the incidence of elevation in serum creatinine from baseline levels in patients
      initiated on PARP inhibitors and compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on
      creatinine to that from alternative tests.

      The primary purposes of this study are to:

        -  Assess the incidence of increase in serum creatinine in patients with a solid-organ
           cancer on treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

        -  To compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine with that
           of alternative biomarkers to assess whether changes in serum creatinine reflect changes
           in kidney function or creatinine secretion.

        -  To examine the persistence or resolution of creatinine increase and/or GFR decrease
           noted after discontinuation of PARPi

    <description>Kidney function will be assessed by serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, and urine creatinine clearance calculation for patients who opt-in to 24 hour urine collection.
These laboratory measures will be completed by patients at the following time points:
Timepoint A: Baseline (prior to PARP inhibitor initiation, at the time of standard of care clinical testing)
Timepoint B: On-treatment (within 3-9 weeks of PARP inhibitor initiation, at the time of standard of care clinical testing)
Timepoint C: Post-treatment (within 4 weeks of PARP inhibitor discontinuation, only for those patients with clinically significant changes in GFR based on serum creatinine, cystatin C, or 24 hour urinalysis at Timepoint B</description>
