  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of patients with stage I (tumors ≥ 4cm), IIA, IIB (and select IIIA) NSCLC
      are managed with upfront surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, relapse rates
      remain high and are primarily due to distant, metastatic disease. Previous meta-analysis
      evaluating the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate a
      similar impact on improved disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The role of
      checkpoint inhibitors has been proven to be effective in the treatment of patients with
      advanced NSCLC, regardless of histology and PD-L1 expression. Results from trials evaluating
      the use of checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant
      setting for early stage disease are promising. However, there are no trials evaluating the
      role of concomitant chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting. In
      addition, emerging data supports the use of ctDNA as a promising biomarker for early
      detection of minimal residual disease and have indicated that the presence of detectable
      ctDNA after surgery for localized lung cancer is correlated with a 90-100% chance for disease
      recurrence. Therefore, we propose this current study assessing concomitant chemotherapy plus
      Atezolizumab in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage I (tumors ≥ 4cm), IIA, IIB (and
      select IIIA) NSCLC who have detectable ctDNA after surgery. The clearance of ctDNA will serve
      as a surrogate for long term DFS and OS in this patient population.

At each time point, ctDNA detection status (detectable or not detectable) will be determined by CAPP-seq using the Monte Carlo-based ctDNA detection index cutoff point of &lt; 0.05, as described by Newman et al [53, 54]. If ctDNA detection index is &gt; 0.05, ctDNA will be classified as not detected at that time point, whereas if &lt; 0.05 then it will be classified as detected.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or
             obtained separately.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have undergone complete surgical resection of their stage I (tumors &gt;=
             4cm), IIA, IIB, and select IIIA (T3N1, T4N0-1) NSCLC according to the AJCC 8th edition
             with negative margins (R0).

          -  Squamous or non-squamous NSCLC histology. Cancers with a histology of &quot;adenosquamous&quot;
             are considered a type of adenocarcinoma and thus &quot;non-squamous histology&quot;.

          -  Surgery for this lung cancer must be completed &lt;= 60 days prior to starting treatment.

          -  Must have tissue available to perform prospective correlative testing. Tissue block is
             preferred but 10-15 unstained slides (5 μm thick) are also acceptable. If prior PD-L1
             results with Dako 22C3 antibody are not available, an additional 5 unstained slides (4
             μm thick) must be submitted.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to
             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to registration NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential
             unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least
             12 consecutive months

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use two non-hormonal methods of contraception, including
             at least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period
             and for 5 months after treatment discontinuation.

               -  Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per
                  year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal
                  contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices,
                  and copper intrauterine devices. Must use &quot;estrogen-free&quot; hormonal method if this
                  is chosen contraception method.

               -  A barrier method may be used as the second contraceptive method. The reliability
                  of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
                  clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
                  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods)
                  and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Contraception method must begin starting from the time of informed consent until 5
             months after treatment discontinuation.

          -  For men: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 5
                  months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men
                  must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of

        Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may
        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
        investigational agent.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of

               -  Subject must have negative total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at
                  screening, or positive total HBcAb test followed by a negative hepatitis B virus
                  (HBV) DNA test at screening. The HBV DNA test will be performed only for patients
                  who have a positive total HBcAb test.
