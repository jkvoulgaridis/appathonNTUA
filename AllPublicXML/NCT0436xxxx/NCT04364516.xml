  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Registry of all consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation from Heath Area of Vigo, since
      2013 to 2020, in order to study therapy, mortality, cardiovascular complications and bleeding
      events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective observational registry of patients diagnosed of atrial fibrillation between
      2013 and 2020. Clinical, analytical and echocardiographic data will be recorded, as well as
      therapeutic prescription information. Data on mortality and cardioembolic and hemorrhagic
      events will be collected during follow-up. The aim is to study the prevalence and incidence
      of atrial fibrillation, the anticoagulant treatment according to cardioembolic risk, the
      thromboembolic events and hemorrhagic events, the risk of mortality (Cardiovascular,
      Non-Cardiovascular), the contemporary management (Rhythm control versus frequency control
      strategy), and other complications, such as heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or cancer.

    <description>Embolic events include ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), pulmonary embolism (PE), and systemic embolism (SE). Ischemic stroke was defined as sudden onset of a focal deficit consistent with occlusion of a major cerebral artery (documented by means of magnet resonance imaging [MRI ]or computer tomography [CT]) and categorized. TIA was defined as a temporary neurologic deficit presumably due to reduced blood flow in a particular cerebral artery lasting for ≤24 hours with complete resolution of the neurologic deficit. A PE event was confirmed by spiral CT, perfusion‐ventilation scan, pulmonary angiography, or autopsy) and resulted in a final PE diagnosis. A SE event was defined as any end-organ ischemia other than in the brain, heart, eyes, and lungs, caused by abrupt vascular insufficiency associated with clinical or radiological evidence of arterial occlusion in the absence of another likely mechanism.</description>
