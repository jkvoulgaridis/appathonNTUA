      This is a multicenter, noninterventional, long-term follow-up study of patients with MPS IIIA
      who have completed a prior clinical trial involving the administration of ABO-102. This study
      is designed to provide LTFU in accordance with the FDA and EMA guidelines for patients
      treated with gene therapy products. The duration of the current study is 3 years for a total
      of up to 5 years post-treatment for these participants who rollover from a prior clinical
      trial of ABO-102. Participants will have up to 5 scheduled visits with assessments as
      specified in the schedule of assessments.
