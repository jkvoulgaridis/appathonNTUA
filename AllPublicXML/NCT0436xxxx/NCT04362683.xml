  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LOWE AF HD is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized study to assess safety,
      efficacy, acute and long-term outcome data of a specific ablation approach as treatment of
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation using radiofrequency (RF) ablation is acknowledged used treatment
      strategy for atrial fibrillation, many different approaches are recently implemented. The
      specific approach used in this study includes:

        -  Multi-directional high-density mapping

        -  High power - short duration settings

        -  Contact force sensing ablation catheter The aim of LOWE AF HD is to assess the acute
           safety and success rate of this approach and also the long-term outcome assessed by
           atrial recurrences arrythmias collected by an implantable loop recorder.
