  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is currently revolutionizing the field in oncology. However, prostate cancer is
      poorly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition. The combination of immunotherapy and
      radiotherapy is an emerging clinical treatment aradigm. X-ray radiation treatment can
      activate both the adaptive and innate immune systems through directly killing tumor cells,
      causing mutations in tumor-derived peptides, and causing localized inflammation that
      increases immune cell trafficking to tumors. Recently, preclinical study reported that immune
      checkpoint inhibition combined with radiotherapy treats CPRC with significant increases in
      median survival compared to drug alone.

      Permanent brachytherapy is one of those standard treatments for localized prostate cancer
      patients.

      Biopsy confirms prostate cancer. Blood and urine of localized prostate cancer patients will
      be collected before and at different time points after permanent brachytherapy (1, 3, 6, and
      12 months)

    <description>Briefly, the patient had a general anesthesia and PPB was performed by using the &quot;real-time&quot; intraoperative planning method guided by TRUS. The radioactive seeds were inserted transperineally according to a modified peripherally loaded Seattle technique 17. I-125 was used for all implants with a mean seed activity of 0.45 mCi per seed. All procedures were completed by a single surgeon.</description>
