  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients suffering from end-stage
      organ disease, including for chronic kidney failure. The implementation of effective
      immunosuppressive therapies has already significantly improved the prognosis for graft
      survival. However, these therapies are often associated with considerable inter- and
      intra-individual variability both in terms of response or in terms of pharmacokinetics.
      Innovative approaches must be considered, such as studying the involvement of intestinal
      microbiota in the pharmacology of these drugs.

      The general aim of the study is therefore to relate the variabilities observed in the
      pharmacology (mainly pharmacokinetics) of immunosuppressive drugs used in renal
      transplantation (tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) and the composition of the intestinal
      microbiota of renal transplant patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid-organ transplantation often requires the implementation of a lifelong immunosuppressive
      therapy. A combination of tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), together with
      steroids is currently used in over 60% of cases. In some patients however, these therapies
      are associated with high levels of variability, either in terms of response to treatments or
      in terms of pharmacokinetics, which remains unexplained. To address the issue, new approaches
      are being considered, in this study we will investigate the involvement of the intestinal
      microbiota in the pharmacology of these drugs. This is a particularly promising avenue for
      drugs with a low therapeutic index and large intra- and inter-individual pharmacokinetic
      variabilities such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Despite promising preliminary
      data for tacrolimus, the influence of the gut microbiota in these pharmacokinetic
      variabilities remains unclear, even less data are available about the involvement of the
      microbiota in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil.

      We expect that this study will produce additional information on the effect of
      immunosuppression drugs on gut microbiota, and the relationship between microbiota
      composition and variabilities.
