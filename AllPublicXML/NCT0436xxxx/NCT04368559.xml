    <description>Subjects in Rezafungin treatment group will receive a 400 mg loading dose in Week 1, followed by 200 mg once weekly, for a total of 13 weeks. Subjects will receive oral placebo for standard antimicrobial regimen (SAR) azole prophylaxis and oral placebo for SAR anti-PCP prophylaxis in accordance with the respective SAR dosing regimens for each. For subjects who are switched to a SAR IV regimen, oral placebo for SAR azole prophylaxis will be changed to IV placebo.</description>

    <description>Subjects in SAR treatment group will receive 400 mg oral fluconazole once daily for 13 weeks. Fluconazole may be switched, due to acute clinically significant GVHD, to 300 mg oral posaconazole twice daily on the first day of the medication switch and 300 mg once daily, thereafter. However, subjects who are switched to posaconazole cannot be switched back to fluconazole. Azole-based antifungal therapy (fluconazole or posaconazole) can be switched from daily oral therapy to daily IV therapy at the discretion of the Investigator. In addition, subjects in the SAR group will receive anti-PCP prophylaxis with oral TMP/SMX (80 mg TMP/400 mg SMX) once daily.</description>
