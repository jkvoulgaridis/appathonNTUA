    <textblock>
      This is a three-phase pilot prospective study to develop a devise capable of detecting
      changes in cortical blood volume and oxygenation due to noxious stimuli. The hypothesis of
      the study is that optical signal changes corresponding to blood volume and oxygenation will
      be detected with functional near infrared spectroscopy in the prefrontal cortex of children
      under general anesthesia in response to peripheral noxious stimuli produced from the
      neurophysiological monitoring (SSEP).

      Pain is a subjective feeling, and an objective measure of pain is needed to obtain improved
      clinical management and safe outcomes of pain treatment. At present, there is a lack of
      specific physiological markers of acute pain that can guide analgesic treatment both during
      and after surgery. The anesthesiologist typically relies on hemodynamic variables to guide
      administration of opioids for surgical pain, but those parameters are not always either
      specific or sensitive. On the other hand, uncontrolled pain during surgery can lead to
      emotional distress and enhancement of the systemic inflammatory response (1).

      Current evidence (2-4) shows that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in pain
      perception and emotional elaboration. Functional neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance
      imaging functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional near infrared spectroscopy
      fNIRS) has been recently utilized to investigate cerebral pain-related activity (5, 6).

      We propose to detect the optical signal changes over the prefrontal cortex using fNIRS and
      diffuse optical imaging (DOI) in response to noxious electrical stimulation. This electrical
      stimulation will be applied over the ulnar nerve at the wrist in children undergoing
      neurosurgery with SSEP monitoring. This noxious electrical stimulation is the standard
      stimulus used to establish baseline somatosensory evoked potentials in this patient
      population for this surgery. DOI is a mathematical methodology used to generate an image from
      the optical signals analogous to the mathematical methodology of generating a MRI from
      nuclear magnetic spectroscopy signals.

      We will evaluate the magnitude of change of fNIRS-DOI signals after two different intensities
      of noxious electrical stimulation and following intravenous administration of fentanyl (2
      mcg/kg). We will also analyze the temporal correlation of the prefrontal cortex fNIRS-DOI
      changes with the SSEPs. The results will lead to the identification of an objective specific
      biomarker for acute pain in children. Our long-term goal is to develop a portable and readily
      accessible device to improve management of intraoperative nociception and to evaluate acute
      pain in awake non-verbal children.
