      Haematological malignancies constitute the most common neoplastic disease in child
      population, with acute leukemia occupying the number one spot with a percentage of 32.8%. In
      children, leukaemia is primarily encountered in its acute form (97%) and in the majority of
      the cases it is presented as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - ALL (80%). Acute
      Non-Lymphoblastic Leukemia - ANLL is encountered less frequently (17%) and it includes Acute
      Myelogenous Leukaemia - AML (15%) and some other rare forms (2%), while the remainder 3%
      corresponds to chronic leukaemia.

      L-Asparaginase (L-ASP) is a fundamental component during the loading phase with regards to
      achieving remission of the disease and, likewise, during the maintenance phase with the
      intention of establishing that remission in both children and adults suffering from ALL. The
      cytotoxic effect of the exogenous administration of Asparaginase is caused by the depletion
      of the reserve of asparagine in the blood. Asparaginase (ASP) acts as a catalyst for the
      hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. Asparagine is vital for protein and
      cell synthesis and, therefore, for their survival. The normal cells of the human body have
      the ability to produce asparagine from aspartic acid, with the assistance of the enzyme
      asparagine synthetase. However, the neoplastic cells either lack the enzyme completely or
      contain minute amounts of it resulting in their inability to synthesize asparagine de novo.
      The survival of these cells and their ability to synthesize proteins depends entirely on
      receiving asparagine from the blood. Thus, the administration of ASP leads to the inhibition
      of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis which, in turn, results in the apoptosis of these cells.

      Despite L-ASP's paramount importance in the chemotherapy treatment of leukaemia, it is
      responsible for a plethora of toxic adverse effects that sometimes even require the
      termination of its administration. A critical adverse event of ASP is a disorder in the
      metabolism of lipids. Specifically, it appears that the activation of the endogenous pathway
      that produces triglycerides through hepatic synthesis leads to hypertriglyceridaemia. The
      liver is capable of synthesizing VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoproteins) that are rich in
      triglycerides. Utilising the effect of the enzyme Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL), located on the
      vascular endothelium, the triglycerides detach from the VLDL causing the latter to transform
      into IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoproteins) and afterwards into LDL (Low Density
      Lipoproteins). The triglycerides are later extracted from the blood circulatory system and
      stored in the adipose tissue, while the LDL particles connect with tissue receptors or
      macrophage receptors. The final products of the breakdown (coming from the peripheral
      hydrolysis of triglycerides with the help of LpL) of chylomicrons, VLDL, the remnants of
      lipoproteins, will eventually be removed by hepatic receptors. Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) plays
      an important role in this procedure, it binds these remnants in the presence of LpL and
      hepatic lipase. Along the duration of the treatment with ASP, reduced LpL functionality is
      recorded, resulting in impaired plasma clearance of triglycerides and an increase in their
      levels, while L-ASP appears to cause disorders in other lipid factors, such as cholesterol,
      HDL and apolipoprotein A. Disorders of lipid metabolism have been found to be associated with
      polymorphisms of the LpL and Apo-E genes, sometimes with positive and sometimes with negative
      effects on the lipid profile and more likely participation in cardiovascular complications.
      The current study will evaluate, the lipid profile of children with ALL, the effect of L-ASP
      on the lipid profile of the aforementioned patients, as well as the correlation between the
      polymorphisms of Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with the values of the
      lipids during chemotherapy. Both the universal and national bibliography that pertain to the
      effect of ASP on the potency of LpL and App E and to the values of the lipids in children
      that suffer from ALL during chemotherapy with L-ASP is limited, while there exists no
      bibliographic reference correlating the genetic background to LpL and Apo E and the relation
      of the lipid profile. The current study will examine for the first time gene polymorphisms of
      LpL and Apo E in children with ALL during treatment with ASP.

      Introduction

      Malignancies during childhood constitute the 2nd cause of death, following injuries
      worldwide. According to epidemiological data, 300,000 new cases of neoplasia present
      themselves every year in children and teenagers under 19 years of age1, 160,000 of which
      concern children under the age of 15. Haematological malignancies constitute the most common
      neoplastic disease in child population, with acute leukemia occupying the number one spot
      with a percentage of 32.8%, followed by central nervous system tumors with a percentage of
      21% on the second spot and lymphoma with a percentage of 12% on the third spot.

      Definition - Pathophysiology

      Leukaemia (L) is defined as a group of perturbations characterized by uncontrolled
      proliferation of white blood cells, due to the bone marrow's primary divergence from normal
      and the its infiltration by immature undifferentiated stem cells. By definition, more than
      20% of the bone marrow is infiltrated by stem cells. Leukaemia's exact pathogenic mechanism
      has not been clarified as of yet, it appears, however, to be the result of genetic mutation
      and damage to the multipotential haematopoietic ancestral cells, during one of their distinct
      stages of differentiation. This fact leads to clonal expansion and inhibition of
      differentiation. The leukaemic cell's immunophenotype reflects the level of differentiation
      achieved by the neoplastic clone. The leukaemic cells divide at a slower pace and require
      additional time to synthesize DNA compared to normal haematopoietic cells causing anaemia,
      thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. At the time of the diagnosis, the leukaemic cells could
      have, not only replaced the normal cells of the marrow but also expanded into extra-medullary
      areas.

      The various types of leukaemia are exceptionally heterogeneous and, depending on the cells'
      origin, they are differentiated into lymphoblastic and non-lymphoblastic leukemias. Each one
      of the above mentioned subgroups can be encountered in its Acute Leukaemia (AL) or Chronic
      Leukaemia (CL) form. In the acute form, the immature cells of the haematopoietic tissue are
      dominant and the progression of the disease without any treatment leads quickly to death. In
      the chronic forms, the mature cells dominate the tissue and the development of the disease,
      generally, takes longer. In children, leukaemia is primarily encountered in its acute form
      (97%) and in the majority of the cases it is presented as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL,
      80%). Acute Non-Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - ANLL is encountered less frequently (17%) and it
      includes Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia - AML (15%) and some other rare forms (2%), while the
      remainder 3% corresponds to chronic leukaemia. AL occurs more often between the ages of 2 and
      6 years old while the incidence is higher in boys compared to girls (1:1.3). 2.5% - 5% of
      children's ALL and 6% - 14% of children's AML is encountered in infants under 1 year old. The
      characteristic type of ALL is the B-cell ALL, which is additionally the most common in
      children (85%) compared to the T-cell ALL (15%) which is accompanied by masses in the lymph
      nodes of the mediastinum amongst other areas.

      Epidemiology

      In the United States of America (USA) and most of the countries of Western Europe, the
      frequency of leukaemia in children is 3.5 - 4.0 cases per 100,000 childhood population yearly
      and it is ranked as the 20th cause of death among malignancies of all ages. It is deduced
      from large-scale cohort studies that the incidence of childhood cancer in developed countries
      is rising 1% every year. The prevalence of ALL in children was detected for the first time in
      the 1930s in the United Kingdom (UK) and the USA. In the USA, ALL appeared first in children
      of European descent, and afterwards, in children of African descent in the 1960s. The
      frequency of ALL is lower in developing and underdeveloped countries, a fact that hints at a
      possible correlation between industrialization and leukaemogenesis.

      Asparaginase (ASP)

      The chemotherapy combination treatments used today to treat ALL have improved significantly
      the long-term course of the disease with the overall five-year-survival rate exceeding 80%,
      while the respective ratio in the 1960s was under 30%. One of the main reasons that
      contributed to this development is the intensive, extended and higher dosed administration of
      Asparaginase. L-Asparaginase (L-ASP) is a fundamental component during the loading dose with
      regards to achieving remission of the disease and, likewise, during the maintenance dose with
      the intention of establishing that remission in both children and adults suffering from ALL.
      The cytotoxic effect of the exogenous administration of asparaginase is caused by the
      depletion of the reserve of asparagine in the blood. Asparaginase acts as a catalyst for the
      hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. Asparagine is vital for protein and
      cell synthesis and, therefore, for their survival. The normal cells of the human body have
      the ability to produce asparagine from aspartic acid, with the assistance of the enzyme
      asparagine synthetase. However, the neoplastic cells either lack the enzyme completely or
      contain minute amounts of it resulting in their inability to synthesize asparagine de novo.
      The survival of these cells and their ability to synthesize proteins depends entirely on
      receiving asparagine from the blood. Thus, the administration of asparaginase leads to the
      inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis which, in turn, results in the apoptosis of
      these cells. The low levels of asparagine only affect the survivability of the cancer cells,
      leaving the healthy cells undisturbed.

      The ability of L-ASP to suppress the proliferation of the leukaemic cells was first observed
      in clinical studies during the 1970s, and from that moment on it has remained the cornerstone
      of childhood ALL treatment. The natural forms of the enzyme, produced by the bacteria Erwinia
      chrysanthemi and Escherichia coli (E.Coli), are being used for treatment, much like L-ASP's
      product created from the conjugation of E. Coli. with polyethylene glycol
      (Pegylated-Asparaginase, PEG-ASP) with prolonged half-life of 5.5 days instead of the 26 hour
      half-life of the natural forms. Chemotherapy protocols for ALL recommend a dosage of 1,000 -
      2,500 IU/m2 of PEG-ASP and 5,000 - 12,000 IU/m2 of the natural form.

      Adverse Reactions of Asparaginase

      Despite L-ASP's paramount importance in the chemotherapy treatment of leukaemia, it is
      responsible for a plethora of toxic adverse effects that sometimes even require the
      termination of its administration. Studies have shown that the omission of administration of
      doses due to the emergence of toxic adverse effects in previous administrations is linked to
      poor prognoses in children with ALL. The most common adverse effects are hypersensitivity
      reactions, as studies indicate their rate occurrence is as high as 75%. The ASP that is being
      utilized is a large molecule of bacterial origin (mainly E. Coli) and thus is able to induce
      an immune response which grows more intense after repeated exposure and, mainly, after a
      delay of the drug administration. Aside from the clinical hypersensitivity reactions that
      signal an immediate response from the attending medical staff, there also exist subclinical
      reactions that can lead to a decrease in the potency of the drug that is difficult to detect
      in order to act swiftly. Pancreatitis is reported at a rate as high as 18% of the patients
      with ALL during treatment with ASP. The pathogenic mechanism is not yet known, however it
      appears that the fault lies with the decrease of protein synthesis from organs with
      significant protein turnover, like the pancreas. Moreover, it is considered that this
      mechanism is also responsible for the hepatotoxicity detected during treatment with
      asparaginase. Additionally, the ASP induced decrease in protein synthesis is involved in the
      processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis which in turn leads to thrombotic episodes of the
      central nervous system and deep vein thrombosis of the extremities. Other adverse reactions
      are hyperglycaemia, as a result of decreased insulin production and myelosuppression, mainly
      due to enhancing the suppression effect of the other chemotherapy drugs. Furthermore, there
      have been reports of incidents of encephalopathy during therapy with ASP that could be
      related with the elevated levels of ammonia that result from the breakdown of ASP.

      A critical adverse event of ASP that could result in additional complications if it is not
      promptly identified is a disorder in the metabolism of lipids. Specifically, it appears that
      the activation of the endogenous pathway that produces triglycerides through hepatic
      synthesis leads to hypertriglyceridaemia. Some studies indicate that the rate of high values
      of triglycerides is 67% 8 - 14 days after administering the medicine. The liver is capable of
      synthesizing VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoproteins) that are rich in triglycerides. Utilizing
      the effect of the enzyme Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL), located on the vascular endothelium, the
      triglycerides detach from the VLDL causing the latter to transform into IDL (Intermediate
      Density Lipoproteins) and afterwards into LDL (Low Density Lipoproteins). The triglycerides
      are later extracted from the blood circulatory system and stored in the adipose tissue, while
      the LDL particles connect with tissue receptors or macrophage receptors. The final products
      of the breakdown (coming from the peripheral hydrolysis of triglycerides with the help of
      LpL) of chylomicrons, VLDL, the remnants of lipoproteins, will eventually be removed by
      hepatic receptors. Apolipoprotein E (apo-E) plays an important role in this procedure, it
      binds these remnants in the presence of LpL and hepatic lipase.

      Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL)

      The LpL gene is located on the chromosome 8p22 and is comprised of 10 exons. There have been
      recorded roughly 100 mutations, with 3 of them being the most common, 2 of which are
      connected with reduced functionality of LpL and increased cardiovascular risk. The mutation
      known as polymorphism N291S is present in 2-5% of the general population and its existence is
      associated with decreased functionality of LpL and an imbalance in the VLDL metabolism
      [increase of triglycerides, decrease of HDL (High Density Lipoproteins)]. In addition, it
      appears that the effect of this mutation is amplified by the coexistence of other genetic
      factors (familial hypercholesterolaemia, apolipoprotein E2/E2). The second mutation, known as
      polymorphism D9N, is related to increased risk of atherosclerosis, even if the mutation
      causes a light decrease in the functionality of LpL. As of late, it was observed that the
      combination of small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on the genes of Apo E and of LpL
      denominate a high-risk group for cardiovascular disease. Lastly, the third mutation,
      encountered in the 20% of the general population, polymorphism S447X is linked with slightly
      elevated HDL levels and low levels of triglycerides and thus has a positive impact on the
      lipid profile.

      Along the duration of the treatment with ASP, reduced LpL functionality is recorded, likely
      caused by the altogether reduced protein synthesis from the liver, as is apparent from the
      decreased concentrations of other proteins, such as albumin and fibrinogen. Studies have
      demonstrated, in particular, that the suppression of the LpL's effects is connected with an
      increase in the ratio of ApoCIII/ApoCII, where ApoCII is an essential cofactor of LpL and it
      promotes the hydrolysis of triglycerides and ApoCIII acts as an inhibitor of LpL while
      simultaneously appears to be able to regulate the levels of triglycerides in the serum
      independently from LpL. Hence, a problem is created in the triglyceride cleansing from the
      plasma as their levels rise. Another suggested mechanism for the high levels of triglycerides
      during treatment with asparaginase is the increase in VLDL synthesis, which is also reflected
      in the high apolipoprotein ApoB100 concentration, a component of VLDL.

      Apolipoprotein E (Apo E)

      The gene of Apo E is situated on chromosome 19 and it is comprised of 4 exons. Apolipoprotein
      E (Apo E) is one of the structural components included in lipoproteins, which are rich in
      triglycerides, and it plays an important role in the hepatic protein intake. Apolipoprotein E
      (Apo E) has 3 alleles ε2, ε3, ε4 [APOE-ε2 (cys112, cys158), APOE-ε3 (cys112, arg158) and
      APOE-ε4 (arg112, arg158)]. ε3 is the most common in the general population and it contains
      cysteine at position 112 and arginine at position 158. ε4 differs from ε3 at position 112,
      where instead of it substitutes the cysteine for arginine55. The isomorph ε2 has a weaker
      connection with the lipoprotein receptors of the liver which results in the accumulation of
      remnants from chylomicrons and VLDLs.

      ApoE4 attaches to the lipoprotein receptors in the liver in vitro having the same affinity as
      ApoE3, however the effect of ApoE4 in the cleansing of lipoproteins rich in triglycerides in
      vivo is undefined as of yet. The ε2 allele is connected with higher triglyceride levels after
      fasting, while the ε4 allele is connected with hypercholesterolaemia and high LDL
      cholesterol. The individuals with the genotype E3/E4 display slower cleansing of lipoproteins
      rich in triglycerides in comparison with individuals with the genotype E3/E3. The ε4 allele
      looks to be associated with an affected triglyceride metabolism. The individuals with the ε2
      allele have lower cholesterol levels compared to the individuals with ε3 and ε4 alleles.
      Studies indicate, further, that individuals with genotype E2/E4 have higher triglyceride
      levels after fasting in relation to the individuals with genotype E3/E3.

      Alterations in the ApoE gene lead to changes in the amino acids of the coded protein, which
      results in a modified structure of the normal protein. The latter results in a slower
      cleansing of lipoproteins rich in triglycerides. In one study, it was revealed that there was
      a higher prevalence of the phenotype E4/E3 in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia compared to
      patients with normal triglyceride levels. Additionally, no significant statistical difference
      was observed between triglyceride levels and the phenotypes of ApoE after treatment with
      asparaginase.

      Asparaginase and Lipid Profile

      With regard to the effect of asparaginase on cholesterol levels, the studies do not allow to
      reach any reliable conclusion, as some studies found an increase in a small percentage of the
      patients after administering the medicine, others indicated a significant increase, while
      others yet presented a small but not significant decrease. Regarding the HDL levels, studies
      have discovered that they are lower in children suffering from malignancies, specifically of
      a haematological type. Another study focusing on children with ALL, during and after
      treatment with ASP the HDL levels rose with a simultaneous drop Apo-A1 levels. HDL plays a
      crucial role in the process of reverse transfer of cholesterol from the peripheral tissue to
      the liver, a mechanism that imparts on HDL the properties of an anticoagulant agent.
      Functioning in tandem with the aforementioned properties, other parts of HDL have
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anticoagulant properties that contribute
      to safeguarding against atherogenesis. Lipoprotein Apo-A1 comprises the main structural
      protein for HDL. It is apparent that asparaginase as an inhibitory factor of protein
      synthesis could possibly modify the ratio of lipids/ proteins in favor of the first on the
      molecules of HDL. Low HDL and Apo-A1 levels have been noticed even in free of disease
      survivors of ALL after the end of treatment. This observation is of particular importance if
      one thinks about the danger of atheromatosis and coronary disease due to low levels of HDL.

      Hypertriglyceridaemia is able to become the sole contributor to the development of acute
      pancreatitis. When the levels of triglycerides rise above 900 mg/dl they form chylomicrons,
      molecules big enough in size that they can obstruct the pancreatic capillaries leading to
      ischaemia and release of pancreatic lipase. The latter will reinforce the lipolysis with an
      increase of free fatty acids which will, in turn, allow the release of free radicals and
      pro-inflammatory derivatives causing, in the end, inflammation and necrosis. As seen above,
      asparaginase is capable of taking part in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis through two
      routes, an independent and a dependent upon triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridaemia could also
      promote a predisposition for thrombosis in patients suffering from ALL and who are under
      treatment with ASP, as on one hand, the medicine is connected to modifications of the
      fibrinolytic system, as was already mentioned, meanwhile on the other hand the increase of
      triglycerides causes hyper-viscosity of the blood raising the risk of thromboembolic
      complications. Drawing from the cases documented in the universal bibliography, it is made
      clear that the majority of the thromboses involves the central nervous system (CNS), while on
      second place are cases of deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremities.

      Lastly, it is significant to add that administration of ASP to children with haematological
      malignancies in multiple phases of the treatment is co-administrated with corticosteroids,
      either prednisone or dexamethasone. It can be easily perceived that corticosteroids can
      synergize and intensify the adverse events, such as hyperlipidaemia, pancreatitis and
      thrombosis. Furthermore, asparaginase can contribute to some adverse events of the
      corticosteroids, such as osteonecrosis through the hyper-coagulant state that it creates.
      Since both of these medications are pivotal therapeutic factors, a very close and attentive
      monitoring of the patient's condition and emergence of adverse events is required in order to
      intervene if necessary.

      Originality

      Both the universal and national bibliography that pertain to the effect of asparaginase on
      the potency of LpL and Apo E and to the values of the lipids in children that suffer from ALL
      during chemotherapy with ASP is limited, while there exists no bibliographic reference
      correlating the genetic background to LpL and Apo E and the relation of the lipid profile.
      The current study will examine for the first time gene polymorphisms of LpL and Apo E in
      children with acute ALL during treatment with ASP.

      Importance

      In this particular study investigators will focus on researching the lipid profile of
      children with ALL, on the effect of ASP on the lipid profile of these patients, as well the
      correlation between the polymorphisms of lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
      with the values of lipids for the duration of the chemotherapeutic protocol. The hypothesis
      that is going to be tested is whether recording the genotypes of the under-study children
      with ALL will be able to constitute a preemptive indicative factor for the outcome of their
      treatment.

      In this manner, vital conclusions will be extracted for the probable contribution of
      genotypes of children that are being administered L-ASP to the laboratory demonstration of
      lipid disorders during treatment, the closer supervision during the corresponding phases of
      treatment and the timely therapeutic intervention in order to prevent any complications.

      Methodology

      Study Type: Prospective case-control study The characterization epidemiologic study is in
      complete accord with the aim of our study, a study of the effect of ASP on the lipid profile
      of children and adolescents with ALL (Patient Group) as well as the correlation of the
      polymorphisms of LpL and ApoE with the lipid levels duration of the chemotherapeutic
      protocol. The existence of two additional children groups that will act as population-control
      (children and adolescents of the same age group that do not manifest the disease and
      participants of the similar ages that have manifested the disease and have completed
      chemotherapy as per protocol for at least 6 months prior) specialises our study type into a
      case-control study.

      Study Site: The study will be conducted in the Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology -
      Oncology Unit of the 2nd Department of Paediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
      (AUTH), at University General Hospital AHEPA.

      Description of the recorded parameters

      During the disease's diagnosis, the lipid profile of the patients' will be determined by
      measuring the following parameters: total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B100, lipoprotein α [Lp(α)], glucose,
      Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase
      (SGPT),Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free Thyroxine (FT4), amylase, lipase.
      Additionally, a genetic analysis for polymorphisms of LpL and Apo E will be conducted.
      Similar measurements will be done to all participants of all groups.

      The participants of group A will be immediately subjected to the chemotherapy protocol ALLIC
      BFM 2009. During the loading dose, these children will receive treatment with prednisolone
      for 33 consecutive days and asparaginase will be added on days 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,
      33. During the maintenance phase the children will be subjected anew to treatment with
      corticosteroids, dexamethasone, and asparaginase will be added on days 8, 11, 16, 18. The
      lipid identity will be checked before administration of ASP on day 0 and 11 as well as after
      the administration of ASP and before the administration of the next dose at the loading dose,
      meaning days 15, 24, 33. Similarly, the lipid identity will be checked on the maintenance
      phase, meaning on days 8, 16, 21 as well as after the end of every phase of chemotherapy
      protocol in which ASP is not administered.

      Moreover, an examination of LpL polymorphisms (the three most common polymorphisms p.N291S,
      p.D9N, p.S447X) and of Apo E polymorphisms [ε2(rs7412-T,rs429358-T), ε3(rs7412-C, rs429358-T)
      and ε4 (rs7412-C, rs429358-C)] will be performed after isolating the DNA from the peripheral
      blood and analyzing it with molecular techniques.

      Participants that meet all the inclusion criteria for this study will be examined and undergo
      treatment with ASP (Patient group) and will be compared to the corresponding teams of healthy
      children and children that have ailed and are off chemotherapy for at least 6 months
      (Controls group).

      Blood will be collected and placed in a 4ml tube without anticoagulants. The tube will be
      centrifuged and the blood's serum will be isolated in order to examine the biochemical
      parameters of the study with the cooperation of the Biochemistry Lab of University Hospital
      AHEPA. Furthermore, 2ml of whole blood will be collected in a tube containing
      Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the anticoagulant for use in molecular techniques.
      The whole blood and the serum will be stored in a temperature of -80 degree Celsius.

        Prospective children and adolescents will participate, newly diagnosed with acute
        lymphoblastic leukaemia, which will be thoroughly tested for a precise and accurate
        diagnosis of acute leukaemia. Those children will create Team A (Patient Group).
        Furthermore, an equivalent number of children will participate, of similar ages that have
        been ailing from ALL and have terminated their chemotherapy for more than 6 months. These
        children will compose Team B (Control group).

        In addition, in the control group (Team C) children will be added of similar ages that have
