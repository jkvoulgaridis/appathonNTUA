  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accidental falls in hospitals are serious events concerning the safety of the patients.
      Recent studies demonstrated that the time of falls is a key factor to be considered in
      prevention. It has been shown that the time of day, the day of the week and the month of the
      year impact on the occurrence of falls.

      The aim of this project is to know the effect of the application of a program of preventive
      measures based on the temporal patterns of the risk factors on the hospital fall occurrence.
      A mixed method research design will be conducted. Three phases will be carry out: 1)
      Longitudinal prospective study in two parts: a) audits and seminars of health professionals
      focused on an effective and efficient hospital falls register. Cosinor and Multi-Component
      analyses will be performed to obtain temporal patterns of the hospital falls and their
      related variables. b) Implementation of a based-temporal patterns, multidimensional
      prevention program. 2) Retrospective study of falls registered in institutional databases. 3)
      Qualitative study based on focus groups (physicians, nurses and nursing assistants).

      It is imperative to study temporal patterns of hospital falls to effectively and
      comprehensively define the etiology of falls, and therefore, design preventive strategies. A
      reduction of the number of in-hospital falls and related injuries is expected, as well as, an
      improvement of the quality of life of patients. Considering temporal patterns, and levels of
      mood and sleep of healthcare professionals will achieve an improvement of patient safety.

      -Design

      A mixed-method research will be carried out. Three different study design will be used:

      Phase 1. Prospective longitudinal study in 2 steps:

        -  A first step, of 18 months, in which a first intervention of audits and seminars in
           health professionals will be carried out, focused on an effective and efficient registry
           of hospital falls in older people. This first phase is crucial to identify temporal
           patterns of falls in relation to specific intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors among
           hospitalized older people; as well as the levels of fatigue/sleepiness, attention and
           cognitive functionality of the health professionals who attend to an in-hospital fall.

        -  A second step, of application of a multidimensional prevention program for 15 months
           focused on organizational, educational and behavioral elements; applied to admitted
           older people and health professionals.

      Phase 2. Retrospective study of the fall records found in the institutional databases of the
      study centers, in the period between January 2018 - September 2020. This period covers the
      first (January 2018 - May 2019) and the second phase (June 2019 - September 2020) of the
      project, previously indicated.

      Phase 3. Descriptive exploratory study with a qualitative approach, focus groups made up of
      health professionals: doctors, nurses and nursing assistants who provide and have provided
      their professional services in the field of study, in the periods in which the studies have
      been carried out. longitudinal and retrospective previously mentioned.
