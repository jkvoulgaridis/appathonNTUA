  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the SiFAr-project is to increase safe cycling in community-dwelling older adults
      (age 70 years and older) with a structured, multi-component exercise cycling training. The
      progressive exercise program encompasses training of motor competence and cognitive
      functions. The ability to cycle safely will be tested prior and after the training period
      using a cycling course, which consists of variant tasks requiring motor and cognitive skills.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cycling is a form of physical activity that is positively associated with health and
      functional benefits. In Germany, the use of bicycles, especially of those with motorized
      assistance (e-bikes), is steadily increasing among older adults. Despite the benefits
      mentioned, cycling also poses potential health risks. For instance, there is a significant
      association between increased bicycle use and bicycle crashes. This relationship is
      particularly evident in older adults with a higher prevalence of bicycle crashes leading to
      minor and serious injuries. This might be explained by the age-related decline of physical
      and cognitive function, which may essentially affect (reduce) the ability to cycle safely. In
      order to prevent crashes and falls from bicycles, targeted training of the required skills
      for safe cycling could be effective. However, there is a lack of scientifically evaluated
      bicycle-training concepts that have been developed specifically for older adults.

      By developing and providing a structured and progressive multi-component exercise program
      related to cycling for older adults, the SiFAr-project will address the improvement of
      bicycle-related basic motor competence (e.g. balance, strength, ability to react, cycling
      skills and techniques) and the reduction of stress and fall-related psychological concerns.

      The ability to ride a bike safely will be measured in both arms before and after the training
      period by completing various tasks in a cycling course.

      The aim of the program is that the participation in the three-month exercise intervention
      program will lead to a reduction of failures in the bicycle course. As comparative values,
      the number of faults in the bicycle course before the training period and the number of
      faults in the control-in-wait group will be used. Furthermore, a substudy aim to investigate
      stress biomarkers targeting inflammatory and stress associated physiological parameters
      during cycling. The activity of stress systems will be determined by measuring stress
      hormones like cortisol and inflammatory responses in the body by measuring C-reactive
      protein. To analyse biomarkers, saliva, hair and blood specimen will be collected.

    <intervention_model_description>Stratified randomized, controlled study with cross-over design. Enrolled participants are either randomized in intervention group or in control-in-wait-group.
In the first year, the Intervention Group (IG) will participate in the multi-component exercise program, the Control-in-Wait Group (CIW) will not. Both groups will be tested for functional, health and cognitive status. In addition, both groups will perform the cycling course. In the second year, the IG will change to the Follow-up-Group (FUG) and the CIW will change to IG. Additional participants will be included for the CIW.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The cycling competence will be tested in a standardized cycling course, including the following tasks: slalom, slow cycling within a marked lane, dismounting into a marked zone, getting on the bike, cycling through a narrow alley, turning to the off-side, braking with pinpoint accuracy. Mean change of number of faults in the cycling course will be tested between pre- and postintervention.</description>
