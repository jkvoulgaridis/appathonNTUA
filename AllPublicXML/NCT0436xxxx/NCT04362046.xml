      This study protocol evaluates the use of hysterscopic endomyometrial resection in women
      diagnosed with atypical endometrial hyperplasia or grade I endometrial cancer who have not
      responded to anti-hormone therapy. Patients in this study wish to preserve fertility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer among Canadian women. This
      cancer often arises from a precursor lesion called atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH).
      Hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for EC and AH. It is well recognized that EC may
      be diagnosed in younger women of child-bearing age. The diagnosis of EC or AH in these
      younger women is devastating as a hysterectomy is frequently required. Though some of these
      women respond to high-dose progestin treatment, the failure rate is high (60%), necessitating
      surgery. Recent case series show that some women with AH and early EC can be treated by
      resecting the precursor lesion of the early cancerous area in the uterus by hysteroscopy
      without the need for hysterectomy. The fertility-sparing approach is outlined in this
      research protocol.This is a multidisciplinary research project with input from gynaecologic
      oncology, general gynaecology, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and pathology. Our
      hypothesis is that hysteroscopic resection (HR) is a safe and effective treatment for AH or
      EC in women who want to preserve their fertility and have not been successfully treated using
      progestin therapy. Patients will be closely monitored to ensure that this is a safe and
      effective treatment option.

    <description>Hysteroscopic Resection will be evaluated as a fertility-sparing treatment for patients with early Endometrial Cancer or Endometrial Hyperplasia (atypical or persisting typical) who fail progestin therapy. Failure of progesterone therapy is defined as: (a) Unsuccessful eradication of hyperplasia or cancer in the uterus or (b) Intolerance to the side effects of th hormone therapy.
HR is a common gynecologic procedure that is offered to women for treatment of several benign gynecologic conditions. The conduct, risks, and complications of it are well-understood. In relation to this protocol, it is the indication for HR that constitutes the experimental intervention including the assessment of it's outcome. Patients deemed appropriate for hysteroscopic endomyometrial resection will be counselled on the nature of the procedure along with its risks and complications.</description>

        All candidates for this protocol must have an adequate trial of anti-hormone therapy prior
        to hysteroscopic resection. In cases of EC, the minimum trial is 6 months of high-dose
        progestin. In cases of AH, being that this is a benign condition (pre-malignant), patients
        may not require a full 6 months of anti-hormone therapy. All patients must have a pre-HR
        hysteroscopic evaluation to confirm that they are suitable candidates for this study.
        Patients being considered for the experimental intervention (hysterscopic resection) will
        be discussed/conferenced by the study committee in order to ensure that the following
        criterion are met in order to proceed with the surgical resection:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age less than 40 years

          -  Pathologist confirmed biopsy evidence of one of the following:

               1. Grade I endometrial endometrioid adrenocarcinoma (EC) with less than 1/3 of the
                  endometrial surface involved.

               2. Atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH)

          -  MRI demonstrating less than 1/3 myometrial invasion if the patient has EC

          -  Absence of significant surgical co-morbidities e.g. pulmonary hypertension,
             significant cardiac valvular disease, or contraindication to surgery.

          -  Desire to preserve fertility

          -  Reasonable chance to conceive based on consultation with an infertility specialist

          -  Adequate dose and duration of progesterone therapy prior to enrolment:

          -  Adequate dose:

               1. Medroxiprogesterone acetate (Provera; 200mg/day)

               2. Megestrol acetate (Megace; 160mg/day)

          -  Adequate duration: 6 months

          -  Failure of progestin therapy defined as:

               1. Unsuccessful eradication of hyperplasia or cancer in the uterus

               2. Intolerance to the side effects

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Age 40 years and over

          -  Grade 2 or 3 endometroid endometrial adenocarcinoma or non-endometroid pathology

          -  Greater than 1/3 involvement of the endometrial surface in patients with Grade I EC

          -  Women who are not able to provide informed consent

          -  Women without pathologic confirmation of low-grade endometrioid carcinoma or AH

          -  Myometrial invasion on MRI greater than 1/3 total myometrial thickness.

          -  MRI evidence of ovarian or adnexal involvement

          -  The diagnosis of another cancer or medical condition that would interfere with the
             assessment of the hysteroscopic surgery success rates.

          -  Significant underlying fertility impairment that would significantly interfere with
             the success rate of HR
