    <textblock>
      Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common disease in the andrology clinic. Currently, the
      effectiveness and outcome differences of drug treatment still need to be studied and
      demonstrated. Premature ejaculation concurrent with erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in
      outpatient clinics. The preferred treatment plan for these patients still needs to be further
      studied and explored, and the difference in the efficacy of different treatment regiments
      remain to be evaluated.
