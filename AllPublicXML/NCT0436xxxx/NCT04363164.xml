  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic men without pain due to prostate cancer progressing with metastatic CRPC after
      treatment with combination or sequential ADT + Abi will be treated on a randomized, open
      label study to determine if sequential treatment with high dose T and Enza will improve
      primary and secondary objectives vs. continuous Enza as standard therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are those who have progressive disease after treatment with Abi either in
      combination with ADT as initial therapy or as second-line therapy after development of
      resistance to primary ADT. Patients will continue on ADT with Luteinizing hormone-releasing
      hormone (LHRH) agonist (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) or LHRH antagonist
      (Degarelix) if not surgically castrated throughout the duration of the study to inhibit
      endogenous testosterone production. Patients will be randomized 1:2 and stratified based on
      whether patients received Abi in combination with ADT or in sequence after progression on ADT
      and based on duration of response to Abi (&lt;6 or ≥ 6 months). Patients randomized to Arm A
      will receive continuous therapy with standard dose Enza (160 mg po q day). Patients
      randomized to Arm B will receive Sequential Testosterone and Enzalutamide (STE). Patients in
      Arm B will receive intramuscular injection with testosterone cypionate (T) at a dose of 400
      mg every 28 days x 2 (i.e. cycle 1). This dose was selected based on data demonstrating that
      it produces an initial high dose serum level of T (i.e. &gt; 1500 ng/dL or 3-10 times normal
      level) with eugonadal levels achieved at the end of two weeks and near castrate levels after
      28 days. On Day 1 of cycle 2, patients will stop testosterone and begin enzalutamide 160 mg
      po q day for 56 days. Each cycle is 56 days. On Day 1 of cycle 3, patient will not take
      enzalutamide and will again receive injection of testosterone. Patients will continue to
      alternate one cycle of testosterone (2 injections) with one cycle of 56 days of enzalutamide.

      Patients will have prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and symptoms assessment checked
      every cycle. Every 2 cycles (~4 months) patients will have repeat bone/CT scans to evaluate
      treatment response status. On CT scan, radiographic progression will be defined by RECIST
      criteria (i.e. &gt;20% increase in the sum of target lesions). On bone scan, radiographic
      progression will be defined by PCWG3 criteria as ≥ 2 new bone lesions.

      Patients with PSA progression but with disease response or stable disease on imaging studies
      will remain on study until clinical or radiographic progression criteria are met. Patients
      with radiographic disease progression will stop treatment and come off study. Patients with
      clinical progression due to pain flare after first two injection of testosterone can remain
      on study. If pain persists after first cycle of enzalutamide, patients will stop treatment
      and come off study. If pain resolves on enzalutamide, but returns with next or subsequent
      cycles of testosterone, patients will stop treatment and come off study.
