  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the goals of an ablation procedure is to create scarring of cardiac tissue. Not all
      ablations result in scar tissue. Advances in technology have improved scarring but ideal
      parameters that result in scar tissue are still not completely clear and there is great
      variability in the parameters used. Theoretically, intense ablation can always create scar
      tissue but is also likely to create more complications such as cardiac perforations. The
      investigator recently published another retrospective study looking at ablation parameters
      that reliably result in scar tissue but it had its limitations as it was retrospectively
      done.

      This is a prospective study to validate the parameters that result in long term scarring. MRI
      has long been used to visualize ablation scar tissue. So in this study patients undergoing,
      initial left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation as standard of care will undergo a 3
      month post ablation MRI and that will be used to validate the ablation parameters.

    <textblock>
      A critical step to improve atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation broadly is to minimize
      interoperator variability. VISITAG SURPOINT calculated a marker tag index value by combining
      contact force, power setting, and duration of energy delivered. Use of VISITAG SURPOINT has
      accurately predicted sites of pulmonary vein reconnection and regional changes in late
      gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2 (edema) intensity 24 hours post ablation. Prospective use
      of the ablation index improves first pass pulmonary vein isolation and 1-year freedom from
      atrial tachyarrhythmias compared to conventional treatment.

      There remains a paucity of data regarding if ablation guided by index values and VISITAG
      SURPOINT results in durable scar formation in humans in general and compared to conventional
      approaches. In addition, the relative contribution of the components of VISITAG SURPOINT
      impact scar formation in-vivo and across a broad diversity of atrial anatomies. Such data are
      critical in patients that present with various degrees of atrial myopathies, arrhythmia
      substrate, and anatomies.
