  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose study of
      AVM0703 administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with COVID-19. The
      study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single-ascending dosing of AVM0703 in patients with COVID-19.

      Phase 1 The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of AVM0703 in subjects with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 infection.

      The secondary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending doses of AVM0703.

      The exploratory objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to assess potential
      biomarkers indicative of natural killer T (NKT) cell activity and biomarkers predictive of
      response to AVM0703 in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage.

      Phase 2 The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the
      potential efficacy of AVM0703 when administered at the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19
      infection.

      The secondary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to gain further information
      about the safety of AVM0703 in patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 infection.

      The exploratory objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess potential
      biomarkers indicative of NKT cell activity and biomarkers predictive of responders to AVM0703
      in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage.

          2. Must have laboratory confirmed COVID-19;

          3. Must have severe, immediately life-threatening COVID-19, according to COVID-19
             Critical Illness Salvage Criteria, as follows:

               1. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (Berlin Criteria [JAMA 2012]);

               2. Refractory hypoxemia on invasive mechanical ventilation despite rescue measures
                  (prone positioning, positive end-expiratory airway pressure [PEEP] ladder,
