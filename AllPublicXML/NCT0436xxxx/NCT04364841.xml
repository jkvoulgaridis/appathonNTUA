  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual desire may decrease among obese individuals who feel worthless and therefore there may
      be behaviors that avoid sexuality. Sexuality, one of the activities of daily life, is an
      issue that is affected by cultural norms and rules and individuals have difficulties
      expressing their sexual problems comfortably. In a systematic review which is about the
      effect of bariatric surgery on sexuality; it was emphasized that bariatric surgery, the most
      widely used treatment in obesity, has positive effects upon reproductive hormones and sexual
      functions thanks to weight loss. In light of these information above-mentioned; the study was
      done to examine the correlation between body perception and sexual life before and after
      bariatric surgery among obese individuals.

      Obese individuals who want to learn healthy life behaviors and wish to acquire and to realize
      behavioral changes that will help them cope with health problems are in need of training and
      counseling. In this process, nurses -being in close and continuous contact with individuals-
      play counselor role as a part of their educator roles. It is stated that nurses need to
      understand, empathize with and support individuals who suffer from different problems while
      they play this role. In presence of obesity, which is a psychophysiological condition; nurses
      should also consider the fact that obese individuals who face bitter criticisms and social
      exclusion may show low self-esteem and impaired body image due to excessive weight and
      therefore they should give these individuals opportunities to express their feelings as to
      how they perceive themselves. The studies in literature that investigated the correlation
      between body mass index (BMI) and self-esteem and body perception report that obese
      individuals demonstrate relatively lower self-esteem and body perception as compared to the
      normal individuals. Psychological and hormonal disorders, impaired body image and chronic
      diseases that develop with obesity influence sexual life negatively, too. Therefore; sexual
      desire may decrease among obese individuals who feel worthless and therefore there may be
      behaviors that avoid sexuality. Sexuality, one of the activities of daily life, is an issue
      that is affected by cultural norms and rules and individuals have difficulties expressing
      their sexual problems comfortably.

    <description>&quot;Body Perception Scale&quot; filled in to determine how satisfied they were the various parts of their bodies and various body functions at the pre-operation period by the obese individuals.
The scale includes 40 items and each item refers to an organ or a limb (arm, leg, face, etc.) or a function (sexual activity level). Each item score ranges from 1 to 5 by marking &quot;I do not like at all&quot;, &quot;I do not like&quot;, &quot;I am uncertain&quot;, &quot;I like&quot;, &quot;I like a lot&quot;. Total score ranges from 40 to 200. High scores indicate high level of satisfaction. Cutoff score of the scale was 135 and scores lower than 135 (≥135) indicate lower body perception.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale&quot; was filled in to measure sexual functions related to sexual orientation and the relationship with partners at the pre-operation period by the obese individuals.
Scores for each question range from 1 to 6 and total score ranges from 5 to 30. Lower scores indicate strong, easy and satisfactory sexual response while higher scores indicate presence of sexual dysfunctions. According to Soykan, a score ≥11 is a cutoff score for sexual dysfunction.</description>

        The population of the study was consisted of 33 patients who received obesity diagnosis at
        General Surgery Unit, Mersin University Hospital and underwent bariatric surgery between
        1.6.2017 and 1.12.2018. It was identified that the number of the patients who had bariatric
        surgery at the hospital between 30.11.2016 and 30.5.2017 was 33. During the sampling phase,
        at least 27 of the 33 patients who volunteered to join the study and met inclusion and
        exclusion criteria were targeted between 01.06.2017 and 01.12.2018 when Data Collection
        Forms were distributed according to the statistical calculations in which 20% loss of the
        population was predicted. However, the whole population was achieved.
