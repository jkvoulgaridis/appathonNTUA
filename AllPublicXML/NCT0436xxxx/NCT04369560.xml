  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study of the safety and performance of a novel intravesical
      contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging protocol for determination of bladder cancer
      stage prior to transurethral resection of bladder tumor (21 subjects) or prior to radical
      cystectomy for muscle invasive disease (21 subjects). Subjects will undergo a single MRI
      study: a pre-contrast, single breath hold image followed by sterile placement of a temporary
      urethral catheter for instillation of a 50mL solution containing Gadobutrol (4 mM) plus
      ferumoxytol (5 mM) and then a second, post-contrast image. Images will be reviewed by two
      dedicated abdominal radiologists, who are blinded to the pathologic staging, for
      determination of tumor presence and depth of bladder wall penetration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty one patients with at least one cystoscopically confirmed papillary bladder tumor, who
      have been scheduled for Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) for surgical
      extirpation and staging, and twenty-one patients with histologically confirmed, muscle
      invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who have been scheduled for definitive
      radical cystectomy with curative intent will be recruited for a single study Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging to be performed between 1 and 6 days prior to their scheduled procedure.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging of all the enrolled patients will be performed on a 60-cm,
      wide-bore, 3T scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel pelvic phased-array
      coil placed over the bladder using radial k-space sampling technique for volumetric free
      breathing acquisition with NCM enhanced StarVIBE57. Un-enhanced fast spoiled gradient-echo
      images with fat suppression will be obtained prior aseptic instillation of 50cc of a novel
      contrast mixture (NCM) of Gadobutrol (4 mM) plus Ferumoxytol (5 mM) in sterile water through
      a temporary urethral catheter. The catheter will then be removed and the patient repositioned
      in the scanner to obtain post-contrast images. All the image datasets will be linearly
      registered to the subject to ensure that regions of interest represent the same anatomical
      location at all time points. Post-contrast T1, pre-contrast T1 and deltaT1 will be measured
      from the acquired images. Two radiologists blinded to the pathologic findings will evaluate
      the Magnetic Resonance images to assign a radiologic tumor stage that will be compared with
      the subsequent pathologic stage determined at time of surgery. Following the MRI study,
      subjects will proceed with their surgical procedure as scheduled per standard of care.

    <description>Patients are typically scheduled for radical cystectomy after initial TURBT with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MRI findings of bladder tumor will be compared with the areas of tumor identified on whole mount sectioning of the bladder to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI for bladder cancer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be used to estimate the tumor size threshold value for the diagnosis with MRI.</description>
