  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy is a highly technical and integral component of the definitive treatment of
      gynecologic cancers [1]. To enhance provider communication and patient engagement, our study
      investigates a video consent on impact of patient treatment-related outcomes.

      The study team will use a detailed brachytherapy video in addition to the standard
      brachytherapy verbal consent to evaluate patient-reported satisfaction and patient anxiety
      for gynecologic high-dose rate brachytherapy (a radiation procedure).

    <textblock>
      1:1 randomized trial using blocked randomization based on chronologic arrival in clinic, a
      group of patients will be randomized to the standard of care verbal consent (Arm A), or the
      standard of care consent plus the online brachytherapy informed video consent (Arm B). There
      will be three time points for the collection: After the standard consent process as the
      baseline, following the standard only vs standard and educational video consent process prior
      to the first brachytherapy procedure, and prior to the last brachytherapy procedure. The
      patients in the brachytherapy video consent process will be watching this online. The patient
      will be given a specific log in to use, and study researchers will be able to track the
      number of times the patient watches the video and the completion of the video view. The
      patient is allowed to watch the video as many times as desired

    <description>The primary analysis will be based on the Intention-to-Treat population, defined as all individuals who were randomized to arm A or arm B. A Likert-scale questionnaire is used to calculate satisfaction score.
Using the brachytherapy specific questionnaire, the study team will examine three patient reported time points for impact: baseline, after the consent process, and prior to the last brachytherapy procedure. For primary endpoint, a two-sample t-test will be used to compare differences of satisfaction scores at two time points (baseline and following consent process) between groups. It is not anticipated that there are any possible confounders, if any study team will include it in the secondary analysis.The reporting scale is the following:
Strongly disagree (1) Disagree (2) Uncertain (3) Agree (4) Strongly agree (5) A higher score means a better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Related Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>from study enrollment to the final dose of brachytherapy, up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfactory scores at three time points will be analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) to assess satisfactory scores trajectories between two arms. The MMRM model will include terms for time, consent arm, baseline score, arm-by-time interaction, baseline score by time interaction, plus covariates that include age, stage. Time will be treated as categorical. If values of last two time points are similar, analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) will be used to model the change in satisfactory scores. The mean of the last two time points will be calculated. That is, the after consent score (mean values) will be regressed upon baseline score and consent arms. Patient treatment-related anxiety between groups, defined as NCCN distress score, are also collected at three time points and will be analyzed using the same strategy. The NCCN distress scale is from 0-10 with 10 being a value that is more distress- worse.</description>
