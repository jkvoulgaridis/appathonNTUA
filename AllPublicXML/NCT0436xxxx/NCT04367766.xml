  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After atraumatic tooth extraction and the assessment of the feasibility of immediate implant
      placement, patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment concepts:

        1. Immediate Implant Placement and Immediate Provisionalization

        2. Alveolar Ridge Preservation. After 4 months of healing an implant will be placed with
           simultaneous GBR and/or Soft Tissue Augmentation procedures, if needed.

        3. Spontaneous Healing of the socket. After 4 months of healing, an implant will be
           placedwith simultaneous GBR and/or Soft Tissue Augmentation procedures, if needed.

      In all groups, four months after implant placement, a prosthesis will be delivered. From this
      experimental period onward, patients will be scheduled for maintenance. Clinical,
      radiographic and volumetric assessment will be performed by clinicians not involved in the
      surgery and blind with respect to treatment assignment at 1, 3 and 5 years post loading.

      The overall objective of this study will be to compare the three treatment modalities after
      tooth extraction (immediate implant placement, alveolar ridge preservation, spontaneous
      healing) in terms of:

        -  patient-related (morbidity) outcomes during surgical procedure and the first 2 weeks
           after the surgical procedure

        -  cost-effectiveness ratio (treatment time, number of surgeries, number of appointments
           and overall appointments time, need for bone and soft tissue augmentation, overall
           costs) at the time of prosthesis delivery

        -  volumetric bone and soft tissue changes of the site before treatment (prior to tooth
           extraction), 4 months after tooth extraction, 1, 3 and 5 years after final prosthesis.

        -  clinical, radiographic, aesthetic and patient-related (satisfaction) outcomes at the
           time of prosthesis delivery and 1, 3 and 5 years after final prosthesis.

        -  Implant Success and Survival at 1, 3 and 5 years after final prosthesis.
