    <measure>Primary Patency Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary patency is defined as no significant reduction of flow detectable by Duplex ultrasound through the index lesion and no further clinically driven target vessel revascularization performed in the interim. Significant reduction of flow is binary restenosis defined as the diameter stenosis &gt;50% with a peak systolic velocity ratio &gt;2.4 as measured by Duplex ultrasound.</description>

    <measure>Major Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Major adverse events included death, index limb ischemia, index limb amputation, and significant embolic events, which were defined as causing end-organ damage.</description>
