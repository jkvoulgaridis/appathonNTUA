          2. Is willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any
             study-specific procedures.

          3. Has evidence of portal hypertension, with at least 2 of the following:

               1. platelet count &lt;150,000/mm3

               2. spleen size ≥ 15 cm (by documented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed
                  tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound imaging)

               3. collateral vessels (by documented MRI or ultrasound imaging or physical
                  examination, ie, caput medusae)

          4. Has a history confirming nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis, with at least
             one of the following:

               -  There is a historical liver biopsy showing cirrhosis with steatohepatitis. There
                  is no evidence for a competing etiology for the cirrhosis.

               -  There is a historical liver biopsy showing steatohepatitis, and there is evidence
                  of cirrhosis from clinical or imaging data or a second liver biopsy showing
                  cirrhosis without all features of NASH (as the histological NASH lesions may have
                  burnt out). There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There is at least 1
                  co-existing metabolic comorbidity at Screening: obesity (with either body mass
                  index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2 or waist circumference ≥102 cm [40 in, men] or ≥88 cm [35
                  in, women], or by ethnically appropriate cutpoints); hypertension (either on anti
                  hypertensive drug therapy for at least 1 year or systolic/diastolic blood
                  pressure (BP) &gt;140/80 mm Hg); Type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥6.5%,
                  or on anti-diabetic medication for at least 1 year); or dyslipidemia
                  (triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or on drug therapy for hypertriglyceridemia for at
                  least 6 months; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤40 mg/dL [men] or ≤50 mg/dL
                  [women]) to corroborate a diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

               -  There is a historical liver biopsy showing cirrhosis with steatosis but not
                  steatohepatitis. There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There are at
                  least 2 co-existing (or history of) metabolic comorbidities (with obesity or
                  diabetes being one of them) to corroborate a diagnosis of NAFLD.

               -  There is a historical liver biopsy showing steatosis but now with cirrhosis
                  either by clinical examination, imaging, or biopsy. If there is a current biopsy,
                  it does not show evidence of steatosis or steatohepatitis as histological lesions
                  may have burned out. There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There are at
                  least 2 co existing (or history of) metabolic comorbidities (with obesity or
                  diabetes being one of them) to corroborate a diagnosis of NAFLD.

               -  For patients without a historical liver biopsy with slides available for review
                  by the central study pathologist, a screening liver biopsy is required.

             Note: All liver biopsy blocks and/or slides for eligibility assessments (including
             those from historical biopsies) will be reviewed by the central study pathologist
             while the subject is in Screening, and must meet definitions for diagnosis of either
             Definitive cirrhosis or Probable cirrhosis. Results from the central study pathologist
             must be available before the subject is randomized.

          5. Absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by valid imaging (liver ultrasound, triple
             phase CT or MRI of liver) within 6 months prior to randomization. If no such imaging
             result is available, then it should be performed as part of standard of care.

          6. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be enrolled, if they are adequately
             controlled on a stable dose or doses of antidiabetic medication(s) for at least 3
             months before study enrollment, and their screening HbA1c is ≤9.5%.

          7. Patients on vitamin E or pioglitazone can be enrolled if they are on a stable dose and
             regimen for at least 3 months before screening, and the dose is expected to be held
             constant during the trial.

          8. Patients on a statin can be enrolled if they are on a stable dose and regimen for at
             least 3 months before screening, and the dose is expected to be held constant during
             the trial.

          9. Is not pregnant and must have a negative serum pregnancy test result prior to
             randomization.

         10. Is of non-childbearing potential or if a fertile man or woman participating in
             heterosexual relations, agrees to use effective means of contraception (ie, 2
             effective methods of contraception, one of which must be a physical barrier method).

             Effective forms of contraception include condom, hormonal methods (birth control
             pills, injections or implants), diaphragm, cervical cap, or intrauterine device
             throughout his/her participation in this study and for 90 days after discontinuation
             of study treatment. Surgically sterile males and females are not required to use
             contraception provided they have been considered surgically sterile for at least 6
             months. Surgical sterility includes history of vasectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation. Postmenopausal women who have been
             amenorrheic for at least 2 years at the time of Screening will be considered sterile.

         11. If a lactating woman, agrees to discontinue nursing before the start of study
             treatment and refrain from nursing until 90 days after the last dose of study
             treatment.

         12. If a man, agrees to refrain from sperm donation throughout the study period and for a
             period of 90 days following the last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP).
             Female subjects may not begin a cycle of ova donation or harvest throughout the study
             period and for a period of 90 days following the last dose of IMP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Presence of esophageal, gastroesophageal, or isolated gastric varices, based on an
             upper gastrointestinal (GI) esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) exam conducted within 4
             weeks of randomization. Patients with clearly defined gastric fundal varices should be

                  *Screening values will be obtained at SV1 and SV2 (which will be separated by 2
                  to 4 weeks). A second screening value that is &gt;50% higher than the first value
                  should prompt re-evaluation of the severity of the underlying liver disease and
                  eligibility for this trial. If a transaminase level at SV2 is &gt;33% different from
                  the level at SV1, then additional measurements should be performed at SV3. In
                  such cases, the baseline transaminase levels will be established for subjects
                  using the mean value of 4 evaluations [ie, at SV1, SV2, SV3, and Baseline (ie,
                  pre-dose during Visit 1)].

               -  international normalized ratio (INR) ≥1.5 (without anticoagulant therapy)

               -  total bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/dL (subjects with a documented history of Gilbert's
                  syndrome can be enrolled if the direct bilirubin is within normal reference
                  range)

               -  Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Score ≥7 Note: Following Phase 2b, subjects with CTP
                  scores ≥7 may be enrolled if recommended* by the Data Safety Monitoring Board
                  (DSMB) and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), based on the planned
                  interim analysis (IA). [*based on DSMB review of preliminary results from a
                  separate hepatic impairment clinical trial (Study GT-032) which is assessing
                  belapectin safety and PK in cirrhotic subjects with CTP scores ≥7.

         11. Taking a statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor
             blocker, or β-1 selective adrenergic receptor inhibitor, unless on a stable dose and
             dosing regimen for at least 3 months prior to screening, and no changes in the dose or
             dosing regimen are anticipated during the entire study. Subjects taking a
             non-selective beta blocker are not eligible to be enrolled.

         12. History of major surgery within 8 weeks of randomization, significant traumatic injury
             within 6 months, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the
             course of the study.

         13. History of a solid organ transplant requiring continuing immunosuppressive therapy.

         14. History of bariatric surgery within 3 years of randomization, or plan to undergo
             weight reduction surgery or participate in weight reduction programs (eg, Weight
             Watchers®, Jenny Craig®) during the study.

         15. Has positive screening test for illicit drugs of abuse, including, but not limited to,
             amphetamines, cocaine, or non-prescription opiates (eg, heroin, morphine) at
             Screening.

         16. Has participated in an investigational new drug study within 30 days or 5 half-lives
             whichever is longer, prior to randomization (including follow-up visits) or at any
             time during the current study.

         17. Has a history of malignancy, except for the following: adequately treated
             nonmetastatic basal cell skin cancer; any other type of skin cancer, except melanoma,
             that has been adequately treated and has not recurred for at least 1 year prior to
             enrollment; and adequately treated in situ cervical cancer that has not recurred for
             at least 1 year prior to Screening.

         18. Has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (eg, uncontrolled hypertension,
             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization, unstable angina), New
             York Heart Association Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring devise/ablation or Grade II or greater peripheral vascular
             disease within 12 months prior to randomization.

         19. Has a history of clinically significant hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary,
             neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, systemic inflammatory, metabolic or
             endocrine disorder or any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             renders the subject a poor candidate for inclusion into the study.
