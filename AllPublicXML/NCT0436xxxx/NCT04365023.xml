      The purpose of this study is to analyse clinical data of well-differentiated grade 3
      digestive neuroendocrine tumors. These rare tumors may have a different disease evolution,
      response to chemotherapy and prognostic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Digestive neuroendocrine tumors are rare tumors and cell differentiation is a major
      prognostic marker of neuroendocrine tumors.

      The 2010 WHO Classification defined three groups of tumor according to the combination of the
      morphological characteristics and the mitotic index and/or the Ki-67 index: Grade 1 and 2
      corresponded to well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors whereas grade 3 corresponded to
      poorly differentiated lesions entitled neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). It was assumed that
      no well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a mitotic- or a Ki-67- index above 20%
      existed.

      Recently, a proportion of neuroendocrine tumors corresponding to grade 3 neuroendocrine
      tumors with a proliferation- or Ki-67 index &gt; 20% and with a well-differentiated morphology
      have been identified. This entity has been partially explored and may have a different
      survival than grade 3 NEC. Furthermore, targeted therapies, and used in pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors have not been assessed in this case.

      The TENpath network is a pathological network whose goal is the systematic reading of all
      diagnosed cases of neuroendocrine tumors. As part of this network, nearly 3.000
      neuroendocrine tumors were reviewed by pathologist experts. Of all the reviewed tumors, 167
      were identified as well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors, observed Ki-67(5.6%)
      confirming the existence of this entity.

      Treatment and follow-up of well-differentiated grade 3 tumors are not consensus-based and
      recommendations are exclusively based on experts' opinions. The purpose of this study is to
      define the characterization of this entity and evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy on
      well-differentiated grade 3 digestive neuroendocrine tumors identified from the TENpath
      network.
