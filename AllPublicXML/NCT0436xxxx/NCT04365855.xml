  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are assessing the prevalence of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and
      Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) in the population and assembling a well-characterized
      cohort of adults with NAFLD and NASH to determine long-term outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease
      in the world and a major public health issue in the US (1) (2). Epidemiologic studies
      assessing the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population have been largely based on NHANES
      surveys between 1988 and 1992 (3), or single center hepatology evaluation, which is limited
      by selection bias. Obesity rates have increased significantly since early 1990s (4),
      therefore the prevalence of NAFLD has likely changed. Recent information on the prevalence of
      NAFLD in general and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis in particular is very
      scarce. Such information is crucial for defining the epidemiology of NAFLD, identifying risk
      factors for advanced fibrosis and longitudinal outcomes. These data would be fundamental for
      the development of screening strategies in the community, which are urgently needed for early
      diagnosis of liver fibrosis and therapeutic interventions before cirrhosis develops.

    <intervention_model_description>We will send survey letters to 3,000 adult Olmsted County residents with research authorization, identified based on a random search of the REP database. We anticipate a 33% response rate. Therefore we plan to accrue 1,000 participants. Based on literature estimates, approximately 600/1000 adults will be at risk for NAFLD due to overweight/obese status. This large sample size will be sufficient to derive crucial epidemiologic data of prevalence, natural history and risk factors for long-term complications in the community.</intervention_model_description>
