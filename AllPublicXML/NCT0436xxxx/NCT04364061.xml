  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-intensity interval exercise (HIIT), as compared to moderate intensity continuous
      training (MICT), is a time-efficient strategy to decrease total and abdominal fat mass (FM).
      However, the mechanisms underlying such adaptations are not yet elucidated and research are
      still needed to establish the optimal HIIT according to subject characteristics. The aim of
      this study was to compare acute HIIE and MICE cycling exercises on enjoyment, post-exercise
      substrate oxidation, appetite and energy intakes over 24h in postmenopausal women with
      overweight or obesity. It is hypothesized that compared with the traditional MICE, HIIE could
      favor greater enjoyment, higher 2h-post-exercise fat oxidation and a similar energy intakes
      over 24h despite different post-exercise appetite perceptions.

      The aim of this study was to compare acute HIIE and MICE cycling exercises on enjoyment,
      post-exercise substrate oxidation, and appetite and energy intakes over 24h in postmenopausal
      women with overweight or obesity.

      Using a randomized crossover design, 12 postmenopausal women completed 3 cycling exercises at
      6-days intervals:

      i) Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise (MICE) which consisted of 35 min cycling at 60-65%
      theorical Peak Heart Rate (thPHR) ii) High Intensity Interval Exercise 1 (HIIE 1) 60 cycles
      of speeding up for 8 s at 80-90%thPHR followed by pedaling slowly for 12 s (20min) iii) High
      Intensity Interval Exercise 2 (HIIE 2) which consisted of repeated 10 x 1min at 80-90% thPHR
      followed by pedaling slowly for 1min.

      Substrate oxidation (CHO and FAT) were measured at rest and 2h- post exercise. Enjoyment,
      perceived exertion and appetite were recorded and post-exercise energy intakes were assessed
      over 24h.

    <description>The validated 100 millimeters Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess the subjective appetite at 4 time points: before, immediately post-exercise, 60 minutes and 120 minutes post-exercise. This scale comprised four questions anchored with words representing the opposing extreme states of desire to eat, hunger, fullness and prospective food consumption. The score of each question are between 0 and 100.</description>
