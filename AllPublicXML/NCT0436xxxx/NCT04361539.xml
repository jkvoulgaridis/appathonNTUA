      Background: To assess the impact of pre-season clinical measures and rotator muscles strength
      on the risk of significant shoulder injury (SSI) in elite adolescent badminton players
      Design: Prospective cohort study Participants: Nine elite adolescents badminton players were
      included and followed from September 2018 to May 2019.

      Independent variables: A pre-season visit consisted in clinical and isokinetic shoulder
      strength testing. Isokinetic internal and external rotator shoulder muscles strength was
      tested at 60, 120 and 240Â°/s. Conventional and functional (eccentric-to-concentric) ratios
      (FR) were calculated. SSI collection was performed by an experienced sport physician.
