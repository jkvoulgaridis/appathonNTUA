      PURPOSE OF STUDY: To determine if a non-invasive skin stripping technique can be used to
      detect individuals with phenylalanine abnormalities, and to monitor dietary and/or drug

      This study will determine if a non-invasive skin stripping technique can be used to detect
      individuals with phenylalanine abnormalities, and to monitor dietary and/or drug effects over
      time. To do this 50 children and adults with phenylalanine abnormalities and up to 50
      unaffected controls will be recruited to this study. The 50 affected individuals will have
      their metabolomic profile analyzed from up to 3 skin-stripping samples over time and compared
      to their serum amino acid profile in both dried blood spots and a typical blood sample. The
      unaffected controls will provide one skin-stripping sample. Clinical data regarding
      compliance with dietary therapy and other medications will be collected to determine other
      effects on the metabolome.

    <description>The establishment of normative data for the skin metabolome will provide a baseline for assessing changes in the skin metabolome that occur during development and with disease.
By exhaustive extraction of the adhesive tapes with organic solvents, the investigators will analyze the metabolome of the stratum corneum with developed targeted methods for amino acids. The analysis will be performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography - quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLCQTOF-MS) to identify biochemical changes in the tape-stripped skin metabolome. With the comparative intensity/concentration results of identified metabolites, a subsequent metabolic network reconstruction will be carried out to reveal the underlying mechanism perturbed in PKU and metabolic response to diet or therapeutic interventions.</description>

    <description>Skin sample collection: samples of human stratum corneum will be obtained with squame adhesive tape disks typically at the time of their clinic appointment. The tape will be placed on the inside of the forearm and the procedure will be repeated up to five times per patient to have sufficient corneocytes for analysis. This type of sampling is non-invasive.</description>

        Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a serious metabolic disorder characterized by intolerance to the
        dietary intake of phenylalanine. When untreated, older children can show the following
        clinical manifestations: microcephaly, epilepsy, a musty body odor, decreased skin and hair
        pigmentation, eczema, severe intellectual disability, and behavioral problems.
