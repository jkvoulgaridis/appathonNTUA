        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at least 90 days prior to the first
        screening visit. Patients with a HbA1C (glycosylated haemoglobin) between 7.5 - 9.5%
        (59.5-80.3 mmol/mol) Patients with a fasting triglyceride level â‰¥200 mg/dL and &lt;750mg/dL at
        both screening visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who have a history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any substance in
        epeleuton capsules, placebo capsules or statins.

        Patients with active severe liver disease defined as any of the following;

          1. cirrhosis,

          2. active hepatitis,

          3. biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit
             of normal) and AST or ALT &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal.

        Patients with a history of malignancies within the past 5 years other than curatively
        treated non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas).

        Patients who have been treated with any investigational product within 60 days prior to
        visit 1, or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer). Patients cannot participate in any other
        investigational medication or medical device trial while participating in this study.

        Patients who have been treated with any medication for diabetes or obesity in the four
        weeks before the baseline visit, except for metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors,
        SGLT2 inhibitors and short-term insulin treatment for acute illness for a total of below or
        equal to 14 days.

        medullary thyroid carcinomas.

        intervention (such as stent placement or heart bypass), carotid or peripheral

        revascularisation or hospitalisation for unstable angina in the 3 months prior to
        screening.

        Patients who have a history of diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients with significant systemic or
        major illnesses that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude or interfere with
        treatment with Epeleuton, adequate follow up and/or compliance with the protocol.Patients
        who are pregnant, planning pregnancy, breastfeeding and/or are unwilling to use adequate
        contraception (as specified in Inclusion Criterion 9) during the trial.
