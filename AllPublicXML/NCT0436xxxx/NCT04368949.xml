  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical mobility limitations (PCML) manifest early in the process of declining mobility,
      and are not typically identified or acted upon by clinicians. These mobility limitations
      manifest as changes in how daily tasks such as walking are performed (slower speed, lower
      endurance). Persons in the PCML stage are at increased risk for the onset of disability and
      chronic disease. Persistent deterioration in mobility is a predictor of mortality and has
      been reported even in the absence of changes in activities of daily living over a two-year
      period. Further, older persons with mobility limitations, including reduced gait speed, are
      at risk for falls. These cumulative transitions of a person's life-long mobility form their
      mobility trajectory and preventing mobility decline at an early stage along this trajectory
      is the focus of this research initiative. This study will evaluate a novel intervention,
      STEPPING-UP, for improving walking ability in persons with PCML.
