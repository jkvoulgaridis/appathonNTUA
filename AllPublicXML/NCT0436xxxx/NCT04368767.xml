  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late preterm infants are at risk of experiencing inadequate glycogen stores with immature
      glucose metabolism and increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation, which indicates
      cellular increased and stress. Processes mediating infant acute/chronic stress symptoms and
      their biochemical effects have not been adequately investigated. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC),
      also known as Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), is as an intervention that activates mechanisms of
      energy preservation that decrease stress in preterm infants. SSC has been shown in numerous
      clinical trials to reduce mortality and morbidity by stabilization of breathing, thermal
      regulation, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. SSC also reduces behavioral distress during
      painful and stressful procedures and improves breast-feeding parent bonding. However, little
      is known about how SSC affects biomarkers of stress and energy expenditure in late preterm
      infants in the first week of life.

      The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to evaluate changes in biomarkers of
      stress, stress modulation and energy expenditure in late preterm infants who receive two
      hours of continuous SSC care or two hours of lying undisturbed in an incubator administered
      daily for 3 consecutive days in the first week of life, and to provide preliminary data for
      future research comparing the effects of usual incubator care with prolonged SSC on stress
      biomarkers in preterm infants.

    <description>Skin-to-skin contact will be performed for two hours daily for three consecutive days in the first week of life, 30 minutes after feeding. SSC will usually occur in the afternoon between 11:30-12:30 pm or 14:30-15:30pm. This time interval will allow all pre-intervention sample collection to begin 1 hour after the infant's feeding schedule in the afternoon. The room will be monitored to maintain a temperature of 72-77 degrees Fahrenheit during SSC. Stress biomarkers will be collected per protocol.</description>

    <description>Skin-to-skin contact will be performed for two hours daily for three consecutive days in the first week of life, usually in the afternoon. This time interval will allow all pre-intervention sample collection to begin 1 hour after the infant's feeding schedule in the afternoon. After pre-intervention measures of axillary temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SPO2) are obtained; cotton balls placed in the diaper for urine collection will be removed and stored in an appropriate container. Salivary oxytocin and cortisol will be collected per protocol below. Mothers will be requested to sit in reclining chairs with a front opened blouse or hospital gown. Infants will be removed from the incubator and placed naked except for a diaper and hat directly onto the skin between the mother's breasts and covered with a blanket. All infants will be monitored. After the two hours of SSC is completed, the infant will be returned to the incubator.</description>
