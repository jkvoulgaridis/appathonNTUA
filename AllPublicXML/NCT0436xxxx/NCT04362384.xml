    <textblock>
      Patients with hemorrohoids grade II and III were included. Patients were randomized into 2
      groups:

        -  Experimental group: Patients will receive a treatment with vitamin E ovules, which must
           be placed inside the annus

        -  Control group: Patients will receive a treatment with corticoid ointment, with endoanal
           application

      Bleeding, pain and stinging will be evaluated 14 days after beginning the treatment.

      Patients with hemorrohoids grade II and III were included.

      Patients were randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Experimental group: Patients will receive a treatment with vitamin E ovules, which must
           be placed inside the annus. 1 ovule must be inserted daily during 14 days.

        -  Control group: Patients will receive a treatment with prednisolone ointment, with
           endoanal application 3 times per day during 14 days.

      Bleeding, pain and stinging will be evaluated 14 days after beginning the treatment.
      Quantification of pain will be performed following a visual analogic scale ranging from 0
      (absence of symptoms) to 100 (unbearable symptoms).
