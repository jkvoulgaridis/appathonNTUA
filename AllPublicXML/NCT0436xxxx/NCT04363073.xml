      This is an interventional, prospective, randomized, comparative, two-period cross over study
      to evaluate the performance of Annabella breast pump against a control breast pump.

      50 women who are 2-5 months post-delivery will be included in the study following appropriate
      consent. Women will be randomly allocated to two groups for the type of pump used on the
      first session. Each expression visit will start approximately 3 hours after the end of a
      regular baby feeding session. Each expression visit will start approximately 3 hours after
      the end of a regular baby feeding session. During each visit, milk will be expressed once a
      day from each of the two breasts (left &amp; right). During the 4 first visits (at least 1 day
      apart) Annabella or the control pump will be used. After at least 3 days washout period, milk
      will be expressed for additional 4 days, once a day from each of the two breasts, using the
      other breast pump. An expression session will last until no milk is expressed for 3 min
      continuously but not for longer than 25 min. Participants will be serving as their own
      control. Milk will be collected for volume and quality assessment. Maternal comfort at the
      end of each visit will be assessed using questionnaire.
