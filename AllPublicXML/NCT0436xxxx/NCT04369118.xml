  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new medical device in
      post-surgery of lung resection. The principle of this new device is based on selective chest
      wall restriction. This new modality of chest wall restriction is evaluated on patients in
      post-surgery for lung cancer.

      The hypothesis is that the use of this medical device would reduce the postoperative pain and
      increase the efficacy of cough and expectoration. The evolution of the operated patient would
      be better.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is the first evaluation of the efficacy of a selective chest wall
      restriction belt.

      The efficacy will be estimate on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at D3 by
      comparing 2 groups: a control group of patients with conventional follow-up and an
      experimental group of patients with conventional follow-up and a daily wear of the selective
      chest wall restriction belt after surgery.

    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic preference-based measure that indirectly measures the utility for health that generates an index-based summary score based upon societal preference weights. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 6 items that cover 5 main domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a general visual analog scale (VAS) for health status. Each item has 5 response levels ranging from level 1 (no problem or none) to level 5 (unable to perform activity). The VAS ranges from 0 (worst health status) and 100 (best health status). Comparison between the two groups preoperatively, at the patient's exit from hospital, at Day 15 during the phone follow-up and at the follow-up visit at Month 1.</description>
