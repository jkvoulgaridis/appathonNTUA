    <textblock>
      The proposed study will consider the LC-MS/MS quantitative determination of Omarigliptin
      after administration to four Egyptian volunteers. The main aim of the study is to confirm
      that the developed LC-MS/MS method is applicable for the bio-assay of the drug in the actual
      biological samples at the time of Cmax (nearly about 1.5 hours). The design of the study is
      open labeled, one treatment, one period, single dose study. The concentration of the drugs
      after 1.5 h will be determined in healthy human subjects according to the ethical regulations
      of World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (October 1996) and the International
      Conference of Harmonisation Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Written informed
      consent was provided (attached and signed by the four volunteers) in order to be approved by
      the ethics committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt. The good
      health of the human subjects was confirmed by a complete medical history and physical
      examination. Samples from four, healthy, adult, male, smoking, Egyptian volunteers (age:
      23-37 years, Average weight: 81.6 kg, Average BMI: 30.4) will be collected at 1.5 h, to be
      transferred to heparinized centrifuge tubes in order to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS study
      (developed &amp; validated) after single oral dose administration of one Marizev® tablet
      nominally containing 12.5 mg of Omarigliptin (first arm as 4 volunteers). The blood samples
      (1 mL of each sample) will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes, 100 µL of the plasma
      will be separated and spiked with the internal standard working solution and then the sample
      preparation and LC-MS/MS determination will be applied. Blood glucose level will be
      determined for all volunteers at different time intervals to monitor any hypoglycemic effect
      to ensure their safety all over the study. The study will be conducted as per FDA guidelines
      &amp; the evaluation of safety of the study will be based on monitoring of blood glucose level,
      vital signs, pulse rate, monitoring of adverse events, and physical examination.
