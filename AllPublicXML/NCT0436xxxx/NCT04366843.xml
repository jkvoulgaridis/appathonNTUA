  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is tested the idea of two forms of musculoskeletal pain prophylaxis (chair massage
      and an original set of exercises) among musicians.

      The hypothesis of the study was that massage and exercises could be helpful for musicians to
      avoid pain conected with playing musical instrument.

    <description>Chair massage was performed useing only traditional methods of Swedish massage were used, consisting of stroking (smooth, continuous movements to relax and calm the sympathetic nervous system), kneading (consisting of wringing, squeezing muscles, compressing pressure points for the relaxation of soft tissues, i.e. muscles, tendons, fascia), stretching combined with swaying and passive movements of the upper limbs (to mobilize the joints of the upper limbs) and final stroking combined with slapping and shaking percussion, vibration.</description>

    <description>The original set of exercises was developed based on the knowledge and clinical experience of the authors of the study and based on EBP (Evidence Based Practice). The program consisted of 14 strengthening and stretching exercises involving the muscles of the trunk and limbs whose main goal was to mobilize the joints and strengthen the weakened muscles and relax overloaded muscle groups.</description>
