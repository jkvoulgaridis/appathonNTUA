  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is testing the use of a smartphone app to identify clinically meaningful
      changes in the behaviors of patients' with gynecological cancers by using passively collected
      smartphone data.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of patients with advanced gynecologic cancers and oncology providers
      from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Gynecologic Oncology Program to explore the
      feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone-based real-time behavioral anomaly detection
      system (SIGNAL).

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study interventions
      including smartphone data collection, surveys, and a brief interview once you have completed
      the study to learn more about your experiences on the study.

      Participants will download the adapted Beiwe app for a 6-month period and the investigators
      will collect passive smartphone sensor data and active PRO data bi-weekly.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women ≥18 years of age who plan to receive chemotherapy to treat recurrent, incurable
             gynecologic cancers (i.e., ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, uterine, cervical
             cancer) that has recurred despite ≥1 prior treatment.

          -  Own a smart-phone (Android or iOS)

          -  Capable of downloading and running the study apps.

          -  Can read and provide informed consent in English.

          -  Do not have cognitive or visual impairments that would preclude use of the app.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients will be ineligible if they are participating in an investigational drug
             treatment trial that requires structured symptom or toxicity reporting at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients with severe cognitive impairments or who appear too weak, emotionally
             distraught, agitated or ill to participate, as judged by either the research study
             staff or an oncology provider, will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are unable to provide informed consent in English will be excluded
             because the smartphone app is only available in English at this time.

          -  Children and young adults up to age 17 will be excluded because the diagnosis of
             metastatic gynecologic cancers in this age group is rare and the proposed instruments
             are not designed for people of those ages.
