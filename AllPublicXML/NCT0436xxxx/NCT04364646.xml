    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression and anxiety are common, serious, and frequently overlapping disorders
      that increase morbidity and mortality in new mothers (including suicide) and result in poor
      infant/child outcomes. Current therapies often fail to produce recovery or are poorly
      tolerated, and many pregnant women seek non-pharmacologic therapy or forgo treatment when
      non-pharmacologic options are not available. Expectant and new mothers who experience
      circadian rhythm dysregulation are at increased risk for perinatal depression. This
      Confirmatory Efficacy Clinical Trial of Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Mental
      Disorders R01 seeks to test whether a Personalized Integrated Chronotherapy (PIC)
      intervention can improve treatment outcomes for pregnant patients seeking outpatient
      treatment for depression, with or without anxiety. PIC is a multicomponent treatment
      consisting of bright light therapy, sleep phase advance, and sleep stabilization/restriction
      that targets the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs of circadian rhythms and
      sleep-wake behavior. To increase sample size and diversity and accelerate recruitment, this
      study will be performed at 4 sites that differ in clinical structure and that have piloted
      the PIC intervention. The study will enroll expectant mothers diagnosed with major depressive
      disorder during 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Participants will be randomized to either: (a)
      usual care (UC, n = 110) or (b) PIC+UC (n = 110). PIC+UC will have pregnancy and postpartum
      components and will be administered via a personalized approach tailored to optimize the
      intervention based on each patient's individual circadian and sleep timing. After a baseline
      assessment, PIC will be prescribed during 5 dedicated clinical visits: three during 3rd
      trimester of pregnancy and 2 in the postpartum period. UC will consist of medication and/or
      psychotherapy. UC will be quantified in both groups to evaluate differences between the
      PIC+UC and UC groups. Mood will be measured in both groups by blinded clinician interview and
      patient self-report. The safety profile of the PIC intervention will be assessed by
      evaluation of side effects/adverse events. Importantly, the study will also examine the
      target mechanisms by which PIC is hypothesized to work and test the mediation effects of the
      circadian targets on improvement in mood symptoms. Participants will wear wrist
      actigraphy/light monitors continuously during weeks 28-40 of pregnancy and postpartum weeks
      2-6 to assess light exposure and to estimate sleep timing and duration. Circadian phase
      (measured with salivary dim light melatonin onset) will be measured at baseline during
      pregnancy (~30 weeks' gestation), at 36 weeks' gestation, and at postpartum week 6.
      Exploratory aims will examine associations between infant sleep behavior and maternal
      circadian rhythms and factors relevant to future dissemination of PIC. If this intervention
      is effective, perinatal PIC could change clinical practice and have major public health
      impact due to the high prevalence of perinatal depression and anxiety, the negative effects
      of mood disorders on mothers and their children, and the need to provide effective, novel,
      non-pharmacologic therapies for women with perinatal mood disorders.

      The purpose of this research study is to collect data on whether adding light therapy and a
      prescribed sleep schedule to usual treatment for depression can reduce depression and anxiety
      symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum. The study is enrolling pregnant woman between
      the ages of 18 and 40 who have been diagnosed with depression and (possibly) anxiety.

      This study takes place from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to 18 weeks postpartum. Women who
      take part in this study will be randomly assigned (&quot;randomized&quot;) into one of the study
      treatment groups (1) the &quot;usual care&quot; group (UC); or (2) the group that receives bright light
      therapy and a prescribed sleep schedule, also called the &quot;Personalized Integrated
      Chronotherapy&quot; group (PIC). The usual care group will receive medications and/or talk therapy
      as decided by the woman and her doctor. Women in the integrated chronotherapy group will
      receive usual care (as above) and will also receive a bright light box to sit with every
      morning for up to 60 minutes as prescribed by the study doctor. Light will be delivered with
      a portable, broad-spectrum light box. Both groups will have their sleep and light levels
      monitored during 3rd trimester of pregnancy (weeks 28-40) and weeks 2-6 and 18 after the baby
      is born (postpartum weeks 2-6 and 18) Sleep monitoring takes place in the home using a small
      wrist activity monitor called an &quot;actigraph.&quot; Participants will also be asked to provide
      three saliva sample sets over the course of the study to measure melatonin levels.

      In addition to the &quot;Personalized Integrated Chronotherapy&quot; study treatment that will
      supplement the clinical care as described above, participants will be asked to come in for
      research study visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - pregnant women, ages 18-40 years with a HAMD score &gt;=14 and a current DSM-5 diagnosis of
        major depressive disorder as determined with the Current Major Depression Module of the
        Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID-I/P)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  active psychosis or suicidality contraindicating outpatient treatment as determined by
             the clinical judgement of the research team and as measured with the B/C module of the
             SCID-I/P and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale

          -  bipolar disorder (because sleep restriction can increase risk of conversion to mania)

          -  seizure disorder (because sleep restriction can increase seizure risk)

          -  self report of frequent migraines/headaches precipitated by bright light or sleep
             deprivation

          -  preexisting eye/skin disorders contraindicating light therapy

          -  use of photosensitizing medications

          -  primary Axis I diagnosis other than MDD (e.g., anorexia nervosa, ADHD)

          -  high risk pregnancy (e.g., conditions requiring mandatory bed rest or complex medical
             regimens that will interfere with study participation or conditions where poor infant
             outcomes are anticipated)

          -  starting antidepressants in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  current employment as night shift worker

          -  Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score &gt; 8 and/or Drug Abuse
             Screening Test (DAST) &gt; 1 indicating current alcohol or drug use disorders

          -  women whose infants will not be living in the home or who will have a nighttime
             caregiver

          -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI)190 &lt; 5 (i.e., those who report no sleep
             complaints during 3rd trimester of pregnancy and for whom an intervention targeting
             sleep might not be indicated).

          -  women who do not speak and read English because PIC research instruments are only
             available in English at this time. If this RCT shows effectiveness, future work will
             examine effectiveness in women who speak and read languages other than English.

          -  Women who experience fetal loss or stillbirth, as well as mothers whose infants are
             born before 36 weeks' gestation or have NICU stays &gt; 5 days, will be discontinued from
             the study but will continue to receive UC.
