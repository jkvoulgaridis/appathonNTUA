  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart rate variability reflects the autonomic nervous system on the intrinsic activity of
      sinus node cells. Sympathetic hyperactivity is an adaptation to stress, while parasympathetic
      hyperactivity is present at rest. Thus, any variability in the heart frequency rate reflects
      variations in sympathetic and parasympathetic components in the autonomic nervous system.
      Failure to return to normal or a reduction in the variability of the heart rate in the
      postoperative period is correlated with complications in colorectal surgery.
