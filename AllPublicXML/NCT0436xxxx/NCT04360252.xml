  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GERD, is a common and chronic world-wide disease. Cardinal symptoms of this condition are
      heartburn-regurgitation, and sometimes with extra-intestinal symptoms that can affect
      patients' quality of life. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) potently inhibit gastric acid
      secretion and are widely used for treatment of acid-related diseases. This class of
      medications is the most widely used for the management of GERD. H2 Receptor Antagonists
      (H2RAs) are another type of medication used to of uncomplicated GERD, gastric or duodenal
      ulcers, gastric hypersecretion, and for mild to infrequent heartburn or indigestion. H2RAs
      decrease gastric acid secretion by reversibly binding to histamine H2 receptors located on
      gastric parietal cells, thereby inhibiting the binding and action of the endogenous ligand
      histamine.

      Dietary modification is endorsed by the National Institutes of Health and the American
      College of Gastroenterology as a first-line therapy for patients with GERD. The Gracie Diet
      is thought to play an important role in the prevention of GERD. The concept behind this diet
      is that the consumption of proper food combinations promotes optimal health by preventing
      unhealthy chemical reactions in the digestive process such as fermentation and acidity.

      This diet describes the benefits of combining different foods together and the downsides of
      combining others. It provides guidance on avoiding specific foods and combinations of foods
      that may aggravate GERD, and adopting meal spacing habits to improve overall health outcomes.
      The idea is that such dietary changes support more efficient digestion and encourage
      healthier lifestyles (i.e. smoking cessation, elimination of alcohol intake, avoidance of
      soda consumption and desserts). This diet also supports the acquisition of healthy eating
      habits characterized by higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and
      encourages a reduction in the intake of saturated fat, sodium, added sugars, and canned
      foods. Limiting beverage consumption of water or fresh coconut water between meals is also
      encouraged. In this pilot study, the investigators hypothesized that the Gracie diet it could
      be an alternative option to improve GERD symptoms in those patients who do not respond to
      standard doses of PPI and/or H2 receptor antagonists.

    <description>The effect of the Gracie Diet in GERD symptoms by changes in the UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 score.
The UCLA-SCTC GIT 2.0 is a multi-item instrument that measures GI symptoms and their impact on health related quality of life. Includes 34 questions in 7 domains (reflux, distension, soilage, diarrhea, social function, emotional wellbeing and constipation) during a 7 day recall period. Each domain is weighted and scored, and a total score is then calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2 and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the Gracie Diet in GERD symptoms by changes in the PROMIS Scale score. This questionnaire has items that measure the frequency, severity, impact, and bother of cardinal GERD symptoms, including heartburn and regurgitation, using a seven-day recall period. The questionnaire consists of 13 questions, and in each question, the answers are scored from 0 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Reflux Symptoms Index (RSI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2 and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the Gracie Diet in GERD symptoms by changes in the RSI score. The RSI is a nine-item questionnaire assessing symptom severity, and designed to assess the severity of symptoms related to laryngopharyngeal reflux. Normative data suggests that a RSI of greater than or equal to 13 is clinically significant. Therefore a RSI &gt; 13 may be indicative of significant reflux disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Health-related Quality Of Life scale for GERD (GERD-HRQL) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2 and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Gracie Diet in GERD symptoms by changes in the score of the GERD - HRQL. The GERD-HRQL was developed to survey symptomatic outcomes and therapeutic effects in patients with GERD. The scale has 11 items, which focus on heartburn symptoms, dysphagia, medication effects and the patient's present health condition. The GERD-HRQL takes approximately one minute to complete. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with a higher score indicating a better QOL.</description>
