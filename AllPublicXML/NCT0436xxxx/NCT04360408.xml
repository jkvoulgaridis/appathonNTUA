  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common symptom reported by 70 - 85 % of people with end-stage kidney
      disease (ESKD) receiving haemodialysis (HD). Educational interventions involving energy
      conservation strategies are helpful in reducing fatigue. However, the effectiveness of energy
      conservation has not been previously studied in people with ESKD receiving HD. This study
      aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of energy conservation education intervention
      for people with end-stage kidney disease receiving haemodialysis (EVEREST) in Nepal.

      Symptom Management Theory (SMT) will guide this study. A pragmatic cluster randomised
      controlled trial (pCRT) will be conducted in one dialysis centre in Nepal. People on HD who
      meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate. The primary outcome is fatigue
      severity and the secondary outcome are other renal symptoms, occupational performance and
      health-related quality of life. Intention to treat analysis will occur and will include a
      change in the primary and secondary outcome. The study will provide evidence about the
      feasibility and effectiveness of EVEREST for symptom management.

    <measure>Changes in Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) will be used to assess the severity, frequency, interference associated with fatigue and daily pattern of fatigue. The scale consists of 14 items rated on the 11-point items.</description>

    <measure>Other renal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Other renal symptoms will be measured using the renal version of the IPOS (IPOS-Renal). It is a short 11-item measure, combining the most common symptoms experienced by renal patients and additional items from IPOS on concerns beyond symptoms, such as information needs, practice issues, family anxiety during the past three days. Ten questions, including 23 subitems, covers physical and psychological symptoms, carer anxiety and practical issues with optional items for any other concern. Each item is scored using a five-point Likert scale for severity and total score reflect symptom burden.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occupational Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a valid and reliable instrument that measures the occupational performance. The COPM is designed to identify changes in the individual's personal perceptions of occupational performance over a period of time. Individual rates their performance within the area of self-care, productivity and leisure and satisfaction with their performance. Both scales range from 1-10, with higher values indicating better performance and greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured using the SF-36 which is the 36-items self-administered survey of a patient's health. There are two distinct concepts measured by the SF-36 represented by the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). For each sub-scale, items are scored using a Likert scale, summed and transformed on to a scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health)</description>

    <description>The total program consisting of three educational sessions (at Week -1, week -3 and week -5) and one booster session (week -10) over a period of 12 weeks. Participants will receive individual, face to face education during their regular HD session. Education will be provided over 30-45 minutes for the first session, 30 minutes in the next two sessions and 30-45 minutes for the booster session. The lead researcher, who is a nurse, will deliver the entire intervention to avoid information bias. The simple language will be used, and emphasis will be given on the objectives of each session.</description>
