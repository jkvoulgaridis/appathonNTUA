  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to be a two-arm, non-randomized prospective phase 2 study
      evaluating the impact of medical physicist patient intervention on the anxiety level and
      patient satisfaction of patients undergoing a course of radiation therapy. The goal is to
      demonstrate that these interventions will have a significantly positive impact on the overall
      well-being of the oncology patients.

    <description>Patients will be scheduled for CT (computed tomography ) simulation for radiation treatment planning. Prior to simulation, patients will be asked to complete anxiety and patient satisfaction questionnaires. Following completion of the questionnaires, each patient will receive the first intervention with a member of the medical physics team to review the process of simulation, treatment planning, and subsequent treatment. This meeting will last approximately 15 minutes and at this time, the team member will explain that they are the primary resource for all the technical aspects related to the patient's treatment. Additionally, they will identify and address any concerns that patients or their caregivers have with radiation treatment and the patient will be shown the simulation infographic. The patient will then be asked to complete a second set of anxiety and patient satisfaction questionnaires and will then undergo the planned simulation.</description>
