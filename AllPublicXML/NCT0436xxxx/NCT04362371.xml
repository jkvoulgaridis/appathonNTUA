  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present PMCF study with a 6 month follow up period is to identify
      potential new and unknown risks associated with longer term use of Ainara® and (considering
      the duration of symptoms in GSM) to collect additional data regarding efficacy of a long-term
      treatment with this medical device.

      This is an interventional prospective study. It fits/pertains into the category of Post
      Marketing Clinical Follow up studies. The study evaluates performance, safety, and quality of
      life in late menopausal transition and post-menopausal women treated with the medical device
      Ainara® vaginal gel for vaginal dryness for 6 months The Research Question of the present
      study is the following: in a population composed of menopausal transition and menopausal
      women treated with polycarbophilic vaginal gel (Ainara®) for vaginal dryness, will a 6-month
      post marketing follow up study be able to give a reliable overview on the long-term
      performance (in terms of VHI, subjective and objective symptoms, and female sexual function),
      safety (in terms of patient and Investigator evaluation, and potential unknown risks of
      ADE/SADE/USADE/AE/SAE) and quality of life of this medical device.

    <description>subjective symptoms: dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and dysuria reported on patient diary and scored as reported in the AGATA study as follows: 0 = absence, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe intensity. The change in these variables will be evaluated from baseline to days 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 (final visit).</description>

    <description>Vaginal pH: it will be measured by the Investigators with a test strip delivered by Sponsor. The baseline values can be from 5.0 (this was the minimum value need for vaginal atrophy diagnosis in AGATA study) to 9.0. The Investigator will insert the pH strip into the upper wall of the vagina and will consider the reading made while the strip is still damp. For this outcome the change of mean values will be analysed from baseline to Visit 2 (final visit).</description>

    <measure>Global Symptom Score (GSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Global Symptom Score (GSS)(20) a composite score of symptoms, will be obtained to assess the effect of treatment on all individual symptoms taken as a whole. It will be calculated by the addition of the intensity scores of all individual symptoms (range, 1-15: 1 = only mild vaginal dryness, 15 = all five symptoms severe in intensity). This outcome will be analysed assessing the change from baseline visit to day 180 visit (final visit).</description>

    <description>Ainara is a class II medical device, already marketed in several EU countries. The product is a mucoadhesive moisturising gel for vulvovaginal use, indicated for the relief of symptoms of vaginal atrophy and dryness, and related discomfort. In each packaging there is a tube containing the gel (sterile and viscous with about 87% water) and a syringe-like plastic applicator with cannula and plunger.
Each administration kit (subject kit) for patients of Ainara® will contain a box with 1 tube with 30 g gel, 1 cannula and 1 plunger. The gel quantity is enough for one subject over the course of the study (1 g at each administration).</description>
