  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a PET/MRI scanner and an investigational radioactive drug called
      [F-18]DPA-714 that measures inflammation in the brain, also called neuroinflammation, before
      chemotherapy and after 3 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy given as part of your clinical care. In
      addition, this study will use a PET/MRI scanner with an investigational radioactive drug
      called [C-11]PiB that measures the amount of abnormal protein (called beta-amyloid) in the
      brain that is a marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

      One of the most common complaints among breast cancer survivors is cognitive or memory
      problems especially in older adults. Researchers need to better understand the mechanisms and
      risk factors for cognitive problems in order to address this problem. This study seeks to
      examine two mechanisms, neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition, that have been suggested in
      other age-related cognitive disorders. This study may help physicians and researchers develop
      new treatments to protect the brain in cancer patients. UAB plans to enroll 20 participants
      in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 50 years of age or older

          2. Female gender

          3. Newly diagnosed treatment naïve women with breast cancer that meet the following
             criteria:

        Stage IIA: Any 1 of these conditions:

          1. There is no evidence of a tumor in the breast, but the cancer has spread to 1 to 3
             axillary lymph nodes. It has no spread to distant parts of the body. (T0, N1, M0).

          2. The tumor is 20mm or smaller and has spread to the axillary lymph nodes (T1, N1, M0).

          3. The tumor is larger then 20mm but not larger than 50mm and has not spread to the
             axillary lymph nodes (T2, N1, M0).

        Stage IIB: Either of these conditions:

          1. The tumor is larger than 20mm but not larger then 50mm and had spread to 1 to 3
             axillary lymph nodes (T2, N1, M0).

          2. The tumor is larger than 50mm but has not spread to the axillary lymph nodes (T3, N0,
             M0).

        1.The cancer of any size has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or to internal mammary
        lymph nodes. It has not spread to other parts of the body (T0, T1, T2, N2, M0). Stage IIIA
