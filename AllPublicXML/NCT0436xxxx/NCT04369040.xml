      This study is a single-center, randomized study, comparing two methods of oxygenation during
      micro-laryngeal surgery performed under general anesthesia and myorelaxation: high-flow nasal
      oxygen therapy (HFNO) or Flow Controlled Ventilation (FCV) using a laryngeal tri-tube. The
      study population will be composed of 80 patients, aged over 18 and under 80.
