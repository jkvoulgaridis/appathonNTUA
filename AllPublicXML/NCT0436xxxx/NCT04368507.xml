    <textblock>
      Metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of YYB101 in combination with irinotecan. In
      Phase 1b, YYB101 20 mg/kg in combination with irinotecan 150 mg/m2 will be administered as a
      dose level 0, and the safety and pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed based on the
      DLT after a 4-week treatment period. If no DLT occurs during the 4-week observation period,
      dosing will be continued every 2 weeks until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs. After completion of Phase 1b, the SRC will determine the RP2D of YYB101 and
      irinotecan, and Phase 2a will be initiated. Stage 2 will proceed when unconfirmed response is
      observed in one or more subjects out of 10 subjects evaluable for tumor in Phase 2a Stage 1
      which includes the RP2D dose cohort in Phase 1b.
