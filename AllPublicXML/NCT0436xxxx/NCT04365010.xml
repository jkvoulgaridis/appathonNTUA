  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is an important treatment in septic shock patients, however whether
      crystalloid composition affects septic shock patients outcomes remains unclear. According to
      previous studies, low-chlorine crystalloids could significantly reduce the incidence of
      kidney injury and 30-day mortality compared with high-chlorine crystalloids in critically ill
      adults. Therefore, we hypothesized that the use of low-chlorine crystalloids would result in
      a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE 30: overall incidence
      of death, new renal-replacement therapy, and persistent renal dysfunction) than high-chlorine
      crystalloids in septic shock adults.
