  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International guidelines recommend exercise as the first choice treatment for knee
      osteoarthritis (KOA). Muscle strengthening training (MST) and behavioural graded activity
      (BGA) show comparable effects on KOA pain, but the mechanisms of action are unclear.
      Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to tailor exercise therapy towards specific
      mediators and thereby optimize treatment effects. Based on previous studies, both
      exercise-induced anti-inflammation and endogenous analgesia are promising pathways for pain
      reduction after exercise therapy. This study aims to examine (anti)-inflammation and
      endogenous analgesia as mediators for the effect of MST and/or BGA on pain in patients with
      KOA. Therefore, a 3-arm randomized clinical trial is established: 12 weeks of muscle
      strengthening training, behavioural graded activity or control. Mediator analysis will be
      performed. Unravelling the mechanisms of action of exercise therapy in KOA will not only be
      extremely valuable for researchers, but also for exercise immunology and pain scientists. The
      results of this research will also find their way into clinical practice: thanks to the
      current project, tailoring exercise therapy programs towards specific mechanistic factors and
      thereby optimizing treatment effects will be at the horizon for patients suffering from KOA.

    <intervention_model_description>The patients will be randomly allocated to 12 weeks of either muscle strengthening training (MST), behavioural graded activity (BGA) or control. Randomization will be performed by using the method of randomly permuted blocks, utilising a computer-generated random number sequence. To keep both intervention groups balanced, randomization will be stratified for sex (male versus female) baseline inflammation status (hsCRP&lt;3mg/L versus hsCRP ≥3mg/L) and baseline central sensitization status (central sensitization inventory (CSI) score &lt;40 versus CSI score ≥ 40).
A list with patient numbers and the group allocation that results from this randomization procedure will be securely stored and only an independent researcher will have direct access to the randomization list. Patients will be scheduled to receive their first assessment within 1 week of randomisation.
Patients will be recruited in primary care and participating hospitals. Announcements will be placed in newspapers, pharmacies etc.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Outcome assessors will be blinded to the maximal extent possible. With regard to this, patients will be asked not to communicate with the assessors about the intervention received. The researcher who is responsible for the acute measurements, is not blinded for group allocation but the researcher responsible for the basal measurements is. Both researchers are blinded for the outcome analyses. Furthermore, at the end of each assessment, the success of assessor blinding will be examined by asking whether the assessor thought the participant had received the experimental or control intervention, including the percentage of certainty. The physiotherapists providing BGA will not be involved in providing MST, and vice versa. Additionally, the physiotherapists will be blinded for outcome measures. The statistician will be blinded to the allocation of the treatment groups and statistical analyses will be performed in a blinded manner.</masking_description>

    <description>The efficacy of endogenous analgesia will be evaluated by the conditioned pain modulation paradigm. Conditioned pain modulation will be tested with the electrical stimulator as test stimulus and the cold pressor (12 °C) as conditioning stimulus. The difference between the electrical pain threshold (baseline) and the electrical pain threshold during the cold pressor (baseline + cold pressor) is called the conditioned pain modulation effect. After electrical stimulation (Surpass LT Stimulator), a VNRS score from 0 to 10 will be asked.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessments will be performed at baseline and at week 13 (at least 48 hours after the last intervention) and at week 64.</time_frame>
    <description>Endogenous analgesia will be assessed by offset analgesia. Offset analgesia can be described as the disproportionately large decrease in perceived pain following slight decreases in electrical intensity.
Painful electrical stimuli (Surpass LT Stimulator) will be given to the patients into 3 time intervals. The electrical intensity of time interval 1 and 3 will be the same, while the electrical intensity of time interval 2 will be higher. Participants need to report their intensity of pain according to the visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 during the 3 intervals.</description>

The purpose of BGA is to increase the level of activities in a time-contingent manner and increase the level of physical activity in the subject's daily lives.
