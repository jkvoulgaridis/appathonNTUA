  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuronal damage caused by neuroinflammation in patients undergoing major surgery is the most
      determinant factor of postoperative cognitive disfunction (POCD). Neuronal damage can be
      detected through the measurement of biochemical markers of brain damage. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate neuronal damage and its association with POCD during liver
      transplantations. After the approval of the ethics committee and patient consents,
      preoperative and postoperative cognitive functions of 33 patients undergoing liver
      transplantation (LTx) were measured using the Mini Mental Test (MMT) whereas simultaneous
      neuronal damage was evaluated through the measurement of S-100 beta (S100β), Neuron specific
      enolase (NSE) and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. As a result, there was no
      statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative MMTs. However,
      there was a statistically significant decrease in postoperative GFAP and a statistically
      significant increase in NSE compared to preoperative values. The decrease in S100β level was
      statistically insignificant. In conclusion, neuroprotective approaches in the investigator's
      anesthesia protocol protect patients from brain damage during liver transplantation and
      prevent the development of POCD, which was indicated by the insignificant change in MMT
      scores and S100β level and the significant decrease in GFAP. Since the significant increase
      in NSE levels during liver transplantations was deemed to might have been associated with
      causes other than neuronal damage, NSE should not be evaluated as a marker of brain damage in
      these operations.
