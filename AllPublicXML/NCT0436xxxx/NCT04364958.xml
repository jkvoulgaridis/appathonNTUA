      Background: Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) have concerns and needs about
      their health and the health care they receive. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are tools that
      assist patients in making health decisions, when there is uncertainty about treatment choice,
      incorporating their personal preferences and values about the available treatment options.
      PtDAs can improve shared decision-making (SDM) and lead to better treatment outcomes. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based PtDA for patients with GAD in
      primary care.

      Methods and analysis:The general study design comprises two stages: i) Development of a
      web-based PtDA for patients with GAD, derived from an evidence-based Clinical Practice
      Guideline and, ii) Assessment of the effectiveness of the PtDA employing in a randomised
      controlled trial (RCT) design, in primary care centres of Tenerife (Spain). This RCT will be
      carried out with 124 patients with GAD, comparing the PtDA to usual care (fact sheet with
      general information on mental health). Patients will review the PtDA accompanied by a
      researcher. Post-intervention survey will be administered immediately after the intervention.
      The primary outcome will be decisional conflict. Secondary outcomes will include knowledge
      about GAD and its treatment, patients' values, treatment preference and intention, and
      decision quality with the decision-making process.

    <description>Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are tools that assist patients in making health decisions, when there is uncertainty about treatment choice, incorporating their personal preferences and values about the available treatment options. This PtDA will include information about GAD symptoms, diagnosis, causes, and benefits and risks associated to psychological and pharmacological treatments for GAD (based on the Clinical Practice Guidelines-GAD). It will also include a values clarification exercise, in which patients will have to rate the importance attributed to the different aspects of treatments (e.g., mode of administration, benefits, risks, time to improvement, probability of relapse).</description>
