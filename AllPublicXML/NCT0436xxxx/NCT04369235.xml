  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tCES) is contemporarily important issues in the advanced
      rehabilitation medicine. tCES can selectively change the excitability of regional cortex with
      non-invansive and safety properties. Therefore, the investigators aim to develop a set of
      tCES system with special waveforms for using in clinical rehabilitation of upper extremities.
      This developed tCES system is smaller than all commercial available products, which could be
      conveniently and portably wore on head for clinical rehabilitation. In addition, the present
      tCES system with special waveforms developing by our team is much more efficient on improving
      neuroplasticity than the traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in rats.
      The investigators hope the tCES system combined with the rehabilitation of body extremities
      will become a routine treatment for stroke patients at hospitals or residential
      rehabilitation in the future.

    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 6-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA-UE was performed (score ranges from 0 to 66) to assess upper limb motor recovery. Each movement is estimated by a 3-point scale (0-1-2). The total score of the FMA-UE is 66, and a higher score indicates that the patient has better movement ability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 6-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The JTT assesses hand functions commonly used in activities of daily living. The subtests are scored according to time taken to complete the task. Total score is the sum of time taken for each subtest, with shorter times indicating better performance.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Finger to Nose Test after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 6-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The Finger to Nose Test assesses coordination of upper-extremity movement. The number of complete nose-target movements during a 1 min period will be recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 6-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity</description>

    <description>The positions of the lesion side primary motor cortex were defined as C3/C4 according to the international 10-20 system of electroencephalograms. Sham tCES will consist of a 5-second ramp up to 1.0-1.5 mA direct current stimulation and a specific-added waveform followed immediately by a 5-second ramp down, no current in the middle 19 minutes 40 seconds, and a ramp-up and ramp-down period during the last 10 seconds.</description>
