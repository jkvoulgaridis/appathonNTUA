  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the stroke volume variation measured by both
      methods: transpulmonary thermodilution and electrical impedance tomography (EIT), during
      fluid responsiveness maneuvers and after fluid replacement in the immediate postoperative of
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients. Patients will be hemodinamically monitored
      with the VolumeView set in combination with EV1000 clinical platform and the display of
      valuable volumetric parameters (Edwards Lifesciences, California, USA). Simultaneoulsy,
      patients will be monitored with Enlight Electrical Impedance Tomography (Timpel, São Paulo,
      Brazil). Hemodynamic data will be assessed at baseline 1, one minute after the passive leg
      raising maneuver, after PEEP increment, and after 500 mL of Lactated Ringer's (bolus
      infusion). Blood gases sample will be assessed before and immediatly after the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the ICU, immediately after CABG surgery, patients are submitted to mechanical ventilation
      (volume-controlled mode with tidal volume = 8mL/Kg of PBW, PEEP = 8cmH2O and FiO2 = 60%,
      respiratory rate to maintain PaCO2 = 35 - 45 mmHg); hemodynamically monitored with VolumeView
      set in combination with EV1000 clinical platform and the display of volumetric parameters
      (Edwards Lifesciences, California, USA). Electrical impedance tomography monitoring (Enlight,
      Timpel, São Paulo, Brazil) is performed with a pair of electrodes belt attached around the
      thorax at 4Th - 6Th intercostal space, and a flow sensor attached between the orotracheal
      tube and the Y connector from the ventilator.

      Before initiate the protocol, patients are submitted to a bolus of usual care doses of
      sedation and muscular blockage (Fentanyl, Midazolam and Cisatracurium).

      To assess fluid responsiveness patients will be submitted to two different maneuvers applied
      in a random way: Passive Leg Raising (PLR) ant PEEP increment (PEEP). And after these
      maneuvers patients will receive a bolus of 500 ml of Lactated Ringer's.

      Measurements are performed one minute after each of these conditions:

        -  Baseline: before both fluid responsiveness maneuvers, before and after Lactated Ringer
           infusion, patient is positioned in 450 semi-recumbent position;

        -  PLR: Fluid responsiveness maneuver which patient is positioned from 450 semi-recumbent
           position to dorsal decubitus and the legs are raised at 450;

        -  PEEP increment: Fluid responsiveness maneuver which consisted in increased the PEEP
           level 5 cmH2O above the mean airway pressure, patient is positioned in 450
           semi-recumbent position

        -  Infusion of 500 mL of Ringer's; 450 semi-recumbent position.

      Transpulmonary Thermodilution assessment are performed by the injection of 3 cold salines in
      bolus - the injection volume varied from 10 - 20mL according to the patient's actual weight
      and EIT assessment are performed by 1 injection of 10 mL of hypertonic saline at 7.5 - 10%
      according to the patient's actual weight.
