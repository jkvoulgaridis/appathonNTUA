  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complicated schedules for topical steroid drops, forgetfulness and physical difficulties
      in instilling drops may compromise compliance, increasing the risk for secondary
      complications as PME post-cataract surgery, especially in a high-risk diabetic population.
      Dextenza, a sustained release steroid insert, could help preclude adherence difficulties and
      could provide better bioavailability, being as effective as or more effective than steroid
      drops in preventing PME. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of PME in diabetic
      patients undergoing cataract surgery when comparing with topical prednisolone acetate 1%.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized, fellow-eye, investigator-sponsored
      clinical study seeks to investigate the incidence of PME in diabetic patients with any level
      of background diabetic retinopathy undergoing cataract surgery treated with a 0.4mg
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert when compared to standard of care prednisolone acetate
      1% QID/1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/ 1 week, QD/1 week. Topical NSAIDs will not be used in this
      study and all patients will receive an intracameral injection of moxifloxacin at the end of
      the surgical procedure. After screening, a given patient for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, and gaining informed consent, each eye will undergo cataract surgery on separate
      days. The second eye will be operated on within 30 days of the first eye's surgery. One eye
      will be randomized to receive the dexamethasone insert using coin flip. The other eye will be
      prescribed a prednisolone acetate 0.1% eye drop QID/ 1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1
      week regimen. Dexamethasone insert will be placed 2-4 days before surgery (Day -4 to Day-2)
      and those randomized to receive prednisolone acetate to be started 2-4 days before surgery.
      After surgery, each eye will be followed for a period of approximately 60 days, consisting of
      four postop follow-up visits (eight total postop visits per patient). Primary and secondary
      endpoints will be assessed alongside standard-of-care procedures at all 7 study visits .
      Adjusting for enrollment period, the study will last a total of approximately 12 months.

    <intervention_model_description>This prospective study will use a fellow-eye design for 30 participants, summing to 60 eyes total. All eyes will receive cataract surgery. Per participant, one eye will be randomized to receive DEXTENZAÂ® insertion at the end of the surgery, while the other eye will be assigned to a standard of care prednisolone acetate 1% eye drop regimen.</intervention_model_description>
