  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence for benefited newborns following delayed cord clamping (DCC), including increasing
      hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, improving iron stores, and decreasing need for blood
      transfusion and incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, in term or preterm infants led the
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to recommend a delayed cord
      clamping at least 30-60 seconds in vigorous term and preterm infants at birth. Although DCC
      has been found to be beneficial to infants, the additional blood provided by DCC could
      increase the incidence of jaundice that requires phototherapy and the hyperbilirubinemia, and
      the time prolonged by DCC might jeopardize timely resuscitation efforts, if needed. The
      acid-base status in umbilical cord blood at birth reflects the newborn's aerobic and
      anaerobic intrauterine metabolisms and is an objective measure of the fetal exposure and
      response to hypoxia during labour.

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which glucose intolerance develops
      during pregnancy. It has been estimated in 2009 that nearly 7% of pregnancies are complicated
      by diabetes and approximately 86% of these cases represented women with GDM. The
      Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome study (HAPO) revealed that the infants of
      diabetic mothers (IDMs) are at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia,
      shoulder dystocia, and birth trauma. And newborns to diabetic mothers are at increased risk
      of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and hypoxia, a major cause of admission in
      neonatal intensive care units. There is little direct evidence on the implementation of
      delayed umbilical cord clamping in the risk group of IDMs. Therefore, it no clear that the
      effectiveness and impairment of DCC in IDMs.

      Therefore, the investigators conducted a prospective study in performing DCC in the infants
      of diabetic mothers versus the newborns with early cord clamping (ECC) to assess the effect
      of DCC on neonatal bilirubin levels, hyperbilirubinemia incidence, acid-base status and
      hypoxia in IDMs.
