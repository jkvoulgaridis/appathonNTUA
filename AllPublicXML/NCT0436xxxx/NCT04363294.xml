  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our ultimate goal is to design a multi-center randomized trial to test the hypothesis that
      targeted testing for transthyretin cardiac amyloid (ATTR) will improve survival and health
      status among aortic stenosis patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement
      (TAVR). The hypothesis of this pilot study is to evaluate if invasive cardiac hemodynamics
      obtained after TAVR, by using the AortoVentricular index (AVi), can be used as a novel test
      to help identify participants with ATTR.

      Aim 1. To determine if an abnormal AVi value can identify ATTR among aortic stenosis patients
      undergoing TAVR.

      Aim 2. To determine if s' from echocardiography plus AVi can enhance the prediction of ATTR
      among aortic stenosis patients undergoing TAVR.

      Aim 3. To design a pilot trial to improve patient outcomes after TAVR by targeted testing for
      ATTR.

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1. To determine if an abnormal AVi value can identify ATTR among aortic stenosis patients
      undergoing TAVR. Patients undergoing TAVR for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, with
      pre-TAVR echocardiography and post-implantation invasive hemodynamic assessment are eligible
      for study participation. The AVi will be recorded from post-implantation invasive hemodynamic
      assessment. Participants will undergo bone scintigraphy (99mTc-pyrophosphate Planar/SPECT
      imaging) within 28 days after TAVR. Participants with abnormal bone scintigraphy require
      evaluation for a monoclonal protein with blood/urine laboratory testing, and possible tissue
      biopsy/Hematology consultation to exclude light-chain amyloidosis. Participants who are ATTR
      positive will receive comprehensive heart failure management and possible genetic testing to
      evaluate for mutated ATTR. The prevalence of ATTR will be reported among participants with
      AVi &lt;0.5 versus ≥0.5 mm Hg/beats per minute. Test performance of AVi to predict ATTR will be
      reported.

      Aim 2. To determine if s' obtained from echocardiography tissue Doppler imaging plus AVi can
      enhance the prediction of ATTR among aortic stenosis patients undergoing TAVR. The s' will be
      recorded from pre-TAVR tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus. The prevalence of ATTR
      will be reported among participants with both s' ≤6 cm/second and AVi &lt;0.5 mm Hg/beats per
      minute versus s' &gt;6 cm/second and AVi &lt;0.5 mm Hg/beats per minute.

      Aim 3. To design a pilot trial to improve patient outcomes after TAVR by targeted testing for
      ATTR. The change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12 from baseline to 12-months
      and survival with reasonable quality of life at 12-months will be reported among participants
      who are ATTR positive vs. ATTR negative.
