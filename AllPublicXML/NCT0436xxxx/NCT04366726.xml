    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the ability of subjects to self-administer 300 μg
      abaloparatide-sMTS over a period of 29 days based on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) markers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy ambulatory female from 50 to 85 years of age (inclusive)

          -  Postmenopausal for at least 2 years.

          -  BMD T-score based on the female reference range &lt;-1.0 and &gt;-5.0 at the lumbar spine
             (L1-L4) or hip (femoral neck or total hip) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

        Every effort was made to enroll subjects with a T-score of -2.0 or lower but &gt; -5.0

          -  Good general health as determined by medical history and physical exam (including
             vital signs, and has a body mass index up to 33 kg/m^2

          -  Laboratory tests within the normal range including serum calcium (albumin-corrected),
             PTH(1-84), serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and thyroid stimulating hormone

          -  Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values must be ≥ 20 ng/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton,
             other than radioiodine

             disease)

          -  Diagnosis of cancer within the last 5 years (with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cancer of the skin)

             drugs, or bone anabolic steroids, including abaloparatide, teriparatide, or
             parathyroid hormone (1-84)

          -  Prior treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates at any time or oral bisphosphonates
             within the past year (12 months). Subjects who have received a short course of oral
             bisphosphonate therapy (3 months or less) may be enrolled as long as the treatment
             occurred 6 or more months prior to enrollment

          -  Prior treatment with an investigational drug or device within the past 3 months or 5
             half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer
