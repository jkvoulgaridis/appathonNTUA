      The study is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, unicentral (Huashan Hospital Department
      of Neurology/ Neurosurgery) and exploratory clinical trial. Subjects will be enrolled from
      Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorder specialized outpatient department of Neurology in
      Huashan Hospital and network platform of chronic diseases. Spinal Cord Stimultion (SCS) will
      be performed in department of Neurosurgery and cerebral metabolism will be assessed in PET
      center of Huashan Hospital. Specialists in Neurology will follow up 3 months to record any
      unsafe incidents of progressive supranuclear palsy patients after the SCS surgery to evaluate
      safety. Meanwhile, improvement in gait disorder (including 10MWT and TUG test score) will be
      measured to evaluate efficacy.

      The Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation on Progressive
      Supranuclear Palsy is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, unicentral and exploratory
      clinical trial.

      In the screening stage, patients clinically and radiologically diagnosed as progressive
      supranuclear palsy with prominent gait disturbance will be enrolled. Then comprehensive
      evaluations and spinal cord stimulation will be performed on patients eligible for
      stimulation. In the subsequent process of neuromodulation, changes of clinical presentations
      and cerebral metabolism of participants will be assessed. Any unsafe incidents in process
      will be recorded in detail.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis is Progressive Supranuclear Palsy according to International
             Movement Disorder society criteria for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (2017).

        2.18FDG-PET imaging was completed within three months before the operation, and the imaging
        results were consistent with characteristics of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, supporting
        the clinical diagnosis of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.

        3. The clinical manifestation is prominent gait balance disorder with &quot;freezing gait&quot;,
        &quot;turn difficulties&quot; and &quot;feet like a stick on the ground&quot;, &quot;instabillity&quot; and a fall
        history in the nearly 6 months (fall number less than or equal to 3 times).Or the
        researchers observe the existence of gait balance disorder, but patients can still walk
        without using external things with new freezing gait questionnaire survey more than 1
        minute.

        4.Those who fully understand the research and sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe mental symptoms or depression state.

          2. Severe cognitive dysfunction with MMSE less than 20.

          3. Severe loss of postural reflexes (inability to stand and work independently) and
             depend on a walker or wheelchair.

          4. Depend on nasal feeding tube.

          5. Female in pregnant state when grouped.

          6. Clear and definite history of neurological diseases (stroke, trauma, tumor,
             hydrocephalus.

          7. Complicated with severe heart, liver or renal diseases.

          8. Clear and definite contraindications for surgery, electrical stimulation and PET
             examination.

          9. Unsuitable for surgery according to evaluation before the surgery.

         10. Other conditions that researchers think unsuitable surgery.

         11. Those who participant in other clinical trials at the same time.
