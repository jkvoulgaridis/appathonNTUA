  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal asphyxia is a major cause of hypoxic Ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), perinatal death
      and long term neurodisability. This can be devastating for the individual and their family;
      the healthcare and litigation costs notwithstanding. In recent years have attempted to
      quantify the effect, and wider impact of intrapartum compromise, as well as the underlying
      mechanisms for it. After a poor outcome related to intrapartum care parents and healthcare
      practitioners often strive to understand whether the event could have been predicted and/or
      prevented. This can be difficult to answer, at least partly related to the heterogeneous
      fetal response to perinatal asphyxia. Mothers and the maternity service are increasingly
      encouraged to personalize care and their choices around the birth process, however the
      information required to guide these choices is most often missing. This makes it difficult
      for women and professionals to make an informed choice about their care, including the safest
      mode of birth for them and their baby.

      Aim of the study: Identifying antenatal and intrapartum risk factors associated with neonatal
      hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

      Antenatal, perinatal and postpartum data will be documented from the medical notes and from
      parental reports including;

        -  Booking factors (maternal age, smoking, parity, previous lower segment caesarean section
           (LSCS), multiple births)

        -  Antenatal factors (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, prelabor abruption, placenta
           previa, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, threatened preterm labor, gender, concerns of
           IUGR infant)

        -  Labor factors (induction of labor, pre-labor rupture of membranes, planned LSCS,
           gestation at birth, presentation, prelabor breech, breech delivery, duration of ruptured
           membranes).

        -  Infant characteristics included GA, gender, birth weight (BW), head circumference, and
           multiplicity.

        -  Clinical signs, examination findings and laboratory data also will be included. Most
           covariates will be extracted from patient's notes, routine data collection or as part of
           a routine clinical database.

      Data will be processed and analyzed using SPSS software and the results will be processed in
      tables and figures.
