      This is an international, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (left
      ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤40%) who have been stabilized during hospitalization
      for acute heart failure, evaluating the effect of in-hospital initiation of dapagliflozin
      versus placebo on the clinical outcome of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years (male or female)

          2. Currently hospitalized for acute heart failure (AHF) defined as meeting all the
             following criteria:

               1. Presentation with worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g., worsening dyspnea or
                  dyspnea at rest, progressive fatigue, rapid weight gain, worsening
                  edema/abdominal distention/anasarca)

               2. Objective signs or diagnostic testing consistent with volume overload (e.g.,
                  jugular venous distension, pulmonary basilar crackles, S3 gallop, ascites,
                  hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, radiological evidence of pulmonary congestion,
                  noninvasive or invasive hemodynamic evidence of elevated filling pressures)

               3. Intensification of heart failure therapy during admission defined as at least one
                  of the following:

             i. Augmentation of oral diuretic therapy [e.g., ≥2x outpatient regimen dose, addition
             of a second diuretic agent, or new initiation of diuretic therapy in a previously
             naïve patient] ii. Initiation of intravenous diuretic therapy iii. Initiation of
             intravenous vasoactive agent (e.g., inotrope or vasodilator)

             The majority of enrolled patients should have an established history of heart failure
             with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (defined as present for ≥2 months and for which
             the patient is on treatment). Trial leadership will monitor this proportion and may
             cap enrollment of patients without an established history of HFrEF (i.e., patients
             presenting with de novo HFrEF).

          3. Most recent LVEF ≤40% within the past 12 months (including current hospitalization)

          4. Elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (≥1600 pg/mL) or B-type
             natriuretic peptide (BNP) (≥400 pg/mL) during current hospitalization (NT-proBNP ≥2400
             pg/mL or BNP ≥600 pg/mL if patient in atrial fibrillation) (NB: for patients treated
             with angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in the 4 weeks prior to
             randomization, only NT-proBNP values should be used)

          5. Eligible patients will be randomized no earlier than 24 hours and up to seven days
             after presentation while still hospitalized once they have been stabilized, as defined
             by:

               1. No increase (i.e., intensification) in the dose of intravenous diuretics during
                  the 24 hours prior to randomization

               2. No use of intravenous vasodilators or inotropes during the 24 hours prior to
                  randomization

        Patients with and without type 2 diabetes are eligible for participation in the trial. The
        trial leadership will monitor the proportion of patients with and without type 2 diabetes
        and may cap enrollment of one subgroup to ensure adequate representation of the other.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic hypotension in the past 24 hours

          2. Use of two or more inotropic agents during the index hospitalization

          3. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2 as measured by the
             Chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation (CKD-EPI) equation at
             screening or rapidly progressive renal disease

          4. Use of an Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor within the last 30 days

          5. Prior intolerance of SGLT2 inhibitors

          6. Type 1 diabetes mellitus or history of diabetic ketoacidosis

          7. In patients with diabetes on insulin or a sulfonylurea, a history of recurrent major
             hypoglycemia (i.e., resulting in severe impairment in consciousness or behavior, or
             requiring emergency external assistance)

          8. Implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device or valve repair or
             replacement within 3 months prior to randomization or intent to do so during the trial

          9. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization (percutaneous
             coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) within 3 months prior to
             randomization or intent to undergo coronary revascularization during the trial

         10. Untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias or Mobitz type II or third-degree heart
             block (i.e., without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] or pacemaker,
             respectively)

         11. History of heart transplantation, current transplant listing, or history of mechanical
             circulatory support (either durable or temporary)

         12. History of heart failure due to restrictive or infiltrative cardiomyopathy, active
             myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis, hypertrophic (obstructive) cardiomyopathy,
             uncorrected primary valvular disease, or complex congenital heart disease

         13. History of cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension

         14. Women of child-bearing potential (unless using adequate contraception) or currently
             breastfeeding

         15. Current participation in a clinical trial with an unlicensed drug or device

         16. Study center employees or their family members

         17. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make trial participation
             not in the best interest of the subject, or would compromise compliance with the trial
             protocol (e.g., active severe infection, active malignancy)
