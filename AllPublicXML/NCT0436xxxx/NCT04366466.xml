  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the number of emergency visits for suicide attempts is estimated at 220,000 per
      year. Suicide management aims to reduce suicide risk factors in order to improve the mental
      health of patients and prevent recurrences.

      To day, no study has compared the approaches to health surveillance and case management in a
      clinical trial, nor established the benefit of each on commitment to care and beyond the
      prevention of suicidal recurrence.
