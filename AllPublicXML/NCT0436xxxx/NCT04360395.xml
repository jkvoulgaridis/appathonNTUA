      Our study design will consist of a cohort of adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy
      (CP) that will undergo a gait training protocol. All participants will complete MEG or EEG
      baseline brain imaging measures of their sensorimotor cortical activity, MRI brain/spinal
      cord imaging, neurophysiological tests of the spinal cord H-reflex and a series of mobility
      clinical tests. Participants with metal in their body that would interfere with the MEG
      (e.g., braces on teeth, permanent retainer) will not undergo the MEG tests but will undergo
      the EEG assessments. Those eligible for the MEG assessments will not undergo the EEG
      assessments. The assessments will be scheduled on two separate days (MEG/EEG + Spinal Cord
      Dynamics Assessments Day 1, MRI + Mobility Assessments Day 2).

      After completing the baseline tests, the participants with CP will undergo the therapeutic
      gait training. After completing all of the therapeutic gait training sessions, the
      participants with CP will repeat the same assessments that were completed at baseline.

      Separately, a cohort of neurotypical adolescents and young adults will also complete the
      baseline assessments. The neurotypical participants will not undergo the therapeutic gait
      training, but will be used as a normative group for interpreting if the changes seen in the
      participants with CP after therapy are in fact moving the system toward a normative state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) results from a perinatal brain injury and is one of the most prevalent
      and costly pediatric neurologic conditions in the United States that often results in
      mobility deficits. Our extensive experimental work has been focused on developing a
      therapeutic gait training protocol that will improve the long-term mobility of adolescents
      and young adults with CP. Despite our major breakthroughs, it is apparent across our
      investigations that some patients have vast improvements in their mobility after treatment,
      while others are clearly non-responders. This response variability represents one of the
      major Gordian knots in the treatment outcomes seen in adolescents and young adults with CP.
      We will address this knowledge gap with a multimodal approach that blends our expertise in
      MEG/EEG brain imaging, MRI spinal cord imaging, and assessments of the spinal cord
      interneuronal circuitry to probe the neurophysiological differences in participants that are
      classified as responders and non-responders after therapeutic gait training. The Specific
      Aims of this study will: (1) identify if responders and non-responders have differences in
      the strength of the sensorimotor cortical oscillations involved in the planning and execution
      of a leg motor action, (2) determine if responders and non-responders have differences in the
      neural synchrony within the somatosensory cortices, following stimulation of the foot
      mechanoreceptors, and (3) decipher if responders and non-responders have differences in the
      spinal cord microstructure and circuitry dynamics. Briefly, our study design consists of a
      cohort of adolescents and young adults with CP that will initially undergo MEG/EEG brain
      imaging, MRI spinal cord imaging, neurophysiological tests of the spinal cord interneuronal
      circuitry and clinical mobility assessments. After completing the baseline tests, the
      participants will undergo our therapeutic gait training protocol. Upon completion of the
      treatment program, the participants will repeat the same assessments that were completed at
      baseline. Separation of the participants into responders and non-responders to treatment will
      be based on the criteria for a clinically relevant change in the 10-meter walking speed test.
      The new data derived from this project will provide unparalleled insight on the potential
      neurophysiological origins of the diverse mobility outcomes seen in adolescents and young
      adults with CP after treatment. Finally, an additional cohort of neurotypical adolescents and
      young adults of similar age and sex will also complete the mobility, MEG/EEG, spinal cord
      imaging, and Hoffmann reflex protocols for comparative purposes.

    <description>The therapeutic gait training protocol will consist of 24-treatment sessions that will be performed 3 times-a-week for an 8-week period. All therapeutic exercises will be performed under the direction of a licensed pediatric physical therapist. Any sessions missed will be added on to the 8-week period. Each intervention session will consist of over-ground gait activities that will be completed in a 60 minute session with rests as needed. The key ingredients of the therapy will include: 1) activities of adequate intensity that promote gait adaptation and gait speed sustainment, 2) exploratory activities that enhance the somatosensory experience through rich/novel movement, and 3) optimally challenging activities that emphasize planning and problem solving that requires altering the leg kinematics to meet the environmental and task constraints.</description>
