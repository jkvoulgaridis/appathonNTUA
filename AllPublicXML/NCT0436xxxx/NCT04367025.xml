      For locally advanced gastric cance, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can increase the resectability
      of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival.

      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric
      cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce
      recurrence rate. Camrelizumab（SHR-1210） in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal
      antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma and Hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This study is a single center, open-label, randomized comparative phase II clinical trial to
      evaluate safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with perioperative chemotherapy
      in locally advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Differences in T
      cell expression were detected by single cell RNA sequencing to screen people who were more
      sensitive to immunotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China with incidence and mortality
      both ranking the 2nd among malignancies in China. Surgery is the only possible way to cure
      gastric cancer, however, over 80-90% of gastric cancer patients in China are in advanced
      stage. Locally advanced gastric cancer could be cured by multi-disciplinary therapies
      including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can increase the
      resectability of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival. However, the therapeutic
      effects remain unsatisfactory.

      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric
      cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce
      recurrence rate. Camrelizumab in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for
      injection which has been approved for melanoma and Hepatocellular carcinoma .This study is a
      single center, open-label, randomized comparative phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety
      and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally
      advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Differences in T cell
      expression were detected by single cell RNA sequencing to screen people who were more
      sensitive to immunotherapy.
