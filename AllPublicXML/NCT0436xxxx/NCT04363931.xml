  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bruxism is defined as a repetitive jaw-muscle activity characterized by tooth grinding or
      clenching accompanied with wearing of the teeth, and jaw muscle discomfort in the absence of
      a medical disorder . Bruxism has two distinct circadian manifestations: it can be nocturnal
      or diurnal. Hypertrophy of the masseter muscle is an objective sign of bruxism. Additionally,
      fatigue or stiffness in the masticatory muscles, pain in the temporomandibular joint or
      headaches are subjective signs of bruxism. According to literature, 85% to 90% of the general
      population experience episodes of bruxism during their lives. Thus, finding an effective
      treatment method for bruxism is crucial.The aim of this study is to investigate the effects
      of two different physiotherapy approaches on the masseter muscle thickness and stiffness in
      patients with Bruxism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no certain treatment for Bruxism. However, the most recent recommendation is to
      follow the Multiple-P approach prior to medical drug regimens and invasive procedures.
      Different methods used in the conservative management of Bruxism are known as the
      &quot;multiple-P&quot; approach, which consists of; physiotherapy, plates, pep talk, pills and
      psychology . Physiotherapy generally focuses on two objectives: decreasing the adverse
      effects of bruxism to the masticatory muscles and increasing self-awareness regarding this
      habit. These studies involve different intervention such as massage of the masticatory and
      cervical muscles, electrotherapy, therapeutic exercises, taping interventions or relaxation
      therapies . However, literature regarding which physiotherapy intervention is the most
      effective in bruxism is not clear. Therefore patients in this study were randomly divided
      into one of two groups; manual therapy or kinesio taping. All patients were assessed at
      baseline, received 4 weeks of treatment and were assessed following the 4 weeks.

    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold of Masseter Muscle</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain Pressure Threshold of Masseter Muscle at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Pressure Threshold was determined using a digital algometer (Lafayette Manual Muscle Test System™, Model 01163, Lafayette Instrument Company, Indiana, USA) which consists of a padded disc attached to a microprocessor control unit that measures peak force (Newton). The Pain Pressure Threshold of the masseter muscle was assessed via the algometer. During Pain Pressure Threshold assessment, the researcher positioned the algometer on the trigger points of the respective muscle and increase the amount of pressure applied until the participant verbally informed the researcher when the sensation of pressure became pain. The applied pressure was read from the digital screen after each assessment.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Sleep Quality at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is an index widely used to measure sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-reported questionnaire that includes 19 questions that when scored, are separated into seven domains. The seven domains are; perceived sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep medications; and daytime dysfunction. Each domain is scored from 0-3 and a total score ranging from 0-21 can be obtained. A total score of; 0-4 indicates a good sleep quality, 5-10 indicates poor sleep quality and scores above 10 indicate a possible sleep disorder.</description>

    <description>Manual Therapy is a widely used physiotherapy modality which is known to be effective in the management of musculoskeletal problems . Manual Therapy is a passive, therapeutic approach used to target a variety of anatomical structures with the intent to create beneficial changes in the amount of pain a patient experiences. Manual Therapy includes joint mobilization, manipulation, or treatment of the soft tissues and is widely used to break fibrous adhesions, restore normal range of motion, reduce local ischemia, stimulate synovial fluid production, and reduce pain .</description>

    <description>Kinesio tape is a type of elastic therapeutic tape that was developed which is used in many different situations with various aims. Advocates of Kinesio Tape state that it may promote different therapeutic objectives such as; improved circulation and lymphatic drainage, pain inhibition, reduction of delayed onset of muscle soreness or improvement in performance and coordination .</description>

    <description>Participants in this group received 4 weeks of manual therapy and massage of the masticatory muscles intra and extra orally together with massage of the cervical muscles. Massage and Manual Therapy brings about benefits by increasing local circulation and decreasing muscle tonus . Additionally, stretching exercises aiming to decrease pain and elongate shortened masticatory muscle fibers by autogenic inhibition of the masseter muscle were performed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Kinesio Taping</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants in this group had an application of Kinesio Taping on the masseter muscles. The material used for bruxism Kinesio Taping application was Kinesio Tex Gold Finger Prints (Kinesio Holding Corporation, Albuquerque, USA), a 100% cotton, latex-free, 5-cm wide, elastic tape. Kinesio Taping placement was chosen according to principles described by Kase et al. Tapes were cut 2.5 cm in width (cut in half vertically from 5 cm width). Two strips of Kinesio Tape were crossed over the masseter muscle area with 0-5% tension in maximum stretched epidermis position. Web-cut strips epidermis-dermis-fascia technique were used. Tape was applied bilaterally after every session of manual therapy.</description>
