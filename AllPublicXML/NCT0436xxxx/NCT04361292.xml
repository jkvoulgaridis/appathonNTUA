    <textblock>
      Intrauterine insemination (IUI) combined with ovarian stimulation, has been an extensively
      used procedure for the treatment of patients with unexplained infertility. The aim of this
      study was to report the effect of ejaculatory abstinence on sperm DNA fragmentation and
      pregnancy rates in IUI cycles, as well as the correlation between the two.

    <textblock>
      Intrauterine insemination (IUI) combined with ovarian stimulation, has been an extensively
      used procedure for the treatment of patients with unexplained infertility. The fact that IUI
      is less expensive, less invasive, and easier to perform than other assisted reproductive
      techniques makes it the first-line treatment option in infertility treatments. Several
      studies have been published over the past few years examining the relationship between sperm
      DNA fragmentation and IUI outcome. The optimal period for ejaculatory abstinence before the
      semen sample is a controversial issue in the literature. There are only two retrospective
      studies examining the relationship between the ejaculatory abstinence period and pregnancy
      rates after IUI.

      Several studies suggested performing IUI with sperm samples obtained in a shorter abstinence
      period than recommended by WHO. However, there isn't enough research on this issue in the
      literature. Moreover, there is no specific prospective clinical research examining the
      relationship of ejaculatory abstinence period and sperm DNA fragmentation in IUI cycles. The
      aim of this study was to report the effect of ejaculatory abstinence on sperm DNA
      fragmentation and pregnancy rates in IUI cycles, as well as the correlation between the two

    <intervention_model_description>One hundred twenty eligible couples were prospectively randomized into two groups on the second day of the cycle just before starting the treatment protocol. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated random number list at a ratio of 1:1. From the randomization list, an independent secretary who was blind to patients' identities applied the allocation in consecutive order. Patients allocated into group A, had an ejaculatory abstinence period of one day, whereas patients allocated into group B had an ejaculatory abstinence period of three days.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>From the randomization list, an independent secretary who was blind to patients' identities applied the allocation in consecutive order. Patients allocated into group A, and group B. Care provider and investigator were blind to patient groups. Participants were informed about the timing of abstinence intervals, but they did not know which groups they were allocated to.</masking_description>

The fact that IUI is less expensive, less invasive, and easier to perform than other assisted reproductive techniques makes it the first-line treatment option in infertility treatments. Sperm that have been washed and concentrated are placed directly into the uterus around the time of ovulation. All patients had ovulation induction with gonadotropins and ovulation was triggered by recombinant hcg.</description>
