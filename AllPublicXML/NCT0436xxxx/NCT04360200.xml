  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and neurocognitive disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      and Vascular dementia (VaD) have become common diseases in the elderly. The burden of
      dementia is rising in China, with major medical, social and economic impacts. To address this
      important public health problem, cohort study on elderly cognitive disorders should be carry
      out. The methods of early prevention, early diagnosis and early treatment the cognitive
      disorders in elderly should be found to reduce the burden of the social and economic issue
      due to dementia. At present, the international corresponding guidelines have taken gene and
      brain imaging biomarkers as important indicators of dementia pathogenesis research, accurate
      diagnosis and targeted intervention. The study will construct a prospective cohort to
      establish database that provide not only comprehensive epidemiological data on the MCI and
      neurocognitive disorder in ageing people, but also complete the construction of biological
      samples bank and clinical diagnosis and treatment information database. Using the database,
      the study will identify the conversion rates from MCI to dementia and risk factors for the
      progression from MCI to dementia or AD. The study will also apply and develop brain
      structural and pathological imaging technology to support precision diagnosis of senile
      cognitive disorders. The study have goals to identify and validate imaging and blood/CSF
      biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of cognitive disorders.
