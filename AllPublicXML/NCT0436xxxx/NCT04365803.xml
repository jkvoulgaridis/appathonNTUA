      Pilot study on patients with invasive ductal breast cancer triple negative or HER2 +, N+/-,
      candidates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The principal endpoint of the study will be the accuracy of the result of the histological
      examination of the Vacuum- Assisted Breast Biopsy (VABB) performed pre-surgery in comparison
      to the result of the histological examination of the definitive surgical intervention in
      patients with radiological complete response at Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done after
      the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study articulates in five phases:

      Phase one: acquisition of the informed consent followed by positioning a clip into the cancer
      bed (by radiologist) if not already present; Phase two: after radiological confirmation of
      pathological Complete Response pCR done performing breast ultrasound, MRI and 18 FDG TC PET
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy the patient becomes candidate to VABB pre surgery.

      Phase three: the patient has VABB within 15 day from the term of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      Phase four: definitive surgical intervention within 30 days from the end of the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy Phase five: verification of correspondance between histology of VABB and
      definitive histology.

      The study hypothesis is that VABB could be used in the patients with pCR to the imaging
      post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy to confirm sensibility and specificity of PET / TC and breast
      MRI to show the absence of breast cancer.

      The use of VABB with negative histology result could bring to a therapeutic gold standard
      without over surgical treatment
