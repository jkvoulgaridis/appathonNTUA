  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized control trial aiming to explore the use of immersive
      virtual reality (VR) training in conjunction with real-life tasks therapy in 75 first time
      stroke patients with upper limb weakness.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to a control or experimental group. The experimental group will
      receive immersive VR training followed by the translation of related tasks in a real life
      environment. The control group will perform the same tasks in a real life environment but
      will receive immersive VR exposure to a non-related task.
