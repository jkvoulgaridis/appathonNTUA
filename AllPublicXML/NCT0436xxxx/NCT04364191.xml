  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia symptoms in older adults with mild cognitive impairment represent a significant
      public health burden in terms of impaired quality of life, risks from untreated insomnia, and
      risks from pharmaceutical insomnia treatment. To address the limitations in the most
      effective non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia in older adults with mild cognitive
      impairment, a randomized pilot study will be conducted to test a brief (4 week),
      tablet-based, personalized, multicomponent behavioral sleep intervention for insomnia,
      compared to a sleep education control, in this at-risk group. The findings of the proposed
      project will inform future, larger scale clinical trials and may provide a novel and
      innovative way for older adults with mild cognitive impairment to achieve better sleep and
      health-related quality of life outcomes.

    <description>RAND Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a multidomain scale that measures physical and mental components of HRQOL with eight subscales. The 8 subscales contribute to two resulting component summaries: a mental component summary (MCS) and a physical component summary (PCS). Both PCS and MCS scores range from 0 to 100 (lower scores indicate worse HRQOL).</description>

    <description>Meaningful activity protocol during the day and Assistive Relaxation Therapy (ART) at night; includes 1) Sleep Hygiene Education; 2) Meaningful Activity Modules a) Physical Activity b) Cognitive Activity and c) Social engagement; 3) ART, a breath-based relaxation intervention that is coupled with a physical anchoring task. Participants will complete a daily sleep diary, use the activity modules daily as pre-determined times personalized to the participant, use the ART software when they get in bed to help with insomnia symptoms, and wear an actiwatch for a four-week period. Participants will have biweekly phone consultation with the research nurse.</description>

    <description>Study participants in the control group will also receive a tablet and watch, but the meaningful activity modules and ART software will not be accessible to them. The sleep hygiene educational material represents an active control intervention and is recommended as part of the initial treatment of insomnia based on an NIH guide for sleep education. This approach provides staff and technology interaction/attention that is comparable to the intervention arm, and thereby promotes adherence; it has been used as a placebo comparator for many insomnia treatment studies and has low attrition rates. Control subjects will also be asked to complete electronic sleep diaries and wear the actiwatch on the non-dominant wrist to monitor sleep/wake patterns. For both arms, participants will be asked to complete baseline assessments, 1 month (post-intervention) and follow-up (3 month).</description>
