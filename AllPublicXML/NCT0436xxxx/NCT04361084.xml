  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of this project is to identify if mixed reality (MR) can support simulating the
      complexities of differing community environments compared to traditional physical structure
      simulated environments. Concurrent with this, the aim is to establish if mixed reality can
      produce a safe learning and reflective environment for community staff to develop their
      skills. This could potentially improve patient outcome and support healthcare teams to
      deliver safe effective care. Evidence suggests that simulation based learning improves
      confidence; although there is limited research available that combines simulation based
      learning and mixed reality. As mixed reality could provide high fidelity simulations, it is
      an area which requires much needed research.

      The scope of this project is to identify if mixed reality (MR) can support simulating the
      complexities of differing community environments compared to traditional physical structure
      simulated environments. Concurrent with this, the aim is to establish if mixed reality can
      produce a safe learning and reflective environment for community staff to develop their
      skills. This could potentially improve patient outcome and support healthcare teams to
      deliver safe effective care. Simulation is a technique for practice and learning to replace
      and amplify real experiences with guided ones, and are often immersive in nature. Simulation
      is a safe, learning environment, that encourages participants to reflect on the situation.
      Mixed reality is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environment and
      visualisation where physical and digital objects can co-exist and interact in real time.

      For sustainability of the health and social care sector, the long term aim is to facilitate
      people's healthcare needs in the community. Such increased community services will require
      staff with holistic skills to work as independent practitioners. Simulation in the acute
      setting is currently provided by the simulation team in the Trust's dedicated simulation
      suite, and through in-situ simulations within individual departments. The scenarios for these
      simulations can be created due to the repetitive and clinical nature of the environments
      required. Since becoming an integrated care organisation, the need to provide simulation
      based learning to all staff, including those who are out in community settings has arisen. In
      order to create a realistic learning environment for community based staff, there is a need
      to recreate an individual's home, accounting for all of the different environments the
      investigator's patients live in, such as a small residence with tight spaces, differing
      levels of cleanliness and the addition of pets, which is very difficult using traditional
      simulation methods. The need to develop an innovative way of delivering community based
      simulation is therefore important, to allow all staff access to valuable simulation based
      learning while providing a safe and supportive environment to practice both technical and
      non-technical skills.

      The investigator proposes to run two simulations per week resulting in undertaking a total of
      34 simulations. One of these will be using traditional methods of simulation, and the other
      will be using mixed reality. Using traditional methods, physical items will be used to
      recreate the community environment. It can be costly, time consuming and difficult to achieve
      the desired environment. Mixed reality provides the option of quickly immersing participants
      into different environments,allowing participants to experience all of the features. This
      makes it a very useful to method to compare to traditional methods of simulation, as the
      outcomes could be potentially be more realistic. The investigator will use questionnaires to
      get feedback from participants, both before, and after they have taken part in the
      simulation. This feedback will be used to determine if participants feel more confident and
      competent from traditional methods of simulation or mixed reality based simulation. It will
      also assess which environment they feel creates a more realistic environment to learn in.
      Qualitative data will be collected by those participants who choose to take part in a
      semi-structured interview. Alongside collecting data from participants the simulation
      technicians will also be asked via a face to face approach to attend a semi-structured
      interview regarding the feasibility and adaptable of both simulations. This is voluntary. As
      although participants feedback is important it is also essential that the technician feedback
      is included as they will be the ones that have to assist with running the simulations. The
      semi-structured interviews will be undertaken similar to participants semi-structured
      interviews, with written consent forms, recording of interview and confidentiality. However
      the questions will be different. They will be given a participant information sheet when they
      are approached. Evidence suggests that simulation based learning improves confidence;
      although there is limited research available that combines simulation based learning and
      mixed reality. As mixed reality could provide high fidelity simulations, it is an area which
      requires much needed research.

    <description>Participants will undertake the Community simulation using traditional methods, physical items to recreate the community environment. Training will be in pairs and will play the role of their own profession when undertaking simulated scenarios. Medium to low fidelity traditional simulation techniques involving scenarios played out using actors as (standardised patients) to participants. Following a briefing, the participants will be asked a series of questions prior to the simulation to establish their profession, age and level of previous training achieved so this can be compared against the results and are anonymous. They will also complete their pre-questionnaire which will anonymous. Afterwards participants undertake a post-questionnaire and then asked if they wish to take part in a semi-structured interview.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants need to be full or part time healthcare staff that work within the
             community setting, patients own homes.

               -  These participants can be registered or non-registered staff but needs to be
                  clinical members of staff

               -  Staff will be from various professions, including nurses, occupational
                  therapists, physiotherapists, assistant practitioners and support workers.
                  Relying on volunteers, the study is unlikely to have an even representation of
                  all professions, especially bearing in mind numbers of staff within each
                  profession (proportionately more healthcare support workers than specialist
                  therapist).

               -  Participants need to be employed, whether full time/part time or on the bank by
                  Torbay and South Devon to be able to participate in this study.

               -  As this is only for staff employed by the local trust, this will mean no one
                  under the age of 18 will be included in this study and those staff who are over
                  the age of 80 will also be excluded, as the Trust doesn't employ clinical
                  healthcare professions outside of these age limits.

               -  Only healthcare professionals who have given implied consent will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any individuals who do not work with patients or services users within a community
             setting (patient's own homes or residential/nursing homes). This will mean
             non-clinical staff members will be excluded.

               -  Participants under the age of 18 and above 80 years old.

               -  Participants who are unable to provide informed consent.

               -  Participants who have one of the following health conditions will be excluded:
                  Conjunctivitis, Pregnant (5 months+), Corneal Ulcers, Ear infections/ear disease,
                  Corneal Infections, Influenza, &quot;Dry Eye&quot;, Head Cold, Iritis, Respiratory
                  Ailments, Cataracts or Glaucoma, Cochlear Implants or other Inner
                  Ear/Vestibular-Related Conditions (e.g.Labyrinthitis). Also anyone that is under
                  the influence of alcohol or drugs on the simulation day. This is due to the
                  unknown research of MR with participants who have medical conditions that could
                  be affected.
