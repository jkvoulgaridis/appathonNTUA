  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are an important part of infectious diseases. For some
      patients, those infections are recurrent and have many consequences such as altered quality
      of life, recurrent symptoms, antibiotics overuse… The primary purpose of this study is to
      estimate the proportion of patients in Puy-de-Dôme with recurrent urinary tract infections
      among patients with at least one UTI during 2019. The secondary purposes are :
      characteristics of patients with recurrent UTI, by sex ; determine predictive factors of
      recurrent UTI, by sex ; describe bacterial ecology of recurrent UTI and the proportion of
      multi-resistant bacteria.
