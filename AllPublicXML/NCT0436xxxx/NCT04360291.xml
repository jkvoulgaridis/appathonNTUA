  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To communicate with the observer and guide his gaze on the canvas, painters have developed
      different stylistic processes that artists, in the manner of scientists, have acquired on the
      functioning of human visual perception. This direct communication between the artist and the
      observer is strongly impacted for people with visual impairments.

      In order to improve the accessibility and autonomy of visually impaired people in museums and
      to allow each observer to feel the visual and emotional experience closest to the original
      work of the artist, it is essential to identify the modifications. perceptive generated by
      the constriction of vision

      In this experiment, the investigators study the adaptive strategies developed by people with
      retinitis pigmentosa in the perception of figurative works of art. Peripheral vision is
      crucial for detecting objects and directing attention to the relevant areas of the
      environment, while central vision, of high spatial resolution, is especially essential for
      identifying the nature of objects. The integration of perceived information in peripheral
      vision and central vision makes it possible to quickly and effortlessly develop a spatial
      representation of the environment, to activate categorical knowledge on the observed scene
      and to relate the various objects perceived. However, with the progressive constriction of
      the visual field, the visual exploration of the subject RP can not be carried out with the
      strategies used by the healthy subjects, in which the targets of the saccades are in
      particular determined according to the information perceived in peripheral vision.

      Through the recording of eye movements, the investigators compare the differences in visual
      explorations of people with retinitis pigmentosa and healthy people with or without a
      simulated deficit.

They will be invited to observe scenes of human interaction presented on photographs, pictorial works or artificial scenes with or without prior instruction.
In addition to the elementary variables recorded during the exploration by these subjects, such as the number, the amplitude or the orientation of the saccades, the sequence of fixations will be analyzed to define the exploratory strategy used.</description>
