  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore whether singing is a useful way of supporting people in
      South Devon to self manage aspects of their COPD and associated social isolation. It will
      also investigate whether a model of bespoke respiratory community choirs provides a useful
      service for our local community. The study will look at the impact of singing on breathing,
      wellbeing, frailty and engagement.

    <description>Singing for Wellness will use an uncontrolled observational study design. Two mixed-cohort, 12-week community choirs will be delivered by experienced vocal practitioners in South Devon localities: Newton Abbott and Torquay.
Lung function, frailty and health-related quality of life will be assessed by Spirometry, CRQ (chronic respiratory questionnaire), MRC breathlessness scale, Rockwood frailty and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Participants will be assessed at baseline and then again at completion of the 12-week course.
Written feedback from participants to capture qualitative experience using narrative and Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). The attrition and attendance rate will also be recorded for later review.</description>
