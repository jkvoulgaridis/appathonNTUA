  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three different ways to deploy a clinician-decision
      support platform called NOCTEM COAST among behavioral health care providers who encounter
      patients with insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia and other sleep disorders are highly prevalent among military service members and
      compromise readiness, health, and performance; increase the risk of injury; and are
      associated with astronomical healthcare costs. The first-line treatment recommended for
      insomnia is cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI). However, the large number of
      service members who are in need of this treatment outnumber the clinicians who are experts in
      behavioral sleep medicine and who currently provide this intervention in a cost-efficient
      manner and in a way that is acceptable and accessible to patients and clinicians. To address
      this challenge and scale the delivery and access to evidence-based behavioral sleep
      interventions, NOCTEM™ has developed a digital health platform called COAST (Clinician
      Operated Assistive Sleep Technology). However, the most effective way to implement the use of
      digital sleep health technology, and its comparative impact on patient outcomes, remain to be
      determined. Therefore, this trial will compare three different ways to deploy the NOCTEM™
      platform among behavioral health care providers who encounter patients with insomnia.
      Specifically, the study will evaluate and compare without external or internal support
      (NOCTEM), with external support (i.e., facilitation) offered by the NOCTEM team (NOCTEM+EF),
      and with external support and internal support from local champions (NOCTEM+EF/IF). The trial
      will also compare the overall magnitude of improvements in insomnia among patients who use
      the NOCTEM app with their provider.
