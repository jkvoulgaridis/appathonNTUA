  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study postulates that the application of Sirolimus, an anti-proliferative agent that
      inhibits neointimal hyperplasia, via Sirolimus coated balloon (SCB) will be safe and will
      result in better arterial patency in infrainguinal peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The aim
      is to evaluate the efficacy (12 month freedom from clinically driven target lesion
      revascularisation) and safety (freedom from major adverse events) of sirolimus coated
      balloons in the treatment of infrainguinal PAD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is imperative to have effective treatment strategies for PAD which can maintain the
      patency of arteries. The current standard of care for PAD is angioplasty which includes usage
      of drug coated balloons (DCB). Paclitaxel is the only anti-proliferative drug available in
      all currently available DCB technology. Sirolimus is another highly effective
      anti-proliferative drug of immense potential as demonstrated by superior results in Sirolimus
      drug eluting stents in coronary disease. The physical properties of Sirolimus have made it
      challenging for it to be similarly applied to DCB technology and it is only due to recent
      advances in nanotechnology that it is now possible to develop Sirolimus coated balloons
      (SCB), which is the study device used in this study. The study device allows delivery and
      deposition of sirolimus to the arterial wall. By applying this agent into lesions in
      peripheral arterial disease, this study aim to effectively reduce neointimal hyperplasia, and
      therefore prolong the patency of the artery and improve our limb salvage rates for PAD and
      CLI patients. Subjects will be followed up in the clinic at 6 month, 12 month, and 24 month
      post-intervention to assess primary and secondary outcome of safety and efficacy.
