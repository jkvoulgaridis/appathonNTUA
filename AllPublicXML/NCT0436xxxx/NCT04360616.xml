        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women aged 18 years and over with full capacity for civil conduct;

          2. Breast imaging examination (including mammography and breast ultrasound) found that
             patients with BI-RADS 4 or nonpalpable lesion need to have breast biopsy (refer to the
             classification of BI-RADS, which is consistent with the indications for biopsy),
             including some patients with BI-RADS 3 nonpalpable breast lesions who are willing to
             have biopsy;

          3. Voluntarily participate in and sign the informed consent form, and be willing to
             accept the inspection designated by this test;

          4. The results of blood examination, coagulation examination, preoperative infection
             examination, and 12 lead ECG examination within 2 weeks before biopsy met the biopsy
             requirements;

          5. It conforms to the biopsy standard (refer to the image-guided breast histology biopsy
             guide in the breast cancer diagnosis and treatment guide and specification of China
             Anti Cancer Association (2019 version)).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women are participating in another clinical trial of drug or medical device;

          2. Women with neuropsychiatric disorders;

          3. Women with severe systemic diseases and serious bleeding diseases that can not
             cooperate with the examination, or the researchers think it is not suitable to
             participate in this clinical trial;

          4. Other subjects not suitable for X-ray examination
