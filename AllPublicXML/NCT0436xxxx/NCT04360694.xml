      Background: The thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD) regimen is widely accepted as a standard
      prescription. The concept of incremental dialysis has been established as a possible
      alternative for patients with preserved diuresis and end-stage renal failure in need of HD.
      The main problems related to prescription of incremental HD are an arbitrary use of
      infrequent regimens and the lack of clear standards for incorporating residual kidney
      function (RKF) in the assessment of HD dose. Several models have been proposed for
      prescription of incremental dialysis. The latest, the variable target model (VTM)
      (Casino&amp;Basile, NDT, 2018), gives more clinical weight to the RKF and allows less frequent HD
      treatments at lower RKF. Despite increasing evidence derived from observational studies to
      support the use of incremental HD, RCTs are lacking and, then, urgently needed.

      Methods/Design:

      The Division of Nephrology of the Miulli General Hospital, Acquaviva delle Fonti, Italy, the
      EUDIAL Working Group of the European Renal Association - European Dialysis Transplant
      Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation of the
      Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ConsorzialePoliclinico, Bari, Italy are starting a
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) in incident HD patients, whose name is &quot;REAL LIFE&quot;, by using
      the acronym of its whole definition: RandomizEd clinicAL triaL on the effIcacy and saFety of
      incremental haEmodialysis. REAL LIFE is a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre, open label
      RCT, investigator-initiated, comparing the intervention arm (incremental HD) with the control
      arm (standard 3HD/wk). It consists in starting the HD treatment adopting the new incremental
      approach guided by the VTM. The primary outcome is the survival of kidney function, with the
      event defined as urinary output (UO) ≤ 100 mL/day, confirmed by a further collection after 2
      weeks to exclude temporary illness.

      Discussion: REAL LIFE will enable the investigators to know with the highest level of
      scientific evidence the safety and efficacy of an incremental approach to the start of HD
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of dialysis patients are currently treated with a fixed dose thrice-weekly
      haemodialysis (HD) (3HD/wk). The 3HD/wk regimen has been assumed, until recently, almost as a
      dogma in the dialysis community. Incremental HD is based on the simple idea of adjusting its
      dose according to the metrics of RKF. REAL LIFE is a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre,
      open label RCT, investigator-initiated, comparing the intervention arm (incremental HD) with
      the control arm (standard 3HD/wk). A Variable Target Model (VTM) has been suggested, which
      gives more clinical weight to the RKF and allows less frequent HD treatments in patients with
      lower RKF. The investigators recommend to start and keep on with once-weekly HD, which should
      be possible until residual renal urea clearance (KRU) falls below 2.5 - 3.0 mL/min/35 L,
      i.e., glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≈ 4 mL/min/1.73 m2. The primary outcome is the
      survival of kidney function, with the event defined as urinary output (UO) ≤ 100 mL/day,
      confirmed by a further collection after 2 weeks to exclude temporary illness. Secondary
      outcomes are: composite primary cardiovascular endpoint (cardiovascular death, non fatal
      myocardial infarction and/or or non fatal stroke); intima-media thickness of the carotid
      arteries; specific cardiomyopathy control; RKF preservation; survival of the patients;
      hospital admissions; anemia control; mineral and bone disorder control; middle molecules and
      RKF. Considering a type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.20, the study must enroll 49
      patients in the conventional HD arm and 49 patients in the incremental HD arm, totaling 98
      patients enrolled into the trial. Finally, under the assumption of an expected drop-out rate
      of 15%, 58 patients per group should be enrolled for a total of 116. The assessment of the
      key kinetic parameters as well as the guide to the selection of operative parameters, as
      required to get the required equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V = 1.2), will be done by using SPEEDY, a
      spreadsheet prescription tool that uses essentially the same equations used by Solute Solver,
      the software based on the double pool UKM recommended by the 2015 KDOQI guidelines. SPEEDY is
      freely available at the European Nephrology Portal (ENP). The link is
      https://enp-era-edta.org/174/page/home. The control arm includes patients put on a
      thrice-weekly HD schedule, as detailed above. The dialysis dose (eKt/V) should be about 1.2.
