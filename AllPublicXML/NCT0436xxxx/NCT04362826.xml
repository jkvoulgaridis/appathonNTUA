  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of probiotics on the breast tumor
      microbiome and gut microbiome in breast cancer. Microorganisms that make up the microbiome
      (such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi) may have an important role in breast cancer
      development. Understanding the association of microorganisms with breast cancer may enable
      new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat breast cancer.

      The probiotic, BIOHM, which is owned and distributed by BIOHM Health LLC, will be used in
      this study. BIOHM is a food supplement that is believed to balance bacteria and fungi in the
      body and has received the designation as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). This study is being done to determine the effectiveness of BIOHM
      in breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of the investigational product (a novel probiotic)
      on altering the microbiome (bacteriomeand mycobiome) and polymicrobial biofilms in the gut of
      50 women with breast cancer given the novel probiotic, compared to 50 women with breast
      cancer given a placebo.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Determine the efficacy profile of the novel probiotic

        2. Analyze bacteriome and mycobiome profiles as well as polymicrobial biofilm composition
           from breast tissue and stool before and after consumption of the probiotic.

        3. Compare quality of life (QoL) of those receiving novel probiotic compared to placebo.

    <description>Quality of life (QoL) via EORTC QLQ C-30 will be converted into dimensions, which evaluate the quality of life associated with health. Dimensions are expected to range 0-100, with high scores referring to higher responses (QoL, symptoms) and are described by the arithmetic mean and standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U test will be utilized to compare the dimensions between each of the 2 groups (probiotic vs placebo groups). For testing the statistical significance of the change in dimensions before and after treatment (within probiotic arm; within placebo arm), the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used. P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</description>
