        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this treatment plan have to meet all of the following

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Patients with CML in chronic phase with or without T315I mutation, who were previously
             treated with all commercially available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the
             specific market and are relapsed, refractory to or intolerant of TKIs as determined by
             the treating physician or for whom the treatment with one or more available TKIs is
             contraindicated based on approved label

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2

          -  Patient is deemed by the treating physician to have the initiative and means to be
             compliant with treatment and follow-up requested

          -  Adequate end organ function, within 14 days before the first dose of asciminib
             treatment, as defined by:

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who may only
             be included if total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x ULN

          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN

          -  Serum lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN. For serum lipase &gt; ULN - ≤ 1.5 x ULN, value should be
             considered not clinically significant and not associated with risk factors for acute
             pancreatitis

          -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min as calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for this treatment plan must not meet any of the following criteria:

             the product

          -  Platelets ≤ 50 x 109/L; transient prior therapy related thrombocytopenia (&lt; 50 x 109/L
             for ≤ 30 days prior to asciminib treatment start) is acceptable

          -  Active uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including ongoing cardiac arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction within the past 3-6 months

          -  A current 12-lead ECG showing signs of QTcF prolongation

          -  A history of active long QT syndrome or risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) and risk
             factors for TdP, such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (patient can be
             corrected before start of asciminib treatment), or any cardiac repolarization
             abnormality

             chronic Hepatitis C (HCV) infection

          -  Significant other uncontrolled medical conditions, such as (but not limited to)
             uncontrolled diabetes, pulmonary hypertension

          -  Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment or
             within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, UNLESS they are:

          -  Women whose sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner

          -  Women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means

          -  Using a highly effective method of birth control (i.e. one that results in a less than
             1% per year failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices (IUDs);
             periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)
             is not acceptable Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the period of
             treatment and for 14 days after treatment discontinuation.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with
        serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
        reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment
        is she considered not of child bearing potential.
