    <textblock>
      The efficiency of the D3 lymph node dissection is still controversial for left colon cancer
      patients. This study will try find difference in 5-year overall survival between D2 and D3
      lymph node dissection. Investigation of the functional and short-term outcomes will clarify
      safety of the D3 lymph node dissection.

    <textblock>
      Discussion about optimal type of lymph node dissection in colorectal cancer continues during
      last 15 years, when in Europe was presented concept of complete mesocolic excision. However,
      this concepts is very close to Japanese D3 lymph node dissection and in the first view it
      seems the same but principal differences were found. Japanese concept is partial resection of
      the bowel according feeding artery (short bowel specimen, long lymphovascular pedicle),
      opposite European concept is wide resection of the bowel like hemicolectomy or extended
      hemicolectomy, sigmoidectomy. In complete mesocolic excision anatomical landmarks are still
      unclear but in Japanese guidelines it has anatomical margins which can standardize this
      procedure. Also nerve sparing technique around root of inferior mesenteric artery was
      described. One more difference is in histological examination of the specimen. European
      concept is to pay more attention to the quality of complete mesocolic excision and less - to
      the number of investigated lymph nodes. In Japan lymph node extraction is performed by
      surgical team from the fresh specimen and send to pathologist separately (each group of lymph
      nodes). Considering the absence of randomized control trials for patients with left colon
      cancer DILEMMA trial was started using Japanese approach

    <description>This procedure is performed for tumours in splenic flexure and proximal and descending colon.
Left colic artery is divided at its origin. Sigmoid arteries and superior rectal arteries are preserved. Inferior mesenteric vein is divided at the lower border of the pancreas. The colon is divided about 10 cm proximal and distal to the tumour. Mesocolic fascia is preserved and the length of the &quot;vessel trunk&quot; of the mesocolon corresponds to the level of lymph node dissection. After removal of the resected colonic segment a handsewn or stapler end-to-end or side-to-side colonic anastomosis is performed.</description>
