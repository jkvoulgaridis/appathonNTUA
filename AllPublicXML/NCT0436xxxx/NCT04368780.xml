    <textblock>
      The increase in the elderly population, insufficiencies in chronic diseases cause an increase
      in the number of dependent and dependent elderly. This situation negatively affects
      caregivers with elderly individuals. nonpharmacological interventions are commonly used to
      reduce the negative emotions of caregivers due to care. One of these applications is
      progressive relaxation exercises. This study was planned in a randomized controlled
      experimental study design to investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation
      exercise. on care satisfaction, care burden and depression level of caregivers who care for
      bed dependent elderly individuals. The study will consist of 10 interventions, 10 control
      groups, and 20 caregivers.

      Today, changes and developments in technology and lifestyles have lengthened average life
      span and increased the elderly population. The physical and cognitive changes, health
      problems, new roles such as being retired or widowed and economic losses come one after
      another for the elderly, and this turns the old age into a period full of difficul ties. Due
      to these changes in individuals with aging, older individuals make dependent and dependent on
      care. Caregivers experience care burdens, emotional stress, depression and anxiety during the
      care process. There are various non-pharmacological applications in the literature aimed at
      reducing the level of depression and care burden of caregivers. The non-pharmacological
      methods used in this study for older people's included progressive muscle relaxation
      exercise.

      Objective: In this study, it is aimed to determine the effect of progressive muscle
      relaxation exercise. on care satisfaction, care burden and depression level of caregivers of
      bedridden elderly individuals.

      Methodology: This is randomized clinical test. The study will consist of 10 interventions, 10
      control groups, and 20 caregivers. The progressive muscle relaxation technique combined with
      music was employed. In order to collect the data, we adopted the interview with form filling
      technique, using the introductory information form, The Carer's Assessment Of Satısfactıon
      Index (Cası-TR), the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS); and the Beck Depression Scale
      (BDS).

    <description>The CD on relaxation exercises developed by the Turkish Psy-chological Associationwas used.In the second of CD 30-min section; relaxation exercises are explained to the accompaniment ofrunning water sounds and verbal instructions. Progressive relaxation technique includes stretching and relaxing the bigmuscle groups (hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen,hip, feet andfingers) in the human body on purpose. When steps ofProgressive Relaxation Exercises are analyzed, it is observed thatlearning how to take correct and deep breaths is the most impor-tant step towards learning relaxation. In addition, taking correct breaths is used as a part of the exercise among all relaxation exercises.Steps of Progressive Relaxation Exercise:- breathing exercises- lower extremity exercises- upper extremity exercises- exercise of respiratory muscles.</description>
