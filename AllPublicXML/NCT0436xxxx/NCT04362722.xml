  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical phase II study is designed to investigate the efficacy of intratumorally
      administered L19IL2/L19TNF in patients with injectable lesions of BCC or cSCC. Favorable
      tumor responses following intralesional treatment with L19IL2/L19TNF have been observed in
      patients with injectable melanoma lesions of stage III or IV, for injected and non-injected
      lesions.

      The proposed clinical phase II study plans to investigate the intralesional administration of
      6.5 Mio IU of L19IL2 (~1.08 mg) and 200 µg of L19TNF to be administered in an approximate
      volume of 1.0 mL as a single or multiple intratumoral injections in patients with high-risk
      BCC or cSCC.

      There is a high medical need for non-invasive therapeutic strategies with a comparable good
      response rate and high recurrence free survival for treatment of patients with BCC or cSCC,
      who cannot be treated by or refuse surgery. Surgery is not always applicable, as it may not
      be feasible due to the anatomic location, may have a poor cosmetic outcome for the patient or
      is generally not accepted as treatment strategy by the patient. However, current non-surgical
      treatment strategies have a considerably reduced response rate and recurrence free survival.
      Based on the favorable results for injected and non-injected lesions obtained in the phase II
      study of L19IL2/L19TNF and the good safety profile seen in the subsequent phase III study,
      both in stage III or IV melanoma patients, we believe, that patients with BCC or cSCC will
      profit from intralesional treatment with L19IL2/L19TNF.

    <description>40 patients will be enrolled and treated with a mixture of 6.5 Mio IU (~1.08 mg) L19IL2 and 200 µg L19TNF once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. The dose will be distributed among the lesions via multiple intralesional injections.
New lesions occurring during the treatment phase will also be treated as described but the treatment period for new lesions will not be extended beyond the previously defined 4 weeks treatment period with clock-start at the time of the first intralesional L19IL2/L19TNF injection.
After the Tumor Assessment/Safety visit, patients may receive surgery in a curative intention within 6 weeks, in order to assess the pathological response with estimation of percent of residual viable tumor cells.</description>

             the Head of Medicine Agencies' Clinical Trial Facilitation Group and which include,
             for instance, progesterone-only or combined (estrogen- and progesterone-containing)
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine devices,
