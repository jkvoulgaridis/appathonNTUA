  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to ensuring staff safety during the COVID-19
      pandemic. Properly designed, formal PPE (fPPE) is in increasingly short supply, and a series
      of improvised PPE (iPPE) designs have been widely circulated on the internet, particularly on
      social media. Groups have started to publicise these devices through websites and the lay
      press. Some are even using crowd-funding to finance the purchase of these systems with the
      intention of supplying NHS workers in place of approved systems.

      It is not clear what degree of testing these systems have undergone. The investigators are
      already planning trials formally investigating the quality of seal offered by these
      improvised systems. Currently the team are investigating a designed based on a modified
      snorkel mask (STRIPE-1). In the current study the investigators wish to extend this
      investigation to consider the atmosphere within the mask.

      This is an important question, as modifications to the snorkel design have changed the way
      gases mix within the system. This might increase the risk that the user will rebreathe
      expired gases, which will dilute the amount of oxygen available to them, and increase the
      carbon dioxide levels to which they are exposed. At extreme deviations, these might pose a
      potential health hazard over and above the risks posed by COVID-19 exposure via a poor mask
      seal.

      This study will therefore recruit a convenience sample of 10, and request they wear two masks
      sequentially. These masks will comprise: a formally designed and tested commercial FFP3 mask,
      and one design of improvised PPE, based on the snorkel design available on the internet.

      Each mask will be worn for a total of 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes measurements will
      be taken with the user at rest. In the second 20 minutes measurements will be taken while the
      user undertakes light exercise.
