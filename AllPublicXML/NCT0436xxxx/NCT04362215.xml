  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Near vision deterioration during aging results from a decrease in accomodation amplitude
      (AA). Myocardial regeneration is limited, and cardiac aging is an independent risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. Thus, the investigators investigated the association between cardiac
      aging and AA.

      The subjects (500, mean 50-year-old subjects, with equal males and females) were divided into
      two groups according to AA measured with a Raf ruler. Biomicroscopy was used to capture
      images of the lens nucleus in the unaccommodated state, followed by images of a 4 diopter (D)
      accommodated state. The nucleus diameter change at 1 D accomodation was measured using
      ImageJ. Cardiac conduction system differences were evaluated using electrocardiography, and
      cardiac autonomic aging was assessed based on heart rate variability. Myocardial aging was
      assessed based on diastolic dysfunction.

      Lens cells and proteins are encapsulated, and they are not turned over or replaced.The lens
      nucleus starts to form before birth, so the nucleus is one of the three oldest tissues in the
      body .With aging, continuous cardiomyocyte stress derails proteostasis by causing excessive
      autophagy and protease activation, and, ultimately, contractile and electrophysiological
      dysfunction. Aggregate deposition, proteostasis deterioration, and diffusion degradation
      between the nucleus and cortex are the main reasons for lens aging.Heart, lens, and neuronal
      cells change significantly with age, and they are older than cells from renewable tissues.

      Near vision deterioration during aging results from a decrease in accomodation amplitude
      (AA). Cardiac aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Thus, the
      investigators investigated the association between cardiac aging and AA. The subjects (500
      mean 50-year-old subjects, with equal males and females) were divided into two groups
      according to AA measured with a Raf ruler. The nucleus diameter change at 1 D accomodation
      was measured using ImageJ. Cardiac conduction system differences, autonomic aging, myocardial
      aging were evaluated using electrocardiography, heart rate variability and diastolic
      dysfunction. For near distance vision,compared to subjects who could see clearly from 24-28
      cm, subjects who could see clearly from 29-33 cm had a 2.104-fold higher risk of a lateral e'
      velocity &lt;10 cm/s[95%CI; 1.312-3.374], 2.603-fold higher risk of diastolic dysfunction[95%CI;
      1.453-4.662], 1.54-fold higher risk of a low/high frequency ratio &gt;3.1, [95%CI;1.085-2.197].
      Subjective AA measurement can predict important heart aging parameters.
