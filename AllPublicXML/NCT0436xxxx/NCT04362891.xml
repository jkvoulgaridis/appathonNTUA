  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is need for evidence-based and reproducible data comparing the safety, longevity and
      patient satisfaction propensity of the various HA soft tissue filler products. Among cosmetic
      HA soft tissue filler procedures, especially the lip augmentation has become common.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether a statistically significant
      difference can be detected in the safety, longevity and/or patient satisfaction related to
      four HA soft tissue filler products widely used for cosmetic lip augmentation. Specifically,
      the aim of this study is to determine whether superiority of one or more product(s) over the
      others can be detected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Currently, hyaluronic acid (HA) soft tissue fillers are widely employed in
      cosmetic medical practice for facial contouring and rejuvenation. Among these procedures,
      especially the lip augmentation has become common. To this end various products have become
      commercially available, however to date no robust evidence is available to support the
      safety, longevity or patient satisfaction propensity superiority of one product over the
      others.

      Objective: To assess whether superiority in safety, longevity and patient satisfaction
      propensity can be shown of one of four most frequently used FDA-approved and/or CE marked HA
      fillers worldwide, used to augment the lip, over the others.

      Study design: Multi-center, randomized, controlled, four group, parallel, triple-blind
      clinical trial of 160 adult participants.

      Study population: Consecutive healthy individuals with no history of previous lip treatment
      and a self-reported wish for lip augmentation, who present at one of the private cosmetic
      medicine clinics in the Netherlands, will be recruited.

      Intervention (if applicable): After giving informed consent, participants will be randomized
      to receive a protocoled lip augmentation procedure by the injection of either 1 mL of brand
      A, B, C or D.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure will be the absolute lip volume
      augmentation as measured by the Lemperle Lip Index from baseline to 3-months follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of serious adverse reactions and side effects
      related to the procedure, the absolute volume augmentation from baseline to 2-weeks follow-up
      and self-reported quality of life and satisfaction with aesthetic results from baseline to
      2-weeks follow-up as measured by validated FACE-Q questionnaire scores.

    <description>The primary study treatment site will be the vermilion (body of the lip); additional areas (vermilion borders, Cupid's bow, philtral columns, and/or oral commissures) will be treated if deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Treatment will be administered through intradermal, subdermal, and/or intramuscular injection within the orbicularis oris muscle. Injection techniques for each area will include linear threading, serial puncture, fanning, and/or cross-hatching. The treating physician will determine the appropriate volume to inject based on clinical experience and the subject's goals for lip augmentation.</description>
