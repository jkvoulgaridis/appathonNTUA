  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate how patient knowledge and confidence in decision making can be impacted by shared
      decision making in common urogynecology conditions.

      The investigators will enroll patients seeing a specialist to discuss treatment of pelvic
      organ prolapse, overactive bladder and stress urinary incontinence in this pilot study. The
      study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of three decision aids designed to
      promote shared decision making conversations for these three condition. The investigators use
      a quasi-experimental design in which the investigators first enroll patients in the control
      arm and measure their outcomes. Then, the investigators enroll patients into the intervention
      arm and measure their outcomes. The investigators estimate that it will take about one month
      to recruit the control arm and one month to recruit the intervention arm. Patients will be
      surveyed after the clinic visit with a specialist and surveys will assess patients'
      knowledge, treatment preferences, shared decision making, decisional conflict and
      acceptability of the tool. A clinician survey will be administered and completed after each
      patient visit, that details how the physician felt about the length of the visit, how
      informed the patient was, and how far along they may be with their decision.
