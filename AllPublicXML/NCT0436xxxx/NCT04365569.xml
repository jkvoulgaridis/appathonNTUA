  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 65% of breast cancer survivors are overweight and less than one-third participate
      in recommended levels of physical exercise. Obese breast cancer survivors have been found to
      have greater than a two-fold increase in mortality compared to women with normal body mass
      index (BMI). The current standard for weight loss interventions involves in-person
      counseling. However, this incurs costs related to travel for counseling sessions, potentially
      limiting program participation, compliance and sustainability.This is a pilot study of an
      individualized in-person and telephone-based nutrition and exercise counseling program.
