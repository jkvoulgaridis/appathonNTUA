  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the effect of ketofol, a combination of propofol and ketamine, on hemodynamics and airway
      response during induction of general anesthesia has been studied before. Its effect on the
      smoothness of extubation has not been studied before. In the present study; we aimed to
      assess the effect of ketofol on the smoothness of extubation as regards, airway response,
      sedation score during suction and extubation and hemodynamic changes comparing it with
      propofol for induction of general anesthesia.

      After securing intravenous access by a 20g catheter, intravenous premedication (midazolam 2
      mg and 4mg ondansetron) was administered to all patients. Standard ASA(american society of
      anesthesiologists) monitoring (5-lead ECG, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse
      oximetry) was applied to all the patients for the recording of heart rate (HR), NIBP and
      oxygen saturation by a multiparameter monitor. Induction of general anesthesia was achieved
      as follows: in Group K (Ketofol group), fifty three female patients received propofol
      (1mg/kg) plus ketamine (0.5mg/kg) at the induction of general anesthesia while in Group P
      (Propofol group), fifty three female patients received propofol (2mg/kg) only at the
      induction of general anesthesia.

      Patients in both groups received fentanyl 2 ug\kg and atracurium 0.5 mg\kg. After tracheal
      intubation, general anesthesia maintained by isoflurane 1.5 volume % in 2 L\min oxygen-air
      mixture 50:50 and atracurium 0.1 mg\kg every 30 minutes, if needed. At the end of the
      surgery, inhalational anesthesia was stopped and reversal of the patients was done by
      injection of neostigmine 0.05mg\ kg and atropine 0.01mg\kg.

      Hemodynamics (HR and mean arterial pressure ''MAP'') was assessed at 5 minutes interval from
      the time of reversal of muscle relaxant up to 30 minutes after extubation.

      The level of sedation during suction and extubation was assessed using observer assessment
      sedation score and the airway response under direct laryngoscopy to suction was noted by
      five-point scale. After 5 minute interval, the level of sedation and smoothness of extubation
      was noted by four-point scale.
