  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate both Hall technique and atraumatic restorative
      technique in comparison to the conventional restorative technique in the management of
      carious lesions in primary molars.

      This study is a three arm randomized controlled clinical trial. Eligible children will be
      selected from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Public Health Department,
      Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University after securing necessary consents. One hundred
      and fifty five teeth will be randomly allocated into 3 groups fifty two each. Group I will be
      assigned to Hall technique Group II will be assigned to atraumatic restorative treatment
      using Glass ionomer cement, and Group III will be assigned to a conventional restoration and
      will serve as a control.

    <description>Orthodontic separators will be used to create space for fitting the stainless crown, then removed after 3-5 days
Occlusion will be measured assessing the patient's occlusal-vertical dimensions (OVD) using a modified version of van der Zee and van Amerongen method with a millimeter probe measuring the distance from the lowest point of the gingiva, around the lower canine on the vestibular side up to the point where the tip of the upper canine ends in order to assess the degree of overbite after mounting of the crown.
The correct crown size will be selected. The crown should cover all the cusps and approaches the contact points, with a slight feeling of &quot;spring back.&quot; till reaching the gingival margin. Cementation will be done using glass ionomer cement</description>
