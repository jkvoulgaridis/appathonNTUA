  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research has the following objectives:

      Specific Aim 1 (Phase II): Based off findings from the &quot;Development of a Resiliency Program
      for Siblings of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot; qualitative focus group study
      (protocol 2019P002284), the aim is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of an 8-session Relaxation Response Resiliency (SibChat) program for
      siblings of children with ASD.

      Primary Aim 2 (Phase III): To test the effectiveness of a pilot waitlist controlled trial on
      improving resiliency, and on improving stress coping, distress, growth enhancement, positive
      and adaptive emotions, anxiety and depression, worry, and sleep. This will be assessed by
      comparing Baseline-3 mo. scores on primary and secondary outcome measures between the
      Immediate and Waitlist control groups.

      Secondary Aims: Among participants randomized to both conditions, to investigate the extent
      of pre-post changes in primary and secondary outcomes.

      Secondary Aim 2: Among immediate condition group only, to assess whether end-of-treatment (3
      mo. post enrollment) improvements will be sustained at 6-mo. post enrollment.

  <detailed_description>

      This intervention will be a modified version of Dr. Elyse Park's evidence-based 8-week
      multimodal treatment which is designed to promote adaptation to stress and promotion of
      resiliency. The program is an 8 session, 1 hour a week multi modal intervention that
      incorporates relaxation techniques, stress awareness discussion, and adaptive strategies for
      coping with stress. This study will refine an 8-session group virtual-delivered resiliency
      treatment program consisting of 8 virtual group 1-1 Â½ hour sessions. The goal of this study
      would be to advance our ultimate objective to implement a national sibling resiliency
      program.
