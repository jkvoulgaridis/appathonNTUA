    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a global problem. Worldwide, 1.2 million people die of lung cancer each year.
      In Iraq, lung cancer is the most common malignancy after breast cancer and the leading cause
      of cancer-related death. Tobacco smoking plays a major role in lung cancer; it is reported in
      85-90% of lung cancer patients yet environmental tobacco smoke, environmental and domestic
      air pollution, work-related risk factors, radon exposure, and viruses may also have an impact
      on lung cancer incidence rates. Early detection of the disease before patients develop
      symptoms considers the best way to improve patient outcomes. IT LUCAS is designed to evaluate
      the utility of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening in early detection and
      management of lung cancer in high-risk people.

      Background Lung cancer is a global problem. Worldwide, 1.2 million people die of lung cancer
      each year. In Iraq, lung cancer is the most common malignancy after breast cancer and the
      leading cause of cancer-related death. Tobacco smoking plays a major role in lung cancer; it
      is reported in 85-90% of lung cancer patients yet environmental tobacco smoke, environmental
      and domestic air pollution, work-related risk factors, radon exposure, and viruses may also
      have an impact on lung cancer incidence rates. Early detection of the disease before patients
      develop symptoms considers the best way to improve patient outcomes. Screening for lung
      cancer using low dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been the subject of research studies
      since the 1990s. It has been reported to be superior to CXR and septum cytology for small
      tumors detection.

      Aim of the study IT LUCAS is designed to evaluate the utility of LDCT screening in early
      detection and management of lung cancer in high-risk people in Iraq.

      Study design 500 healthy participants aged 50-75 years with a history of smoking of at least
      30 pack year of smoking were recruited from Ministries of Oil and Transport. They were
      offered Low dose CT of the chest. Nodules with suspicious (Lung RADs 4A or 4B) findings were
      classified as positive and referred to the Respiratory Department for further workup and
      biopsy. Nodules with Lung RADS 3 features are reviewed after 6 months while those with Lung
      RADS 2 offered a LDCT after 12 months.
