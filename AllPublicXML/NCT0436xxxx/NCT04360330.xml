    <measure>Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Pre-Operative SABER</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 13 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pre-operative SABER therapy will be established as the highest dose level tested for which no more than 1 out of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Adverse Events (AEs) including DLTs will be evaluated by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants experiencing treatment-related toxicity by type and grade including adverse event (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Toxicity will be evaluated using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with Complete Pathological Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pCR will be defined as a negative pathologic specimen for invasive carcinoma. The specimen used for evaluation will be the tissue samples obtained from standard of care partial mastectomy and axillary surgery as per discretion of treating physician.</description>

    <description>Participant cosmesis will be evaluated-by-physician at 1, 6,12 and 24 months post-SABER therapy and post-surgical follow-up, using the Harvard 4-point ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor).</description>

    <description>Preoperative SABER: Participants will be treated with an assigned dose level of preoperative SABER, delivered in once a day, 5 fractions given on non-consecutive days, over a period of 2 weeks. In this phase I study, starting with dose level II, a dose level of preoperative SABER will be assigned per study dose-escalation design, treating 2 to 6 patients per dose level. The tested doses are the following:
Dose Level I: 35 Gy (5 fractions of 7 Gy)
Dose Level II (Starting Dose): 40 Gy (5 fractions of 8 Gy)
Dose Level III: 45 Gy (5 fractions of 9 Gy)
Dose Level IV: 50 Gy (5 fractions of 10 Gy)</description>
