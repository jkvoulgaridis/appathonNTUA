  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the next three decades, the world's population over 60 years old is expected to more than
      double its size. Even in the absence of an obvious pathology (i.e., healthy aging), advancing
      age is typically associated with a progressive decline in cognitive performance. Although
      pathophysiological changes in age-related neurodegenerative disorders have received much
      attention over the past years, far less is known about the neural processes affecting
      cognition in healthy ageing. One of these postulated processes is neural dedifferentiation
      (i.e., a decrease in neural selectivity, by which neural representations of processed
      information become less univocally distinguishable), possibly accompanied by the recruitment
      of additional cortical areas in the healthy aging brain. To date, these processes have been
      extensively studied on the neural level, yet their functional significance for cognitive
      behaviour remains largely unclear. This project will investigate neural dedifferentiation and
      its relationship to cognitive performance in the healthy aging brain. To this end, the
      investigators will use a combination of state-of-the-art technologies including simultaneous
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) as
      well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Perspectives include a better understanding of the
      relationship between neurophysiological mechanisms and cognitive performance in the healthy
      aging brain.

    <description>Within-subject design. In a visual discrimination task participants will be asked to identify specific features of visual stimuli (i.e., the gender of a face, or the motion direction of a grating). During this task, single-pulse TMS will be applied in one-third of the trials; sham stimulation will be applied in a further third of the trials; and no stimulation will be applied in the remaining third of the trials, while hd-EEG will be continuously measured. The order of these three stimulation conditions (i.e., single-pulse TMS, sham, or no stimulation, during the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd third of the trials) will be counterbalanced over participants.</description>

    <description>Sham stimulation is delivered with a dedicated coil, which is magnetically shielded and thus produces only approx. 20% of the nominal magnetic field. This is not enough to reach and stimulate the cortex, but the produced sound and scalp sensation are the same as with a real TMS coil.</description>
