  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an important disease with the incidence of
      6th all over the world. In Taiwan it is the fifth of male cancer mortality. Most of the
      patients were middle age and the impact for economy and society was incredible. For recurrent
      or metastatic HNSCC, the average life span was around 4-6 months. Most patients just can
      receive chemotherapy. However the chemotherapy can't have any survival benefit. Recently a
      study showed the Cetuximab plus chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil had survival
      benefit in the recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. However in Taiwan, the cetuximab can't be given
      by health insurance for the patients of the situation.

      A lot of investigations recently showed the B lymphocytes got involvements in the squamous
      cell carcinoma carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In addition the B cell will influence
      the tumor associated macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells. Those immune cells
      could decrease the affect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus the B cell depletion has the
      possibility to develop a new treatment policy. Therefore investigators create a pilot
      clinical trial using Rituximab plus chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine for recurrent
      or metastatic HNSCC.
