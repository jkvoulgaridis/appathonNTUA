      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A,
      C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine
      compared with those observed following the administration of a single dose of Menactra®

      Secondary Objective:

      Immunogenicity: To describe the antibody responses to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y,
      and W before and 30 days (+14 days) after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or
      Menactra®.

      Safety: To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and that of Menactra®.

             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥99.5 F or ≥37.5 C). A prospective
