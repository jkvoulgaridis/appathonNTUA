  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the effects of NAVA versus Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) on
      patient-ventilator interaction in pediatric patients with difficult weaning from mechanical
      ventilation after moderate Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PARDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12 pediatric patients, admitted in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with moderate PARDS
      and who failed up to 3 SBTs in less than 7 days, were enrolled in this study. These patients
      underwent three studies conditions, lasting 1 hour each: Pressure support ventilation 1,
      Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist and Pressure support ventilation 2.

      During each trial were recorded the patient tracings of flow, airway pressure and electrical
      activity of diaphragm for the patient-ventilator interaction analysis.

    <description>in each study condition, the asynchrony index was measured. The asynchrnony index value grater than 10% is an indicator of worsening patient-ventilator interaction. the Asynchrony Index is the ratio between the number of asynchronous events and the total respiratory rate, expressed as percentage</description>

        during the study, all patients (older than 1 month and younger than 2 years) admitted to
        Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for moderate pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
        and ready for weaning from mechanical ventilation were evaluated.

        All patients who failed up to 3 SBTs taking less than 7 days, presenting at least two of
        the following signs: diaphoresis, nasal flaring, tachycardia (Heart Rate increase ≥ 40 bpm)
        cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, apnea, PETCO2 increase &gt; 10 mmHg, decrease of arterial pH
        &lt; 7.32, PaO2 &lt; 60mmHg with an FiO2 ≥ 0.40 (PaO2/FiO2 less than 150), were enrolled in the
        study.
