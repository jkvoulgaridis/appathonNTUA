  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial to investigate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of multiple doses of VIT-2763 versus placebo in
      participants with non-transfusion-dependent Beta-thalassemia (NTDT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a 12-week treatment period and a safety follow-up period of 4 weeks.

      About 36 participants (adults and adolescents) are expected to take part in this study at a
      number of different institutions internationally.

      Adult Participants (Cohort I) will be randomized to receive either VIT-2763 once daily (QD)
      or twice daily (BID) or placebo, at a dose of 120 mg or 60mg depending on their body weight.
      Following cohort I review, adolescent participants (Cohort II) will be randomized to the same
      study arms with the same interventions.

      The study medication will be given as oral capsules, containing 60 mg of VIT-2763 or placebo.

          -  NTDT is defined as subjects having received less than 5 units of red blood cells
             (RBCs) during the 24-week period prior to randomisation/first drug administration of
             VIT-2763 or placebo (Day 1; 1 unit is defined as 200 to 350 ml of transfused packed
             RBCs and last RBC transfusion must have been received at east 14 days prior to
             randomisation).

          -  Male and female adult NTDT subjects, 18-65 years of age inclusive (Cohort I only) at
             time of screening.

          -  Adult or adolescent subjects with body weight lower than 40.0 kg or greater than 100
             kg at screening.

          -  Chronic liver disease and/or alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST)

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (according to
             chronic kidney disease classification Stage 4 or higher), and/or significant
             albuminuria greater than 30 mg/mmol. eGFR should be estimated according to Chronic
             Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKI-EPI) in adults, and Schwartz
             formula in adolescents.

          -  Newly diagnosed folate deficiency anemia and/or Vitamin B12 megaloblastic anemia.
             Subjects with known folate deficiency anemia and/or Vitamin B12 megaloblastic anemia
             who are on at least 12 weeks stable replacement therapy are eligible.

          -  Any history or clinically important finding of cardiac disorders, such as clinically
             relevant cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, coronary disease, valve disorder, or
             heart failure according to New York Heart Association classification 3-4.

          -  Subjects with history of partial or total splenectomy within 6 months prior to
