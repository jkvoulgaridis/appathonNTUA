  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at Seattle Children's Research Institute want to find ways to understand
      gastrointestinal disease such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      (IBS) and Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD). We want to compare healthy cells from the
      gastrointestinal tract to cells from people with gastrointestinal diseases.

      The investigators are looking for healthy participants 18-25 with no gastrointestinal
      symptoms to volunteer to have an upper and lower endoscopy and to collect blood and stool
      samples.

      The investigators hope the information gathered in this study will help to better predict and
      treat these diseases in the future.

      Participants who join the study will complete the following activities:

      1 hour appointment at Seattle Children's Hospital to determine eligibility Blood Draw Upper
      and Lower Endoscopy with tissue biopsies Stool Sample collection Participants will get $600
      to thank them for their time.

      Participants may be eligible for this study if they meet the following requirements:

      18 -25 years of age Do not have any abdominal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain)
      Are not on any medications (vitamins and birth control are OK) Have a BMI (body mass index)
      between 20-25 kg/m^2 Please note: Interested participants will have a 30 minute phone call
      with the study team and subsequent 1 hour appointment at Seattle Children's to determine if
      they meet all of the eligibility criteria.

      This study will enroll a cohort of healthy individuals age 18-25 to volunteer for an
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy and will collect of gastrointestinal tissue biopsy
      samples, blood and stool samples.

      Research Procedures include:

        -  Screening questionnaires

        -  Medical records review

        -  Height, weight, blood pressure and temperature measurements

        -  Collection of urine sample for pregnancy test and banking

        -  Blood sample up to 50ccs(volume based on weight)

        -  Stool sample

        -  GI tissue from endoscopy (4-16 biopsies collected from esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 4 -16
           biopsies collected from colonoscopy)

      Data to be collected:

        -  Demographics

        -  Medical history

        -  Pregnancy test results

        -  Endoscopy results

        -  Pathology results

        -  Clinical data related to endoscopy

        -  Clinical lab values

      Study population:

      The study will enroll 10 participants who meet the following criteria:

        -  Age 18-25

        -  No signs or symptoms of present illness

        -  No known history of chronic illness

        -  Not on any medications other than birth control or vitamin supplementation

        -  BMI between 10-25 kg/m^2

        -  Negative pregnancy test result

      Objective/ Purpose:

      The samples and information collected from this cohort will be used to understand the mucosal
      immunity of the gastrointestinal tract in individuals without gastrointestinal problems or
      history of chronic disease. This information will be used to study the immunology of diseases
      such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Graft vs. Host
      Disease.
