  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the specificity/sensitivity of the combined presence of cortical
      lesions (CLs)/leuco-cortical lesions (LCLs) and central veins sign (CVs) for multiple
      sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and differential diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLs and LCLs may be detected at 3 Tesla (T) MRI by using dedicated sequences. 3D Double
      inversion recovery (DIR), Phase-Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR), Magnetization Prepared -
      RApid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) and Magnetization Prepared - 2- RApid Gradient Echo (MP2RAGE)
      have all shown variable sensitivity to CLs and LCLs. The central vein sign (CVS, i.e. the
      detection of a central vessel in a focal lesion) has been recently proposed as a biomarker
      for distinguishing between MS and not and not MS. Both the presence of CL and CVs brings high
      sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MS from not MS patients; whether their
      combination achieves higher sensitivity and specificity to MS diagnosis and differential
      diagnosis is to date not know. This study investigates the specificity/sensitivity of the
      combined presence of cortical lesions (CLs)/leuco-cortical lesions (LCLs) and central veins
      sign (CVs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and differential diagnosis.

    <description>Image analysis/ Central vein detection will be performed using a fully automated approach based on an ensemble of 3D convolutional neural Networks. The method is applied to T1w, T2w and T2*w data . Results will be manually reviewed by 2 experts in CVs detection. MRI data must have been collected at 3 Tesla (3T) between 1990 and 2020 and must include T1 w, T2 w, T2-star based sequence (CVs detection).</description>

        MRI and clinical coded data will be collected from some of the European centers that belong
        to the MAGNIMS consortium (Oxord University, University College London, University Hospital
        Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona), Verona University) as well as from Basel University hospital.
        MAGNIMS members and associate centers have a common data-sharing agreement (enclosed).

        MAGNIMS is an independent European network of academics that share a common interest in the
        study of multiple sclerosis (MS) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI data must have
        been collected at 3T between 1990 and 2020.
