  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, open, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial will include 120
      patients with lower limb lymphedema who undergo treatment in an office-based vascular lab at
      the Ryazan regional clinical cardiology dispensary, Ryazan, Russia. The patients will be
      recruited by the staff of the Department of cardiovascular, endovascular, operative surgery,
      and topographic anatomy, Ryazan state I.P. Pavlov medical university, Russia. The study will
      include patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria.
      Patients will be divided into 4 groups, 30 subjects each. Group 1-patients with lower limb
      lymphedema who will receive conservative therapy with elastic compression and an antioxidant
      (Tocopherol-400 IU/day); Group 2-patients with lower limb lymphedema who will receive
      conservative therapy with Micronised purified flavonoid fraction (diosmin+flavonoids
      expressed as hesperidin)-1000mg/day) in addition to elastic compression; Group 3-patients
      with lower limb lymphedema who will be treated with elastic compression; Group 4- healthy
      volunteers with no history or clinical signs of venous or lymphatic disease; The duration of
      this study for each subject will be a maximum of 90 days. Pre-screening and screening will
      involve 200 subjects with a total of 120 subjects who will be randomized into the study.
      Peripheral blood samples will be collected to evaluate the activity of biochemical markers of
      endothelial function; the quality of life will also be assessed.

      Research methods:

        1. Physical examination;

        2. peripheral blood sampling (assessment of the concentration of the markers of endothelial
           dysfunction, including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SD), catalase( CAT),
           glutathione peroxidase (GP). MDA concentration will be determined with a competitive
           enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), which will be performed using a General MDA assessment kit
           (manufacturer: USCN Life Science Inc. US-CEA597GE). CAT concentration will be determined
           using a competitive enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), which will be performed with a kit for
           quantitative in vitro assessment of catalase (manufacturer: USCN Life Science Inc.
           US-SEC418Hu). GP concentration will be determined with a competitive enzyme immunoassay
           (ELISA), which will be performed using a glutathione peroxidase quantification set
           (abfrontier supplier, Republic of Korea - LF- EK0110). SOD concentration will be
           determined using a competitive enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), which will be performed using
           a total superoxide dismutase detection kit (supplier Cayman Chemical Company, US -
           706002).

        3. Lower limb venous sonography with a linear 5-13 MHz probe;

        4. Patient questionnaire using a Russian-language version of the Quality of life
           questionnaire &quot;SF-36 Health Status Survey&quot;
