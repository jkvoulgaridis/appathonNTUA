  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If someone is really sensitive to certain noises and sounds, they might have misophonia.
      U-HEAR is a study created to find out what helps kids and teens with misophonia. There are
      two treatments being tested in this study. The treatment your child receives will be
      determined at random. There will be a Two-Thirds (2/3rds or 66%) chance your child will
      receive a treatment called the Unified Protocol for Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A) that
      has been modified to meet the needs for youth with misophonia. There is a One-Third (1/3rd or
      33%) chance your child will receive a treatment called Psychoeducation and Relaxation. All
      participants will get ten free treatment sessions. Each session will last one hour and happen
      once a week. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
      the UP-C/A for youth with misophonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Misophonia is a condition characterized by intense affective and/or physical responses to
      auditory triggers. Negative affective states, including significant distress and avoidance
      are characteristic of misophonia. These negative emotional responses to trigger sounds, which
      result in behavioral problems and impairment, may be the primary targets for effective
      psychosocial intervention for misophonia. Transdiagnostic treatment approaches address
      clinically-significant distress through the use of evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral
      techniques (e.g., mindful awareness, problem-solving, and opposite action strategies) that
      allow for flexible and personalized treatment of core dysfunctions that cut across emotional
      disorders and lead to on-going impairment. This type of evidence-based, transdiagnostic
      approach includes skills applicable for problems observed frequently in misophonia including
      adaptability, problem solving, emotional (arousal) dysregulation and poor distress tolerance.
      The hypothesized mechanism of change of these core-dysfunction focused treatments is
      increased tolerance of distress in response to strong or intense emotion states. A secondary
      target is the reduction of maladaptive emotional behaviors (e.g., avoidance, aggression,
      escape) that may reinforce distress over time. To that end, this proposal aims to evaluate
      the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic
      Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A) for youth with
      misophonia. We will compare UP-C/A in a 2:1 ratio against a comparison condition (PRT:
      psychoeducation plus relaxation training), a behavioral approach that represents usual
      treatment in the community and has been utilized in clinical trials (35% response rate).

    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point clinician rated scale of treatment response anchored by 1 (very much improved) and 7 (very much worse). For categorical secondary outcomes, response is defined as a CGI-I rating of 1 or 2 (much improved/very much improved), and remission as CGI-S of 1 to 2. CGI-I will be used to measure symptom improvement after 5 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>Clinician rated measure of general functioning including impairment to capture functioning/impairment independent of diagnoses. The child or young person is given a single score between 1 and 100, based on a clinician's assessment of a range of aspects related to a child's psychological and social functioning. The score will put them in one of ten categories that range from 'extremely impaired' (1-10) to 'doing very well' (91-100. General functioning of the participant will be measured before treatment begins to create a baseline for each subject.</description>

    <description>The Misophonia Questionnaire is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses the presence of misophonia symptoms, emotions and behaviors associated with misophonic reactions, and symptom severity. The first two subscales are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true). These two parts are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 - 68. The severity subscale is a single item that asks an individual to provide a rating of their sound sensitivity on a scale from 0 (no sound sensitivities) to 15 (very severe sound sensitivities). The youth self-report (for those 10 and older) and parent report will serve as both a measure of symptoms of misophonia and allow for calculation of severity score.</description>
