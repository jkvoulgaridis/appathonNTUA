  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar puncture is a diagnostic procedure performed as part of the etiological assessment of
      cognitive disorders. Despite good tolerance and very rare complications, lumbar puncture is
      still perceived as being painful or anxiety-provoking by patients. Hypnosis could improve
      pain and anxiety when performing lumbar puncture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar puncture is an invasive procedure potentially inducing pain and anxiety indicated in
      elderly patients for cognitive assessment. Indeed, the measure of amyloid biomarkers and tau
      in the cerebrospinal fluid is useful in the etiological diagnosis of cognitive disorders.
      With the ageing of the population and the increase incidence of cognitive disorders, this
      diagnostic procedure will be more and more frequent. Many studies have shown the efficiency
      of hypnosis during invasive procedure, especially in young children. The absence of
      side-effect is a major asset in elderly patients at high iatrogenic risk. It represents an
      interesting alternative to anxiolytic or sedative treatments. Nevertheless, its effectiveness
      in the elderly during lumbar puncture remains to be demonstrated. Investigators hypothesized
      that hypnosis may decrease pain and anxiety during lumbar puncture associated to setting
      comfort situation (relational care, music, transcutaneous anesthesia).
