  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the study drug, 18F FTC-146, as a positron
      emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography (CT) radiotracer imaging agent to evaluate
      tumor status in patients newly diagnosed with osteosarcoma (&quot;bone cancer&quot;).

      Primary Objective: Demonstrate correlation of pre-post reduction in 18F-FTC-146 PET/CT with
      amount of post-treatment tumor necrosis in newly-diagnosed and treated osteosarcoma patients.

      Secondary Objective: Demonstrate correlation of pre-post reduction in 18F-FTC-146 PET/CT with
      amount of post-treatment pain reduction in newly-diagnosed and treated osteosarcoma patients.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be assessed with 18F FTC 146 PET/CT imaging at baseline and after neoadjuvant (pre surgery) chemotherapy but before surgery itself. Chemotherapy will be nominally three 3 week cycles administered over up to 12 weeks. The ability of 18F FTC 146 PET/CT to evaluate treatment effect will be assessed as the percentage of tumor that is assessed as necrotic after the treatment course. The outcome will be reported as the mean percentage of the resected tumor (removed by surgery) that is assessed by histopathology as necrotic, with standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be assessed with 18F FTC 146 PET/CT imaging at baseline and after neoadjuvant (pre surgery) chemotherapy but before surgery itself. Chemotherapy will be nominally three 3 week cycles administered over up to 12 weeks. Based on the PET/CT scans, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the tumor region of interest (ROI) will be calculated at baseline and after treatment. The outcome will be reported as the mean percent change in SUVmax from baseline to post treatment, with standard deviation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to Assess Treatment Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will receive neoadjuvant (pre surgery) chemotherapy, nominally three 3 week cycles administered over up to 12 weeks. The treatment effect of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be assessed as the change in scores on the PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) questionnaire, from baseline to post treatment. The result will be reported as the mean difference from baseline to post treatment, with standard deviation.</description>
