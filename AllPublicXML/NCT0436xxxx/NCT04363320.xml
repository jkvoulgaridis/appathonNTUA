  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The grant will test two timely and successful evidence-based implementation practices, NIATx
      Coaching and ECHO, with jail/community-based healthcare providers to increase medication
      assisted treatment (MAT) use with justice populations.

  <detailed_description>

      In this trial, the investigators will test two implementation interventions being applied to
      medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) dissemination and implementation in justice
      settings for justice-involved populations: NIATx Coaching and the Extension for Community
      Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model. NIATx Coaches provide expertise in MOUD implementation and
      organizational change to help treatment organizations and staff make, sustain, and spread
      MOUD. The ECHO platform focuses only on the provider side by connecting the primary care
      provider with expert MOUD prescribers to promote high-quality MOUD practices. This will be
      the first trial that assesses the comparative effectiveness of these approaches overall, and
      in justice settings.

      The trial will be conducted with a combination of 48 jails and community-based organizations
      that treat individuals with opioid use disorders (OUDs) post-incarceration. Sites will be
      randomly assigned to one of four study arms, with 12 sites in each arm: High-Dose
      Coaching/ECHO, Low-Dose Coaching/ECHO, High-Dose Coaching/No ECHO, and Low-Dose Coaching/No
      ECHO. The intervention period will be over a 12-month span with an additional 12-months for
      sustainability.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study will implement a cluster randomized block design where staff are nested within sites. The community-based provider sites and jails will be grouped into homogeneous blocks and then randomly assigned into 2x2 factorial design for each block. The forty-eights sites will be assigned to one of four study arms using a matching strategy within the blocks that groups four jail-clinic combination together prior to randomization. Each jail and cognitive behavioral (CB) treatment provider (or clinic) in these combinations will be treated as a site.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Percent of Eligible Justice Involved Persons initiated and on MOUD</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The intervention reach will be measured using data gathered through organization monthly tracking sheets and state criminal justice databases to track MOUD use. 'Involved persons' include those who are initiated onto any MOUD (buprenorphine, extended-release injectable naltrexone, or methadone) and engaged with MOUD use.</description>

    <measure>Change in Number of Prescribers using MOUD</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12-months, 24-months</time_frame>
    <description>The adoption of each intervention will be in part measured by tracking the number of prescribers using MOUD at each time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Recidivism Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12-months, 24-months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the intervention will be measured by the rate of re-arrest. This data will be collected at baseline, 12-months and 24-months using State criminal justice databases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of sites that continue to use MOUD post intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maintenance of the intervention (MOUD Sustainability) will be measured using the Program Sustainability Assessment Tool included in the Staff Survey at three points during the study (baseline, 12-months &amp; 24-months) to determine if likelihood of sustainability increases as study progresses. This tool has a total possible range of scores from 0-63 with higher scores indicating increased sustainability of the intervention.</description>
