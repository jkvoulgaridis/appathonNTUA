      Objective: To validate ethyl glucuronide in scalp hair, fingernail and urine as a biomarker
      for alcohol use in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.

      Background: Alcoholic cirrhosis is a leading indication for liver transplantation in
      abstinent patients. However, the assessment of alcohol use remains a daily diagnostic
      challenge. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is the most promising biomarker for the detection of
      alcohol use. EtG can be both a short-term (urinary EtG) and long-term biomarker (scalp hair
      and nail EtG). Although EtG is synthetized in the hepatocyte, the validation of these
      biomarkers and their proposed cut-off values is not present or scarce in patients with
      cirrhosis, impeding their widespread clinical use.

      Therefore, the investigators will assess the diagnostic accuracy of EtG in scalp hair,
      fingernail and urine in a cohort of patients with cirrhosis. In addition, the investigators
      will apply a new mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) method to visualize the distribution of EtG
      in scalp hair, allowing a visual chronological assessment of alcohol intake based on a single
      hair strand.

      Methods: Blood, proximal scalp hair, fingernail samples and urine will be collected from
      patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the Maastricht University Medical Center. Alcohol intake
      in the previous 3 months will be questioned using the Timeline Followback method. The
      diagnostic accuracy of hair EtG (analyzed with matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization-MSI and routine gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
      (GC-MS/MS)), fingernail and urinary EtG (both GC-MS/MS) for moderate and excessive alcohol
      use will be assessed in a validation cohort. Secondly, the investigators will assess the
      diagnostic potential of these EtG biomarkers in a clinical application group of patients with
      alcoholic cirrhosis undergoing screening for liver transplantation.

      Anticipated results: The combination of different EtG biomarkers allows accurate assessment
      of abstinence and alcohol use in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and therefore can be
      implemented in the daily care of liver patients.

        Patients with alcoholic liver disease will be included from the in- outpatient clinic of

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of alcoholic liver cirrhosis: consensus of the medical team based on (1) the
             patient history alcohol use (2) the exclusion of other causes of liver disease by
             blood analysis and (3) if available, liver histology findings.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old.

          -  For the validation cohort: reliable self-reported alcohol use. The reliability of this
             self-report will be based on (1) an interview by the researcher at study inclusion,
             (2) an interview by the physician at inclusion.

          -  For the clinical application group: patients with ALD who deny moderate or excessive
             alcohol use in the previous 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other liver disease than alcoholic liver cirrhosis: viral hepatitis, auto-immune liver
             disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and cholestatic liver diseases
             (primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) and Î±1-antitrypsine
             deficiency.

          -  For the validation group: unreliable self-reported alcohol use. Patients will be
             excluded in case of any doubt or inconsistency concerning the self-reported alcohol
             use.

          -  Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
