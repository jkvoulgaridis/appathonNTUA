    <textblock>
      Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) Syndrome are cancer predisposition
      syndromes due to germline aberrations in the TP53 gene. Patients with classical LFS have a
      lifetime malignancy risk between 80-90%, with 21% of those cancers occurring by the age of 15
      years. There are established guidelines for screening patients with LFS that have led to
      earlier detection and treatment of cancer in this population. There are a number of important
      issues facing patients identified to have germline TP53 variations. First, with the advent of
      massively parallel sequencing, increasing numbers of patients are now being identified with a
      wide range of clinical phenotypes associated with germline TP53 mutations, and the natural
      history of these patients is less well understood. Second, surveillance for malignancy in LFS
      and other TP53-associated syndromes involves frequent laboratory and radiologic studies that
      are imperfect measures of disease onset; therefore, more specific, less invasive
      biomarker-driven screening methods are needed. Finally, studies to date have not yet
      identified whether tumors which form in LFS or other germline TP53-associated tumors have
      unique aberrations or signatures that could be exploited in precision medicine treatment of
      these patients. In order to study these important issues in LFS, this protocol will establish
      a TP53 Clinical Database and Biobank. The Investigator plans to use this biobank to study
      genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with LFS and other germline TP53-associated
      syndromes, mechanisms of tumor formation, and novel methods of cancer screening in this high
      risk population.

      Context: Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) Syndrome are cancer
      predisposition syndromes due to germline aberrations in the TP53 gene. Patients with
      classical LFS have a lifetime malignancy risk between 80-90%. There are guidelines for
      screening patients with LFS that have led to earlier detection and treatment of cancer in
      this population. There are a number of important issues facing patients identified to have
      germline TP53 variations, including study of genotype-phenotype correlations, enhanced cancer
      screening modalities, and novel treatment strategies for cancers that develop.

      Objectives: In order to study important clinical issues in LFS, the primary objective of this
      biobank is to gather and store ongoing clinical data and biospecimens from patients with LFS
      and other potential germline TP53-associated syndromes. The investigators plan to use this
      biobank to study genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with inherited TP53 mutations,
      mechanisms of tumor formation, and methods of cancer screening.

      Study Design: This study is a retrospective/prospective biobank containing clinical data and
      data and biospecimen. Patients for inclusion will be identified by query of our clinical
      electronic medical record from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn
      Medicine (PENN) for patients followed in our respective clinics. In addition, patients will
      be recruited by ongoing prospective collection in clinic. Data collection, data entry and
      biobank maintenance, will be conducted by the investigators listed on this protocol at CHOP
      and at PENN through the Master Reliance Agreement. Future investigators and collaborators at
      other institutions will have access to samples and limited data by executing a written Data
      User Agreement and/or Materials Transfer Agreement with the biobank.

      Setting/Participants: The biobank will be conducted at CHOP and PENN. Any infant, child, or
      adult with a germline TP53 mutation will be invited to participate. In addition, individuals
      with a diagnosis of LFS or LFL, who have been seen by a physician at Penn/CHOP or referred
      from outside physicians will be contacted for participation. To provide control group
      samples, unaffected family members and/or household members will also be recruited.
      Prospective enrollment into the biobank is planned to be an ongoing effort, without a fixed
      end date or target subject number. At minimum, however, the estimated number of recruitment
      is approximately 300 affected individuals and their family/household members along with their
      data and specimens.

      Data/Specimen Collection Procedures and Frequency: The only required study procedure is the
      review of medical records. Optional study procedures include collection of germline DNA (via
      blood, saliva, urine, or hair), plasma collection, stool collection, and skin biopsies.
      Clinical data will be updated every 6 months. Subjects can opt-out of this follow-up process.

      For affected patients (group 1), collection of biospecimens will occur either once (i.e.,
      blood, buccal swabs, urine, skin fibroblasts), or every six months (i.e., plasma from blood,
      stool samples, and other specimens that are obtained and leftover as part of clinical care) .
      Unaffected family members (group 2) and household members (group 3) will only have samples
      requested once as per Schedule of Study Procedures (Group 3 subjects will not be asked for a
      germline specimen). None of these procedures are required for the subjects to participate in
      the study. Children &lt;18 years will complete procedures at CHOP, and adult participants will
      complete study procedures at PENN (adolescents and young adults seen at CHOP clinically may
      have their samples collected at CHOP even if over 18 years).

    <ipd_description>Only a limited data set will be available to future users of the biobank. To access data and biospecimens within the biobank, the prospective recipient executes a written Data User Agreement with the biobank, which will prohibit any attempts to re-identify subjects. Limited data will then be transmitted to prospective researchers using downloaded Excel compatible file formats. PHI will be maintained within the database as part of the consent process, in a partitioned and protected fashion (not available to future investigators) to permit the addition of updated clinical information into the biobank on a periodic basis. If for any reason the study is terminated, all data will be retained for six years, per CHOP policy A-3-9 for data retention. Following the end of data retention, data will be permanently de-coded and de-identified.</ipd_description>
