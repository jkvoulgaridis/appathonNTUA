  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of women's medical records to understand the impact of previous changes to breast
      cancer screening (increase from one to two clinicians examining each woman's mammograms, and
      what proportion of women they recall for further tests)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective observational study examining the records and outcomes of women who attended
      breast cancer screening between 1988 and 2016. Linkage of records from the breast screening
      service, the cancer registry, and mortality. Analysis of whether changing the threshold for
      whether to recall women for further tests or the number of clinicians examining the
      mammograms for signs of cancer affects outcomes.
