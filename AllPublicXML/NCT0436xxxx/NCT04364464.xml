  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY 63-2521 is intended to be used for a disease that affects the blood flow through the
      lungs. Renal impairment is a common condition in patients with this disease. The goal of the
      study is to learn more about the safety of BAY 63-2521, how it is tolerated and the way the
      body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study dug given as a single oral dose of 1 mg
      tablet in participants with renal impairment and healthy participants matched for age-,
      gender-, and weight
