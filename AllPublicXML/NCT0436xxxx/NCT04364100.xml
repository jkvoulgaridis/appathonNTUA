    <textblock>
      During their studies, the dental students of Brest (France) learn their future profession by
      working in the Dental University Hospital, from the fourth academic year. This clinical
      activity is considered as both a source of satisfaction and stress by most of the students.
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the experience of Brest dental students
      through a qualitative methodology, with individual interviews, followed by an analysis by
      grounded theory (Paillé, 1994).

      During their studies, the dental students of Brest (France) learn their future profession by
      working in the Dental University Hospital, from the fourth academic year. This clinical
      activity is considered as a source of satisfaction by most of the students. They are also
      reassured because they know that they will easily find an employment at the end of their
      studies. However, the clinical activity can also create a stress among the students, which
      varies with their progress in their studies (Polychronopoulou et Divaris, 2009). Other
      sources of stress could also be identified. This multifactorial stress can influence their
      well-being, their practices and their relationships with patients. The stress and
      satisfactions of the dental students have mainly been studied by some questionnaires
      (Inquimbert et al., 2017). The main objective of this study is to investigate the experience
      of Brest dental students through a qualitative methodology, with individual interviews,
      followed by an analysis by grounded theory (Paillé, 1994). This type of research can enable
      us to keep a broad approach of students' experience and to stay faithful to it.
