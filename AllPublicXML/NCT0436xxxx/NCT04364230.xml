  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine made of 6MHP and a
      mutated neoantigen peptide (BRAF585-614-V600E) combined with adjuvants. The adjuvants that
      will be used in this trial are a CD40 antibody (CDX-1140) and a toll-like receptor (TLR) 3
      agonist (Poly-ICLC). The study will also investigate the effects of the vaccine and the
      adjuvants on the immune response. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing
      tests in the laboratory on participants' blood and skin tissue.
