  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are commonly used in the therapeutic arsenal of
      metastatic melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, thanks to
      their inhibiting effects on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) and
      anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD1) respectively. These treatments can induce numerous
      cutaneous and non-cutaneous adverse effects that are mainly due to their immunological
      action. Their most frequent adverse effects are dysthyroidism, autoimmune hepatitis, colitis
      and skin disorders. Among those, pruritus is frequently reported as a side effect of these
      treatments. Its incidence has been estimated between 11% and 47%. Pruritus can deeply affect
      the patient's quality of life and may lead to treatment discontinuation. Until now,
      ICI-related pruritus has been poorly studied and it is not understood. In the literature,
      data on the presence and characteristics of pruritus in patients treated by ICIs were
      provided, without analyzing the causes of this pruritus. Indeed, it is not known if the
      occurrence of pruritus is related to direct or indirect effects of ICIs. Some authors
      reported a correlation between the occurrence of cutaneous adverse events under ICIs and the
      survival. The principal aim of our study was to analyze the putative causes of pruritus
      occurring in patients treated with ICIs for melanomas and cutaneous carcinomas. The other
      objectives were to assess the association between the occurrence of pruritus and survival,
      and between the other adverse events and pruritus.
