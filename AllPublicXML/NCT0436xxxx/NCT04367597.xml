    <textblock>
      A roll-over study of the current CM-2019 trial to assess the same preplanned outcomes of
      CM-2019 at 14 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This roll-over study is designed as a 14-week treatment continuation from CM-2019 (parent
      study), a randomized, sham controlled, double-blind, multi-center study trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of CyMedica Orthopedics e-viveâ„¢ system, a multifunctional electrotherapy device
      providing neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as an adjunctive therapy for pain
      relief and accelerating functional recovery in patients with knee osteoarthritis. This
      follow-up trial will include subjects who have been randomized into the CM-2019 trial.
      Subjects will be enrolled into the appropriate treatment group based upon the treatment
      received in the parent study. It is hypothesized that the continued use of CyMedica e-vive
      NMES may provide additional pain relief and improved knee function for an additional 14 weeks
      compared to sham.
