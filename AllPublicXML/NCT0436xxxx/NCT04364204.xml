  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of neonatal mortality and account for over
      one million neonatal deaths annually. About 12% of babies are born before 37 weeks of
      gestation, and are at risk for hypothermia, hypoglycemia, infections, and mortality during
      the first 28 days of life. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) has been shown to reduce hypothermia,
      neonatal infections and neonatal mortality, while improving weight gain and mother-infant
      attachment; however, implementation to scale has been slow. The BEMPU® bracelet offers the
      opportunity to monitor the body temperature of newborns for the early detection of
      hypothermia and to increase the uptake of KMC. Further research is needed to evaluate the
      impact of the BEMPU® bracelet on KMC practices and neonatal health outcomes and facilitate
      its adoption in low-resource settings. The goal of this research is to evaluate its effect on
      KMC practices and neonatal health outcomes in Ghana. Evidence of a significant impact on
      outcomes will provide critical evidence to facilitate prompt identification of hypothermia,
      maximize the benefits of KMC, decrease the risk of neonatal death, and impact the leading
      cause of neonatal mortality in Ghana and other settings.

      This study will evaluate the effect of the bracelet on KMC practices and neonatal health
      outcomes in LBW infants using a randomized controlled trial. Infants currently being treated
      in the KMC or neonatal wards of the participating hospitals will be screened for eligibility
      by study nurses. After obtaining parental consent, infants will be randomly assigned with a
      1:1 ratio to KMC with and without the BEMPU® bracelet.

      A standardized questionnaire will be administered to each mother to collect information on
      socio-demographic characteristics and contact information. As is the standard of care, all
      mothers regardless of study arm will be taught how to provide KMC, how to monitor the
      infant's condition and recognize dangerous clinical signs during KMC and will be supported by
      a nurse during initial attempts at practicing KMC.

      Mothers of infants randomly allocated to the intervention arm will be taught to use the
      bracelet. The meaning of the audiovisual alarm will be explained as well as the measures to
      be taken if the device indicates any sign of hypothermia. There will not be any additional
      training beyond that pertaining to the BEMPU® bracelet. The study nurse will then place the
      BEMPU® bracelet on the wrist of the infant. Infants in the intervention arm will wear the
      bracelet for up to 28 days post-discharge.

      After discharge, participants in both the intervention and control arms will receive two
      study visits; one at 7 days post discharge and one at 28 days post-discharge. During each
      visit, infants will receive a physical examination to collect weight, length, head
      circumference and axillary temperature, and additional data will be collected on history of
      illnesses, care-seeking and treatment, KMC and feeding practices, and frequency of use of the
      bracelet (if applicable).

    <description>Kangaroo mother care involves early, continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn, frequent and exclusive breastfeeding and early discharge from hospital. The BEMPU bracelet, also known as the BEMPU Tempwatch, is a silicone band with a thermistor metal cup that emits an audio alarm and flashes an orange light when the body temperature drops below 36.5⁰C, signaling hypothermia and prompting caregiver to provide thermal care.</description>
