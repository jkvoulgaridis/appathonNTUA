      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of regorafenib when given together
      with ipilimumab and nivolumab in treating patients with microsatellite stable colorectal
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and remains despite
      chemotherapy treatment (resistant). Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      regorafenib, ipilimumab and nivolumab may slow the tumor growth and/or shrink the tumor size
      in patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended dose level of the combination of regorafenib, nivolumab and
      ipilimumab in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the objective overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      II. Estimate the duration of response, duration of stable disease (SD), progression free
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

      III. Describe the safety of this regimen as determined by frequency and severity of
      associated adverse events.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the presence of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)+ macrophages,
      regulatory T cells (Tregs), TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) and tumor PD-L1, CTLA-4 and
      PD1 expression (at baseline and post treatment) on tumor biopsies with response rate.

      II. Characterize the systemic immune alteration through evaluation of mandatory pre and post
      cycle 1, and cycle 2, and at progression blood draws.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of regorafenib.

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W), and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes
      every 6 weeks (Q6W). Cycles repeat every 28 day for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 3
      months for up to 5 years.
