    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate why individuals with type 2 diabetes are at
      increased risk for heart disease and stroke. This study will investigate risk factors for
      heart disease and stroke, including platelet (involved in clotting) activity, inflammation,
      blood vessel wall function, and genetic information (blueprints of your cells), in
      participants with type 2 diabetes and elevated cholesterol. Participants will be given
      cholesterol lowering medicines (statin and PCSK9 inhibitor) for 1 month with the same risk
      factors being measured following cholesterol reduction. This study will help understand why
      individuals with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk for heart disease and stroke before and
      even after cholesterol reduction.

      As part of this SFRN investigating REPAIR (non-progression of clinical events or regression
      of atherosclerosis) in T2D, this project will reveal mechanisms behind the platelet mediated
      increased cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D by focusing on the platelet transcriptome
      in those with clinical progression and subsequent cardiovascular events versus those without
      clinical progression. A prospective clinical study will investigate platelet activity and
      transcriptome before and after significant cholesterol reduction to better understand
      mechanisms of increased residual risk observed in patients with T2D, even when cholesterol is
      not elevated. By combining prospective studies on the platelet phenotype in humans with T2D,
      mechanistic mouse models of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis in the Fisher, Basic
      Project, and the human plaque and genomic data available data from the Giannarelli,
      Population Project, the investigators believe the research will fill an important and
      clinically significant gap in the understanding of how diabetes attenuates cardiovascular
      repair and to identify new treatment and prevention strategies.

    <description>The difference in platelet activity will be assessed by measuring changes in monocyte-platelet aggregates. Monocyte platelet aggregates (MPA) are a robust marker of platelet activity and inflammatory monocytes. The difference in platelet activity before and after cholesterol reduction will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The study will also perform a linear mixed model for the multivariate analysis; the primary outcome will be the change in platelet activity (MPA) before and after cholesterol reduction. All tests will be 2-tailed, and a P &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.</description>

    <measure>Change in platelet activity (LTA) before and after cholesterol reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up visit (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in platelet activity will be assessed by using the light transmission aggregometry test (LTA). Light Transmission Aggregometry [LTA] is frequently undertaken as the first test of platelet function, as a screening test for a bleeding disorder and in addition for monitoring of anti-platelet drugs using platelet rich plasma (PRP). The difference in platelet activity before and after cholesterol reduction will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We will also perform a linear mixed model for the multivariate analysis; the primary outcome will be the change in platelet activity (LTA) before and after cholesterol reduction. All tests will be 2-tailed, and a P &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.</description>
