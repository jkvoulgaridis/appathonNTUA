  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In view of patient care, patient characteristics and treatment parameters are
      registered for all patients visiting the Mobility Clinic of the University Medical Center
      Utrecht for orthopaedic knee treatment. Patients also fill out questionnaires for function,
      pain and mobility of the knee, before and after treatment.

      Objective: The main objective of this registry is to collect patient characteristics and
      treatment parameters together with data from the questionnaires in a database. This knee
      registry can be used for future research questions.

      Study design: This is a longitudinal observational registry.

      Study population: All patients that visit the Mobility Clinic will be asked to participate in
      the knee registry. Patients that meet one or more of the following criteria will be excluded:
      are below the age of 16, not able or willing to sign the broad consent form, not being able
      to read and understand Dutch language, or receiving medical treatment for their knee
      elsewhere.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Data will be collected for future research for which the
      purpose is not known at this time. When new research will be conducted, study parameters will
      be set. A study application has to be submitted to the institutional ethical review board of
      the University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients do not need to be asked permission for the
      use of their data for each study individually. Only when additional information is needed.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The burden for patients to participate in this registry is minimal and consists
      of time. Any future results may be beneficial for patients. Participation or refusal to
      participate in the registry has no consequences for their treatment.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a questionnaire about the quality of life on a scale of 0-100 and has 5 dimensions, each dimension has 5 levels. A higher score indicates a higher health utility. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
