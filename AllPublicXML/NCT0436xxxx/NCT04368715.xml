    <textblock>
      This study is based on the records of the patients treated for labial frenectomy with a
      dental laser at the Department of Padiatric Dentistry from January 2017 to December 2017.
      Patients younger than 15 years were included and in total 22 patients who matched the
      inclusion criteria were investigated in the study. The analyzed data included age, gender,
      frenelum insertion type, type of dental laser, and postoperative pain perception.

      This study is based on the records of the patients who received laser‑assisted frenectomy
      treatment due to mucogingival problems at pediatric dentistry department during two year
      period. Twenty-two patients treated with either Er,Cr:YSGG laser 2780 nm or 940 nm diode
      laser were selected who fulfilled the study's inclusion criteria. The analyzed data included
      age, gender, frenelum insertion type, type of dental laser, postoperative pain perception and
      wound healing. Post-operative pain was reported with Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale after
      3 hours 1, 7 and 14 days. Wound surface healing was evaluated through photography. Images
      were uploaded to the software and the changes in the wound area were measured in square
      millimeters at the day of frenectomy and on days 1, 7, and 14 postoperatively.

    <description>Evaluation of changes in pain scores were evaluated with Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale which consists of a set of cartoon faces with varying facial expressions ranging from a smile/laughter to tears. Children were asked to select the facial expression that best represented their pain. Score 1 represents there is no pain, score 5 presents moderate pain and score 10 is the higher score which represents the worst pain.</description>
