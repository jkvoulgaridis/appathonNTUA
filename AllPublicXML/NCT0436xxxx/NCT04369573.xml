  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of early intra-aortic balloon pump
      implantation at admission over local clinical practice (pharmacological only) in acute
      decompensated heart failure patients with cardiogenic shock, with respect to 60-day survival
      or successful bridge to heart replacement therapies (heart transplant or Left Ventricular
      Assist Device implantation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock (CS) is the most severe form of acute heart failure, with in-hospital
      mortality up to 50%. Failure to improve mortality has been reported, despite observed
      improvements in hemodynamics. Previous studies on CS have almost exclusively been focused on
      CS following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Chronic heart failure patients with acute
      decompensation (ADHF) and CS represent a unique physiologic phenotype compared with ACS
      patients, which may lead to a differential response to device therapy. Recent evidences
      emphasize that intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is not recommended for patients with
      ACS-related CS, but it is associated with a high likelihood of bridge to durable Left
      Ventricular Assist Device or heart transplant without the need for escalation to more potent
      temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, when implanted in ADHF patients. Data
      retrieved from the available literature in the setting of patients with CS not related to ACS
      are poor even in large, well-reported registries.

      Accordingly, Altshock-2 trial has been designed to test the superiority of early IABP
      implantation at admission over local clinical practice (pharmacological only) in ADHF
      patients with CS, with respect to 60-day survival or successful bridge to heart replacement
      therapies
