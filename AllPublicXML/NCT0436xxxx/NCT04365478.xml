  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hands and wrist spasticity are a common post stroke complication and often lead to
      restrictions in daily living activities. Spasticity causes changes in muscle composition such
      as accumulation of collagenous connective tissue and progressive loss of skeletal muscle
      fibres and these changes start almost immediately after a vascular event. Radial Shock Wave
      Therapy (rSWT) is a valid alternative rehabilitating tool in managing chronic spasticity but
      no study has so far investigated the effect in a recently onset hemiparesis. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of an early radial shock wave therapy in improving
      spasticity of the upper limb in patients with a recent onset stroke. The secondary outcome is
      to investigate the improvement of upper limb motor functionality, passive range of motion and
      joint pain and to determine if it can lead to a better performance in daily living
      activities. This study is a randomized controlled trial double arm single blind. The
      investigators plan to enrol 40 hemiplegic patients with sub-acute stroke and randomly assign
      them to an experimental or control group. The experimental group (EG) will perform one radial
      shock wave therapy session a week for 8 weeks administered during the daily morning 40
      minutes of conventional rehabilitation treatment. The control group (CG) 40-minutes of
      conventional rehabilitation treatment for 5 days per week in the morning for 8 weeks. All
      patients performed in the afternoon a second daily session of 40 minutes of conventional
      rehabilitation therapy 5 days per week. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) (with motricity, Passive Range of Motion (PROM) and pain
      sub-scores of upper extremity part of the scale), Modified Barthel Index and Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) for patient's benefit perceived, will be evaluated before and a week after the
      last intervention. MAS will be administered once a week, before rSWT treatment. The
      investigators plan to have a 1 month follow up during which every outcome measure will be
      administered. The investigators hypothesize that radial shock waves therapy, started early
      and associated with traditional physiotherapy, may be more effective in promoting the
      reduction of spasticity and pain of the upper limb, improve its functionality and therefore a
      reduction in disability, compared to conventional rehabilitation treatment. A reduction in
      the use of analgesic and muscle relaxants drugs is also conceivable
