        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have evidence of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis
             of metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV, American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] v7.0) that

             Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Ventana Inc).

          -  Disease Status Requirements: disease progression after alectinib or ceritinib as first
             line therapy (the study will limit enrollment of participants with best response of
             progression or indeterminate on prior alectinib to 8 participants). Participants may
             have had prior chemotherapy, but only if before starting treatment with alectinib or
             ceritinib.

          -  Tumor Requirements: All Participants must have at least one measurable target
             extracranial lesion according to RECIST v1.1. Participants with asymptomatic CNS
             metastases (including participants controlled with stable or decreasing steroid use
             within the last 2 weeks prior to study entry) will be eligible. Participants who have
             leptomeningeal disease (LM) or carcinomatous meningitis (CM) will be eligible if the
             LM/CM is visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or if documented baseline
             cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) positive cytology is available.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1.

          -  Acute effects of any prior therapy resolved to baseline severity or to CTCAE Grade â‰¤1
             except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigator' judgment do not constitute a
             safety risk for the participant.

          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy with alectinib or ceritinib discontinued within a minimum
             of 5 half-lives prior to first dose of lorlatinib on the study (unless clinically
             meaningful tumor flare per discretion of the investigator, in which discussion with
             the sponsor is warranted).

          -  Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to use proper
             contraception during the intervention period and for at least 98 days after the last
             dose of study intervention

          -  Female participants are eligible to participate if they are not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and agree to use proper contraception during the intervention period
             and for at least 35 days after the last dose of study intervention.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent and willingness and ability to comply with
             the study scheduled visits and other procedures.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Prior ALK TKI treatment or anti-cancer treatment other than first line alectinib or
             ceritinib.

          -  Spinal cord compression unless the participant has good pain control attained through
             therapy, and there is stabilization or recovery of neurological function for the 4
             weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Gastrointestinal abnormalities, including inability to take oral medication;
             requirement for intravenous alimentation; prior surgical procedures affecting
             absorption including total gastric resection or lap band; active inflammatory
             gastrointestinal disease, chronic diarrhea, symptomatic diverticular disease;
             treatment for active peptic ulcer disease in the past 6 months; malabsorption
             syndromes.

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Known prior or suspected severe hypersensitivity to study interventions or any
             component in their formulations.
