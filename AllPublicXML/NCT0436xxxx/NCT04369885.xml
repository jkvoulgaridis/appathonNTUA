  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site feasibility pilot study to determine if patients with COPD with an
      increased risk of exacerbation will use an in-home COPD telemonitoring system for three
      months that collects lung measures, pulse oximetry, and medication compliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, prospective, open label trial evaluating home telemonitoring for
      patients with COPD and a history of increased exacerbation risk. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether automated home monitoring of medication compliance and biometric
      parameters [forced expiratory capacity in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC),
      peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), inspiratory capacity (IC), pulse oximetry, and symptoms]
      is acceptable to patients, can improve adherence, and may improve clinical outcomes and
      reduce exacerbations and avoidable 30-day readmissions. Slow spirometry will be performed
      Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Forced spirometry will be performed
      Tuesdays and Thursdays.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive the intervention consisting of a home telemedicine tablet platform (GoHome) that will collect multiple spirometry tests each week (including both forced and slow spirometry measurements), pulse oximetry, and quality of life (QoL) Questionnaire responses. The platform will remind patients to take their medications remind patients to perform measurements, send patients helpful information, and execute a University of North Carolina (UNC) clinic established COPD Action Plan.The backend of the platform is a remote server (Monitored Therapeutics Incorporated CarePortal) that collects the data, send out alerts to the Principal Investigator and can track and trend the data for them.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Percentage of participants achieving â‰¥2 point decrease in CAT from baseline to three months. The CAT is a short, self-completed, 8-item questionnaire, each item is rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment). The total CAT score is calculated by summing the scores of all items and ranges from 0 to 40, higher scores indicating severe condition.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with score of 4 or higher on individual survey domains. A satisfaction survey (investigator-developed, 15 questions, each question is graded on a scale of 1-5, 1 being not at all and 5 being extremely) will be used to measure home spirometry and table ease and usefulness.</description>

    <description>The 30-day COPD exacerbation rate, defined as the mean number of events/30 days of follow-up (using three months of follow-up data). COPD exacerbation events are defined as self-reported COPD exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics or steroids.</description>
