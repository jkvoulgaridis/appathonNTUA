  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (Glasgow Coma Scale 13 to 15) represent 70 to 90% of
      traumatic brain injury. Different disorders may occur after a traumatic minor brain injury
      (somatic, cognitive or affective) within 2 weeks.

      For 10 to 20% these symptoms are persistent and are part of post-concussion syndrome. Today a
      small amount of tools to predict this syndrome are available. Cerebral CT scan, a routine
      test for mTBI, isn't relevant to predict the post concussion syndrome.

      In order to improve understanding of the evolution toward this complication, it seems
      relevant to run a multimodal study.

      Multiparameter MRI combined to psychological and sociological evaluations cold provide a
      better global perception.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Describe correlation between risk factor and the development of post-concussion syndrome.
Describe risk factors as demographic factors and medical history correlated with the development of post-concussion syndrome.
The risk factors studies will be:
Age (median in years)
Sex
Cohabitation status
Education
Daily consumption of alcohol
Smoking
Glasgow score
Loss of consciousness after the trauma
Associated injuries This information will be obtained using the medical record and by interviewing the patient. The presence of post-concussion syndrome will be defined using the Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. The presence of post-concussion syndrome will correspond to a score higher than 12.</description>
