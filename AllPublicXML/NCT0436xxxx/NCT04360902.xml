  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled pilot study is to evaluate the performance of this
      novel Anemia Controller (vis-à-vis standard of care) for anemia management in hemodialysis
      patients. Since the Anemia Controller is designed to bring patients to a pre-defined Hgb
      target level and keep them there, the target population for this study are patients whose Hgb
      levels are currently not well-controlled (rather than patients who are already relatively
      stable within the Hgb target range under a standard anemia management algorithm).
      Specifically, therefore, the target population for this clinical study are chronic
      hemodialysis patients who are exhibiting Hgb cycling.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to compare the percentage of time patients will spend within the Hgb target range of 10-11 g/dL when treated with the Anemia Model Predictive Controller (intervention group) vs. when treated with the Standard of Care Algorithm (control group)</description>

    <description>Subjects in the standard of care group will continue to receive anemia management in the same way they normally do as part of their routine dialysis care. For the purposes of this study, this means the use of the clinic's established Mircera® anemia management algorithm. Participation in this study will not affect the anemia management of subjects in the control group.</description>

    <description>For subjects randomized into the intervention group, our erythropoiesis model will be used to identify each subject's individual values for several physiological determinants of erythropoiesis based on his/her sex, body height and history of body weights, Hgb concentrations and Mircera® administrations over the preceding 150 to 180 days.
For subjects in the intervention group, their current method of anemia management will be discontinued. From this point on, Mircera® dose recommendations will be generated by the Anemia Controller software based on our erythropoiesis model and each subject for the duration of their 26-week participation in this study. The Anemia Controller computes the Mircera® doses required to attain the target Hgb level of 10.5 g/dL. Controller-generated Mircera® recommendations will be communicated to the respective clinics' anemia managers on a standardized report.</description>
