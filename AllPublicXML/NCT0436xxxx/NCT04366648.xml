      This study is a multicenter, open labeled, positive controlled, single, -combined, with
      multiple dose escalation trial.

      The trial consists of 6 drug dose groups, which are 50mg/m2, 75mg/m2, 100mg/m2, 125mg/m2,
      150mg/m2 and 180mg/m2 respectively. At each testing dose group, one patient will be treated
      with HCl-Irinotecan (CPT-11), at dose level of 175mg/m2.

      The initial dose of 50mg /m2 will be administered once. Starting from the 75mg/m2 dose group,
      each patient will be given testing drug at least twice. During first and second drug
      administration, blood samples will be collected for PK characteristics analysis. Patients
      will be evaluated after every two rounds of drug delivery and preliminary efficacy of testing
      compound will be determined as PD, SD, CR etc.

    <description>Maximum tolerance dose (MTD) will be determined. MTD is defined as the highest dose that can be given without causing any adverse side effects according to CTCAE v5.0.
The dose climbing scheme was designed according to the improved Fibonacci method, which was carried out in sequence from the low dose group to the high dose group. The principle of &quot;3+3&quot; dose increment was adopted. At least 4 subjects were randomly enrolled in each dose group (including one patient who will be assigned to control drug).</description>

Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (25×109/L≤ platelet count &lt; 50×109/L) with obvious clinical bleeding symptoms, or grade 4 thrombocytopenia (with or without obvious clinical bleeding symptoms); 3. Other grade 4 hematological toxicity； 4. Grade 3 and above non-hematological toxicity； 5. Hair loss, fatigue, except for those with grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea without maximum symptomatic supportive treatment.</description>

    <description>Serum concentration of injectable PEG-Irinotecan , Irinotecan and SN-38 in human subjects.
Blood samples will be taken within 60min before administration, 10min±5min after intravenous infusion, 10min±5min before the end of intravenous infusion, immediately after intravenous infusion 0h±5min, thereafter 15min±5min, 30min±5min, 1h±5min, 2h±10min, 4h±15min, 8h±30min, 12h±30min, 24h±1h, 48h±2h, 72h±2h, 96h±2h, 168h±2h; A total of 16 time points were collected in each patient. The concentrations of PEG-Irinotecan, irinotecan and the active metabolite SN-38 will be determined by LC-MS/MS. And the maximum concentration (Cmax) and the time of peak of concentration (Tmax) will be compared across different groups.</description>
