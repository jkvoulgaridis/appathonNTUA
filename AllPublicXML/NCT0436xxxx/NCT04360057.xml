  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory cross sectional cohort study will evaluate the feasibility and fidelity of
      using an innovative strategy, the Patient Motivational Dialogue (PMD)/PMDPlus that will
      intentionally motivate and encourage the patient toward self-advocacy for their Health Care
      Professional's (HCP's) hand hygeine (HH) adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be implemented with two volunteer innovation champion physicians, one in
      radiation oncology and one in the chemotherapy oncology clinic. If other physicians begin to
      use the PMD/ PMDPlus in their clinics, the initiation will be considered a positive
      indication of feasibility and fidelity.

      New patients will be enrolled in the study starting September 2016 until the sample size
      reaches 30 patients per clinic (n=60). Each patient will be followed in each clinic visit
      longitudinal through March 2017 or until discharged from the clinic treatment depending on
      which comes first. PMD will be administered in the first clinic visit followed by the PMDPlus
      each visit thereafter to ensure an adequate treatment dose. The PMD is estimated to take
      about two minutes of the initial clinic visit and the PMDPlus is estimated to take about one
      minute of the follow-up clinic visit.

      The following steps will be taken based on the innovation decision model:

        1. The PI will instruct the physicians, or designee in the use of the PMD/PMDPlus. Script
           cards with the PMD/PMDPlus will be provided to each physician. The physician will be
           instructed in use of PMD at the initial visit and the PMDPlus every follow-up clinic
           visit thereafter until discharge from the clinic.

        2. A HCP survey will be conducted pre-intervention asking the HCP: &quot;Has a patient or family
           ever ask you to clean your hands? If yes, the HCP will be asked to describe the
           situation.
