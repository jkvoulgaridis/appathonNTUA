    <textblock>
      A clinical study to investigate the effect of an investigational drug in adults with
      schizophrenia by using Electrocardiogram (Picture of the electrical action of the heart).
      This study is accepting male and female participants between 18 years old -65 years old who
      have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. This study will be conducted in approximately 7
      locations in the US. The study will last approximately 7 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-dose, active and placebo controlled, 3-period crossover
      study of the effect of SEP-363856 150 mg on electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals in subjects
      with schizophrenia. SEP-363856 and matching placebo will be utilized in a double-blind
      fashion. Moxifloxacin will be utilized as an active control in an open-label fashion.

      The primary analysis will be based on concentration-QTc modeling of the relationship between
      plasma concentrations of SEP-363856 or its metabolite SEP-363854 and change-from baseline
      QTc.
