  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplant recipients are followed as out patients at the transplant center for about 8
      weeks after surgery. Between 1-2 weeks after surgery, 50 standard immunological patients will
      be randomized (1:1) to either follow standard of care (SOC) or having every second poli
      clinical visit without entering the hospital HBM; Home Based Monitoring). They are to take a
      capillary finger-prick blood sample themselves, send it to the laboratory for analysis and
      then they will get a telecom follow-up that day from their transplant physician. Outcome is
      no difference with regards to being able to follow the randomized follow-up procedure.

      Renal transplant recipients are followed as out patients at the transplant center for about 8
      weeks after surgery. Between 1-2 weeks after surgery, 50 standard immunological patients
      (i.e. first, kidney (only) transplants, no donors specific antibodies (DSA), panel reactive
      antibodies (PRA), ABO blood type compatible transplant) will be randomized (1:1) to either
      follow standard of care (SOC) or having every second poli clinical visit without entering the
      hospital HBM; Home Based Monitoring). They are to take a capillary finger-prick blood sample
      themselves and send it to the laboratory for analysis (creatinine, hemoglobin, tacrolimus and
      mycophenolate) and then they will get a telecom follow-up that day from their transplant
      physician. Outcome is no difference with regards to being able to follow the randomized
      follow-up procedure without having acute rejection episodes and no need for extra ou-patients
      visits for any reason. End of study is week 7-8 after transplantation.
