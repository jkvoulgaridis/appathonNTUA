    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of using Mineralized Plasmatic Matrix and β-tricalcium
      phosphate that placed to extraction socket as a graft material in terms of periodontal damage
      occurred in the distal aspect of the second molar after mandibular impacted third molar
      surgery.

    <description>Mineralized Plasmatic Matrix (MPM) is a product of mixing of two phases: the mineral phase and the plasma phase. After centrifugation, the white blood cells are recovered and mixed with the mineral phase of bone graft that can be autogenic, allogeneic bone, or a bone substitute like Xenogeneic Bone Synthetic. We will use Beta-tricalcium phosphate as a graft material. The result of this mixture is a homogeneous single component, which is compact and stable, containing the graft, the dense fibrin network, and the promoting healing. And then we are planning to place MPM material to extraction socket of impacted third molar tooth to improve periodontal healing at the distal aspect of second molar tooth. Additional after MPM places to extraction socket, Once the MPM has been placed, it will be covered with a Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) membrane and sutured as a primer.</description>
