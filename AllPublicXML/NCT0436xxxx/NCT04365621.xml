    <textblock>
      A prospective study of the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of young people
      aged 12 to 25 consulting on ambulatory structures in the Seine Saint-Denis.

      This research project, intersectoral and inter-institutional, built in a territorial logic,
      is therefore intended to study longitudinally over a year the population of young consultants
      in the different units participating in it, to highlight their common profiles and
      differences.

      This will be the first clinical research work concerning adolescents and young adults using
      mental health services in the Seine Saint Denis Ouest.

      The main objective of the study will be to quantify the rate of subjects seeking help in our
      units meeting the criteria of subject with an ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Observe the transition rate of these high risk patients at one year.

        -  Study the socio-demographic and general psychopathology profiles of 12 - 25 year olds
           using the services of CMP, CASADO, mobile team and RCL.

        -  Monitor the development of school and professional integration, the overall functioning
           and self-esteem of subjects at six months and one year.
