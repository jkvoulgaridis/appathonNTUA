  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unexpected abnormalities with potential clinical relevance (incidental findings) occur in
      2.7% of head MRI studies. There is a wide variation in how incidental findings (IFs)
      discovered in 'healthy volunteers' are managed. Routine reporting of 'healthy volunteers' by
      a radiologist is a challenging logistic and financial burden and in a survey of UK
      institutions performing research imaging, just 14% of institutions had this as policy. It
      would be valuable to devise automated strategies to ensure that IFs could be reliably and
      accurately identified which potentially would remove 90% of scans requiring routine
      radiological review, thereby increasing the feasibility of implementing a routine reporting
      strategy.

      Deep learning is a new technique in computer science that automatically learns hierarchies of
      relevant features directly from the raw inputs (e.g. MRI) using multilayered neural networks.
      Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning methods in the basic
      interpretation of neuroradiological studies including MRI scans.

      A deep learning algorithm will be trained using both retrospective and prospective head MRI
      studies to recognise studies with abnormalities. Retrospective and prospective data will be
      obtained from secondary and tertiary NHS centres across the UK. A deep learning algorithm
      will be trained that classifies a subset of these studies as normal or abnormal. The
      technique will then be tested on an independent subset to determine its validity.

      Retrospective MRI scans will be collected from NHS databases by the direct care team and then
      anonymised before being transferred to the research team for training and testing.
      Prospective MRI scans will be obtained by recruiting patients who are undergoing head MRI
      scans as part of their routine medical care and then anonymised before being transferred to
      the research team.

    <description>The study involves the development and testing of a diagnostic test. We will develop the computer algorithm using a dataset of retrospective and prospective head MRI scans, to train convolutional networks using software developed at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London. The reference standard will be consultant radiologist reports of the MRI studies.</description>
