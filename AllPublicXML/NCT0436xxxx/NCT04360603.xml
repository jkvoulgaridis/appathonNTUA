  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decade, a major improvement in vitreoretinal surgery was the use of small gauge
      surgical systems that improved the safety of vitrectomy and also reduced the surgical time.
      However, there were still some concerns regarding small gauge vitrectomy system, especially
      27-gauge system, in the stability of its instruments and the efficacy of removing vitreous
      during surgery. Although there were some studies that had reported the surgical outcomes of
      27G vitrectomy system, none had focused on patients with high myopia. The highly myopic
      patients usually had thinner sclera, which was a risk factor for wound leakage after
      sutureless vitrectomy, they also had longer axial length which would make the surgical
      procedure more difficult especially in macular surgery.

      Based on previous clinical finding, gas leakage was 36.4% in 25G , while 27G sclerotomy
      showing less leakage comparing to larger gauge sclerotomy, the investigators believe 27G may
      have its clinical advantages in overcoming the thinner sclera of high myopia, and show the
      superiority of leakage control.

      Hypothesis:

      The 27G vitrectomy system has lower sclerotomy wound leakage rate compared with 25G system
