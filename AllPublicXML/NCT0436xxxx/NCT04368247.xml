  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor has developed the Skin Fluorescent Imaging (SFI) system, an in vivo imaging
      modality, for the purpose of providing physicians with insight into the biological changes
      occurring during tissue remodeling in a nevus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SFI system, a non-invasive point-of-care imaging system, is able to detect markers
      associated with tissue remodeling and thus provide real-time information about biological and
      structural changes occurring in nevi indicative of dysplastic transition.

      If the Site specific pathology lab will not allow the sponsor to make a digital image of the
      original slide, then the Sponsor is asking that a duplicate slide be provided for digital
      scanning. Once scanning is complete these additional slides may not be returned to the site.

      <textblock>
        Subjects who present with suspicious nevus/nevi and who require a Standard of Care (SOC)
        biopsy of the atypical nevi will be able to participate in the study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study a subject must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  Provide a signed and dated informed consent form

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Subjects must present with suspicious atypical nevi scheduled for a biopsy*

          -  Nevi with at least 1 cm of skin surrounding the mole

          -  Nevi must be accessible to the SFI imaging device

          -  Excisional or a tangential excision with a dept of 1 to 2 mm biopsy will be performed
             for the mole tested within 21 days of testing.

          -  Nevi with clinically atypical features

        Only 1 mole per eligible subject will be SFI tested in this study. *NOTE: a subset of
        patients (~10%) with benign nevi (by clinical observation) who wish to have nevi removed
        for cosmetic reasons will be enrolled as negative controls.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          -  Subjects who are younger than 18 years old

          -  Lesions that are consistent with

             - Features of Keratosis and keratin plugs

               -  Basal Cell Carcinoma

               -  Squamous Cell Carcinoma

               -  Challenging anatomical location (e.g., body cervices)

          -  Subjects with nevi that fit the inclusion criteria but are:

               -  Less than 1 cm from the eyes

               -  On the palms of the hands or soles of the feet

               -  Associated with scar tissue

               -  Mucosal lesions

               -  Ulcerated lesions / breached skin

               -  Lesions with some clinical certainty of being melanomas (large, dark, etc.)

               -  Any nevi with ink marking including tattoos, on or adjacent to the nevi

               -  Lesions treated with local anesthesia such as lidocaine prior to enrollment

               -  Lesions larger than 20 mm or too large to allow imaging

               -  Subject is known to be pregnant

               -  Subject who is mentally or physically unable to comply with all aspects of the
                  study

               -  Subject who is undergoing systemic cancer treatment within 6 months of SFI
                  testing

               -  Subject with hypersensitivity to any of the SFI reagents

               -  Subjects with known sensitivity to fluorescent dyes

               -  Any subject who has previously participated (testing to biopsy) in SFI 003
