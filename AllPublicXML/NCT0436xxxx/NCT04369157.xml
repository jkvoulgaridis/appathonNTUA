  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A decline in cognitive abilities following surgery (POCD: Post-Operative Cognitive
      Dysfunction) affects up to 47% of patients undergoing a surgical procedure. Risk factors
      include age, previous depression, alcohol and drug use, smoking, cognitive impairment as well
      as pre-operative biochemical and haematological abnormalities. Inflammation has been proposed
      as a potential cause, however, there is little empirical and clinical evidence in this area
      to determine aetiology or reduce risk of incidence.

      Zinc is an important metal for brain function, with deficiency associated with poorer
      cognitive outcomes. In relation to POCD, biomarker studies have revealed that levels of a
      zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1) were lower in patients with POCD. AZGP1 is a
      multifunctional glycoprotein implicated in cell adhesion, immune response, transmembrane
      transport and cellular proliferation. Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are highly
      sensitive to changes in zinc which have been proposed to contribute to neurodegenerative
      disease as well as POCD. However, whilst animal studies looking at the effects of zinc on
      cognition have been promising, robust human trials are lacking.

      This research aims to establish the role of zinc in POCD by determining associations between
      zinc status, inflammation, cognitive function, and biomarkers of POCD risk and incidence.
      This will be achieved by gathering clinical and cognitive data from a sample of older adults
      undergoing surgery. Blood samples will be taken pre and post-operatively to establish zinc
      status and plasma concentrations of biomarkers of POCD risk and incidence. Pre and
      post-operative cognitive assessments will also be conducted to measure memory and executive
      function. Incidence of POCD will be determined via neurological assessment according to
      diagnostic criteria.

      Should associations between zinc status, POCD biomarkers, inflammation, cognitive performance
      and POCD incidence be established, not only would it lead to future work to investigate
      potential mechanisms of action as well as intervention studies looking to support zinc
      status, optimising early identification of individuals who may be at higher risk of
      developing POCD should lead to better patient outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Healthy older adults under-going elective surgery (knee replacement, hip replacement or
      colorectal surgery) will be recruited via the Royal Berkshire Hospital. Participants will be
      aged 60 years and above, will have the capacity to give fully informed consent and will be
      undergoing elective orthopaedic or colorectal surgery.

      Participation will involve testing on 3 occasions: 48hours-3 weeks prior to surgery (in the
      participant's home), 1-3 days post-surgery (in the Royal Berkshire Hospital) and
      approximately one month post-surgery (in the participant's home).

      On each occasion, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Confusion Assessment Method
      (CAM) will be administered along with various cognitive tests measuring executive function
      (Trials A &amp; B, Stroop, Letter memory task, verbal fluency) and memory (the episodic memory
      tests of free recall and recognition from the CERAD: Consortium to Establish a Registry for
      Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological test battery), as well as completion of questionnaires
      to determine mood (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] and the Positive and
      Negative Affect Scale [PANAS]) and sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). The
      cognitive testing should take approximately 30-40 minutes.

      At the first session (pre-operation) only, dietary information will also be collected via a
      food frequency questionnaire, as well as measures of fluid and crystallised intelligence (the
      National Adult Reading Test and Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -
      Revised respectively).

      In addition, at each visit, a blood sample (maximum volume of 9mL, less than one tablespoon)
      will be taken from the participants for analysis of zinc concentration and markers of POCD
      and inflammation.
