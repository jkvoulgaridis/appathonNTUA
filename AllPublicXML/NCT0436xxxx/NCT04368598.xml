    <description>For all patients in this arm, DXM was administered intravenously at 40 mg daily for 4 consecutive days and then stopped. If platelet count remained below 30×10^9/L or there were bleeding symptoms by day 10 to 14, an additional 4-day course of DXM (40 mg daily) was given. Besides, all patients received Acetylcysteine orally at 0.4g three times a day for 4 consecutive weeks in the first month.</description>
