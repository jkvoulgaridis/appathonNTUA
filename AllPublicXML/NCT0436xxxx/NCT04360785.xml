  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary report have demonstrated that methotrexate induces an anti bio-medicament
      tolerization whan administrated just before the first administration of the bio-medicament.
      Once this tolerization is obtained it seems useless to continue the methotrexate because this
      treatment has no efficacity in cases of spondyloarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      spondyloarthritis are treated in first intention by NSAIDs but in case of inefficacity
      biotherapies that inhib the TNF are used. Adalimumab is the most used anti TNF in this
      indication. Monoclonal antibody uses in therapy is immunogene, and there is a clear link
      between increase of anti drug antibody and in one hand decrease of drug serum concentration
      and in an other failure of the therapeutic response. With adalimumab there is an apparition
      of ADAb in 30%. There are reports suggesting that adding methotrexate to the therapy in a
      specific timeline allow to prevent the immunization. A previous study shows that association
      in long terms between methotrexate and adalimumab induce less immunized patients. The
      investigator's goal is to assess if two methotrexate subcutaneous injections at day 1 and 2
      could prevent anti adalimumab antibodies formation.
