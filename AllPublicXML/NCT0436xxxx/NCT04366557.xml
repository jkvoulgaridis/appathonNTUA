      This randomized, controlled study was aimed to asses influence of a six week global posture
      correction therapy on pelvic floor muscles function and urinary incontinence problem.
      Participants were randomly divided into two groups. All subjects overcame assessment of
      pelvic floor muscles (sEMG, manometry and digital) and completed questionnaire about urinary
      incontinence problem and general health condition connected with lower tract symptoms. Both
      groups had a pelvic floor education (what is it, where are the pelvic floor muscle, how to
      correct contract them etc.) Additionally, the study group had a six week therapy focused on
      body posture correction. Therapy consisted of manual therapy (once per week) and correction
      exercises.
