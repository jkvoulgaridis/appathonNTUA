  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise, such as brisk walking, has been shown to lower levels of indicators of
      inflammation in the blood in people with long term conditions. This includes people with
      heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes. Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is an
      inflammatory condition with prescribed medication focusing on reducing inflammation. However,
      the effect of exercise on indicators of inflammation in axSpA is unknown.

      The research study intends to investigate whether a 12-week period of regular exercise can
      have favourable effects on inflammatory markers in the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 200,000 people in the UK have axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). In 80% of cases the
      condition begins between 20-30 years of age. Exercise is encouraged as an essential treatment
      of axSpA, with the potential to promote well-being, flexibility, posture and pain management.
      Axial spondyloarthritis is an inflammatory arthritis and raised levels of indicators can be
      detected in the blood (e.g C-reactive protein). These markers are released as a consequence
      of the condition, but some, such as TNF-alpha, also promote further disease development.

      In other patient groups with inflammatory diseases it has been demonstrated that regular
      exercise (brisk walking) can lower the levels of pro-inflammatory blood markers and increase
      levels of anti-inflammatory markers, independent of weight loss. Despite axSpA being an
      inflammatory condition with prescribed medication focused on reducing inflammation, there are
      no studies which have assessed the potential of exercise as an anti-inflammatory treatment in
      axSpA.

      This research study will investigate the effect of 12 weeks of a home-based walking exercise
      intervention on measures of systemic inflammation and body composition. Measures of
      well-being and disease activity will also be investigated using established and validated
      methods. There will be an exercise and control group, both containing 10 participants. In the
      control group, patients will carry on with their normal activity. This proof-of-concept study
      will determine the potential of exercise as an additional anti-inflammatory treatment for
      patients with axSpA.

    <description>Using the validated Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). The BASDAI consists of a 0-10 score (0 being no problem and 10 being the worst problem) which is used to answer 6 questions on fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, tenderness, morning stiffness duration, and morning stiffness severity. To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean (average) of the two scores relating to stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final 0 - 10 BASDAI score. The higher the score, the higher the activity of disease.</description>

    <description>Using the validated Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). The index assesses the functional limitation in patients with anykylosing spondylitis by asking the patient about symptom burden. The index consists of 10 questions evaluating how hard the patient finds situations i.e 'how difficult is it to put on your socks?' A score of 0 represents easy, and a score of 10 represents impossible. The mean (average) of the 10 questions is used to assign a symptom burden score of 0-10. The higher the score, the higher the symptom burden caused by ankylosing spondylitis.</description>

    <description>Using the validated visual analogue scale for spinal pain. The scale consists of a straight line with the end points defining extreme limits 'no spinal pain' and 'spinal pain as bad as it could be'. The line is 10cm in length (0cm point representing no pain, 10cm point representing pain as bad as it could be). A score of 0-10 is given depending on where the patient marks the line (5cm representing a score of 5). The higher the score, the worse the spinal pain.</description>

    <description>Using the validated Assessment of SpondyloArthritis Health Index (ASAS-HI). The health index assesses health in patients with spondyloarthritis. The questionnaire asks 17 questions to assess health, with a dichotomous response option: 'I agree' and 'I do not agree'. A score of 1 is given for each 'I agree' response, and a score of 0 is given for each 'I do not agree' response. The lower the total score, the better the overall health status.</description>

Those who score 'high' engage in: 1) vigorous activity on at least 3 days achieving a total PA of at least 1500 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes a week - OR - 2) 7 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum total PA of at least 3000 MET minutes per week.
Those who score 'moderate' engage in: 1) 3 or more days of vigorous intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day - OR - 2) 5 or more days of moderate intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day - OR - 3) 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate intensity, or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum total PA of at least 600 MET minutes per week.

    <description>The participant will walk for 30 minutes on a motorised treadmill at a 1% gradient and at a speed that will elicit a perceived exertion of somewhat hard. The validated rating of perceiving exertion (RPE) scale will be used to quantify RPE. For the 30 minute duration, a combination of heart rate and rating of perceived exertion will be used to quantify exercise tolerance. A rating of perceived exertion of 6 represents no exertion, and a score of 20 represents maximal exertion. The score will be used to assess changes in exercise tolerance during (week 12) and after (week 20) the 12-week home based exercise intervention.</description>

    <description>Patients allocated to the exercise arm will be prescribed a home-based walking exercise programme consisting of 30 minutes of walking on 5 days per week at an RPE in the range of 12-14 (somewhat hard). Each patient's heart rate range will be established during the baseline exercise test by recording the heart rate response at the required RPE target range. This will be provided to each patient to use in conjunction with the activity monitor they will be given to wear on their non-dominant wrist. The monitor reports heart rate and records daily steps, distance and activity duration.</description>
