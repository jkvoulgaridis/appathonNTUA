  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab, apatinib,
      pegaspargase (CAPA) and as an intruction immunotherapy with radiotherapy as first-line
      treatment in patients with de novo stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma,
      nasal type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. Radiotherapy alone for
      stage IE/IIE diseases has good response rate but with high relapse rates, ranging from
      20-50%. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved the long-term survival for
      patients with stage IE/IIE diseases. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been
      established. This study is designed with four cycles CAPA induction immunotherapy, followed
      by 50-56Gy radiotherapy as an approach for stage IE/IIE ENKTCL. The efficacy and safety of
      this treatment will be measured.

             histopathology, immunohistochemistry and EBER.

          -  The primary site is in the nasal cavity or upper gastrointestinal tract. The de novo
             diagnosed patient has at least one objective and evaluable lesion.
