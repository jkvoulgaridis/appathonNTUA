  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairment (dysphagia) is extremely common in older adults living with dementia
      due to age-related changes in swallowing and other disease-specific impairments. Dysphagia is
      commonly managed by modifying diet textures rather than engaging in rehabilitative swallowing
      therapy. This means that countless people with dementia are left to eat pureed foods and
      drink thickened liquids, which are unpalatable and lead to malnutrition. As the disease
      progresses, many are transferred to nursing homes. In Canada, speech-language pathologists,
      who manage dysphagia, are consultants within nursing homes; therefore, swallowing therapy is
      non-existent. However, exercise therapy is more commonly available. Rodent models have
      demonstrated that physical exercise strengthens tongue and vocal-fold musculature, which are
      critical components of swallowing. Therefore, it is possible that whole-body physical
      exercise, which increases rate of respiration, will help to strengthen swallowing-related
      musculature in older adults with dementia. In this study, older adults (65+) with early-stage
      dementia will complete a 12-week physical exercise program to determine improvement of
      swallowing function.
