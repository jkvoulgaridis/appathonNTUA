  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of a low vs. high dose of acupuncture
      treatment in individuals with chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTH). A total of 36 people
      with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) suffering from CPTH will be enrolled in this study to
      receive acupuncture treatment for 5 weeks. Participants will be randomized into two groups:
      1) Low Acupuncture group (5 treatments) and 2) High Acupuncture group (10 treatments). It is
      hypothesized that both treatment groups will have decreased headaches, but that 10 treatments
      will greater alleviate headaches when compared to 5 treatments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of headache days</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of self-reported headache days over a 4 week period. Range: 0-28 days. More headache total days indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) over the course of the study. A higher number of AE/SAEs indicates a less safe treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance with overall protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of treatment sessions. Percent of target treatments. Range: 0-100. A higher percentage indicates more compliance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance with treatment protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of treatment duration. Proportion of participants completed the full 30 minutes treatment session. Range: 0-1. A higher proportion indicates more compliance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI contains questions about participant's sleeping habits. Range: 0-21. Sum of 7 subscores. Higher score indicates worse sleep quality</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Traumatic Brain Injury-Quality of Life Headache Pain (TBI-QOL-Headache)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TBI-QOL-Headache contains questions about participant's headache pain. Range: 10-50. Raw score converted to T-score. Higher score indicates more headache pain.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Headache Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The headache duration, measured in minutes for each headache day. Days will be totaled for the 4 week period measured. Higher number of headache minutes indicates worse headache control.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Headache Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The headache pain intensity is self reported for each headache day. Pain intensity will be averaged for the 4 week period measured. Higher paint intensity score indicates more intense headaches.</description>

    <description>Acupuncture treatments will be separated by a minimum of two days and a maximum of 14 days. Treatment sessions will be identical for both groups. Standard, sterile stainless-steel, disposable needles will be inserted at acupuncture points with a total of 18 needles for each treatment session. The depth of the needle will be approximately 10-20 millimeters. Needles will be left in place for 30 minutes.</description>
