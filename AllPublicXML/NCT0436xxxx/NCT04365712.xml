    <textblock>
      The main goal of the surgical correction of the hallux valgus is the morphological correction
      associated with the functional rebalancing of the first ray. The aim of this study was to
      show the efficacy of piezosurgery in performing distal linear osteotomy of the first
      metatarsal bone in hallux valgus correction, in terms of clinical and radiological outcomes
      at 1-year final follow up.

      This study was performed collecting pre-operative and post-operative data for all patients.

      At the time of admission, the patients received and signed an Informed Consent to adhere to
      the Study Protocol. On this occasion, the patients were also given a summary scheme of the
      clinical and radiographic checks to which they would have undergone in case of adherence to
      the Study Protocol.

      40 patients were included in the trial and were randomly allocated (1:1) in a Piezoelectric
      Group (PG) and in a Control Group (CG) (that provided for the use of a traditional
      oscillating saw) utilizing sealed envelopes. The envelopes were prepared and shuffled by the
      same senior surgeon involved in the surgical procedures and drawn by a researcher not
      involved in the surgical procedures or the clinical and radiographic assessment.

      The patients were not aware of the instrument used during surgery. In both groups, patients
      were treated with the same surgical technique, a distal linear osteotomy of the first
      metatarsal bone (S.E.R.I. technique). Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed
      during the multiple follow-ups.

      The final follow-up was at 1 year.

    <intervention_model_description>40 patients affected by hallux valgus were recruited, based on the listed inclusion and exclusion criteria; 20 underwent 1st metatarsal osteotomy treated with a piezoelectric tool (experimental group) and 20 underwent 1st metatarsal osteotomy with a traditional oscillating saw (control group). The patients were randomly allocated (1:1) in a Piezoelectric Group (PG) and in a Control Group (CG) utilizing sealed envelopes. The envelopes were prepared and shuffled by the same senior surgeon involved in the surgical procedures and drawn by a researcher not involved in the surgical procedures or the clinical and radiographic assessment.
3 patients in PG (1 did not comply with the post-operative management and 2 missed the scheduled follow-up appointments) and 3 patients in CG (all patients discontinued from the evaluations) were lost to follow-up.
Thus, 17 patients in each group were evaluated in the 1-year analysis, all treated according to their original assignment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The patient did not know with which instrument the osteotomy had been performed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>23/5000 Radiographic healing. Patients underwent several radiographic checks, pre-operatively and follow-ups, in order to analyze the healing changes in the osteotomy of 1 metatarsus</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 21-35-50-70-90-180-360 days of follow up from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The patients underwent radiographic control (foot in two projections under load) preoperatively and at 21-35-50-70-90-180-360 days of follow up from the surgery. The radiographs obtained were evaluated by an independent radiologist, always the same for the duration of the study, who was not aware of the type of instrument used during the surgery. His task was to evaluate at what time of follow-up the radiographic consolidation of the osteotomy was achieved.</description>

    <description>Patients completed a clinical evaluation questionnaire (AOFAs metatarsophalangeal (MTP)-interphalangeal (IP)- American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle score). It is a clinical test commonly used in the scientific literature, which serves to evaluate, in terms of value from 0 to 100, the autonomy, pain, stability, and alignment of the hallux of the patient.
The questionnaire was collected preoperatively and at 90-180-360 days of follow-up from surgery. No follow-up questionnaires were submitted before 90 days to avoid the influence of post-operative pain.</description>

    <description>Patients completed a clinical evaluation questionnaire (VAS - Visual Analogue Scale). It is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude, for example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none (0) to an extreme amount of pain (10).
The VAS was collected preoperatively and at 90-180-360 days of follow-up from surgery. No follow-up questionnaires were submitted before 90 days to avoid the influence of post-operative pain.</description>
