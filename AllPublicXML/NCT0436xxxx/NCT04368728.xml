  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, and
      vaccine candidate-selection study in healthy adults.

      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 3 different
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19:

        -  As a 2-dose or single-dose schedule

        -  At up to 3 different dose levels

        -  In 3 age groups (18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age, and 18 to 85 years of age

      The study consists of 3 stages. Stage 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s), dose
      level(s), number of doses, and schedule of administration (with the first 15 participants at
      each dose level of each vaccine candidate comprising a sentinel cohort); Stage 2: an
      expanded-cohort stage; and Stage 3; an efficacy stage.
