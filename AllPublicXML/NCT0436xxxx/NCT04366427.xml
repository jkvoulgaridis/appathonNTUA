  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Hyperbaric Oxigen (HBO) is a widely used treatment for several conditions. There
      are 14 indications for HBO, officially recognized by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical
      Society (UHMS), but research is discovering other interesting applications.

      HBO plays an important role in enhancing antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing radical
      oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide species (NOS). This controlled oxidative stress has
      been shown to stop the vicious circle of inflammation - damage - hypoxia already seen in
      several diseases. Increased neoangiogenesis has been demonstrated at pressures of 2
      atmospheres absolute (ATA), while effects helping ischemic tissues need pressures between 2.5
      and 2.8 ATA to develop.

      During sports activities, metabolism generates waste products - mostly CO2, lactic acid, but
      also ROS. HBO could be useful in modulating antioxidant mechanisms and helping cells in the
      recovery after training and sportive competitions.

      The authors hypothesize that:

        1. HBO can reduce oxidative stress in healthy professional athletes

        2. HBO can ameliorate the lactic acid clearance after a maximal exercise

        3. HBO at low pressures (L-HBO at 1.45 ATA) is at least comparable to conventional HBO (at
           2.5 ATA) in reducing oxidative stress and ameliorating lactic acid clearance after a
           maximal exercise.

      The Authors will include healthy athletes. These will be randomly assigned to a control
      group, a L-HBO group, or a HBO group. The Authors will assess oxidative stress changes and
      lactic acid clearance (testing it after a maximal exercise) before and after 20 L-HBO/HBO
      treatments, and after 2 months after the end of treatments.

      Subjects will be recruited through public announcements in local gyms and gathered to explain
      the protocol. Those willing to participate will sign a written informed consent and
      recruited. To be included, all the subjects will undergo a general medical screening to allow
      hyperbaric treatments. This will include weight, height, non-invasive arterial blood
      pressure, and heart rate measurements.

      After inclusion, subjects will be randomly assigned to three arms using an electronic number
      generator by personnel not directly involved in the experiment:

        -  Arm 1(control): no intervention.

        -  Arm 2 (L-HBO): treated with oxygen at 1.45 ATA for 60 min (inclusive of compression and
           decompression times, and an air break of 3 minutes breathing air);

        -  Arm 3 (HBO): treated with oxygen at 2.5 ATA for 60 min (inclusive of compression and
           decompression times, and an air break of 3 minutes breathing air).

      Subjects included in Arm 2 and 3 will undergo a total of 20 treatments. They will follow a
      personalized diet proportional to their energetic expenditure.

      The Authors will identify 5 time-points in the protocol:

      TIME 0 (T0): immediately after inclusion, before any treatment or experiment; TIME 1 (T1):
      standardized physical exercise 1, before HBO treatments; TIME 2 (T2): after HBO treatments ;
      TIME 3 (T3): standardized physical exercise 2, after the end of HBO treatments; TIME 4 (T4):
      2 months after the end of HBO treatments.

      The following exams will be performed on the included subjects:

        -  at T1 and T3, subjects will undergo a standardized physical stress test on a treadmill.
           Subjects will start with a fast walking at 4 km/h for 5 minutes, then will start running
           at 8 km/h for 3 minutes, and then speed will increase 2 km/h every 3 minutes until VO2
           max or exhaustion is reached. Lactate production will be measured on capillary blood
           through finger stick at basal levels (before exercise), at the maximal threshold (VO2
           max or exhaustion), then 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after stopping the exercise while
           walking at 4 km/h (dynamic cool down).

        -  a standardized panel including Complete Blood Count (CBC), creatinine, Blood Urea
           Nitrogen (BUN), C reactive protein, and VES will be performed at T0, T2, and T4.

        -  oxidative stress markers will be analyzed on blood and urine samples, taken at several
           steps during the experimental period. On blood samples (T0; T1; T3), the Authors will
           measure IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alfa, reactive oxygen species and total antioxidant
           capacity (by paramagnetic resonance), nitrite and nitrate (NO2/NO3) plasma concentration
           (by colorimetry based on the Griess reaction), inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (by ELISA
           commercially available kit), total (tot) and reduced (red) aminothiols (by fluorescence
           spectroscopy). On urine samples (T0; T2; T4), the Authors will assess lipid peroxidation
           by measuring 8-isoprostane concentration (by competitive immunoassay).

      Blood samples (approximately 6 ml) will be drawn from the veins of the forearms
      (preferentially on the non-dominant limb); plasma and erythrocytes will be separated by
      centrifuge at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°C. Urine samples will be collected by voluntary voiding
      in sterile containers. All samples will be stored in multiple aliquots at − 80 °C until
      assayed and thawed only once before analysis.

      With this setting, blinding of patients and investigators will be impossible due to different
      structural characteristics. However, outcome assessors will be blinded to patients'
      allocation.
