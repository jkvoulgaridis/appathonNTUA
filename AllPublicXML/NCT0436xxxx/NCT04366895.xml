      A randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed. The participants were randomly allocated into
      either of the two groups intervention or control group each of seven participants.
      Participants in control group (Group-A) received conventional manufactured implant
      overdenture while participants in intervention group (Group-B) received CAD-CAM manufactured
      implant overdenture.

      Introduction: Mandibular single implant overdenture is a well-established treatment modality
      that address limited financial resources of patients and simultaneously enabled the
      management of conventional complete denture problems. CAD/CAM technology helped to mitigate
      the problems encountered with conventional fabrication techniques, which results in improved
      dentures fit and retention. Therefore, the aim of the current trial study was to evaluate
      whether overdentures fabricated using CAD/CAM printed technology exhibited improved patient
      satisfaction, denture retention, implant survival rate and decreased post-insertion
      maintenance or not compared to overdentures manufactured using conventional techniques.

      Methods: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed. The participants were randomly
      allocated into either of the two groups intervention or control group each of seven
      participants. Participants in control group (Group-A) received conventional manufactured
      implant overdenture while participants in intervention group (Group-B) received CAD-CAM
      manufactured implant overdenture.

    <description>patient satisfactionOral Health Impact Profile 14 (was used to assess the OHRQoL (oral health related quality of life). The profile consisted of 14 questions each with score 0 to 4 (impaired) on Likert scale; therefore for each patient the minimum score was 0 and maximum score was 56.
OES: Orofacial esthetic scale was evaluated through 8 questions, each was assessed with a score that ranged from 0 to 10 (most satisfied) on Likert scale; therefore for each patient the minimum score was 0 and maximum score was 80CFQ: Chewing function questionnaire consisted of 10 questions each with score 0 to 4 (impaired) on Likert scale; therefore for each patient minimum score was 0 and the maximum was 40</description>

    <description>retention of overdentures. The retention of newly constructed dentures was measured at baseline (day of delivery), three months thereafter, and after six months by a digital force gauge device (Extech's Model 475055 Digital Force Gauge FLIR Commercial Systems, Inc.) that measures tension or compression force (pull/push) to values of up to 980 Newton. (19,20). The snap hook of the device engaged a screw fixed to the geometric center of denture bases. Then pulling action was applied till the denture separation recording the amount of retention in Newton.</description>
