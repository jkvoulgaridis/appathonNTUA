  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised prospective control trial comparing the efficiency of a more individualized
      approach in ACL reconstruction with the help of neuromuscular computer models with
      traditional ACL reconstruction practices.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now the ACL reconstruction was based on the surgeon's experience. An individualised ACL
      reconstruction is customized based on each patient's special characteristics. Preoperative
      and intraoperative evaluation of the native ACL (both anteromedial and posterolateral
      bundles), knee anatomy and function, level of activity and generalised ligamentous laxity are
      assessed. Femoral and tibial tunnels should be placed in their anatomical location accounting
      for both the native ACL insertion site and bony landmarks. Two groups will be created, one
      with patients undergoing ACL reconstruction based on a surgeon's experience and one based on
      a more individualised approach according to the particular characteristics of each patient
      separately. In addition, patients in the second group will undergo ACL reconstruction with
      the use of Computer Assisted System (Navigation).

      Preoperatively and postoperatively, the patients will be assessed with the KT2000 system, the
      KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome), the Tegner- Lysholm Knee scoring system and
      the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee). Additionally, all patient will be
      examined for their knee function with the use of a 3D gait analysis system.

      The follow-up examination will take place 6 and 12 months after the surgery.

    <description>Participants in two groups will be assessed with KT2000 arthrometer before and after ACL reconstruction regarding knee stability. Additionally knee kinematics and gait analysis before and after the ACL reconstruction will be compared between the two groups in a gait analysis lab.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Originally published in 1998 in The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) assesses patient pain (9 items), other symptoms (7 items), function in daily living (17 items), function in sport and recreation (5 items), and knee related quality of life (4 items). Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating the worst possible knee symptoms and 100 indicating no knee symptoms. The KOOS is a patient reported joint-specific score, which may be useful for assessing changes in knee pathology over time, with or without treatment.</description>

    <measure>Compare the change from Baseline between the patients of the two groups in IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form) from the baseline until 1 year post operation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year post operation</time_frame>
    <description>the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) was designed to assess patients with a variety of knee disorders including ligamentous and meniscal injuries as well as patellofemoral pain and osteoarthritis. The IKDC is a patient-completed tool, which contains sections on knee symptoms (7 items), function (2 items), and sports activities (2 items). Scores range from 0 points (lowest level of function or highest level of symptoms) to 100 points (highest level of function and lowest level of symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Compare the change from Baseline between the patients of the two groups in Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale from the baseline until 1 year post operation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale was designed to be used for evaluating outcomes of knee ligament surgery, particularly for symptoms related to instability. The Lyshom Knee Scoring Scale is a patient-reported instrument that consists of subscales for pain, instability, locking, swelling, limp, stair climbing, squatting, and the need for support. Scores range from 0 (worse disability) to 100 (less disability).</description>
