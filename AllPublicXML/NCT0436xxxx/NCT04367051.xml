  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate whether withdrawal of
      spironolactone is safe and associated with re-deterioration of left ventricular function in
      patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction. The aim of current trial is to
      test the hypothesis that withdrawal of spironolactone would not be associated with relapse of
      significant clinical deterioration of left ventricular systolic function.
