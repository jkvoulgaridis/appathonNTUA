  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality used in routine clinical
      practice for clinical diagnosis by visualizing the anatomical structure and in vivo function
      of certain organs. The development of ultra-high field MRI systems with 7.0-T or higher,
      gives access to a new field of exploration of the human body by improving the speed of
      acquisition but also a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and better resolution. In order to
      fully exploit the potential of these ultra-high field MRI scanners, various technical issues
      must be adressed. Indeed, the non-uniformity of the transmission field is one of them leading
      to non-uniform images with spatially varying contrast. Thus the pTX (parallel transmission)
      mode using multiple transmission channels allows spatial and temporal control over the RF
      waves.

    <description>The main evaluation criterion is the value of the signal-to-noise ratio in a global way but also by a unit comparison approach (voxel to voxel).
It will be a question of linking these variations to the flip angles but also to the probable inhomogeneities of the B1+ field.</description>
