      This study will be conducted in three phases Phase one is to collect qualitative data from
      Veterans who have recently been released from prison. The data will focus on their transition
      experience, stigma (both self and from others), and behaviors that interfered with success.
      Phase 2a will be to develop a transition program based around the needs identified in phase 1
      Phase 2b will be to develop assessment tools to be used with the program Phase 3 will be to
      perform a two group randomized cross over design pilot study to assess the program
