  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study, which subjects were obese patients requiring bariatric
      surgery.

      The bariatric procedures include laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and one anastomosis gastric bypass-mini gastric bypass
      (OAGB-MGB).

      The main observation is the cure rate of NAFLD:percentage of liver fat content &lt;5% of
      abdominal magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) at 1 year after surgery.

      In addition, secondary observations include the excess weight loss (%EWL), total weight
      loss(%TWL), change of HbA1c, level of insulin resistance, blood lipid level alanine
      aminotransferase(ALT), liver fat fraction in MRI, alpha-fetoprotein and liver pathology.

      Aim to prove that bariatric surgery can effectively cure obese NAFLD.

The scoring system comprised 14 histological features, 4 of which were evaluated semi-quantitatively: steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-2), hepatocellular ballooning (0-2), and fibrosis (0-4). Another nine features were recorded as present or absent.
NAS of &gt; or =5 correlated with a diagnosis of NASH, and biopsies with scores of less than 3 were diagnosed as &quot;not NASH.&quot;

    <description>The operation was started by replacing the 12-mm bladed trocar, and two additional trocars were inserted. LigaSure was used to dissect the omental pieces of the great curvature and any adhesions of the pancreas and stomach. A 36-French orogastric tube was then placed in the stomach. Gastric transection was started at a distance of approximately 4cm from the pylorus using a stapler (EndoGIA™; Covidien). All stapling was performed with yellow/green/black/blue cartridges. The staple line was reinforced with continuous barbed prolene sutures, and any sites of bleeding were closed with the LigaSure device. The portion of the stomach that had been transected from the pylorus was extracted through the 12-mm trocar site.</description>

    <description>LRYGB is performed as described as standard. In brief, smaller stomach pouch of 10 to 20 ml or larger stomach pouch of 25 to 35 ml were created according to the metabolic status of the patients. The jejunum at approximately 150 cm distal site was dragged up and connected (anastomosed) to the remnant stomach.</description>

    <description>Four ports are placed generally. The&quot;paddle&quot;retractor is used to retract the liver. The GIA stapler divides the stomach at the junction of the body and antrum, at a location where the jejunal loop can be brought up comfortably. With 4-6 lines of staples that seal the gastric pouch. The division of the stomach is parallel to the lesser curvature and up to the angle of His. A point is selected on the small bowel about 150 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The jejunal loop is brought up antecolic, and the Endo-GIA stapler is used to anastomose the stomach and the small bowel at this point. The distal end of the gastric tube is anastomosed to the side of the small bowel. The inside of the anastomosis is inspected for bleeding before final closure. The stapler then closes the anatomosis.</description>

             liver, etc.;

          -  previous major gastrointestinal surgery；
