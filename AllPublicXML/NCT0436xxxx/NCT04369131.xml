  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common therapeutic intervention after spinal cord injury (SCI) is prolonged standing in a
      standing frame. For people with SCI, standing for 40 minutes or more, three to four times
      weekly improves several health-related issues including well-being, circulation, skin
      integrity, reflex activity, bowel and bladder function, digestion, sleep, pain, and fatigue.
      However, a person who experiences orthostatic hypotension (OH)—defined as a decrease of 20mm
      hg in systolic blood pressure or a decrease of 10mm hg in diastolic pressure within 3 minutes
      of standing from a sitting or supine position—secondary to SCI may not tolerate positioning
      in a standing frame, thus resulting in a loss of access to these health benefits.

      OH is common for people with SCI. It results from central nervous system dysregulation
      causing pooling of blood in the lower extremities that can lead to dizziness,
      light-headedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, headache, and/or
      syncope. Although an array of physical and pharmacologic interventions are available to
      people in the general population for managing OH, few such interventions have been evaluated
      for use by people with SCI, especially when the level of injury is C5 or above.

      One possible intervention that may be effective for people with OH secondary to SCI is
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) because its application results in a dose-dependent
      increase in blood pressure. An unanswered question is whether the placement of FES electrodes
      on various parts of the body has differential effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study
      is to evaluate blood pressure responses among people with OH secondary to cervical SCI when
      receiving FES intervention involving the placement of electrodes in three different positions
      as well as when receiving no FES intervention during tilt table sessions. The selected
      positions for electrode placement are: (a) the calves, (b) the quads and abdominals, and (c)
      the quads, abdominals, and calves. The researchers hypothesize that FES intervention,
      regardless of placement, will result in better control of OH than no FES intervention and
      that no significant blood pressure difference will occur across the three FES placements.

    <textblock>
      Participants will engage in three initial heads-up tilt table sessions with no FES
      intervention to confirm the presence and consistency of OH. During these sessions, the
      participant will lie supine on a tilt table at 0°, and, using a blood pressure cuff secured
      around the arm, the researchers will measure and record supine blood pressure. The
      researchers will then adjust the tilt table to 30° for three minutes and take and record
      another blood pressure measurement. If the participant reports no OH symptoms and the
      researchers observe no changes in appearance or signs of distress at that time, the
      researchers will query the participant about willingness to adjust the table to an additional
      10° of tilt. Following three minutes at this level, the researchers will again measure and
      record the participant's blood pressure. These procedures will continue with increments of
      10° of increased tilt every three minutes to a maximum of 90° tilt until the session time
      (maximum of 60 minutes) has elapsed or the participant expresses discomfort, measured blood
      pressure drops relative to the supine recording, or the researchers observe behaviors
      indicative of OH (e.g., sweating, change in skin color, change in breathing pattern,
      grimacing). If any of these OH symptoms occur, the researchers will adjust the tilt table to
      lower levels of incline until the participant's blood pressure stabilizes to the supine
      position measurement, and the session will be terminated.

      Intervention sessions will begin after three days of baseline measurements. Intervention
      sessions will follow the same procedures except that the conditions will alternate randomly
      among the three FES placement and the no FES conditions. All sessions will be held at Quality
      Living, Inc., in Omaha, Nebraska.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will engage in three baseline sessions to document blood pressure fluctuations associated with central nervous system dysregulation when changing from a sitting or supine position to a standing position involving the use of a head-up tilt table and no FES. Then, participants will engage in tilt table sessions in which the researchers randomly alternate the placement of FES pads across four conditions: (a) no FES, (b) calves only FES, (c) quads and abdominal only FES, and (d) calves, quads, and abdominal FES. Sessions will occur three to four times weekly until a participant demonstrates no OH upon tilt table adjustment to 90° (i.e., upright position) or the participant discharges from Quality Living, Inc., whichever comes first.</intervention_model_description>
