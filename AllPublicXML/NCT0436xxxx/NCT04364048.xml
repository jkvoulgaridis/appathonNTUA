  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single arm study of induction durvalumab (1500 mg IV) for 1 cycle (every 4 weeks),
      administered prior to starting concurrent definitive chemoradiation, followed by
      consolidation durvalumab (1500 mg IV every 4 weeks) for up to 12 cycles.

      The study will include an initial safety run-in portion. Patients in the safety run-in will
      be monitored through completion of induction durvalumab, chemoradiation, and 2 cycles of
      consolidation durvalumab for assessment of safety prior to completion of enrollment.
