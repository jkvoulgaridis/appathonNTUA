      This study will compare the effect of three transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) doses
      (high, middle, and low irradiance) to sham t-PBM on PFC CBF as assessed with fMRI (BOLD) in
      this multi-center, phase I, double-blinded, dose-ranging, controlled, crossover study of 30
      subjects with MDD. All eligible participants will undergo four sessions of t-PBM during fMRI
      so that they experience irradiances of 50, 300 and 700 mW/cm2 as well as sham. The order of
      dose administration will be randomized and t-PBM will be administered with the LightForce®
      EXPi Deep Tissue Laser TherapyTM System, Transcranial PhotoBioModulation-1000 (tPBM-2.0).

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if application of near infrared energy to
      the forehead can change blood flow in the brains of people with depression. Near infrared
      energy is like light but is not visible to the human eye. This research study will compare
      near infrared exposure with a placebo or sham procedure. The sham procedure will look and
      feel just like the near infrared procedure but won't include near infrared exposure.

    <measure>Change of t-PBM effects on Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The specificity of t-PBM effects on Blood Oxygen Level Dependent(BOLD) signal increases will be assessed by testing three irradiance doses covering a wide range (50, 300 and 700 mW/cm2) versus sham. If a reliable effect on BOLD (compared to sham, the BOLD increase at the optimal dose will have an effect size of Cohen's d≥0.5) is seen with PBM, the study validate BOLD fMRI as a robust biomarker of target engagement for t-PBM and act as a &quot;go&quot; signal. In contrast, if none of the t-PBM doses yield reliable BOLD increases, this will fail the putative mechanism (no go).</description>

    <measure>Changes in the frequency of suicidal ideation experienced</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), an instrument endorsed by the FDA for clinical trials. This instrument systematically tracks suicidal ideation and behavior. The C‐SSRS is made up of ten categories, all of which maintain binary responses (yes/no) to indicate a presence or absence of the behavior. A yes/no binary response is also utilized in assessing self‐injurious behavior without suicidal intent. The results of scoring will indicate the following: Suicidal ideation &quot;Yes&quot; Categories 1‐5, Suicidal behavior &quot;Yes&quot; Categories 6‐10 and Suicidal ideation &amp; behavior &quot;Yes&quot; Categories 1‐10</description>

    <measure>Change in overall depression severity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the use of Clinical Global Impressions - Severity (CGI-S). This instrument is scored 1-7 by the clinician based on assessment of the subject's overall clinical status. It will measure, based on history and scores on other instruments the overall depressive severity (CGI-S). The score of 1 indicates normal where as the score of 7 indicates extremely ill patients.</description>

    <description>This will be assessed by using the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I). The instrument is scored 1-7 by the clinician based on assessment of the subject's overall clinical status. It will measure, based on history and scores on other instruments the overall clinical improvement (CGI-I). The score of 1 indicates very much improved whereas the score of 7 indicates very much worse in clinical status</description>

    <description>The effectiveness of the blinding process in this study will be assessed by the Perceptions of Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ). The PBQ is a self-report questionnaire to determine the degree to which the participant believes s/he is receiving the treatment or the sham.</description>

    <measure>Change in the frequency of side effects experienced</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE). The SAFTEE is a commonly used instrument originally developed by NIMH and adapted into a self-report instrument. This version of the scale examines in a systematic fashion all possible treatment-emergent side effects and probes specific adverse symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and self-injurious behavior.</description>

    <measure>Change in depression severity in participants</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). This 10-item clinician-rated instrument measures depression severity. It will be administered with a structured interview guide. The time frame for this scale is the past 7 days. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>Change in participants with symptoms of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ). This is a comprehensive measure of depression that includes the assessment of symptoms in the anxiety-depression spectrum. It assesses irritability, anger attacks, and anxiety symptoms together with the commonly considered symptoms of depression. Analysis of the factor structure of the SDQ identified 5 subscales, including one in the anxiety-depression spectrum, with adequate internal consistency and concurrent validity.</description>

    <measure>Change in anxiety severity in participants</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured with Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ). This is a 17-item self-report questionnaire measuring the frequency and intensity of 17 symptoms of anxiety, including nervousness, worrying, irritability, trouble relaxing, insomnia, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, somatic symptoms, and impairment in functioning due to anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Participants' perceived quality of cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed with the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders, Cognitive Section (Neuro-QoL). The cognitive section of the Neuro-QoL is an 8 item self-rated measure of both executive function and general concerns. It measures perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, attention, and decision making) or in the application of such abilities to everyday tasks (e.g., planning, organizing, calculating, remembering and learning).</description>

    <measure>Change in Participants' perceived quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 visits over 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF). Participants rate their satisfaction with the following domains of activity: physical health, feelings, work, household duties, school/course work, leisure time activities, and social relations. Each item uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). A total score is derived from 14 items with a maximum score of 70 and with higher scores indicating greater life satisfaction and enjoyment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial photobiomodulator</intervention_name>
    <description>The tPBM-2.0 is an investigational device based on LiteCure's LightForce® EXPi Deep Tissue Laser TherapyTM System. For the investigational study, the EXPi System's beam delivery - EmpowerTM, is modified to non-invasively deliver Near-Infrared Radiation (NIR) to subjects diagnosed with MDD. The modified system is also configured to provide sham (placebo) treatment. The device is manufactured and supplied by LiteCure LLC, 101 Lukens Dr, Suite A, New Castle, DE 18720. The tPBM-2.0 is considered a Class II medical device per 21 CFR 890.5500 and 878.4810 and is manufactured per 21 CFR 820. It utilizes a laser diode source with a maximum continuous (CW) output of ≤30 Watts at a wavelength of 808 nanometers (nm) and nominal beam diameter of 40mm at the outside aperture. Transcranial photobiomodulator (t-PBM) deliver 3 different doses of irradiance: HIgh (770 mW/cm2), Middle (300 mW/cm2) and Low (50 mW/cm2).</description>
