  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this monocentric, non-interventional, prospective study carried out in
      acute geriatrics (UGA) and post-rehabilitation care, is to determine if eosinopenia is
      associated with bacterial infections.

      It's a monocentric, non-interventional, prospective study carried.

      At inclusion:

      Non-opposition will be collected by the investigator upon entering the Geriatric Unit.

      The investigators will have all the biological and radiological results and will decide
      whether or not to start antibiotic treatment.

      Patients will be divided into 2 groups: group with bacterial infections and the other with
      non-bacterial diseases.

      The patient's socio-demographic data, reason for hospitalization, history, BMI, state of
      dependence (ADL-IADL), MMSE, treatments will be collected. Biological examinations in the
      phase where an infection is not suspected will also be collected (NFS, ionogram, urea,
      creatinemia, albumin, pre albumin, CRP, hepatocellular workup. Clinical examination during
      the episode may be infectious as well that biological and radiological data will be collected
      as well as the diagnosis made.

      Antibiotic treatment is prescribed will be listed. The blood levels of eosinophils between
      the two groups will be compared.

      Follow-up at 1 month:

      The effectiveness of antibiotics will be evaluated on the absence of inflammatory syndrome
      and fever after the recommended antibiotic treatment and the duration of the recommended
      treatment. Vital status will be collected.
