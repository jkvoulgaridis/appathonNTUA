  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune neurological disease characterized by
      the destruction of myelin in the central nervous system, grey matter and axonal loss. The
      prevalence of neurogenic dysphagia in this group of patients is estimated to be more than
      30%. The aim of this study was investigating of Masseter, Orbicularis Oris,
      Sternocleidomastoid muscles' viscoelastic properties in MS patients with and without
      swallowing problems.

      The aim of this study was investigating of Masseter, Orbicularis Oris, Sternocleidomastoid
      muscles' viscoelastic properties in MS patients with and without swallowing problems. It
      carried out that myotonometric assessment of muscles in multiple sclerosis patients with
      dysphagia and comparison of these properties.

    <description>MyotonProÂ® device was used to measure muscles' viscoelastic parameters. The device is valid and reliable for measuring viscoelastic parameters (5, 6). Tonus, stiffness, elasticity of the muscles were recorded. Three measurements were bilaterally taken for each muscle. For each muscle, the average values of stiffness, tone and elasticity were retained as the main MyotonPRO outcomes. Myotonometric measurements were carried out for Masseter, Orbicularis Oris and Sternocleidomastoid (SKM) in supine position.</description>

    <description>Eating Assessment Tool was used to assess symptom of dysphagia. EAT-10 consisted of ten items, each of items was scored from 0 to 4. As the score increases, the patient's symptoms become deterioration.</description>

All individuals were classified according to DYMUS. The DYMUS Score was 1 or 2 was taken as mild swallowing problems, 3 or more was taken as severe swallowing problems. Patients were divided into three groups; first group that include patients without swallowing problems, second group that include patients with mild swallowing problems, third group that include severe swallowing problems.</description>
