      We planned to evaluate the change in tumor dimensions of intraaxial parenchymal tumors after
      craniotomy by comparing the tumor size on intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUSG) with
      pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain.

      Background: No previous study to determine the intraoperative changes in the tumor dimensions
      had been undertaken previously. Objectives: We planned to evaluate the change in tumor
      dimensions of intraaxial parenchymal tumors after craniotomy by comparing the tumor size on
      intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUSG) with pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain. Study Design:
      This was a prospective observational study. Participants: Patients aged 15-65 years
      undergoing surgery at SKIMS for intraaxial parenchymal intracranial tumors were included.
      Methods: Standard pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain were done to measure tumor dimensions
      and compared with IOUSG.

        All patients above the age of 15 years conferring to Grade I and II of American Society of
        Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status classification system undergoing elective
        intracranial tumor surgery at our institute in the specified period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients above the age of 15 years conferring to Grade I and II of American
             Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status classification system, undergoing
             elective craniotomy with intracranial tumor excision were included in this study.
             Patients with or without any neuro-deficit were also included. Only those patients in
             whom all the tumor dimensions could be defined with precision on pre-operative CECT,
             CEMRI and IOUSG were included in the final analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients' in whom there are multiple intracranial tumors (e.g. metastasis), deep
             seated tumors, inability to use IOUSG and in whom exact tumor dimensions cannot be
             defined either on pre-operative CECT/CEMRI or on IOUSG were excluded.
