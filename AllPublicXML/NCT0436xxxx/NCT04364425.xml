    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hydrodilatation with low dose steroid
      with high dose steroid for treating adhesive capsulitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial

      Patient and methods:

      Patients with adhesive capsulitis for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomly allocated
      into group 1 (hydrodilatation with low dose steroid ) and group 2 (hydrodilatation with high
      dose steroid). The patients were evaluated before treatment and were reevaluated 0, 6, and 12
      weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Outcomes measures included a pain scale (visual
      analog scale), range of motion, Constant shoulder score, Shoulder Pain And Disability Index

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
