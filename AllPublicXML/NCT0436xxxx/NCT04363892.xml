  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a computer model, based on photographs and heat images of
      patients' skin, to provide early prediction of painful reddening of the skin during
      radiotherapy treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no reliable tool to quantify and detect erythema of the skin during
      radiotherapy. This side-effect may lead to painful moist desquamation, and eventually
      permanent delayed side effects like telangiectasia. If such a tool would be available,
      several interventions could be staged, including (1) the use of steroid cream], (2) the
      re-simulation and/or re-planning of patients to decrease the skin dose by spreading out the
      entrance of the beams, (3) adjusting or eliminating the use of bolus on the skin surface
      (which boosts superficial dose) or (4) the use of other treatment techniques including prone
      technique.

      Given that the dose delivered is not a reliable metric to predict for erythema in a given
      patient, a new method for monitoring, staging and ultimately predicting skin response is
      needed. By analyzing images of the skin using both visible and infrared spectral regions, and
      by carefully converting the information in the images to quantitative metrics, it may be
      possible to characterize the stage of a patient's response to radiation, and to understand
      which patients may go on to experience chronic pain, severe burns or other more serious side
      effects while it is still early enough to intervene.

      The proposed research is to develop a software model that will take as input patient skin
      image data and the patient known clinical outcomes and algorithmically generalize a model to
      predict a biological response of skin to ionizing radiation for any future patient, after a
      few initial images.

      In the first stage of this study, the data will be aggregated to devise the dose response
      curve. In later phases, the model will be refined and used for predictive purposes, i.e.,
      once a new patient has begun radiotherapy sessions, their initial response will be
      quantified, and fed into the model to predict the skin response endpoint after the course of
      radiation therapy ends. As mentioned, this information could be used to adapt the radiation
      course and optimize the therapy for the individual, potentially preventing morbidity from
      overdose, or risk of recurrence from under dose.
