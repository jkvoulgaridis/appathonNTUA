      This study evaluated the regenerative potential of rhBMP-2 gel in intrabony defects when
      compared to sticky bone (control).

      It was done in 40 subjects who were evaluated for a period of 6 months. the results were
      evaluated clinically (CAL, PPD) and radiographically (bone fill) and after 6 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization involved the computerized generation of the allocation sequence in random permuted blocks (block randomization) and blinding was ensured by assigning the block of sites to study groups according to the specified sequence by a second operator who coded the two treatment sites selected from every patient by the first operator into the following groups</intervention_model_description>

    <description>For the preparation of sticky bone, the patient's venous blood is collected and centrifuged at 2400rpm for 2min which leads to two different layers in the vacutainer the upper autologous fibrin glue (AFG) and the lower RBC portion, the upper AFG is mixed with a particulate bone graft (hydroxyapatite). Within 5-10 min fibrin meshwork was formed</description>
