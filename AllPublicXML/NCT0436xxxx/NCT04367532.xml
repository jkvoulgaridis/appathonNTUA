  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that self-myofascial release (SMR) intervention on the cuff muscles would
      affect positively sprint performance and jump height, as well as, decrease Achilles tendon
      stiffness. The second hypothesis is that tissue flossing would be more effective than foam
      rolling.

      The participants will be randomly assigned to foam rolling, tissue flossing, and control
      group (without any intervention). After the intervention, repeated measures will be performed
      (15m sprint, countermovement jump (CMJ) and Achilles tendon stiffness). This will aim to
      improve sprint time, jump height and decrease tendon stiffness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foam rolling provides beneficial results in ankle range of motion, muscle flexibility or
      muscle sourness. Tissue flossing is popular in athletic training and physical therapy, as an
      effective strategy for ankle range of motion or performance. However, there is a lack of
      knowledge about the use of foam rolling and tissue flossing during a 60 minutes
      post-intervention examination on the performance and soft tissue stiffness.

      The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of foam rolling and tissue flossing
      of the cuff on sprint performance, jump height and Achilles tendon stiffness at different
      time points. The second aim is to assess the effectiveness of those self-myofascial release
      methods (SMR).

      This study will include healthy, recreational active subjects aged between 20 and 25 years
      old.
