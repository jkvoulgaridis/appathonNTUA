  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial study was to assess the effects of an 4-week
      exercise program on the recovery capacity after a voluntary maximal apnea. Participants will
      be randomly allocated to perform an experimental breathing protocol (NR-HB), or an usual
      training using their usual breathing (UB) protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a multi-center study. 2 different Spanish Freedivers Centres are included in the study
      (Madrid and Zaragoza).

      Divers were randomly assigned to receive an experimental training (NR-HB) or to be included
      in the Control Group (UB).

      The trial included two study visits. Each exercise training program will be applied sessions
      per week during 4 weeks. Participants received baseline assessments at the beginning of any
      intervention, and post-intervention assessments at the end of the fourth week.

    <description>Oxygen Saturation recovery will be record by the experimenters every 5 seconds by a handheld pulse-oximeter during the 1 min recovery time after a maximal dynamic apnea. The outcome was the length of the time to return to 95% SpO2 during the 1 min recovery time after maximal dynamic apnoea</description>

    <description>It will apply a usual training program for 4 weeks, 4hours and 30 min per week distributed equally over 3 days in the week. In each session, it was performed 8 submaximes-dynamic apnoeas with 3-minute recovery between each one. Then was performed a maximal-dynamic apnoea. To finish the session, was performed a continuous training of free style swimming at moderate effort over 30 minutes.
During that training, only this group will perform an experimental breathing protocol consisted of removing nose-clip previous to surface and then perform hook breathing during 20 seconds. This protocol was applied at the end of each of the 8 submaximes-dynamic apnoeas and after the maximal-dynamic apnoea</description>
