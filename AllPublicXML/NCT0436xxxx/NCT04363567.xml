  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The luminal side of the entire vasculature is covered with a gel-like polymer called
      endothelial glycocalyx (EG). EG is important for the transport of molecules in and out of the
      blood cells and for endothelial function. EG protects the blood vessel wall, is likely to
      contribute to maintenance of normal blood pressure and the prevention of blood clot
      formation. Overall it is likely to avoid development of cardiovascular disease.

      A newly developed blood test, salt-blood test, can measure erythrocyte salt sensitivity and
      gives information about the condition of EG. EG can also be measured by release of
      endothelial glycocalyx proteins.

      Previous studies indicate that this EG is impaired by a number of chronic diseases, including
      chronic kidney disease. This study investigates the quality of glycocalyx in patients with
      chronic kidney disease, and compares with the layer in healthy.

      The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge about how pronounced the EG are affected in
      varying degrees of chronic kidney disease compared with healthy controls assessed by

        1. salt-blood test

        2. release of endothelial glycocalyx proteins.

      and to see how this correlates to

        1. blood pressure (peripheral and central)

        2. pulse wave velocity

        3. albuminuria

        4. coagulation system

        5. vasoactive hormones (PRC, p-Ang-II, p-Aldo, p-ANP, p-BNP, p-AVP)
