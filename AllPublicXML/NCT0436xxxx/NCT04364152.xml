  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking deficits and altered brain capacity have been proved to be two of the main
      contributing factors in dual-task walking deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      In the past, patients with PD were usually suggested not to walk in dual-task conditions in
      order to concentrate on their walking performance better. However, since dual-task walking is
      really common in daily-life, this limitation usually lead to a decrease in quality of life
      for PD patients. In previous studies, effects of using attentional strategies in dual-task
      walking training remain unclear, while suitable attentional strategies and corresponded
      neuroplasticity for patients with and without freezing of gait have not been well discussed,
      either. Accordingly, this study is aimed to identify (1) whether internal or external
      attentional strategies is more ideal for PD patients with and without freezing of gait in
      dual-task walking training, and (2) changes in brain activity after receiving dual-task
      walking training with different attentional strategies in patients with or without freezing
      of gait. Our hypothesis are (1) patients with or without freezing of gait will react
      differently in dual-gait training with different attentional strategies, and (2) changes in
      brain activities will be different according to different attentional strategies given in the
      training.

      The hypothesis will be tested by gait performance, suprapostural tasks performance, relative
      power spectrum of EEG, and scales including MDS-UPDRS, ABC, BBS, and TUG.
