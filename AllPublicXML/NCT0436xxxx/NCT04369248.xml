      The investigators aimed to investigate hepassocin levels in patients with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS). There are 3 groups aged between 18 and 35 years as non-obese healthy women,
      non-obese women with PCOS, and obese women (BMI&gt;30) with PCOS.

      Hepassocin, also known as Fibrinogen-like-protein or hepatocyte-derived fibrinogen-related
      protein 1, is a new marker for obesity and insulin resistance. In hepatic injury, it protects
      liver cells and promotes regeneration. High levels of hepassocin was shown to be
      independently associated with HOMA-IR and diabetes. Since insulin resistance is known to be
      seen in patients with PCOS, it may be expected that hepassocin levels may be higher in this
      group of patients.

    <description>2003 Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM PCOS Consensus Criteria were used to diagnose PCOS that fulfilled at least two of the followings: chronic oligo-anovulation, clinic or biochemical hyperandrogenism and presence of polycyctic ovary by ultrasound (Rotterdam). Oligo-anovulation is defined as periods lasting more than 35 days and/or amenorrhea. Clinic or biochemical hyperandrogenism is defined as the presence of acnes and/ or Ferriman-Galleway modified score &gt;8 and/ or hyperandrogenemia defining the testosterone level &gt; 0.6 ng/ml (2 nmol/l) and/or dehydroepiandrosterone level &gt; 3 ng/ml (10.5 nmol/l). Polycyctic ovaries are defined as the presence of more than 12 follicules 2-9 mm in diameters or ovarian volume &gt;10 cm3 under transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound. non-obese group are the women BMI &lt; 30 between age of 18 and 35.</description>

      Early follicular phase day 3 in case of menstruating and random day for amenorrheic patients
      was chosen for blood sampling after 8 hour of fasting. The blood samples were obtained from
      the antecubital vein via a vacutainer. Process of samples was achieved within maximum 1 hour
      and serum sample was stored in -80 for hepassocin work-up after 5 minutes of centrifuge.
