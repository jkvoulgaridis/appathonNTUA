        -  G2: Patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy as bariatric procedure and not receiving pre-
           or postoperative probiotics

      Preoperative probiotics scheme include:

        -  saccharomyces boulardii ntc 5375 + enterococcus faecium UBEF-41 + lactobacillus
           acidophilus LA 14 during 15 days (between 6th and 4th weeks before surgery)

        -  Bifidobacterium lactis BL 04 + Bifidobacterium breve BB 03 + Bifidobacterium bifidum BB
           06 + Bifidobacterium longum BL 05 during 15 days (between 4th and 2nd weeks before
           surgery)

        -  lactobacillus rhamnosus LR 32 + lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 + lactobacillus
           acidophillus LA 14 during 15 days (between 2nd week and the day before surgery)

      Postoperative probiotics scheme include:

        -  saccharomyces boulardii ntc 5375 + enterococcus faecium UBEF-41 + lactobacillus
           acidophilus LA 14 during 15 days (between 1st and 3rd weeks after surgery)

        -  Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR 32 + Bifidobacterium lactis BL 04 + Bifidobacterium longum BL
           05 + lactobacillus salivarius LS 33 + lactobacillus acidophilus LA 14 + bifidobacterium
           bifidum BGN 4 during 4 months (between 4th and 20th weeks after surgery.

      Both groups will receive the same nutritional recommendations.

      1 year after surgery, weight los will be assessed as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will
      include daibetes mellitus remission and dyslipidemia remission.
