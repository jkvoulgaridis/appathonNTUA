  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Samyama program on blood levels of
      selected neurotransmitters before and after the program, and associate with corresponding
      effects on mind/psyche before and after the program in adult participants.

      Hypothesis:

        1. The state of higher consciousness and ecstasy resulting from Samyama result from
           increased levels of Anandamide, an endocannabinoid, and Brain Derived Neurotrophic
           Factor (BDNF).

        2. The 60-day preparatory phase that includes dietary regulation and yogic practices will
           reduce the gut inflammation and thereby will improve the gut microbiome.

      Potential participants (those signed up to attend the Samyama program at Isha) will be sent
      email invitations approximately 2 months prior to the program. Participants will have the
      options to take part in online surveys, blood samples, and/or stool samples. Up to 1000
      participants (attendees and spouses/significant others) may take the online surveys twice
      before the samyama program, 2 weeks after and 3 months after. Up to *200 may volunteer to
      have 4 blood draws. (Blood draws will occur 1. At home, or at an Isha group meditation, 1-2
      months prior to Samyama 2. At Isha before the start of the program 3. At Isha after the
      program 4. At home after returning from the Samyama program). 150 volunteers may also send in
      3 stool samples - 1. prior to starting the Samyama pre-prep diet 2. within one week of the
      Samyama program 3. After returning home from the program.

      Up to 50 spouses/significant others living with Samyama attendees will also be offered the
      opportunity to complete a shortened version of the online surveys, provide (2) blood and/or
      (3) stool samples. Blood would be collected at home prior to their spouses/significant
      other's Samyama attendance and in their home after the program. Requested stool samples would
      be asked to be collected approximately 1 month prior to the program, 1 week prior to the
      program and one week after the program.

      Blood samples will be sent to Indiana University and may be sent to other specialty labs for
      additional analysis. Genetic and future biomarker samples will be stored at the PI's Indiana
      University lab facilities.

      If survey participants do not complete surveys during suggested time periods, they may also
      be sent reminders (via emails) to complete surveys.

      *Only up to 150 volunteers will have at home blood draws (or blood draws at an Isha group
      meditation). Only those who participated in the pre-Samyama at home blood draws will be asked
      to participate in the post-Samyama blood draws.

      Up to 200 volunteers at Isha can participate in blood draws (regardless of whether they
      participated in at home blood draw).

      Those who complete the survey will also be asked if they have a significant other or spouse
      who lives with them who would be willing to complete surveys, and participate in blood draws
      and/or provide stool samples. Participants with willing spouses will be asked to enter an
      email address for that spouse/significant other. Spouse/significant other will be emailed the
      invitation with study information.

      Upto 25 subjects will also be enrolled in the (2)EEG and (2)fMRI Study March 19 and March 29,
      2018 (before Samyama), and between April 9th and May 9th, 2018 (after Samyama).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>levels of Anandamide</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anandamide (AEA) activates endocannabinoid-1 (eCB1) receptors in the central nervous system and eCB2 receptors throughout the body and studies have suggested its role in regulating mood and behavior, sleeping and eating patterns, memory, pain, immune system, fertility and cancer inhibition [3]. Endogenous anandamide is mainly active at eCB1 receptor, which is responsible for the experience of blissfulness, ecstasy and the elevated mood and wellbeing similar to psychoactive effects reported in cannabis use. Anandamide is thought to be related to the experience of &quot;runner's high&quot; due to intense physical activity [4]. So far, no study has explored the effect of yoga and meditation on endogenous levels of anandamide in humans. However, Anandamide is very quickly catabolized in the human system by Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) [5]. So, to control for this we propose to use FAAH inhibitor in the sampling tube to preserve and accurately measure anandamide.</description>

    <measure>Levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is another neurotransmitter found in the brain and the rest of the body. It helps in survival of existing neurons and growth of new neurons. It is involved in regulation of other neurotransmitters, long-term memory, stable memory function and cognitive function [6, 7]. Studies have suggested negative correlations between BDNF levels and disease such as depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia and dementia. Studies have shown beneficial increase in BDNF levels in human subjects because of yoga and meditation practices [8].</description>

    <measure>Transcriptome analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing - gene expression analyses): Peripheral blood from participants will be collected before and after Samyama in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (Qiagen). Upon RNA extraction, RNA quantity will be assessed with Nanodrop (Nanodrop Technologies) and quality with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA samples will be cleaned using DNAse I kit according to the Rapid out removal DNA kit instruction (Thermoscientific) and will be converted into cDNA by using Lexogen QuantSeq 3' Fwd Library Prep Kit (Lexogen) according to manufacturer's instruction to generate compatible library for Illumina sequencing. cDNA libraries will be assessed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, USA) before 65-100 bp single end sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000 system based on standard protocols to obtain raw sequencing data. Raw sequencing reads will be processed using our standard pipelines to obtain high quality sequencing reads for data analyses.</description>

    <measure>Epigenetic analysis (DNA methylation)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Epigenetic analysis (DNA methylation): DNA from peripheral blood of participants will be examined for integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using fluorimeter using a double stranded DNA (BR) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). About 500 ng of the sampled DNA will be analyzed on a Infinium® MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The hybridized and stained arrays will be ultimately scanned using HiScanSQ system (Illumina). Infinium MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip from Illumina will evaluate over 850,000 methylation sites quantitatively across the genome at single-nucleotide resolution. Data analyses will be performed utilizing previously published standard pipelines.</description>

    <measure>Microbiome analysis:</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiome analysis: Participants will also be requested for stool samples prior to, or early into the start of preparatory steps (approximately 60 days before the scheduled program start), within 2.5 weeks prior to the program, and another one after the completion of the program. The strict vegan diet and the preparatory steps along with the Samyama meditation program is hypothesized to reduce the gut inflammation and improve the gut microbiome.</description>

    <measure>Plasma lipidomic analyses:</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma lipidomic analyses: A high-resolution (0.2 to 3 ppm mass error) mass spectrometric, non-targeted lipidomics platform will be utilized to compare the plasma lipidome of Samyama participants before and after the program. Blood samples will be collected at the following three time points: (1) before the start of the Samyama program, (2) after the Samyama program, and (3) possibly at 3 months after the program.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>fMRI</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>fMRI: Functional MRI is a useful non-invasive tool to study brain neuronal activity.
Examine the qualitative fMRI changes associated with 8-day advanced meditation, Samyama program. This would specifically examine the resting state neuroconnectivity, in particular the 'default mode network'. Anatomical changes such as grey matter volume and insular thickness will also be analyzed. fMRI changes with meditative breath watching will also be recorded and analysed.</description>
