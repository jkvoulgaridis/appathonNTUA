      Endoscopic treatment is recommended for initial hemostasis in nonvariceal upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the additional hemostatic efficacy of argon plasma
      coagulation (APC) has not been widely investigated. We designed a randomized trial comparing
      APC plus injection therapy vs hemoclipping plus injection therapy for peptic ulcer bleeding.

      【Goals and Background 】 Endoscopic treatment is recommended for initial hemostasis in
      nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Many endoscopic devices have been demonstrated
      to be effective in the hemostasis of bleeding ulcers. However, the additional hemostatic
      efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) after endoscopic injection therapy has not been
      widely investigated.

      【Study】 From Feb. 2012 to April 2016, consecutive patients with high-risk bleeding ulcers,
      characterized by active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessels and adherent clots, were
      admitted to our hospital. They prospectively randomly underwent either APC therapy plus
      distilled water injection or Hemoclipping plus distilled water injection. Pantoprazole
      infusion was conducted during the fasting period after endoscopy and orally for 8 weeks to
      encourage ulcer healing. Episodes of rebleeding were retreated with endoscopic combination
      therapy. Patients who did not benefit from retreatment underwent emergency surgery or
      arterial embolization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        ． high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding. High-risk bleeding ulcers were defined as participants
        with stigmata of a bleeding visible vessels (eg, spurting, oozing), a non-bleeding visible
        vessels (NBVV) or adherent clot.4 A NBVV at endoscopy was defined as a raised red, red-blue
        or pale hemispheric vessel protruding from the ulcer bed, without active bleeding. An
        adherent clot was defined as an overlying blood clot that was resistant to vigorous
        irrigation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of another possible bleeding site (eg, gastroesophageal varix, gastric
             cancer, reflux esophagitis)

          -  coexistence of actively severe ill diseases (eg, septic shock, stroke, myocardial
             infarction, surgical abdomen)
