      This project is being done to explore the effects floating has on individuals who have a
      history of trauma with stress related symptoms.

      This pilot study looks to further the current floatation-based REST literature by exploring
      the therapy's effectiveness within a community-based sample of adults with PTSD. This type of
      sample allows the study the opportunity to recruit both veteran and civilian subjects, two
      populations that can suffer from this clinical diagnosis and stand to benefit from this
      therapy. This study will:

        1. Evaluate the psychological effects of floating for a clinical, community sample with
           PTSD.

        2. Evaluate the physiological effects of floating for a clinical, community sample with
           PTSD.

        3. Evaluate the subjective effects of floating for a clinical, community sample with PTSD.
