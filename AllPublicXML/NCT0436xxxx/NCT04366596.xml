    <textblock>
      Efficacy of drug eluting balloon(DEB) for non-atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis will be
      tested in this study. The intervention group will be treated with paclitaxel eluting balloon.
      The control group will be treated with plain old balloon(POB). The primary endpoint is
      efficacy of blood pressure control.

    <textblock>
      Renal artery stenosis is common cause for hypertension in young people. It could be treated
      with open surgery or endovascular intervention. Open surgery has relatively high complication
      rate. Endovascular intervention is micro-invasive but with high restenosis rate. Drug eluting
      balloon(DEB) has been demonstrated to be effective for preventing restenosis in peripheral
      arteries. This study aims to test the efficacy of drug eluting balloon for
      non-atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. The intervention group will be treated with
      paclitaxel eluting balloon. The control group will be treated with plain old balloon. The
      primary endpoint is efficacy of blood pressure control.
