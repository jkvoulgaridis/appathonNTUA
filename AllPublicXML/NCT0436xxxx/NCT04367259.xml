  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare the treatment efficacy of single puncture
      arthrocentesis (SPA) and double puncture arthrocentesis (DPA) techniques in Temporomandibular
      joint (TMJ) disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study sample consisted of 36 patients with DDwoR. 18 patients received SPA procedure and
      included in SPA group. The other 18 patients received DPA procedure and included in DPA
      group.

      Double puncture arthrocentesis technique:

      Posterior puncture method was used as described by Alkan and Etoz. for DPA. A straight line
      was drawn with a marker pen along the skin from the middle portion of the auricular tragus to
      the lateral chantus. The first puncture point was marked 10 mm anterior and 2 mm inferior to
      the tragus and the second 7 mm anterior and 2 mm inferior to the tragus. After local
      anesthesia, upper joint cavity was irrigated with 200 mL of Lactated Ringer's (RL) solution
      by inserting two 21- gauge needle. At the end of the procedure, after withdrawn of one of the
      needles, 1 mL of sodium hyaluronate (SH) was injected into the upper TMJ compartment through
      the other needle.

      Single Puncture Arthrocentesis Technique:

      SPA was performed with one needle (SPA Type-1 according to Senturk and Cambazoglu). The first
      reference point in DPA was used as the needle entry point fort he SPA. With this technique,
      the inflow and outflow of solution were provided through the same cannula and lumen of one
      21-gauge needle as described by Guarda-Nardini et al. The joint was irrigated with 200 mL of
      RL solution under high pressure. At the end of the procedure1 mL of SH was injected through
      the needle.
