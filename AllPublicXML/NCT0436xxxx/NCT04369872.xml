  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the first choice of treatment for early-stage primary pulmonary malignancies, but
      up to 15% of all patients, and 33% of patients greater than 75 years of age, are not surgical
      candidate's due to locally advanced disease, poor cardiopulmonary reserve and significant
      medical co-morbidities. Some patients are also unwilling to undergo surgery. This has
      prompted the development of alternatives to surgery so that local control of unresectable
      tumors can be achieved.

      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is currently an alternative therapy for these
      patients with 3-year survival rates of between 42 and 60%. SBRT has excellent local control
      rates and a favorable toxicity profile relative to other surgical and non-surgical therapies.
      Radiation pneumonitis (RP), amongst others, is one of the major toxicities which can limit
      the maximal radiation dose that can be safely delivered to thoracic tumors. Reported rates of
      SBRT induced RP requiring clinical intervention range from 0% to 29% and life-threatening
      toxicities have been reported in up to 12% of cases in various studies. The potential for
      toxicities from SBRT could limit the number of times a patient could be treated with SBRT for
      residual, recurrent or new pulmonary lesions over time.

      Following the first report of thermal ablation for lung malignancies in 2000, this modality
      has been used to treat primary and secondary malignancies and has emerged as an effective,
      low-cost, safe and repeatable alternative to SBRT for local tumour control. The most widely
      practised technique is radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Microwave ablation (MWA) is a
      relatively new therapy and offers all the advantages of RFA, but with significant additional
      advantages 3. These include reduced procedure times, lower complication rates, increased
      ablative temperatures, improved propagation of thermal energy particularly in the lung,
      improved efficacy in lesions that are in close proximity to blood vessels due to reduced
      heat-sink effect, and less procedure associated pain 2,3. Using high energy MWA to treat 87
      pulmonary tumors, Egashira et al achieved a primary technical success rate of 94% and
      technique effectiveness of 98% at a median of 15 months.

      MWA is performed by Interventional Radiologists using CT guidance. The treatment is performed
      under general anaesthesia and is repeatable. Multiple lesions can be ablated in one treatment
      session. Patients can potentially be discharged the same day of treatment, if there are no
      adverse events.

      MWA is a relatively new treatment option that could be considered in situations where the
      patient is not a candidate for further treatment with surgery, SBRT or chemotherapy, or the
      patient declines the recommended standard available treatments.

      Objectives for Phase I:

      The primary objective for Phase I of this study will be to demonstrate the Safety of MWA
      performed for treatment of lung malignancy in patients not suitable for surgery, chemotherapy
      or SBRT.

      Primary objective (Safety): to determine the proportion of patients experiencing local
      adverse events at one week definitively related to the mwa procedure.

      Secondary objective (Feasibility): To determine the proportion of patients in whom technical
      success of MWA was achieved by assessing completion of ablation on CT at the time of the
      procedure, indicated by replacement of tumor by ground glass change (including a 5mm ablation
      zone in normal surrounding lung parenchyma).

      Objectives for Phase II Primary objective (Efficacy): To demonstrate efficacy by measuring
      the proportion of patients demonstrating absence of residual tumor on follow up CT at 1 month
      after MWA.

      Secondary objective: To determine the proportion of patients needing re-treatment for
      recurrent tumor at 1 month post MWA.
