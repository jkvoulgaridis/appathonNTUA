      A Phase 2a, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of DKN-01 in Combination with Tislelizumab ±
      Chemotherapy as First-Line or Second-Line Therapy in Adult Patients with Inoperable, Locally
      Advanced or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study to be conducted concurrently
      in 2 Parts (Parts A and B). Approximately 72 patients aged 18 years or older with inoperable,
      histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic G/GEJ adenocarcinoma with measurable
      disease (RECIST v1.1) requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study. Both parts are
      designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination therapy of
      intravenous (IV) DKN-01 and tislelizumab ± CAPOX in G/GEJ adenocarcinoma patients. Treatment
      continues in repeating 21-day cycles until patient meets criteria for discontinuation or is
      no longer deriving clinical benefit. Parts A and B will be enrolled concurrently. Two doses
      of DKN-01 will be evaluated in Part B (Part B1 and Part B2)
