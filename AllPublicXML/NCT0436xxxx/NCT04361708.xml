    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to establish the safety of combining irinotecan
      chemotherapy with 5-FU, leucovorin/folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (abbreviated as
      the I-FLOAT study of gFOLFOXIRITAX) chemotherapies (leucovorin/folinic acid is a vitamin to
      make 5-FU work well).

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder
             adenocarcinoma, ampullary carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of unclear primary (with upper GI
             primary suspected), or other primary GI malignancy for which the treating physician
             feels that I-FLOAT is a reasonable therapeutic option.

          2. Patients with a history of obstructive jaundice due to the primary tumor must have
             resolved to &lt;1.5 X upper limit of normal and a metal biliary stent in place

             replacement.

          5. Neuropathy, grade 2 or greater by NCI-CTCAE, v. 4.0.

          7. Serious underlying medical or psychiatric illnesses that would, in the opinion of the
             treating physician, substantially increase the risk for complications related to

             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or any other cancer for which the
             patient has been previously treated and the lifetime recurrence risk is less than 30%,
             and meets all other eligibility criteria.
