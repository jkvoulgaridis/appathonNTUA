  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 50% of full-term newborns and 80% of premature infants develop jaundice which is due to
      hyperbilirubinemia. In the majority of cases, jaundice disappears naturally without treatment
      within three weeks of birth, but the bilirubin level may remain too high, which can lead to a
      serious neurological disease: kernicterus. To avoid this, a therapeutic management must be
      instituted, and in some cases, one or more phototherapy sessions (PT) may be prescribed.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and level of satisfaction of parents and
      healthcare team with one innovative device for phototherapy BUBOLight® included two removable
      strips of luminous textile incorporating optical fibers.

      10 newborns requiring phototherapy, will be illuminated during four hours in one session of
      PT Bilirubin levels is taken at the start of phototherapy H0 and Controls are made at H+6
      hours.
