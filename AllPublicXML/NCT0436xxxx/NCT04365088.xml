  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removal of impacted lower third molar teeth is one of the most common oral surgical
      procedures, and these operations often lead to various complications in patients.
      Antibiotics, analgesics and/or anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed for the treatment of
      complications encountered. Anti-inflammatory is the property of a substance or treatment that
      reduces inflammation or swelling. Anti-inflammatory drugs make up about half of analgesics,
      remedying pain by reducing inflammation as opposed to opioids, which affect the central
      nervous system to block pain signaling to the brain. Based on this information, in this
      study, it is aimed to evaluate the effects of deflazacort preoperatively on the postoperative
      pain, swelling and trismus.

    <description>Deflazacort is a glucocorticoid used as an anti-inflammatory drug. We used deflazacort 30 mg tablet. Patient took a pill once preoperatively (1 hour ago) in third molar surgery.</description>

    <description>After the taken a deflazacort pill once preoperatively (one hour ago), local anesthesia was obtained using 2 ml articaine hydrochloride 40 mg/ml with epinephrine 0.01 mg/ml . The horizontal incision was made with no. 15 scalpel blade and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised. In all surgical procedures, bone removal and/or tooth sectioning were performed under sterile saline irrigation. Following the extraction, granulation tissues were removed, and bleeding was controlled. Finally, the mucoperiosteal flap was repositioned by 3.0 silk sutures.</description>
