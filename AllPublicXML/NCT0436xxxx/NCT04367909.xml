  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of TC Regimenwith or without nimotuzumab in recurrent metastatic oral squamous cell
      carcinoma. Treatment may continue as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit
      as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic
      deterioration attributed to disease progression.

    <description>To compare the efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab plus TC Regimen chemotherapy versus TC Regimen chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma. Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for participants who were not reported as dead at the time of analysis was censored at the date when they were last known to be alive.</description>
