      The project is geared towards the understanding of how to increase cognitive control over cue
      reactivity and drug craving.

      Project C04 aims at assessing the combined effect of two interventions targeting at reducing
      striatal cue reactivity and increasing cognitive control, namely mindfulness-based
      intervention and real-time fMRI neurofeedback. Firstly, the investigators will test whether a
      prior mindfulness-based intervention (WP1) is able to enhance the effect of rtfMRI NFB (WP2)
      and change the networks involved in regulation of cue reactivity by providing participants
      with explicit strategies. Secondly, the investigators will investigate whether this combined
      intervention leads to a better clinical outcome in terms of decreased heavy drinking days and
      a reduced sum of alcohol consumption three months later.

    <masking_description>The participants will be allocated to one of two NFB groups (real NFB or control group) in a double-blind procedure.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>MBT and NFB will each lead to a reduced number of relapses during three months after treatment in comparison to the combination of TAU and sham NFB. The combined intervention is expected to lead to a larger reduction compared to the other groups. The investigators expect a higher number of days until relapse, a lower number of heavy drinking days and a lower amount of alcohol consumed by the participants during the follow-up period showing similar group differences.</description>
