  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue, and intracranial hypertension in
      the acute phase remains a critical scientific issue. Many patients with acute closed TBI
      received conservative, non-surgical treatments at first, while 5%~19% of which develops
      intractable intracranial hypertension that requires emergent surgery. Therefore, it is of
      great clinical significance to identify patients who are at high risk of deterioration in the
      early stage. Previous studies have found that brain compliance is a contributive factor to
      intracranial pressure, and might serve in the development of intracranial hypertension after
      TBI. We made assumption that intracranial pressure has a negative relationship with brain
      compliance providing that the volume of hematoma remains constant. However, few studies have
      applied magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in evaluating brain compliance in patients with
      TBI. Therefore, this study is designed to enroll patients with acute closed traumatic brain
      injury who are initially treated non-surgically. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)
      sequences are performed to non-invasively assess patients' brain compliances, in the hope of
      exploring the potential value of MRE biomarkers to predict the short-term outcome in patients
      with acute closed TBI who are initially receive non-surgical treatments.

        Patients with acute closed traumatic brain injury within 7 days will be enrolled in the
        study. Patients are conservatively managed (didn't receive surgery yet) according to the
        judgement of neurosurgeons.
