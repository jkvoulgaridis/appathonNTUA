      Study Title: Changes on the Interproximal marginal bone level after CAD-CAM designed bridges
      directly placed on bone-level implants, or with intermediate abutments. A Randomized Clinical
      Trial.

        -  Objectives: To evaluate differences on changes on the interproximal marginal bone level
           12 months after the connection of CAD/CAM designed prosthesis with an intermediate
           abutment (3mm long) or directly placed to bonelevel implants. Secondary objectives will
           be evaluate changes on the soft tissues and implant survival, as well as patients'
           satisfaction 3, 6 and 12 months after the connection of the definitive prosthesis.

        -  Design and Outcomes: Randomized double-blinded clinical trial with parallel design to
           asses the effect of CADCAM designed bridges directly placed

        -  Interventions and Duration: Patients will be selected according to the
           inclusion/exclusion criteria among those who attend the Unit of Periodontology of the
           University of Santiago de Compostela. After clinical and radiological implant planning,
           implant surgical placement will be scheduled. 2 MOZO GRAU® INHEX ST implants, with 3.75
           mm or 4.25 mm of diameter and 8mm, 10mm or 11.5mm length will be placed on each patient,
           according to the bone availability. After 8 weeks of submerged healing, second stage
           surgery will be performed and definitive impression will be taken. All groups patients
           will keep a heeling abutment until the definitive prosthesis is placed, 3 weeks later
           (test group: direct to implant / control group: abutment 3 mm long). Clinical and
           radiological assessment after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months will be performed. Each participant
           will be on study about 15 months since the recruitment visit until the end of the study.

        -  Sample Size and Population: Based on previous studies, a sample size calculation
           determined that a group of 32 subjects, considering possible dropouts, will provide 80%
           power to detect a true radiographic difference of 0.80mm between groups after 12 months
           of observation since the definitive prosthesis connection. (Blanco et al 2017, Nóvoa et
           al 2017). A common standard deviation between groups was calculated (SD=0.715268015). A
           p ≤ 0.05 value will be considered significant (JM. Domenech &amp; R. Granero 2010). A
           balanced random permuted block will be applied to prepare the randomization tables,
           stratifying for smoking habits (yes/no) with a 1:1 ratio between test and control
           groups.

      Changes on the interproximal periimplant marginal bone level measured as the distance between
      the bone crest to the first implant to bone contact, using periapical radiographs, will be
      evaluated.

      Each patient will receive to implants that will be rehabilitated with an implant supported
      prosthesis, being the test group a prosthesis connected directly to the implants, while the
      control group will be a prosthesis connected to the implants through intermediate abutments.
