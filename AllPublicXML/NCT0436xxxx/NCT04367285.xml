  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensor-based technological therapy devices may be good candidates for neuromotor
      rehabilitation of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), especially for treating upper
      extremities function limitations. The sensor-based device rehabilitation is characterized by
      interactive therapy games with audio-visual feedback that allows training the movement of
      shoulders, elbows and wrist, measuring the strength and the active range of motion of upper
      limb, registering data in an electronic database in order to quantitatively monitoring
      measures and therapy progress. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      sensor-based motor rehabilitation in add-on to the conventional neurorehabilitation, on
      increasing the upper limbs functions of MS patients. The training consisting of twelve
      sessions of upper limb training, was compared with twelve sessions of upper limb
      sensory-motor training, without robotic support. Both rehabilitation programs were performed
      for 40 minutes three times a week, for 4 weeks, in addition to the conventional therapy. All
      patients were evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of training (T1)

    <measure>Changes in functionality of the upper limb measured in 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT) at 1 months</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in functionality of the upper limb measured in 9-HPT. Changes in the measure in 9-HPT (time, seconds *total scale*) Nine Hole PegTest (Mathiowetz et al, Occup Therap J Resaerach 1985) Time in second to perform the whole test will be recordered (better with less time)</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Level at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is one of the most commonly used self-report questionnaires to measure fatigue. Each question on this scale, which is composed of Likert type questions: 1.I strongly disagree 2.I do not agree 3.No tend to disagree 4. Indefinitely. The total score of the scale, which consists of 9 questions, varies between 9-63. People are asked to mark the appropriate options for each question taking into account their status in the last 1 month period. A total of 36 points and above indicate fatigue</description>

    <measure>Changes in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 questionnaire (MSQOL-54)at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in MSQOL-54. MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure, assessing the perception of physical and mental well-being. The instrument is composed of 54 items concerning 12 subscales, which form two scales relating to the physical and mental well-being. The score of the physical function scales, perceptions of health, energy/fatigue, role-physical limitations, pain, sexual function, social function, health distress, is added and corrected to obtain a score on the MSQUOL PHYSICAL HEALTH scale: a score above 50.0 indicates physical well-being. The score of the health distress scale, overall quality of life, emotional well-being, role limitations - emotional, cognitive function is summed and corrected to obtain a score on the scale MSQUOL MENTAL HEALTH: a score above 50.0 indicates mental well-being. The administration time is about 11-18 minutes, it can be completed by an interviewer or by the patient.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Medical Research Council scale (MRC) at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The MRC score is obtained by evaluating 12 muscle groups in the upper extremities (wrist extensors, elbow flexors and abductors of the shoulder) and lower extremities (dorsal ankle flexors, knee extensors, and hip flexors). For each muscle group will be assigned a score between 0 (complete paralysis) and 5 (normal force), and the total score can vary between 0 up to 60 points.</description>

    <description>Sensor-based Training consists of twelve sessions of upper limb training with PABLO®-Tyromotion. For each session the training consists in interactive-games based on virtual reality which allowed a task-oriented approach and a neurocognitive feedback. The exercises require precision tasks and one-dimensional and bidimensional reaction, allowing to train the attention, the strength control and movement control, the coordination and the movement precision. The interactive-games were chosen from those proposed by the Tyromotion PABLO® System.</description>
