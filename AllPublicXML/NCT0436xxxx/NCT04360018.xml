  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      People who binge drink are more likely to have risky sexual encounters, and alcohol changes
      brain activity associated with reward decisions related to those behaviors. Researchers want
      to better understand how alcohol s effects on risky sexual behavior that might lead people to
      contract sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

      Objective:

      To study how alcohol impacts decisions about engaging in risky sex.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 21-65 without alcohol use disorder

      Design:

      Participants will have 2 study visits, 1 month apart. They will arrive and depart via taxi.
      They will consume alcohol at 1 visit, chosen at random.

      At visit 1, participants will answer questions about HIV knowledge, HIV risk behaviors, and
      sexual interests. They will view pictures of clothed people and pick those they might have
      sex with. They will think about the person s risk of having an STD and whether they would use
      a condom during sex.

      At both visits, participants will sit in a bar-like room and have 2 drinks that may contain
      alcohol. Then they will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. For this, they
      will lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal tube. The scanner makes loud noises;
      they will get earplugs. They will complete tasks that include looking at pictures and making
      choices about money.

      At the beginning of both visits the participants will be screened with urine drug test and
      pregnancy test. Duiring each visit the participants breath alcohol will be measured, and they
      will discuss whether they feel intoxicated.

      Participants will get snacks and stay at the clinic for up to 6 hours after the MRIs.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this protocol is to identify the neural substrates by which acute alcohol
      intoxication leads to an increase in HIV risk behavior during sexual encounters. This study
      uses a two-visit alcohol-administration procedure to examine alcohol-induced changes in

      brain activity during decisions about risky sex.

      Study Population:

      Healthy community participants who binge drink occasionally but do not have alcohol use
      disorder.

      Design:

      Participants will complete baseline measures of sexual history and preferences, HIV risk and
      knowledge, and tasks designed to measure delay discounting of protected sex. At the first of
      two visits, subjects will then receive either alcohol or placebo beverages to

      increase their blood alcohol concentration to approximately 0.08g/dl. Then, participants will
      undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a protected sex discounting
      task. At a second visit, participants will receive the opposite type of beverage

      (alcohol or placebo). Participants will be randomly assigned to order of beverages.

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome of this study is changes in neural activity during protect sex
      discounting during the alcohol compared to placebo visits. Behavioral changes (i.e.,
      willingness to engage in unprotected sexual encounters) will also investigated as a primary
      outcome.

    <time_frame>First Task</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will see a picture of one of the individuals selected during the pre-scan PSD procedure. They will also see two choices corresponding to 1) &quot;Sex with this person without a condom NOW&quot; or 2) &quot;Sex with this person with a condom [NOW or delay] . Participants will have 6 seconds to press a button corresponding to their choice. Conditions of interest will vary as follows: choice difficulty- easy (probability of choosing later option &lt;0.33 or &gt;0.67) or hard (probability of choosing alternative option between 0.33 and 0.67); preference now (probability of choosing later option &lt;0.5) or delay (probability of choosing later option &gt;0.5); sexual risk -high (individual most likely to have an STD) or low (individual least likely tohave an STD); and desirability - high (individual you most want to have sex with) or low (individual you least want to have sex with).</description>

    <measure>HIV-Knowledge QuestionnaireHIV-Knowledge Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>First Task</time_frame>
    <description>A 45-question self-report questionnaire that takes approximately 7 minutes to complete. It assesses how much the participant knowsabout how HIV is transmitted and prevented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV Risk-Taking Behavior Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Second Task</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses quantitatively both intravenous drug use and sexual HIV risk behaviors. This includes 11 questions about sharing and cleaning needles, number of sexual partners, condom use, and sex work. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-5 where higher scores indicate moreHIV risk. It takes less than 10 minutes to administer. Scores on this measure will allow us to consider whether performance and neuralcorrelates of the PSD task are related to actual HIV risk behaviors in our sample.</description>

    <measure>HIV and Sexual Behaviors Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Third Task</time_frame>
    <description>Used to collect additional information on HIV risk. This will include such topics as condom attitudes and negotiation, HIV testing andhistory of exposure, sexual activities, partner risk behaviors, and perceived risk. Information from this survey will allow us to consider whether performance and neural correlates of the PSD task are related to actual HIV risk behaviors in our sample.</description>

    <measure>Sexual Desire Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Fourth Task</time_frame>
    <description>This will be used to assess interest in sexual activity. It is a 14-question self-report questionnaire with each question scored on a scale of 0-8, where higher scores reflect more sexual desire. It typically takes less than 10 minutes to complete. Scores on this measure will allow us to consider whether individual differences in thereward value of sexual activity account for differences in performanceand neural correlates of the PSD task.</description>

    <measure>Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding</measure>
    <time_frame>Fifth Task</time_frame>
    <description>This will be used to measure social desirability bias. It is a 40-question self-report questionnaire that measures self-deceptive positivity andimpression management. Number of items with extremely high agreement indicates level of desirable responding. We will use thisto identify participants who may have inaccurately responded to questions about sexual history and HIV risk due to a desire to represent themselves better, and thus, might potentially bias ourresults in some way.</description>

    <measure>Sexual Sensation Seeking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Sixth Task</time_frame>
    <description>This will be used to assess interest in risky sexual activity. It is an 11 question self-report questionnaire with each question scored on ascale of 1-4. Scores on this measure will allow us to consider whether individual differences in the reward value of sexual activity account for differences in performance and neural correlates of the PSD task.</description>

    <measure>Protected Sex Discounting Pre-Scan Portion</measure>
    <time_frame>Seventh Task</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will view 60 cards with an image of a clothed person, spread on a table in front of them so they can all be viewed at the same time. Participants will be instructed to select all the pictures of individuals who they would be willing to have casual sex with based on physical appearance if the circumstances were right. From the pictures of individuals who the participant indicated that they would have sex with, participants will be asked to select 1) the individual most and 2) least likely to have a STD, and 2) the individual they most and 4) least want to have sex with. Then, for each of these pictures, participants will be asked to indicate whether they wouldbe likely to have sex with that person now with or without a condom.</description>

    <description>During scanning, participants will be shown two squares: a &quot;safe&quot; square and a &quot;risk&quot; square. If the participant chooses the &quot;safe&quot; square, they will earn a set amount of money ($0.25); if they choose the &quot;risk&quot; square, they have the possibility of winning up to $5.00 but also the possibility of losing up to $5.00. Across 40 trials, participants will be able to earn between $0 and $35. All events will be shown for 2 seconds with 2, 4, or 6 second jittered intervals between.</description>
