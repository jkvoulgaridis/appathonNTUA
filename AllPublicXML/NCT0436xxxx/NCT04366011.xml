      The aim of the present study is to a) determine the comparative efficacy of the brief
      capnometry-assisted respiratory therapy (CART) and standard cognitive behavioural therapy
      (CBT), and b) to determine moderators and mediators.

      With the data collected from the study, the investigators will test the following hypotheses:
      (a) CART will be as effective in treating PD/A as CBT, albeit in shorter time, b) patients
      with greater respiratory dysregulations, especially hyperventilation, at pretreatment will
      benefit more from CART, whereas patients with greater cognitive dysregulation will benefit
      more from CBT. CART, but not CBT, will result in reversal of hyperventilation.

    <description>CART has four major treatment components: educating patients about the etiology and maintenance of PD according to a hyperventilation centered rationale, directing patients' attention to potentially aberrant respiratory patterns, instructing patients in respiratory control techniques, and instructing patients in home breathing exercises.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A current DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV) diagnosis of panic disorder

             source of current distress

          2. Patients must be willing to engage in exposure to fearful situations and sensations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Diagnostic Exclusion Criteria:

        months)

        Medical exclusion factors:
