  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients awaiting lung transplantation which
      performed a pulmonary rehabilitation program will be analyzed retrospectively. Acute
      exacerbations occur frequently in these patients and have a major impact on the course of the
      disease. This study investigates the prevalence and the impact of acute exacerbations during
      pulmonary Rehabilitation in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      patients awaiting lung Transplantation that continued the Rehabilitation program despite an
      acute exacerbation. Data will be taken from the internal database of the reference center
      (Schoen Klinik Berchtesgadener Land, Schoenau, Germany) where these data were collected
      during clinical routine.
