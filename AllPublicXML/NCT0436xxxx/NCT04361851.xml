  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label study in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory
      multiple myeloma (RRMM) comparing Pembrolizumab (Pembro) in combination with Daratumumab
      (Dara) to the historical control of Daratumumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients who are treated with single agent daratumumab
      have been reported to have median PFS of 4 months. A median PFS of 4 months corresponds to an
      8-month progression-free survival rate of 25% (based on the exponential survival
      distribution). For this population of patients treated with Daratumumab and Pembrolizumab,
      the aim is to improve the 8-month PFS rate to 50%. Thirty-three RRMM patients who have
      received ≥ 3 lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory
      drug (IMiD) will be eligible for enrollment. Sixteen (16) subjects will be enrolled in the
      first stage, and if at least 5 of the 16 patients are alive and progression free at 8 months,
      an additional 17 subjects will be enrolled.
