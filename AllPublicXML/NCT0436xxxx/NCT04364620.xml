      This Phase II study will recruit 40 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed
      treatment with a platinum-containing doublet treatment and an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 immune
      checkpoint antibody, administered simultaneously or sequentially. All recruited patients will
      receive AB-16B5 at a dose of 12 mg/kg once weekly combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75
      mg/m2 once every 3 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase II trial of AB-16B5 in combination with
      docetaxel in previously treated subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have
      experienced disease progression following treatment with a platinum-containing doublet
      treatment and an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint antibody, administered simultaneously or
      sequentially. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in this trial and receive AB-16B5 at
      a dose of 12 mg/kg once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75
      mg/m2 once every 3 weeks on Day 1. One cycle of treatment will consist of 21 days (3 weeks).
      The safety profile of the AB-16B5 and docetaxel combination will be examined during a safety
      lead-in period with the first 8 subjects completing one cycle of treatment. No dose
      escalation will be performed but a decision to de-escalate the AB-16B5 dose could be made
      using the modified toxicity probability interval method.

      Subjects will be evaluated every 6 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess response to
      treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for
      determination of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS).
      Paired tumor biopsies (pre-treatment and on-treatment) will be collected in all subjects.
      Study treatment will continue until there is evidence of disease progression,
      treatment-related adverse events of unacceptable severity, subject request for
      discontinuation or Investigator determination that further treatment is not in the subject's
      best interest. Treatment through progression will be allowed if the Investigator considers
      the subject to be clinically stable. Subjects who must discontinue docetaxel due to toxicity
      will continue on AB-16B5.

             dose of an antineoplastic investigational agent or last use of an investigational
             device with antineoplastic intent.

          -  Subjects who have received any anti-cancer treatment within 3 weeks or radiation
             therapy within 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment or who
             have not recovered from adverse events to Grade 1 or less. Subjects with alopecia are
             eligible to participate.

          -  Subjects who are expected to require any other form of systemic or localized
             antineoplastic therapy while on the trial. This includes maintenance therapy with
             another agent or radiation therapy.

          -  Subjects who are receiving a dose &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) within 7
             days prior to the first dose of study treatment or any other form of immunosuppressive
             medication (corticosteroid pre-treatment and/or post-treatment of docetaxel is
             allowed).

          -  Subjects who require treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole,

             ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole). Subjects may be included if
             there is an alternate treatment with a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor and they are willing to
             change prior to randomization. If the subject agrees to change from a strong inhibitor
             to a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, the strong inhibitor must be stopped at least 7 days prior
             to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Subjects who have another malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Subjects who have known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous

             treatment, if they have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and if they
             are not receiving a dose &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) within 7 days prior
             to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Subjects who have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy or
             laboratory abnormalities that may confound the results of the trial, interfere with
             the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial or if it is not in the
             best interest of the subject to participate in the trial.

          -  Subjects with medical, social or psychosocial factors that, in the opinion of the
             treating Investigator, could impact the safety or compliance with study procedures.
