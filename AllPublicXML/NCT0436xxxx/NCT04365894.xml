  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to determine the effect of the learning method based on
      transformative learning theory to improve sensitivity towards the disabled on the empathic
      tendency, attitude and alexithymia levels of nursing students.

      This randomized, controlled and experimental study was conducted between October and December
      2019. The sample of the study consisted of 70 2nd grade nursing students (34 people in the
      experimental group and 36 in the control group). The learning method based on transformative
      learning theory was applied to the experimental group. The data were collected using a
      demographic information form, the Empathic Tendency Scale, Attitudes Towards Disabled Person
      Scale, and Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The Mann-Whitney U Test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test,
      Paired Sample Test, and Pearson's Chi-Squared Test were used to determine the differences
      between the groups.

    <description>Empathetic tendency was evaluated Empathic Tendency Scale (ETS). ETS developed by Dökmen, aims to measure the potential of people to empathize in daily life. It is a five-point Likert-type scale consisting of 20 items. The responses on this scale range from &quot;completely contradictory&quot; to &quot;completely eligible&quot;. While collecting points, questions 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15 are collected in reverse. The minimum score to be taken from the scale is 20, and the maximum is 100. The total scores refer to the participants' empathic tendency scores. High scores indicate high empathic tendency; low scores indicate that low empathic tendency. In the study where the scale was developed, the reliability coefficient was found to be .91.</description>

    <measure>attitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline attitude skill at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Attitude was evaluated Attitudes Towards Disabled Person Scale (ATDPS). ATDPS was developed by Yuker and Block and adapted to Turkish by Özyürek. The aim of the scale is to measure attitudes towards people who are affected by inadequacy in general, without specifically distinguishing disability groups. This 6-point Likert-type scale consists of 20 items, which are graded as follows: &quot;I totally agree (+3), I agree (+2), I somewhat agree (+1), I somewhat disagree (-1), I disagree (-2), I strongly disagree (-3)&quot;. Items 2, 5, 6, 11 and 12 are inverted. The sum of the points of all items is calculated, and the sign of the total score of the scale is reversed, and 60 is added to the obtained score. As a result of this calculation, the scores that can be obtained from the scale vary between 0 and 120. High scores express positive attitudes towards individuals with disabilities, and low scores mean negative attitudes.</description>

    <measure>alexithymia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Alexithymia skill at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alexithymia was evaluated Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). This is a 20-question scale developed by Bagby et al. TAS-20 Turkish validity and reliability analyzes were performed by Gulec et al. The scale is a 5-point Likert-type measurement tool, and individuals are asked to mark the most appropriate options among &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Often&quot; and &quot;Always&quot;. Three sub-dimensions of the scale are difficulty identifying feelings (7 items), difficulty describing feelings (5 items) and externally oriented thinking (8 items). The reliability coefficients of the subscales are 0.82, 0.75 and 0.72, respectively. The scoring is done by summing up the points of the items. Five of these items (items 4, 5, 10, 18 and 19) are reversed. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 20, and the highest score is 100. High scores indicate high alexithymia levels.</description>
