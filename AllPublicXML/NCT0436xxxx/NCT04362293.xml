  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test a transplant method that may have fewer side effects (or
      less toxic, less harmful) than conventional high dose chemotherapy conditioning-based
      transplants for children and young adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Patients less than
      or equal to 25 years old with SCD who would likely benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) will be included in this study. Patients with a suitable HLA matched
      sibling donor (MSD) will be enrolled on the MSD arm while patients without an eligible MSD
      who have a suitable haploidentical (HAPLO) donor available will be enrolled on the HAPLO arm
      of the study.

      Primary Objective

      To assess the donor T-cell chimerism at 1-year post transplant in each respective arm (MSD,
      HAPLO) of the trial.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Assess the overall survival and 1-year, 2-year and 3-year post-transplant graft versus
           host disease (GVHD)-free SCD-free survival.

        -  Estimate the primary and secondary graft rejection rate at 1-year, 2-year and 3-year
           post- transplant.

        -  Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).

        -  Estimate the incidence of SCD recurrence after transplant

        -  Assess the neutrophil and platelet recovery kinetics post-transplant.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative
           lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis, V-beta
           spectratyping, and lymphocyte phenotype and function.

        -  Conduct longitudinal examination of impact of HCT on patient health-related quality of
           life (HRQL) and adjustment, and parental adjustment.

        -  Examine impact of HCT on patient cognitive and academic function.

        -  Determine factors that influenced the decision to undergo HCT, explore perceptions of
           the HCT experience, and assess decisional satisfaction/regret.

        -  Develop and evaluate an objective/quantitative imaging biomarker to assess organ (liver
           and heart) function/disease status and changes following HCT.

        -  Develop and evaluate an objective/quantitative imaging biomarker to determine cerebral
           blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction following HCT.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center phase II study of a reduced intensity conditioning based
      hematopoietic cell transplant for patients with sickle cell disease. In this study, patients
      with SCD who would be expected to benefit from an allogeneic HCT will receive an
      unmanipulated peripheral blood derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) graft
      from either an MSD or HAPLO donor after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen comprising
      of alemtuzumab, thiotepa and low dose total body irradiation. All patients will receive a
      pre-conditioning phase comprising of hydroxyurea and azathioprine to reduce the risk of graft
      rejection. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of sirolimus. Patients on the HAPLO arm will also
      receive two doses of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. All patients will receive regularly
      scheduled low dose donor lymphocyte infusions till donor lymphocyte chimerism reaches at
      least 90% donor. The main objective of this study is to improve graft function and immune
      reconstitution after a reduced intensity conditioning based transplant.

             (MFI) is &gt;1000 for donor specific antibody to HLA-A, -B, and DRB1 and MFI &gt;2000 for
             HLA-C, DQB1 and DPB1. Patients with borderline elevated anti-donor specific HLA
