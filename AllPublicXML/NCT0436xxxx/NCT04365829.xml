    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the tolerance of the virtual environment in the
      elderly living in a nursing home (EHPAD). It will be evaluated by the cybersickness
      collection after each session (1 session every other day for a total of 3 sessions).

      The purpose of this muliticentric, interventional, uncontrolled study is to assess the
      tolerance of the virtual environment in the elderly living in a nursing home

      subjects who fulfil the inclusion criteria and after signing the informed consent will
      benefit from three individual virtual reality (VR) sessions.

      The sessions will be performed out with one day apart

      An assessment of anxiety trait and well-being of each subject will be performed before the
      first session (D1) and after the third (D3).

      An assessment of anxiety as a condition will be performed before and after each session.

      Heart rate and blood pressure measurements will be made before, during and after each
      session.

      At the end of each session, an evaluation of cybersickness will be performed. Feedback on the
      acceptability of the experience will be provided at the end of each session.

      Each session will last 1 hour in total: the person will visualize a single scene of virtual
      reality presenting a natural environment of a duration of 7 minutes preceded by a time of
      introduction, evaluation and followed by a time dedicated to evaluations and maintenance.
