  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 subjects in first in woman trial with ethics committee oversight. Women who developed
      postpartum hemorrhage were treated with the InPress Device. The intent of treatment was to
      quickly reduce or stop blood flow by addressing the driving cause of hemorrhage: uterine
      atony.

      The primary objective is to verify the safety of the InPress Device in humans, including: 1.
      Absence of SAEs related to the use of the InPress Device intra- and post-procedure. 2.
      Evaluate any observable damage of the uterus, cervix, or vagina due to the use of the InPress
      Device. 3. Evaluate occurrence of uterine inversion or folding during the use of the InPress
      Device.

      The secondary objectives include evaluations of: 1. Ability to easily place the InPress
      Device transvaginally. 2. Ability to connect the InPress Device to vacuum and maintain
      desired negative pressure. 3. Ability of InPress Device to contract the uterus to a level
      that reduces or stops blood loss and avoids further surgical intervention. 4. Evaluate time
      from insertion and start negative pressure to visible reduction of blood loss.
