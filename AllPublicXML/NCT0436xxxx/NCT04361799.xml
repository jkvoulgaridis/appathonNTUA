  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes and hyperglycaemia in surgical patients is rising and associated
      with grater complication rates, length of stay and mortality rates. Suboptimal glucose
      management in the perioperative setting remains a major barrier to optimal surgical care.
      While there are guidelines to manage perioperative diabetes care, implementation is
      challenging and inconsistent, in part due to a stretched workforce, involvement of several
      disciplines and clinical teams and shortcomings in clinical training and knowledge.
      Closed-loop glucose control represents an emerging diabetes treatment modality that
      autonomously adjusts insulin delivery according to continuously measured glucose levels. The
      use of fully automated closed-loop insulin delivery may represent an easy-to-adopt approach
      for safe and effective perioperative diabetes management.
