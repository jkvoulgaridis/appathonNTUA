          -  Subject who has systemic sclerosis accompanied by moderate to severe skin thickening
             with an mRSS of 10 to &lt;30 at the pre-examination and who has progressing skin
             thickening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any of the following significant concomitant diseases:
