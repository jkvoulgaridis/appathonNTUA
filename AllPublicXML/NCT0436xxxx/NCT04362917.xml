  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the valuable information derived from older studies evaluating type 1 diabetes, the
      diabetes research community has, in large part, overlooked potential contributions of
      baseline abnormalities in β cell function to T1D development. Newer studies focusing on
      higher risk individuals often exclude family members without evidence of positive islet
      autoantibodies. New technologies to assay alternative biomarkers of β cell stress and death
      remain incompletely explored in both Ab negative and Ab positive family members of T1D
      patients. Specifically, modern biomarkers of β cell dysfunction have not been rigorously
      tested in combination with metabolic testing to fully understand their association with
      insulin secretion.

      The investigator's working hypothesis is that individuals at genetic risk for T1D exhibit
      baseline β cell dysfunction, even before development of detectable islet autoimmunity
      (seropositivity for islet Abs).

    <description>Our primary outcome is to assess if there is a difference in first phase beta call function in those genetically at risk for developing type 1 diabetes (first degree relatives) but who are islet autoantibody negative versus healthy controls with no family history of type 1 diabetes.
We will calculate the first phase beta cell function by multiplying the acute c-peptide response to glucose (ACPRg) (nmol/L) by the insulin sensitivity (M/I) (x10-5 mmol/kg/min per pmol/L)</description>

    <description>Adults with a first degree relative with T1D, who have tested negative for islet autoantibodies.
There is no intervention. Each group will get a MMTT and a clamp to evaluate beta cell function, identify elevations in circulating biomarkers of β cell stress or death, as well as their associations with measures of β cell function, and compare advantages of hyperglycemic clamps in identifying β cell dysfunction in this setting, relative to the mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). They will repeat both the MMTT and the clamp once, to assess inter-test variability.</description>
