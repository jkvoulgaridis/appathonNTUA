      The Phase I study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalating. There
      will be 3 dose cohorts, 4 (up to 8) subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 (GM-XANTHO to
      placebo) ratio in each cohort.The total study will take at least 23 days, conducted in
      National Taiwan University Hospital with 2-24 healthy subjects being enrolled.The Phase IIa
      study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel. 2:1 ratio for GM-XANTHO to
      placebo control. The total study will take at least 43 days, conducted in National Taiwan
