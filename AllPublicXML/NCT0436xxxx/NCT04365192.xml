  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices with noninflatable cuff have advantages in omitting the cuff
      pressure monitoring and reducing potential pharyngolaryngeal complications. Typical devices
      without cuff inflation available are the i‐gel™ and the self‐pressurized air‐Q™ intubating
      laryngeal airway (air‐Q SP).

      The i-gel airway is a supraglottic airway management device made of thermoplastic elastomer,
      which is soft, gel-like, and transparent. It was designed to create a noninflating anatomical
      seal of the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and perilaryngeal structures while avoiding the
      compression trauma that can occur with inflatable SADs.

      The i-gel has evolved as a device that accurately positions itself over the laryngeal
      framework, providing a reliable perilaryngeal seal, and therefore no cuff inflation is
      necessary. Its advantages include easier insertion, minimal risk for tissue compression, and
      stability after insertion.

      The air-Q is a new SAD intended for use as a primary airway and an aid for tracheal
      intubation in situations of anticipated or unanticipated difficult airways. The intracuff
      pressure of air-Q dynamically equilibrates with the airway pressure and adjusts to the
      patient's pharyngeal and periglottic anatomy, potentially providing improved airway fit and
      seal.

      The anatomical and physiological changes that accompany ageing may have a significant
      influence on the efficacy and safety of SADs. The distinctive features of the air‐Q SP and
      i-gel may lead to a substantial difference in performance in the elderly, and it is planned a
      head-to-head comparison of these two devices in patients aged between 65 and 85 years.
