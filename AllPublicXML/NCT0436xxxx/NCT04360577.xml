    <textblock>
      In the investigator's pilot study(NCT 03753399), a trend of improvement of quality of life,
      as well as release of symptoms, in gastric patients in acupuncture groups was indicated. This
      study will evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture on QoL in gastric cancer patients undergoing
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with more samples. Enrolled participates will randomly
      receive high-dose acupuncture, low-dose acupuncture or non-acupuncture during the first 3
      cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy after resection.

    <time_frame>At the end of Cycle 3 ( 21 days for one cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-Gastric Scoring is designed for measurement of quality of life(QoL) for gastric cancer patients. FACT-Gastric TOI is composed of PHYSICAL WELL BEING (PWB) SUBSCALE, FUNCTIONAL WELL BEING (FWB) SUBSCALE, and GASTRIC CANCER SUBSCAL (GaCS) of the FACT-Gastric Scoring. The range of FACT-Gastric TOI is 0-132. The higher the score, the better the quality of life. TOI for each patient will be recorded at baseline and once a week during the 3 cycles of chemotherapy (21 days for one cycle). The area under curve (AUCs) for each week are calculated by linear interpolation respectively, and then added together for the total AUC during the 3 cycles of chemotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Total AUC of Modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of Cycle 3 ( 21 days for one cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS) is a questionnaire used for symptom assessment in cancer patients. It was composed of 10 items with score range of 0-10 for each item, including pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing, shortness of breath, and other. ESAS was then modified in 2015, with additional symptoms of constipation and sleep. The higher the score, the worse the symptom is. ESAS scoring for each patient will be recorded everyday in the first week, and then once a week in the next 2 weeks during each cycle of chemotherapy (21 days for 1 cycle). The AUCs are calculated by linear interpolation respectively, and then added together for the total AUC during the 3 cycles of chemotherapy.</description>
