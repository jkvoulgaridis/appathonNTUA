  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b study of NEROFE following a traditional 3+3 design to assess
      safety and to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NEROFE in patients with MDS or
      AML. IV NEROFE will be administered three times per week on alternate days. The exact dosage
      will be determined using the body surface area (BSA) measured on Day 1 of each cycle.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NEROFE monotherapy may be administered for a maximum of 12 cycles provided that the patient
      tolerates treatment and there is evidence of clinical benefit. If patients are receiving
      clinical benefit, they may continue past 12 cycles.

      Patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of NEROFE monotherapy.

      After this 30 day period, patients will only be followed for the resolution of any ongoing
      adverse events.

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of one of the following:

               1. Relapsed/refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) where no alternative life
                  prolonging therapy exists. Adverse genetic risk treatment na√Øve patients may also
                  be considered eligible if, in the opinion of the investigator, these patients are
                  unlikely to benefit from alternative therapy (e.g., an older patient with adverse
                  risk MDS who progresses to AML after failing treatment for MDS (i.e.
                  hypomethylating agent (HMA) or HMA and Venetoclax and is not a candidate for
                  traditional AML induction chemotherapy).

               2. Relapsed/refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) those who fail to achieve a
                  complete remission (CR) with at least 4 cycles of HMA (e.g. decitabine or
                  azacitidine); or those who have progressive disease or have intolerance of HMA
                  therapy after at least 2 cycles. Intolerance to HMA includes those patients
                  forced to stop the HMA after at least 2 cycles due to severe infections/worsening
                  cytopenias and are otherwise considered eligible. Patients with MDS have to have
                  intermediate, high, or very high risk disease by International Prognostic Scoring
                  System - Revised (IPSS-R score).

          2. Adult male or female patients 18 years of age or older.

                  Renal Disease) method.

               5. White blood cell count (WBC) &lt; 25,000/uL before the administration of NEROFE on
                  Cycle 1 Day 1. Use of hydroxyurea to control the level of circulating leukemic
                  blast cell counts is allowed before and during the study.
