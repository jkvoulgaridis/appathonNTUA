  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center, superiority study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JointStem, autologous adipose tissue derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC), in patients diagnosed as knee osteoarthritis. Following a
      2-week screening period, approximately 130 subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the
      following two arms in a 1:1 ratio (1 JointStem : 1 Placebo). After each subject completes
      48-Weeks visit (Visit 7) and the data management team confirms all individual data have no
      issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the
      statistical analysis.
