  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris (AV) is a common inflammatory condition involving pilosebaceous unit. The
      pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and skin microbiome is considered to be one of the key
      factors that aggravate inflammation. Malassezia spp is normal flora on the skin and several
      studies have reported its corelation with inflammatory AV lesion.

      Malassezia have higher lipase activity compared to Propionibacterium acnes which triggers an
      increase in free fatty acid and glycerol, the chemotactic factors towards neutrophils and
      inducing inflammation in AV. Malassezia folliculitis (MF) is sometimes confused with and may
      present together with AV. Pruritus usually presents in MF but some studies also reported
      itching as common symptom in AV.

      The objectives of this study were to identify the presence and the distribution of Malassezia
      spp. in facial AV lesions, to compare the distribution of Malassezia spp. between
      inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions and to identify the association between Malassezia
      spp in acne lesions and pruritus symptom.

      This study used cross sectional design study.

      Subjects with eligible criteria were included. Subjects were divided into subjects with
      inflammatory lesions and subjects with non inflammatory lesions.

      Physical examination consisted of assesment of AV severity (using Lehman criteria) and
      presence of pruritus based on visual analog scale. Clinical documetations were taken.

      Follicular content of four inflammatory lesions or four non inflammatory lesions were
      collected for microscopic examination with KOH solution and fungal culture examination (using
      CHROMagar Malassezia, Dextrose Saboraud agar (DSA), and Tween 60-esculin agar).

      The presence of Malassezia spp and its spore load in both groups were assesed and analyzed
      for its corelation with AV severity and presence of pruritus.
