    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
      for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy, often called
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Peripheral neuropathy refers to the
      conditions that result when nerves that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord
      from and to the rest of the body are damaged or diseased. The TENS device emits high
      frequency electrical stimulation through the skin and may provide relief from chronic pain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Obtain efficacy estimates of daily TENS on CIPN (European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer-CIPN20 [EORTC-CIPN20]) to inform the design of a phase III confirmatory
      trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain efficacy estimates of TENS on individual CIPN symptoms (i.e., hot/burning pain,
      sharp/shooting pain, tingling, numbness, cramping (measured daily via 0 - 10 numeric rating
      scale [NRS]).

      II. Evaluate the feasibility of conducting, within the University of Rochester Cancer Center
      (URCC) National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) network, a
      multisite, modified double-blind randomized control trial (RCT) of TENS for CIPN with
      physiologic assessments of descending inhibition (i.e., conditioned pain modulation [CPM]
      test) by assessing the proportions of (a) screened patients who enroll, (b) randomized
      participants who adhere to the treatment and complete the primary assessment, and (c)
      randomized participants who complete the CPM test.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Investigate the potential effects of TENS on balance, physical function, descending
      inhibition, lower limb sensation, and anxiety and depression.

      II. Establish data to support the construct validity of the Treatment-Induced Neuropathy
      Assessment Scale (TNAS) and CIPN symptom inventory daily diary by comparison to the
      EORTC-CIPN20, which is the most commonly used measure of CIPN.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients wear an active wireless TENS device 5 hours daily for up to 6 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients wear a placebo wireless TENS device 5 hours daily for up to 6 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.
