  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to investigate the different types of immune cells found
      in the blood of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and healthy donors. We know
      that the amount of fat on the surface of immune cells is an important factor controlling
      their behaviour. Immune cells from SLE patients are defective and this is associated with
      changes in the levels of fat on these cells. This project will investigate the level of fat
      in the blood and on immune cells from patients with SLE and age matched healthy controls, and
      measure how changes in the amount of fat can affect the way immune cells behave.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accelerated atherosclerosis is a serious complication of autoimmunity including patients with
      both adult and juvenile onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This suggests that defects
      in fat levels could contribute to disease pathogenesis. The immune system in patients with
      SLE does not work normally. In adult patients with SLE we know that many of the immune cells
      involved in protecting the body from infections or cancer are over-active and actually cause
      disease. In young people the immune system is still developing and very little is known about
      what goes wrong in patients that develop juvenile-onset SLE, whether this is the same as
      adult disease and whether the same treatments are relevant for this group of patients. This
      project aims to find out whether immune cells from SLE patients with adult-onset disease have
      the same defects as adult patients with juvenile-onset SLE. We know that an important factor
      that controls immune cell behaviour is the amount of fat that they have on their surface. We
      also know that a change in fat on immune cells from adult patients with SLE makes them
      defective. This project will investigate the level of fat in the blood and in immune cells
      from adult patients with juvenile-onset SLE and age matched healthy controls, and measure how
      changes in the amount of fat can affect the way immune cells behave. We will investigate how
      drugs that control fat levels can help to normalize the behaviour of immune cells from SLE
      patients.

        Patients will be approached by the consultant rheumatologist when the patient is attending
        their normal outpatient clinic appointment.

        Healthy donors will be approached in a similar way using information flyers, invitation
        letters and participant information sheets by a member of the research team.

        Healthy volunteers from UCL staff will be made aware of the study and also asked to
        participate.
