  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate if the effectiveness of desvenlafaxine
      succinate sustained-release tablet (50 mg/day) used for 8 weeks is not inferior to duloxetine
      hydrochloride enteric-coated capsule (60 mg/day) in adult patients with major depressive
      disorder.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study to evaluate if the effectiveness of desvenlafaxine succinate
      sustained-release tablet (50 mg/day) used for 8 weeks is not inferior to duloxetine
      hydrochloride enteric-coated capsule (60 mg/day) in adult patients with major depressive
      disorder. A total of 400 subjects will be randomly allocated to experimental arm
      (desvenlafaxine succinate sustained-release tablet) and active comparator arm (duloxetine
      hydrochloride enteric-coated capsule) in a 1:1 ratio.

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item Total Score (HAM-D17) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. Change from baseline: score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item (HAM-D17) Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item (HAM-D17) Remission Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. Remission is defined as a Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score of ≤ 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a clinician-administered scale which consists of 14 items, each rated on a five point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe). The highest possible score is 56, which represents the most severe form of anxiety; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I): 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Higher score = worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Score (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Severity Score (CGI-S): 7-point clinician rated scale to assess severity of participant's current illness state; range: 1 (normal - not ill at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). Higher score = worse state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The pain level was assessed with the Visual Analog Scale, which consists of a horizontal line of 10 cm in length. For pain level assessment, &quot;0&quot; defines &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; defines &quot;unbearable pain''. The participants are asked to mark the intensity of their pain level.</description>
