      This is an observational study of doctors working in high-risk COVID-19 clinical areas,
      monitoring heart rate, sleep and temperature, correlating with daily self-reported symptoms
      to develop an algorithm for early detection of COVID-19 in doctors

    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 Pandemic, doctors and other healthcare workers who work in COVID+ wards,
      intensive care unit and the accident and emergency department are at high risk of developing
      COVID-19 infection. In April 2020, 14.6% of doctors were off sick with suspected or confirmed
      COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, 17.9% of COVID+ patients are thought to be asymptomatic.
      Therefore, healthcare workers are also high-risk of spreading infection to patients,
      colleagues and their families. This is an observational study that leverages wearable medical
      device technology and data analytics to develop an algorithm for early detection of COVID-19
      infection in doctors. The wearable medical device is a smart watch that monitors temperature,
      heart rate and sleep. Participants will also be asked daily-self reported symptoms. A total
      of 30 healthy doctors who work in high-risk areas will be included. The study is due to last
      for one month.
