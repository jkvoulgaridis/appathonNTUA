  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to utilise ultrasound, using an established method for detecting
      NAFLD, to determine whether the presence of NAFLD in women with GDM, detected during routine
      scanning, is a marker of deterioration in glycaemic status post-partum. We propose to assess
      the relationship between NAFLD and surrogates for insulin resistance as well as glycaemic
      status, insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function, after delivery.

      The study is not seeking to compare the incidence of T2DM between those with and without
      NAFLD. This would require a longer follow-up and larger cohort size. Instead, it aims to
      quantify the degree of early deterioration of glycaemic status in these groups using insulin
      resistance markers. This is a clinically important issue as a greater level of insulin
      resistance would in itself trigger clinical intervention, including vigilant follow-up and
      empowerment for proactive healthy life style changes, which have been shown to prevent
      diabetes development .

    <description>On attendance to antenatal clinic with confirmed diagnosis of gestational diabetes based on OGTT and following informed consent: Ultrasound scan: Those with positive OGTT results (i.e. GDM positive) will attend an appointment for an ultrasound scan, as per routine practice. These women will,at that appointment, be assessed for presence/absence of NAFLD as well as undergoing their routine foetal assessment. This is a simple addendum to the existing scan, taking no more than 5 minutes. Participants will have been informed during the consent process that the results (regarding the presence / absence of NAFLD) will be compared to MRI after delivery.</description>
