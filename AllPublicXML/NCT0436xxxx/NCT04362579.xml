      Percent agreement of vital signs monitoring between the experimental sensor and standard of
      care monitoring

      The primary objective of the Prentice study is to assess and validate EMG performance of the
      new home-use sensor with extended battery life in detecting continuous EHG in a range of
      uterine contraction intensities, frequencies, and durations compared to gold-standard
      FDA-cleared tocodynamometer (GE Corometrics 250cx) in non-stress testing for antepartum
      surveillance.

      An &quot;at-home&quot; study will validate the developed modifications to the wearable sensors system
      that provides a continuous electrohysterography (EHG) along with other additional
      physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep quality, physical
      activity, and continuous blood pressure) for longitudinal monitoring in the home setting.
