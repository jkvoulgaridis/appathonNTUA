  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the
      fixed combination of pyronaridine artesunate (180:60 mg) with that of standard chloroquine
      therapy in children and adults with acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria

    <textblock>
      This Phase III study was designed to meet regulatory requirements for registration of
      pyronaridine artesunate in Korea. A comparative study was implemented using chloroquine as a
      comparator. The comparator in this study, chloroquine, is recognized as an effective and
      well-tolerated anti-malarial therapy, and is standard blood-stage therapy for subjects with
      P. vivax malaria in Korea. It was anticipated that the study results would be pooled with the
      results of study SP-C-006-06 entitled &quot;A Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, comparative clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose
      formulation of oral pyronaridine artesunate (180:60 mg tablet) versus chloroquine (155 mg
      tablet), in children and adult patients with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria&quot; for a formal
      non-inferiority analysis.
