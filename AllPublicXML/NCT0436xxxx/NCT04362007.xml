      Phase 1 (dose-escalation part): Investigate the tolerability and safety of ASTX660 in
      patients with r/r PTCL and r/r CTCL and determine the recommended dose (RD) for the Phase 2.

      Phase 1 (ATLL expansion part): Evaluate the safety of ASTX660 at RD in patients with r/r
      ATLL.

      Phase 2 : Evaluate the efficacy of ASTX660 at RD in patients with r/r PTCL.
