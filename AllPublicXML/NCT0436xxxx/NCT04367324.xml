  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on
      postoperative pain provoked by thermal stimulation in direct pulp capping. All the patients
      who received consent form in this retrospective study were retrieved from the records of
      patients attended for routine dental treatment at the Ordu University, Faculty of Dentistry,
      Department of Endodontics between 01.10.2017-01.10.2018. Study subjects were recruited from
      the pool of patients who performed direct pulp capping by a single operator. A total of 123
      pre-treated teeth of 123 patients who referred to Ordu University, Faculty of Dentistry were
      examined. Follow-up examinations were carried out at postoperative 6th hours, 1st and 7th
      days with visual analog scale (VAS), and treatment outcome were assessed. Participants were
      allocated to the laser and control group which consist of 42 patients in each group. 6
      patients were excluded from the study due to missing data in both groups. Thus, data from 72
      patients who had been carried out direct pulp capping were assessed.

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative sensitivity was assessed and documented via a visual analog scale. The visual analog scale consists of a 100 mm line which is represented at one end by a sign 'no pain' and at the other end 'unbearable pain'. This form was given to each patient and instructed to mark at home according to the pain intensity at 6th hours. Also, patients were seen 1 and 7 days postoperatively to mark the degree of pain on the visual analog scale. Patients were informed that the marking must be performed only when sensitivity induced by the cold stimulus. On a visual analog scale named postoperative sensitivity scale, '0' presents the minimum value and '10' presents the maximum value. High scores indicate a worse result, while low scores indicate a better result. Lower sensitivity was detected on the visual analog scale at 7th days in the low-level laser therapy group compared to the control group.</description>

        All the participants in this study were retrieved from the pool of patients who attended
        for routine treatment at the Department of Endodontics at the University Hospital of Ordu
        between October 2017 and October 2018. Those patients who had received DPC treatment by a
        single operator were selected.
