  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to investigate effect of Digitally Supported Home
      Exercises (DSHE) in different groups for which digitally supported interventions could be
      beneficial. Balance is altered in individuals with low back pain and requires intervention
      Thus, the investigators will focus on the effect of DSHE to improve postural balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to investigate whether a digitally supported exercise program can
      improve the balance of people with non-specific lower back pain. During the exercise program,
      a computer game at home is controlled with the help of sensors attached to the body. Second
      aim is to record the daily activities of the participants and compare them with the back
      pain.

      The 120 participants in this study will be divided into four groups (A, B, C and D). In
      groups A and B 20 patients are included who are in treatment for chronic back pain and
      receive Medical Training Therapy (MTT). For groups C and D the investigators will invite each
      40 participants who have back pain but are not in treatment for their back pain. Only
      participants in groups A and C receive the digitally supported home exercise program. Who
      gets the training program is randomized using stratified block randomization.

      The balance of all participants is measured four times. Between the 2nd and 3rd measurement
      the digitally supported exercise program is carried out. Between the 3rd and 4th assessement,
      participants in group A and C can exercise as much as they wish. The person who carries out
      the balance tests will not be informed which participant is in which group.

    <description>Change of postural sway in anterior- posterior direction. Larger sway indicates worse balance. During each visit, 4 assessment repetitions of each 120 seconds are performed.</description>

    <description>Lumbar spine and hip angles during task performance. Larger lumbar spine angles describe worse performance. Performance is assessed during a box lifting task and a waiter's bow task. At each assessment visit 5 repetitions of each task are performed.</description>

    <description>The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) is used to assess disability. Scores range from 0 to 24, with a value of 24 indicating higher disability</description>

    <description>The short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WOOQOL-BREF) is used to assess quality of Life. The scale has 4 subscales (raw scores range from 7 to 35, 6 to 30, 3 to 15 and 8 to 38). Larger values describe the better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Ratings of six movements (forward bending, backward bending, sideways bending, rotating, lifting a box, stretching upward) on each how painful or harmful a movement is and how careful a person is when executing the movement. Ratings range from 0 to 100. Large numbers indicate higher painfulness, fearfulness or caution when executing each movement.</description>
