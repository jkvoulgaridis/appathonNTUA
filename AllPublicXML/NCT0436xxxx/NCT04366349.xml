  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3772847, an anti-interleukin (IL) 33-receptor monoclonal antibody, is a novel treatment
      for asthma. The purpose of this study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK and PD of
      single ascending doses of GSK3772847 administered subcutaneously (SC) to healthy
      participants. This study will also establish the bioavailability of SC formulation and
      evaluate the safety in particular injection site tolerability of route. Participants will
      either receive a single dose of 70 milligram (mg) GSK3772847 or placebo in (Cohort 1) and 140
      mg GSK3772847 or placebo in Cohorts 2, 3 (Japanese participants) and 4 (Chinese
      participants). The site of injection will be upper arm; abdomen or thigh for cohorts 1 and 2
      with cohorts 3 and 4 will receive injections in the upper arm only. Approximately, the total
      duration of study will be up to 89 days.

             listed in the exclusion criteria that is outside the reference range for the
             population being studied may be included only if the investigator, in consultation
             with the Medical Monitor (if required), agree and document that the finding is
             unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures or results.
