  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For Phase 1 only. Additional information will be provided if Phase 2 is implemented.
      2019nCoV-101 is a 2-part, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 trial
      designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of SARS-CoV-2 rS nanoparticle vaccine with
      or without Matrix-M adjuvant in healthy participants ≥ 18 to 59 (inclusive) years of age. The
      study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, at least 1 and up to two SARS-CoV-2 rS
      constructs will be evaluated in up to 2 cohorts, which may be enrolled in parallel. An
      interim analysis of Part 1 safety and immunogenicity data will be performed prior to an
      optional expansion to Part 2.

             at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Currently working in an occupation with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (eg,
             healthcare worker, emergency response personnel).

          -  Known disturbance of coagulation (iatrogenic or congenital). NOTE: The use of ≤325 mg
             of aspirin per day as prophylaxis is permitted, but the use of other platelet
             aggregation inhibitors, thrombin inhibitors, Factor Xa inhibitors, or warfarin
             derivatives is exclusionary, regardless of bleeding history, because these imply

             exception of adequately treated non-melanomatous skin carcinoma, at the discretion of
             the investigator)

          -  Vital sign (blood pressure, pulse, temperature) abnormalities of toxicity grade &gt;1

          -  Clinical laboratory abnormalities of toxicity grade &gt;1 for selected serum chemistry
             and hematology parameters

          -  Any known allergies to products contained in the investigational product or latex
             allergy.

          -  Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who plan to become pregnant during the study.

          -  History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction within one year prior to the first study
             vaccination.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to
             the subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the study vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).

          -  Study team member or first-degree relative of any study team member (inclusive of
             sponsor, PPD, and site personnel involved in the study).
