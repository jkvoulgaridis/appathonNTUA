  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized pilot study to evaluate safety and efficacy endpoints for treatment of
      para-hisian accessory pathways according to two different strategies of lesion formation.

      These patients will be divided into 2 groups with different strategies of treatment: group 1
      treated with radiofrequency (RF) ablation, group 2 with cryotherapy (CRYO).

      The primary outcome will be the recurrence rate of accessory pathway conduction after six
      months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints will be immediate success and rate of permanent
      atrioventricular (AV) block.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study on the safety and efficacy for percutaneous ablation of
      para-hisian accessory pathways according to two different modalities: radiofrequency (RF) of
      cryotherapy.

      Forty patients with symptomatic or high-risk para-hisian accessory pathways, documented by
      previous electrophysiological study (EPS), referred to percutaneous catheter ablation, will
      be enrolled in this trial.

      After informed consent, these patients will be randomized in 2 groups with different current
      established strategies of invasive treatment. Group I: electrophysiological mapping and
      ablation with radiofrequency (RF) focal lesion formation.

      Group II: electrophysiological mapping and ablation with cryotherapy (CRYO) focal lesion
      formation.

      The primary outcome will be the recurrence rate of accessory pathway conduction after six
      months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints will be immediate success and rate of permanent
      atrioventricular (AV) block.
