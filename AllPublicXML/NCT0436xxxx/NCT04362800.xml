  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the urgent priorities in the field of pediatric neuro-rehabilitation is the
      development of efficient early motor interventions for children with cerebral palsy (CP).
      Animal studies suggest that early intensive interventions are likely to have a significant
      impact on the organization of the brain and corticospinal tracts, reducing motor impairments
      and their medium and long-term consequences in children with cerebral palsy. Although most of
      the growth, development and cortical organization takes place in the time course of the first
      2 years of life, most studies investigating the effectiveness of intensive rehabilitation and
      associated neurophysiological mechanisms have been conducted in school-aged children (&gt; 6
      years). In addition, the vast majority of these studies were conducted in children with
      unilateral CP, while the bilateral form of the pathology has the highest prevalence. It is
      therefore a priority to investigate the effectiveness of early interventions on the overall
      motor function of children with CP, especially in children with bilateral form of CP.

      Hand and Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy Including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE) makes it
      possible to apply the concepts of structured motor learning and intensive treatment to both
      the upper limbs and the lower limbs and demonstrated improvements at both levels in
      school-aged children with unilateral CP and bilateral and then at all three International
      Classification of Functioning and Disability levels. The principles and content of HABIT-ILE
      can be applied to pre-school children and this method is promising for early
      neuro-rehabilitation.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of 10 days (i.e. 50 hours) of
      early HABIT-ILE (HABIT-ILE) on the overall motor function of children aged 1 to 4 with
      bilateral cerebral palsy in comparison to 10 days (50h) of spontaneous overall motor activity
      including usual rehabilitation (control group).
