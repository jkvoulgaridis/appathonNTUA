  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: A significant increase in the risk of injury and illness at work has been
      associated with fatigue, stress, haste, distraction, emergency situations, excessive noise,
      complex procedures and anger among other factors.

      Most of these factors are related to the lack of attention to work in progress, which can be
      improved by training attention and awareness during daily activities, as it would encourage a
      resumption of focus on the task at hand and the possible risks associated with it. . The
      primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effects of training to increase
      attention and awareness for daily activities - FoCo - outlined for healthcare professionals
      in their work schedule. Method: Health professionals from 18 to 60 years of age, of both
      sexes, will participate in the study, working in 3 units, one in the care of patients in a
      Emergency Care Unit (UPA), in an Elderly Residential and in a Center. Intensive Care (ICU).
      In the UPA will be included 25 professionals in group A and 25 in group B; In the Residential
      of Elderly, 40 professionals will be included in group A and 40 professionals in group B; In
      the ICU will be included 30 professionals in group A and 30 in group B. They will be
      randomized in both groups. Group A will receive training in the FoCo program and group B will
      be a waiting group. After a period of one month, group B will receive training in FoCo and
      group A will be instructed to continue on their own to apply FoCo in their daily lives
      (Fig.1). Participants will be evaluated before, after one month and after two months.
      Expected Outcomes: After training, an increase in mindful, attention and awareness scale,
      self-compassion scale, positive affect, speed of digit and symbol test is expected. It is
      also expected to reduce negative affects, perceived stress and an increased perception of
      possible incidents.
