  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corticotherapy is widely used in auto-immune diseases. If induced immunosuppression by
      corticosteroids is well admitted, it's currently not possible to determine individual risk of
      infection. Thus, the development of new biomarkers able to reflect immunological status under
      immunosuppressive treatments is needed. It would help identifying patients who would benefit
      from adapted treatment protocols or infectious prophylaxis. In this field, the mHLA-DR
      (monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR) has shown encouraging results. However, it has never
      been used in patients treated by immunosuppressive therapies. The investigators aim to
      describe changes induced by corticosteroids in mHLA-DR expression in vivo. To achieve this
      goal, the investigators will measure mHLA-DR before treatment, after 1 months, 3 months and 6
      months of treatment. Finally, the investigators will look for correlation between the level
      of expression of mHLA-DR and the cumulated dose of corticosteroids administered.

    <description>Before treatment/ At inclusion/Day 0 : Collection of gender, date of birth, comorbidities, pathology implicating treatment by corticosteroids and other treatment administered at the time of inclusion.
At Day 0, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6 : Blood sampling (3mL) to proceed to mHLA-DR measurement. At those time-points, results from lymphocytes immunophenotyping, C-reactive protein and numeration will be collected.
At Month 24 : Collection from medical report of
any infectious events that would have occured during the follow-up
course of the disease with corticosteroids
survival or death at 24 months of follow-up.</description>
