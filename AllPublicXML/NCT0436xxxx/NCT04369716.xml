  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this clinical trial is to compare the effects of a whole orange, orange
      juice alone, and orange juice with pomace, and a whole apple, apple juice alone, apple juice
      with pomace on glycemic response. Fruit pomace is a fiber-rich byproduct that is isolated
      during normal juice production of fruits, such as orange and apple.

    <textblock>
      Study products are matched on total sugar and fiber. Phase I consists of 3 orange study
      products and Phase II consists of 3 apple study products. Subjects consume one fruit test
      portion or beverage test portion per visit day with at least a 3 day washout in between.

      24 hr diet records are reviewed each test day to verify food and drink consistency and a diet
      containing at least 150 g of carbohydrate. Subjects arrive fasted (10-14 h, water only), are
      asked to maintain adequate hydration; and refrain from vigorous physical activity (24 h),
      alcohol consumption (24 h), and tobacco products (for at least 1 h).
