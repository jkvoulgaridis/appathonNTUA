      This study will examine the safety of giving the experimental drug, resiniferatoxin (RTX), to
      treat severe pain in patients with advanced cancer. RTX is a chemical extracted from a
      cactus-like plant. It is similar to capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot pepper. RTX has
      relieved pain and reduced the need for pain medication in several animal experiments. It
      works by destroying nerves that transmit pain information.

      People at least 18 years of age with severe pain from advanced cancer at or below the level
      of the chest that cannot be controlled with standard treatments may be eligible for this
      study. Participants undergo the following procedures:

      Pretreatment Visit

      Before beginning treatment with RTX, patients give a medical history and undergo a physical
      examination that includes:

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        -  Blood draw

        -  Urinalysis

        -  Neurological examinations

        -  Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)

        -  Eye examination

        -  MRI

        -  Urology assessment

        -  Pregnancy test, when appropriate

        -  Questionnaires to collect information on health, personality, mood, pain levels and
           symptoms.

           2-Day Hospitalization

      Patients are hospitalized for 2 days for RTX injection and monitoring, as follows:

        -  RTX injection: RTX is injected in the operating room under general anesthesia. It is
           given through a catheter placed in the patient s spine. The catheter is also used to
           obtain samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the clear fluid that bathes the spinal cord.
           The fluid is examined to assess drug effects and side effects, chemical changes in the
           content of the CSF associated with RTX, and how RTX is handled by the body.

        -  Post-injection monitoring, including:

        -  Surveys about symptoms such as pain or weakness

        -  Neurological examinations

        -  Blood and CSF sampling

        -  EKG

        -  AEs

      Outpatient followup

        -  Vitals

        -  Blood draw, Urinalysis, neurological and sensory testing, EKG on days 7, 14 and 30 after
           the injection

        -  MRI scans of the head and back, Urology assessment and PEFR on day 15 after the
           injection

        -  Eye examination

        -  Follow-up phone calls monthly for 6 months

    <textblock>
      Pain continues to be a major problem in patients with advanced cancer. Resiniferatoxin (RTX),
      a potent member of the family of drugs that includes capsaicin, selectively and irreversibly
      destroys the neurons (or their axons) transmitting chronic pain sensation. Intrathecal
      injection of RTX in several animal species has demonstrated a high level of safety,
      specificity, and efficacy in treating severe pain. This first-in-human, dose-escalation study
      will investigate the intrathecal administration of RTX in cancer patients with severe pain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To investigate the safety and efficacy of RTX administered intrathecally in subjects with
      severe refractory pain associated with advanced cancer.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 45 subjects will be accrued. Eligible subjects will be greater than or equal to 18
      years of age, have a clinical and histological diagnosis of advanced malignancy, and have
      severe pain due to malignancy that is at or below the level of the chest and not adequately
      relieved by other pain control therapies.

      DESIGN:

      This is a single site, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study using a modified
      Fibonacci scheme. The starting dose of RTX was 13 micrograms given as a 2 mL injection via an
      intra-spinal catheter over approximately 30 seconds followed by a 1 mL flush. Six subjects
      were dosed at this level and 3 were dosed at the 26 g dose level at the same volume of
      injectate, flush and injection time. Pursuant to the study design, RTX doses were to be
      increased in progressively smaller percentage increments with each dose escalation to occur
      in sequential groups of 3 subjects until 1 escalation above the effective dose in 100% of
      subjects (ED100), completion of the 100 g dose level, or establishment of the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), whichever occurs first. The total duration of study participation for
      any subject will received a dose of 26 micrograms.

      The amended RTX injection technique reduced the injection volume and increased the injection
      time to reduce spread of RTX to above the T6 (sixth thoracic) vertebral level. The present
      rechnique is a 1 mL injection over 60 seconds (0.25 mL/15 seconds) given via infusion pump,
      followed by flushing of the IT catheter with the minimum volume of sterile, preservative-free
      saline necessary to clear the internal volume of the catheter used for the injection. Three
      patients were treated at the new starting dose of 13 micrograms with the new injection
      technique. The next 3-patient cohort at this dose.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary study outcome is the ED100, the MTD, or the maximum dose administered, whichever
      is achieved first during dose escalation. The primary pain variable for determining the ED100
      is the daily worst pain score averaged over a 7-day period during the 3 weeks before RTX
      dosing and during Days 8 through 14 after dosing. The numerical rating scale (NRS),
      administered verbally during a daily telephone interview, will be the primary pain assessment
      instrument. For a given subject, the treatment will be considered effective if the subject
      experiences a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the mean daily worst pain score
      assessed by NRS (evaluated at Study Day 15). We may also consider RTX treatment to be
      successful if there is greater than or equal to 50% reduction in opiate intake, measured by
      morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day, even if pain levels are unchanged after RTX
      treatment.

      Secondary outcome measures will be other surveys of pain, including an assessment of worst
      daily pain by the visual analog scale, and assessments of function and quality of life.

      Safety assessments will include hematology; serum clinical chemistry tests; cerebrospinal
      fluid examinations; physical, neurological, and eye examinations; reporting of adverse
      events; electrocardiograms; and findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and
      brain.

          2. Clinical and histological diagnosis of cancer with disease that has not adequately
             responded to standard therapies. A pathology report documenting malignancy is
             required.

          3. Subject not currently seeking or receiving potentially curative therapies for cancer
             (e.g., chemotherapy or immunotherapy). Curative cancer therapy may be sought after the
             Day 15 clinic visit, and palliative anti-tumor therapy is allowed as long as the
             subject was established on that therapy prior to enrollment (see exclusion criterion
             7).

          4. Mean daily worst pain NRS score of greater than or equal to 6 for pain at or below the
             T6 dermatome (level of the chest) that is associated with a malignant disease. The
             mean score must be derived from recordings on at least 4 of 7 consecutive days within
             3 weeks preceding treatment.

          5. Alternative methods of pain control are not sufficiently effective, not indicated, not
             tolerated, and/or refused by the subject, as determined by the Pain and Palliative
             Care Service (PPCS). Alternative methods of pain control include, but are not limited
             to, the following:

               -  Opioids (all routes of administration including neuraxial infustion)

               -  Medical oncologist or oncologic surgeon

               -  A member of the PPCS at the NIH International normalized ratio (INR; from
                  prothrombin time [PT]) &lt; 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or
                  equal to the upper limit of the reference range. The INR and PTT may be corrected
                  (e.g., by administration of blood products, vitamin K, etc.), provided a repeat
                  blood draw confirms that the values meet this inclusion criterion.

          9. Platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/mm^3. Platelets will be transfused as
             necessary to raise the platelet count to greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 prior
