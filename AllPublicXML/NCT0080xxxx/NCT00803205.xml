  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that makes the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A specific type of
      mutation called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of CF in
      approximately 10% of patients with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.
      This study is a Phase 3 trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of ataluren in adult
      and pediatric participants with CF due to a nonsense mutation. The main goals of the study
      are to understand whether ataluren can improve pulmonary function and whether the drug can
      safely be given for a long period of time. The study will also assess the effects of ataluren
      on CF pulmonary exacerbation frequency, cough frequency, health-related quality of life,
      antibiotic use for CF-related infections, CF-related disruptions to daily living, body
      weight, and CF pathophysiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy
      and safety study, designed to document the clinical benefit of ataluren when administered as
      therapy of participants with CF due to a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) in the CFTR
      gene. It is planned that ~208 participants who are ≥6 years of age and have a forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted will be enrolled. Study
      participants will be enrolled at sites in North America, Europe, and Israel. They will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ataluren or placebo. Participants will receive study drug
      3 times per day (at morning, midday, and evening) for 48 weeks. Participants will be
      evaluated at clinic visits every 8 weeks. Additional safety laboratory testing, which may be
      performed at the investigational site or at an accredited local laboratory or clinic, is
      required every 4 weeks for the first 6 months of study participation. At the completion of
      blinded treatment, all compliant participants will be eligible to receive open-label ataluren
      in a separate extension study.

    <measure>Percentage of Predicted Function (Percent-Predicted) of Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percentage of predicted function, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FEV1 (the amount of air that can be exhaled in 1 second). Spirometry was assessed by using current guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS). Baseline was the average of percent-predicted FEV1 at screening and randomization.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Percent-Predicted of FEV1 at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (EOT) (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percentage of predicted function, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FEV1 (the amount of air that can be exhaled in 1 second). Spirometry was assessed by using current guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS). The percentage of change in percent-predicted of FEV1 was calculated as follows: ([percent-predicted FEV1-Baseline percent-predicted FEV1]/Baseline percent-predicted FEV1)*100. Baseline was the average of percent-predicted FEV1 at screening and randomization. A negative change from Baseline indicates that percent-predicted of FEV1 decreased.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Pulmonary Exacerbations as Defined by Modified Fuch's Criteria Over 48 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>A Respiratory Event Form, which collected data on various signs, symptoms, and effects for each event, was completed by the Investigator when informed by the participant of a respiratory event. Pulmonary exacerbations were assessed by using the modified Fuchs' criteria, which defines an exacerbation as a respiratory event requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotics for any 4 of the following 12 symptoms, with or without intravenous antibiotics: change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnea; fatigue; temperature &gt;38°C; anorexia; sinus pain; change in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decrease in pulmonary function by 10% or more from a previously recorded value; or radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary function. The 48-week exacerbation rate was determined by adding the weekly rates for each arm and dividing the sum by 48.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Awake Cough Hourly Rate at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of awake cough was measured using the LifeShirt, which incorporates motion-sensing transducers, electrodes, a microphone, and a 3-axis accelerometer into a lightweight vest. The rate was determined by dividing the total number of coughs by 24 (the number of hours of the observation period). Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A negative change from Baseline indicates that coughing decreased.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Respiratory Domain Score of the Revised Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R consists of 44 items, including generic scales of physical functioning, role functioning, vitality, health perceptions, emotional functioning, and social functioning, and CF-specific scales of respiratory and digestive symptoms, body image, eating disturbances, and treatment burden. Each domain score ranges from 1 to 4. Scores were linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health. Domain scores were calculated by using the following formula: 100 * (sum of responses - minimum possible sum)/ (maximum possible sum - minimum possible sum). The minimum possible sum = number of questions * 1; the maximum possible = the number of questions * 4. Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A negative change from Baseline indicates that health has worsened. Participants may have switched age groups during the study.</description>

    <measure>Percent-Predicted of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percentage of predicted function, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FVC (the amount of air that can be exhaled after taking a deep breath). Spirometry was assessed by using current guidelines of the ATS and ERS. Baseline was the average of percent-predicted FVC at screening and randomization.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 Weeks Post-Treatment (Week 52) or Premature Discontinuation (PD)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe; Grade 4: life-threatening; Grade 5: fatal. A TEAE was considered related if in the opinion of the Investigator it was possibly or probably caused by the study drug. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Study Drug Compliance by Drug Accountability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>Study drug compliance was assessed by using a Pharmacy Subject Study Drug Accountability Log (completed by the investigational site personnel). The rate of compliance was defined as 100 * (number of sachets taken/number of planned sachets) during the study. All calculations were based on the records of the first dose date to the last dose date. To differentiate dose strengths while maintaining the blind, each kit had a unique kit number and had prominent lettering &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; Each kit contained 65 packets of 1 of the dose strengths (125, 250, or 1000 mg or matching placebo). Labeling for active drug and placebo was identical.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Study Drug Compliance by Patient-Reported Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported data were obtained from the participant's electronic daily diary, which was completed by the participant or the caregiver. During study treatment, the electronic daily diary was to be completed by the participant or caregiver each day for each dose. For each participant, compliance is described in terms of the percentage of study drug actually taken. All calculations were based on the records of the first dose date to the last dose date. To differentiate dose strengths while maintaining the blind, each kit had a unique kit number and had prominent lettering &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; Each kit contained 65 packets of 1 of the dose strengths (125, 250, or 1000 mg or matching placebo). Labeling for active drug and placebo was identical.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Lung Score as Assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>Lungs were imaged by using non-contrast, spiral CT. The total lung score for each CT scan was established by the sum of 5 characteristics from the Brody scoring system, with scores ranging from 0 to 40.5, with lower scores indicating better lung function. The characteristics scored were bronchiectasis (score range 0 - 12), mucus plugging (score range 0- 6), peribronchial thickening (score range 0 - 9), parenchyma (score range 0 - 9), and hyperinflation (score range 0 - 4.5). Baseline was the latest valid assessment prior to the treatment. A positive change from Baseline indicates that lung function worsened.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Chloride Transport as Assessed by Transepithelial Potential Difference (TEPD) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>TEPD was assessed in each nostril using standardized equipment, techniques, and solutions. Assessments were made on the nasal epithelium cells lining the inferior turbinate. Warmed solutions of Ringer's solution, amiloride, chloride-free gluconate, isoproterenol, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were perfused for ≥3-minute sequentially through a nasal catheter while a voltage tracing was recorded. Total chloride transport was computed for each nostril. The total chloride transport values were calculated by subtracting the voltages at the end of a perfusion from the voltage at the end of an earlier perfusion (isoproterenol - amiloride). The average of the values for each nostril was computed. If the assessment was available in only 1 nostril, this value was used as if it were the average of both nostrils. Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A positive change from Baseline indicates that nasal chloride transport increased.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride Concentration at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>Sweat was collected, from each arm, by using pilocarpine iontophoresis. The chloride concentration in the sweat was quantified for each arm by using standard laboratory methods. Tests were also considered valid if the sweat collection time was ≤35 minutes; tests with longer collection times were also considered valid if extra time was needed to obtain sufficient volume (≥15uL) for analysis. For analysis purposes, the average of the values from each arm were computed. If the assessment was valid and/or available in only 1 arm, this value was used as if it were the average of both arms. The method used was consistent with the CFFT-TDN guidelines. Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A negative change from Baseline indicates that sweat chloride concentration decreased.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 299 male and female participants with nonsense-mutation-mediated cystic fibrosis (nmCF) aged ≥6 years signed the informed consent form and were screened for eligibility, of which 61 did not meet entry criteria to participate in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 238 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ataluren or placebo. Six participants (4 in the ataluren arm; 2 in the placebo arm) were excluded from the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population because they did not have at least 1 post-Baseline forced expiratory volume (FEV1) assessment by Week 8.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>A Respiratory Event Form, which collected data on various signs, symptoms, and effects for each event, was completed by the Investigator when informed by the participant of a respiratory event. Pulmonary exacerbations were assessed by using the modified Fuchs' criteria, which defines an exacerbation as a respiratory event requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotics for any 4 of the following 12 symptoms, with or without intravenous antibiotics: change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnea; fatigue; temperature &gt;38°C; anorexia; sinus pain; change in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decrease in pulmonary function by 10% or more from a previously recorded value; or radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary function. The 48-week exacerbation rate was determined by adding the weekly rates for each arm and dividing the sum by 48.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Respiratory Domain Score of the Revised Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The CFQ-R consists of 44 items, including generic scales of physical functioning, role functioning, vitality, health perceptions, emotional functioning, and social functioning, and CF-specific scales of respiratory and digestive symptoms, body image, eating disturbances, and treatment burden. Each domain score ranges from 1 to 4. Scores were linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health. Domain scores were calculated by using the following formula: 100 * (sum of responses - minimum possible sum)/ (maximum possible sum - minimum possible sum). The minimum possible sum = number of questions * 1; the maximum possible = the number of questions * 4. Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A negative change from Baseline indicates that health has worsened. Participants may have switched age groups during the study.</description>

        <description>A TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe; Grade 4: life-threatening; Grade 5: fatal. A TEAE was considered related if in the opinion of the Investigator it was possibly or probably caused by the study drug. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
          <description>A TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe; Grade 4: life-threatening; Grade 5: fatal. A TEAE was considered related if in the opinion of the Investigator it was possibly or probably caused by the study drug. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

        <description>Study drug compliance was assessed by using a Pharmacy Subject Study Drug Accountability Log (completed by the investigational site personnel). The rate of compliance was defined as 100 * (number of sachets taken/number of planned sachets) during the study. All calculations were based on the records of the first dose date to the last dose date. To differentiate dose strengths while maintaining the blind, each kit had a unique kit number and had prominent lettering &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; Each kit contained 65 packets of 1 of the dose strengths (125, 250, or 1000 mg or matching placebo).

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Concentration of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) in Serum and Sputum at Week 48</title>
        <description>Expression of IL-8 was measured in serum and in sputum. Sputum was spontaneously produced and tested by using standardized procedures developed by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. Therapeutics Development Network (CFFT-TDN). Baseline was the latest valid assessment prior to the treatment. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the concentration of IL-8 decreased.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Lung Score as Assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Lungs were imaged by using non-contrast, spiral CT. The total lung score for each CT scan was established by the sum of 5 characteristics from the Brody scoring system, with scores ranging from 0 to 40.5, with lower scores indicating better lung function. The characteristics scored were bronchiectasis (score range 0 - 12), mucus plugging (score range 0- 6), peribronchial thickening (score range 0 - 9), parenchyma (score range 0 - 9), and hyperinflation (score range 0 - 4.5). Baseline was the latest valid assessment prior to the treatment. A positive change from Baseline indicates that lung function worsened.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Lung Score as Assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) at Week 48</title>
          <description>Lungs were imaged by using non-contrast, spiral CT. The total lung score for each CT scan was established by the sum of 5 characteristics from the Brody scoring system, with scores ranging from 0 to 40.5, with lower scores indicating better lung function. The characteristics scored were bronchiectasis (score range 0 - 12), mucus plugging (score range 0- 6), peribronchial thickening (score range 0 - 9), parenchyma (score range 0 - 9), and hyperinflation (score range 0 - 4.5). Baseline was the latest valid assessment prior to the treatment. A positive change from Baseline indicates that lung function worsened.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Chloride Transport as Assessed by Transepithelial Potential Difference (TEPD) at Week 48</title>
        <description>TEPD was assessed in each nostril using standardized equipment, techniques, and solutions. Assessments were made on the nasal epithelium cells lining the inferior turbinate. Warmed solutions of Ringer's solution, amiloride, chloride-free gluconate, isoproterenol, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were perfused for ≥3-minute sequentially through a nasal catheter while a voltage tracing was recorded. Total chloride transport was computed for each nostril. The total chloride transport values were calculated by subtracting the voltages at the end of a perfusion from the voltage at the end of an earlier perfusion (isoproterenol - amiloride). The average of the values for each nostril was computed. If the assessment was available in only 1 nostril, this value was used as if it were the average of both nostrils. Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A positive change from Baseline indicates that nasal chloride transport increased.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride Concentration at Week 48</title>
        <description>Sweat was collected, from each arm, by using pilocarpine iontophoresis. The chloride concentration in the sweat was quantified for each arm by using standard laboratory methods. Tests were also considered valid if the sweat collection time was ≤35 minutes; tests with longer collection times were also considered valid if extra time was needed to obtain sufficient volume (≥15uL) for analysis. For analysis purposes, the average of the values from each arm were computed. If the assessment was valid and/or available in only 1 arm, this value was used as if it were the average of both arms. The method used was consistent with the CFFT-TDN guidelines. Baseline was the latest, valid assessment prior to the treatment. A negative change from Baseline indicates that sweat chloride concentration decreased.</description>
