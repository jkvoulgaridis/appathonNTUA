      The purpose of the investigators project is to examine if the investigators may affect a
      reduction in respiratory infections in a pediatric long term care facility by institution of
      a comprehensive oral care program. The investigators wish to base their project on work such
      as of Yoneyama et al 2002, which hypothesized and showed that &quot;silent&quot; aspiration of
      oropharyngeal contents is a causative factor in development of respiratory infection in
      elderly institutionalized clients. It was found that an advanced oral hygiene program greatly
      reduced the incidence of respiratory infection. Although no similar research projects were
      found to have involved children, the investigators hope that a similar program of oral care
      will allow the investigators to likewise reduce the incidence of respiratory infection among
      the pediatric clients in our facility.

      The investigators propose to examine two groups of children which are fed by gastrostomy
      feedings only. One group will continue to receive oral care as performed today. The study
      group will have their teeth brushed three times a day by the nursing staff by using a suction
      connected toothbrush, daily examination of the oropharynx by the nursing staff, and use of
      chlorhexidine varnish or another suitable antibacterial agent in the oropharynx.

      The investigators will retrospectively examine our records (a 12 month period) for febrile
      days, antibiotic use and hospitalization days due to respiratory causes. The investigators
      will then compare these to the febrile days, antibiotic use and hospitalizations to the 12
      month period [post implementation of the oral care program.

      The importance of this program is to examine whether by implementation of a relatively
      inexpensive and low-tech intervention may meaningfully reduce the morbidity and mortality due
      to respiratory infection among our clients (which from our experience is the main cause of
      morbidity and mortality in the investigators institution). The investigators expect that by
      reducing the incidence of respiratory disease among our clients that the investigators will
      greatly reduce suffering among the children and their families, improve their quality of life
      and ease the financial and organizational burdens as a result of caring for respiratory
      infections.

      As was noted before, no prior research was found which studied the pediatric population in a
      long term care facilities. It is our belief that this project represents a unique research
      opportunity which may bring great benefit to the children and caregivers.
