    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether contingent reinforcement for smoking
      abstinence, compared to noncontingent reinforcement, increases the effectiveness of brief
      counseling and nicotine replacement on smoking abstinence of substance abusers in residential
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance abusers have a high prevalence and rate of smoking with little success in quitting,
      so stronger approaches are needed to encourage attempts to quit smoking.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether contingent reinforcement for smoking abstinence
      (CM), compared to noncontingent reinforcement (NR), increases the effectiveness of brief
      counseling and nicotine replacement on smoking abstinence of substance abusers in residential
      treatment. The proposed study will be a 2-group design in which up to 274 substance abusers
      who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day receive brief advice (4 sessions) and nicotine
      replacement (NRT) (8 weeks), and are randomized to 19 days of CM for smoking vs. a matched NR
      condition. The brief advice is adapted slightly for sobriety settings. Point-prevalence
      abstinence will be assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after starting treatment. Secondary aims
      evaluate effects of CM on substance use outcomes and potential mediators of effects on
      outcome, including within-treatment abstinence, motivation level and tolerance for smoking
      discomfort.

      The significance is to add knowledge about the most effective ways to maximize smoking
      cessation among substance abusers, important given that no methods are known to work with
      this population.

Nicotine Replacement Treatment (NRT): Nicoderm CQ nicotine skin patch: 21mg patch for 4 weeks, then 14mg patch for 2 weeks and 7mg patch for 2 weeks. This is supplemental intervention provided to all.
Brief Advice: Brief Advice (BA): Patients receive four sessions of a manualized brief intervention based on NCI guidelines (Manley et al., 1991; Hollis et al., 1993) as modified for sobriety settings. This simple counseling has five components: (1) Assess smoking and initial interest in cessation; (2) Advise the patient to quit smoking; (3) Assist the patient in quitting; (4) Assess interest in quitting; and (5) Arrange booster sessions.
