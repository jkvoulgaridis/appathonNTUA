  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized, controlled trial that compares Behavioral Activation (BA)
      to Treatment As Usual (TAU) in PTSD Specialty clinics, as early psychotherapeutic
      interventions for OIF/OEF veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sizable proportion of soldiers involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are
      experiencing mental health and adjustment problems on their return, including posttraumatic
      stress disorder and depression (Hoge et al., 2004). Both PTSD and depression can be chronic
      and debilitating disorders, associated with impairments in social, occupational, and physical
      functioning, as well as high health care utilization (Katon, Unutzer, &amp; Simon, 2004; Stein et
      al., 2005).

      Although empirically supported treatments exist for established PTSD and depression, much
      less is known about effective early interventions for these conditions. Exploration of early
      intervention options is necessary, particularly in the case of the new veteran population, as
      such interventions could address social, occupational and physical impairments before they
      become too intractable. Also, successful early interventions could curtail high health care
      utilization dramatically across time. The development of such early interventions for PTSD
      and depression must also take into account any specifications of accessibility and
      acceptability that are particular to the OIF/OEF veteran population.

      The present study is a randomized, controlled trial that compares Behavioral Activation (BA),
      to Treatment As Usual (TAU) as early interventions for OIF/OEF veterans with posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD). Participants will be recruited largely from the primary health care
      setting (to increase acceptability and accessibility to the veteran population). Both BA and
      TAU treatment groups will be administered by psychotherapists who specialize in the treatment
      of PTSD. Both groups will be assessed at pre-, mid- and post-treatment time points to
      determine change over time, health care utilization and treatment satisfaction. This is a
      dual-site study that will be carried out at both the Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC) and
      the VA Puget Sound Health Care Center (VA PSHCS) and coordinated at the PVAMC.

    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (12 weeks after 1st therapy session), and 3-month follow-up (24 weeks after first therapy session)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered scale and is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing the presence of PTSD. Items are ranked on Likert scales according to both frequency (0=never to 4=daily or almost every day) and intensity (0=none to 4=extreme) of symptoms, yielding an overall severity score by summing frequency and intensity ratings (range 0 to 136, with higher scores reflecting greater symptomatology). Scale scores corresponding to the 3 subcategories of PTSD symptoms (intrusive symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and hyperarousal symptoms) can be similarly obtained (scores range from 0-40, 0-56, 0-40 for the 3 subscales, respectively). Internal consistency, interrater reliability, and validity of this measure are strong and well-documented.</description>

    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (12 weeks after first therapy appointment), 3-month follow-up (24 weeks after first therapy appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-M is a 17 item self-report scale that assesses the presence of DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1= not at all to 5=extremely) according to how much the symptom bothered the respondent over the past month. Scores range from 17-85 with higher scores representing greater symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (12 weeks after first therapy appointment), 3-month follow-up (24 weeks after first therapy appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) is a 21-item measure of subjective levels of depression. Items are rated on Likert-scales from 0-3 (individual descriptions are provided for each number ranging from the absence of the symptom to the severe manifestation of the symptom). Scores can range from 0-63 with higher scores representing higher levels of depression. This widely used measure of depression is commonly included in outcome studies in order to determine treatment effects on severity of depressive symptoms and has excellent psychometric properties.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (12 weeks after first psychotherapy session), 3-month follow-up (24 weeks after first psychotherapy appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) (Sheehan, 2000) is a three item self-rated scale of impairment that is widely used in psychopharmacology studies (allowing comparison with these studies). The items ask the respondent to rate (on a Likert scale of 0-10, unimpaired to highly impaired) to what extent their symptoms interfere with their functioning in the areas of: work, social, and family life; a summary score can be obtained by summing the three items (range 0-30, unimpaired to highly impaired). The scale's reliability and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in individuals with anxiety disorders and depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Activation Scale (BAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (12 weeks after 1st therapy appointment), 3-month follow-up (24 weeks after first therapy appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The BAS is a 25-item self-report measure that assesses overall degree of behavioral activation as well as indicators of inactivation across three subscales: avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. Items are rated on 7-point Likert scales (0=not at all to 6=completely). The total BAS score reflects overall level of activation with high scores reflecting higher activation (range 0 - 150).</description>

          -  Psychotic disorders.

          -  Substance dependence. Because these conditions warrant alternative treatments.
             Bipolar, psychotic and substance dependence disorders will be assessed using the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; First, Spitzer,
             Gibbon &amp; Williams, 2002).

          -  Report active and imminent suicidal intent. If imminent suicidality is present, this
             would suggest that a treatment specifically targeting this intent is indicated.
             Suicidal intent will be assessed using The Brief Assessment for Suicidal Ideation or
             Behavior that was designed for this study.

In both clinics providers are trained in Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). Both clinics also offer skills-based “coping skills” treatments for PTSD and pharmacotherapy. Actual treatment received was determined collaboratively between the PTSD Clinic Care provider and veteran and could include any of these treatment options or combinations of treatments.</description>

        <title>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV)</title>
        <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered scale and is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing the presence of PTSD. Items are ranked on Likert scales according to both frequency (0=never to 4=daily or almost every day) and intensity (0=none to 4=extreme) of symptoms, yielding an overall severity score by summing frequency and intensity ratings (range 0 to 136, with higher scores reflecting greater symptomatology). Scale scores corresponding to the 3 subcategories of PTSD symptoms (intrusive symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and hyperarousal symptoms) can be similarly obtained (scores range from 0-40, 0-56, 0-40 for the 3 subscales, respectively). Internal consistency, interrater reliability, and validity of this measure are strong and well-documented.</description>

Behavioral Activation treatment: Behavioral Activation (BA) is a present-focused psychotherapy based on behavioral theory and principles of change, that aims to re-engage individuals with meaningful and pleasurable life activities by targeting and problem-solving patterns of avoidance. It is well-established as a treatment for depression and has been modified for the current study to address PTSD-related problems.</description>

The scale's reliability and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in individuals with anxiety disorders and depression.</description>

        <title>Behavioral Activation Scale (BAS)</title>
        <description>The BAS is a 25-item self-report measure that assesses overall degree of behavioral activation as well as indicators of inactivation across three subscales: avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. Items are rated on 7-point Likert scales (0=not at all to 6=completely). The total BAS score reflects overall level of activation with high scores reflecting higher activation (range 0 - 150).</description>
