      This randomized controlled trial evaluates the provision of individual patient laboratory
      results to newly diagnosed HIV positive smartphone users through a secure application (app)
      as a method to get them linked to and retained in care, and engage with educational materials
      purposefully developed to explain their results. Message prompts will also be used to alert
      patients that their results are ready and provide information on how to link to care, and
      assistance to re-link to care if they fall out of the health system for any reason. Prompts
      will be sent to patients to remind health care workers if they are due for repeat laboratory
      monitoring. The primary endpoint is linkage to care (a HIV-related laboratory test) at 6
      months. The control group received standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This evaluation of a newly designed smartphone application (app) for linkage to care, HIV
      treatment adherence and retention in care, is taking place at five Johannesburg health
      facilities. Intervention allocation is random with individuals either receiving the
      smartphone app or standard of care. The trial is motivated by evidence from elsewhere that
      sending lab results via app acceptable, and loss of patients in need of HIV care can be
      reduced with mobile Health interventions. There is a growing number of smartphones in South
      Africa (at the time of baseline assessment, about 40% of the surveyed population had an
      Android smartphone with data, and the majority of new phones are smartphones). The trial's
      objectives are: a) Test whether routine linkage to HIV care at public sector services is
      improved by providing HIV positive clients with a smartphone-enabled app when compared to
      standard of care; b) Determine HIV treatment initiation rates between intervention and
      control arm; c) Test the feasibility and acceptability of receiving lab results via app; d)
      Assess secondary effects from improved participant information, including return rates after
      falling out of care, participant satisfaction, and rates of repeat blood tests; e) Determine
      knowledge levels on HIV care; and f) Assess the effect in priority groups for better linkage
      to care (male HIV cases and HIV positive youth). If data allow, a cost-benefit analysis will
      also be conducted.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited at 5 public HIV testing sites (1 community health center, 3 clinics, and 1 tertiary hospital) in inner city Johannesburg, South Africa. Recruitment happened from October 2015 to June 2016. HIV positive individuals were pre-screened for trial suitability and recruited if eligible upon screening.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 4537 individuals approached about the study, 90 declined to participate and 4094 were found ineligible during pre-screening and screening, leaving 353 for randomization. 8 standard of care arm participants were later removed from analysis due to erroneous sending of SMS reminders for their 6-month clinic appointment leaving 345 for analysis.</pre_assignment_details>
