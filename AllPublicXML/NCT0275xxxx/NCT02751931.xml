    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in MCC was based on filling urodynamics (volume at the end of filling). During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers. Missing MCC observations at week 24 were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bladder Compliance (ΔV/ΔP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Bladder compliance was an indication of the elasticity of the bladder wall and was calculated by dividing the change in volume by the change in detrusor pressure during the filling of the bladder. Change from baseline in bladder compliance (change in volume/change in pressure) was assessed by the independent central reviewers and reported as annotations on the urodynamic trace and in an external database. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in MCC was based on filling urodynamics (volume at the end of filling). During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Overactive Detrusor Contractions (&gt; 15 cm H20) Until End of Filling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Detrusor overactivity is the occurrence of involuntary detrusor contractions during filling cystometry. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Detrusor Pressure at End of Filling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Detrusor pressure was defined as bladder pressure minus intra-abdominal pressure as assessed by urodynamics. Filling was stopped (end of filling) when the detrusor pressure exceeded 100 cm H2O or was considered dangerously high by the investigator or urodynamicist (for instance, a prolonged passive detrusor pressure &gt; 40 cm H2O). During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Filling Bladder Volume Until First Overactive Detrusor Contraction (&gt; 15 cm H20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Detrusor overactivity is the occurrence of involuntary detrusor contractions during filling cystometry. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers. If no detrusor contraction of &gt; 15 cm H2O occurred, the bladder volume was imputed with maximum cystometric capacity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Catheterized Volume Per Catheterization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the average catheterized volume per catheterization was calculated as the sum of all available/non-missing catheterized volumes recorded over 2 measuring days in the weekend diary, whether or not the 2 days were consecutive divided by the number of catheterizations with non-missing volumes. If volumes were recorded on 1 single day of the weekend diary, the average catheterized volume per catheterization was calculated using all available/non-missing catheterized volumes recorded that day. If no volumes were recorded on any day of the weekend diary, the average catheterized volume per catheterization was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which ≥1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum Catheterized Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the maximum catheterized volume per day was calculated using all available/non-missing catheterized volumes recorded for the 2 measuring days in the weekend e-diary, whether or not these 2 days were consecutive. Maximum value was calculated separately for each measuring day and the mean of the two values was used. If volumes recorded on 1 single day of the weekend e-diary, the maximum catheterized volume per day was calculated using all available/non-zero catheterized volumes recorded that day. If no volumes were recorded on any day of the weekend e-diary, the maximum catheterized volume per day was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum Catheterized Daytime Volume (MCDV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the MCDV was calculated using all available/non-missing catheterized daytime volumes for the 2 measuring days in the weekend e-diary, whether or not the 2 days were consecutive. Maximum value was calculated separately for each measuring day and the mean of the 2 values was used. If volumes were recorded on 1 single day of the weekend e-diary, the MCDV was calculated using all available/non-zero catheterized daytime volumes recorded that day. If no volumes were recorded on any day of the weekend e-diary, the MCDV was missing. Daytime was defined as the time between wake-up time (minus 30 min) &amp; time to sleep (plus 29 min) recorded in the e-diary. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Morning Catheterized Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The first morning catheterized volume was the first recorded non-zero volume within or after the hour of the wake-up time on a volume-measuring day in the e-diary. The average first morning catheterized volume was calculated as the average of the available first morning catheterized volumes recorded for the 2 measuring days in the weekend e-diary, whether or not these 2 days were consecutive. If the first morning catheterized volume was recorded on 1 single day of the weekend e-diary, the average morning catheterized is the first morning catheterized that day. If no first morning catheterized volumes are recorded on any day of the weekend e-diary, the average first morning catheterized volume was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Leakage Episodes Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the mean number of leakage episodes per day (during day and night time) was calculated using all available/non-missing number of leakage episodes for the 2 measuring days in the weekend diary during day and night time. If the number of leakage episodes was recorded on 1 single day in the 7-day diary during day and night time, the mean number of leakage episodes per day during day and night time is equal to the total number of leakage episodes recorded that day during day and night time. If no leakage episodes were recorded on any day of the weekend diary during day and night time, the mean number of leakage episodes per day was zero. If nothing was recorded/diary not completed the result was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Dry Days Per 7 Days (Day and Night Time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Dry days were defined as leakage-free days, this included day and night time. Participants recorded dry days in the 7-day diary. Dry days were calculated as follows: Ddry was the number of valid diary days where the response to the question 'Did you leak between this catheterization and the last one' was 'No' each time a new catheterization was entered in the e-diary during the day &amp; night time period. Dwet was the number of valid diary days where the response to the question 'Did you leak between this catheterization and the last one' was 'Yes' for at least one catheterization entered during the day and night time period. If (Ddry + Dwet) &gt; 3, the number of dry days per 7 days was calculated as Ddry/(Ddry + Dwet) x 7, otherwise the value was missing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire (PIN-Q) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>PIN-Q measured quality of life via an e-diary. Total score ranged from 0 (no effect) to 80 (worst effect); decrease in score indicated improvement. Total score was 20x average of individual PinQ items, the 20 Likert scales were converted to a score: Items 6 &amp; 17; 0: &quot;No&quot; to 4: &quot;Definitely&quot; was used; &amp; For the other 18 items; 0: &quot;No&quot; to 4: &quot;All the time&quot; was used. Expectation that questionnaires had limited missing values; if answers &gt;2 questions were missing, total score was not calculated &amp; was missing. Individual item scores were directly imputed. Change from baseline to each post-baseline visit in the total score was post-baseline visit value minus baseline value. If either baseline or post-baseline visit value was missing, change from baseline was missing. If change was: &lt;0, improvement between 2 time-points; =0, no change between 2 time points; &gt;0, worsening between 2 time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Impression of Severity Scale (PGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S was an answer to the question: &quot;How did you feel about your bladder condition during the past 3 days?&quot; Participants evaluated their recent condition as &quot;Really Bad&quot;(0), &quot;Bad&quot; (1), &quot;Not Bad, Not Good&quot; (2), &quot;Good&quot; (3) &amp;&quot;Really Good&quot; (4). An increase indicated improvement. The total score ranged from 0 to 4, where higher scores indicated improvement.The change from baseline to each postbaseline visit in the PGI-S score is the value at the post-baseline visit minus the value at the baseline visit. If either the baseline or the post-baseline visit value is missing, the change from baseline was missing. A positive change indicated an improvement while a negative change indicated a worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) is a 7 point scale that required the clinician to assess how much the participant's overall bladder symptoms since the start of the study on day 1 has improved or worsened and rated as: very much improved (1); much improved (2); minimally improved (3); no change (4); minimally worse (5); much worse (6); or very much worse (7). The total score range from 1-7, where lower scores indicated improvement.</description>

At weeks 2, 4 or 8, participants were up-titrated to PED50 based on the given dose titration criteria. Following week 24, participants stayed on their individual dose level until week 52 EOS or EOT. Participants with a body weight &gt;=35 kg received mirabegron tablets or body weight &lt;35 kg received mirabegron oral suspension. At week 24, participants on mirabegron oral suspension could switch to tablets if the body weight became &gt;=35 kg or participants on mirabegron tablets could switch to oral suspension if the body weight became &lt;35 Kg or participants could switch to either of the dosage form for acceptability reasons after sponsor's prior approval and on a case-by-case basis. Mirabegron extended-release granules were reconstituted with water to prepare a mirabegron oral suspension of 8 mg/mL. Administration was via an oral syringe with a sip of water afterwards.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a body weight of greater than or equal to 11 kg.

          -  Subject suffers from NDO confirmed by urodynamic investigation at baseline. The
             diagnosis of NDO must be confirmed by the presence of at least 1 involuntary detrusor
             contraction &gt; 15 cm H2O from baseline detrusor pressure, and/or a decrease in
             compliance leading to an increase in baseline detrusor pressure of &gt; 20 cm H2O.

          -  Subject has been using CIC for at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1/screening.

          -  Subject has a current indication for drug therapy to manage NDO.

          -  Subject is able to take the study drug in accordance with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known genitourinary condition (other than NDO) that may cause overactive
             contractions or incontinence or kidney/bladder stones or another persistent urinary
             tract pathology that may cause symptoms.

          -  Subject has one of the following gastrointestinal problems: partial or complete
             obstruction, decreased motility such as paralytic ileus, subjects at risk of gastric
             retention.

          -  Subject has a urinary indwelling catheter within 4 weeks prior to visit 1/screening.

          -  Subject has a surgically treated underactive urethral sphincter

          -  Subject has vesico-ureteral reflux grade 3 to 5.

          -  Subject has undergone bladder augmentation surgery.

          -  Subject receives electrostimulation therapy, if started within 30 days before visit
             1/screening or is expected to start during the study period. Subjects who are on an
             established regimen may remain on this for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject suffers from a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) at baseline
             (symptomatic is defined as pain, fever, hematuria, new onset foul-smelling urine). If
             present at visit 1/screening or diagnosed between visit 1/screening and visit
             3/baseline, the UTI should be treated successfully (clinical recovery) prior to
             baseline. If a symptomatic UTI is present at baseline, all baseline assessments are
             allowed to be postponed for a maximum of 7 days until the UTI is successfully treated
             (clinical recovery).

          -  Subject has a (mean) resting pulse rate &gt; 99th percentile [Fleming et al, 2011].

          -  Subject has an established hypertension and a systolic or diastolic blood pressure
             greater than the 99th percentile of the normal range determined by sex, age and
             height, plus 5mmHg [NIH 2005].

          -  Subject has a risk of QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia, long QT syndrome [LQTS]; or
             family history of LQTS, exercise-induced syncope).

          -  Subject has severe renal impairment (eGFR according to Larsson equation &lt; 30 mL/min).

          -  Subject's aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is
             greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin
             (TBL) greater than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN according to age and sex.

          -  Subject has a history or presence of any malignancy prior to visit 1/screening.

          -  Subject has known or suspected hypersensitivity to mirabegron, any of the excipients
             used in the current formulations or previous severe hypersensitivity to any drug.

          -  Subject has participated in another clinical trial (and/or has taken an
             investigational drug within 30 days (or 5 half-lives of the drug, or the limit set by
             national law, whichever is longer) prior to visit 1/screening.

          -  Subject uses any of the following prohibited medications (after start of washout):

               -  Any medication, other than the study drug used, for the management of NDO;

               -  Any drugs that are sensitive CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index or
                  sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates

               -  Any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors if the subject has a mild to moderate renal
                  impairment (eGFR 30 - 89 mL/min).

          -  Subject has been administered intravesical botulinum toxin; except if given &gt; 4 months
             prior to visit 1/screening and the subject experiences symptoms comparable to those
             existing prior to the botulinum toxin injections.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) at Week 24</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in MCC was based on filling urodynamics (volume at the end of filling). During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers. Missing MCC observations at week 24 were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) at Week 24</title>
          <description>Change from baseline in MCC was based on filling urodynamics (volume at the end of filling). During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers. Missing MCC observations at week 24 were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>
          <population>The analysis population consisted of the full analysis set (FAS) which included all participants who took ≥ 1 dose of study drug and provided both valid (as by the central reviewer’s assessment) nonmissing MCC measurements at baseline and at a postbaseline visit for the primary efficacy endpoint.</population>

        <description>Bladder compliance was an indication of the elasticity of the bladder wall and was calculated by dividing the change in volume by the change in detrusor pressure during the filling of the bladder. Change from baseline in bladder compliance (change in volume/change in pressure) was assessed by the independent central reviewers and reported as annotations on the urodynamic trace and in an external database. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Overactive Detrusor Contractions (&gt; 15 cm H20) Until End of Filling</title>
        <description>Detrusor overactivity is the occurrence of involuntary detrusor contractions during filling cystometry. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Filling Bladder Volume Until First Overactive Detrusor Contraction (&gt; 15 cm H20)</title>
        <description>Detrusor overactivity is the occurrence of involuntary detrusor contractions during filling cystometry. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began, or until the participant experienced pain or discomfort, or because dangerous high detrusor pressure, or 135% of maximum catheterized volume for age had been reached. A valid urodynamic assessment was confirmed valid by the central reviewers. If no detrusor contraction of &gt; 15 cm H2O occurred, the bladder volume was imputed with maximum cystometric capacity.</description>

        <description>For each participant, the average catheterized volume per catheterization was calculated as the sum of all available/non-missing catheterized volumes recorded over 2 measuring days in the weekend diary, whether or not the 2 days were consecutive divided by the number of catheterizations with non-missing volumes. If volumes were recorded on 1 single day of the weekend diary, the average catheterized volume per catheterization was calculated using all available/non-missing catheterized volumes recorded that day. If no volumes were recorded on any day of the weekend diary, the average catheterized volume per catheterization was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which ≥1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>

        <description>For each participant, the maximum catheterized volume per day was calculated using all available/non-missing catheterized volumes recorded for the 2 measuring days in the weekend e-diary, whether or not these 2 days were consecutive. Maximum value was calculated separately for each measuring day and the mean of the two values was used. If volumes recorded on 1 single day of the weekend e-diary, the maximum catheterized volume per day was calculated using all available/non-zero catheterized volumes recorded that day. If no volumes were recorded on any day of the weekend e-diary, the maximum catheterized volume per day was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Catheterized Daytime Volume (MCDV)</title>
        <description>For each participant, the MCDV was calculated using all available/non-missing catheterized daytime volumes for the 2 measuring days in the weekend e-diary, whether or not the 2 days were consecutive. Maximum value was calculated separately for each measuring day and the mean of the 2 values was used. If volumes were recorded on 1 single day of the weekend e-diary, the MCDV was calculated using all available/non-zero catheterized daytime volumes recorded that day. If no volumes were recorded on any day of the weekend e-diary, the MCDV was missing. Daytime was defined as the time between wake-up time (minus 30 min) &amp; time to sleep (plus 29 min) recorded in the e-diary. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>

        <description>The first morning catheterized volume was the first recorded non-zero volume within or after the hour of the wake-up time on a volume-measuring day in the e-diary. The average first morning catheterized volume was calculated as the average of the available first morning catheterized volumes recorded for the 2 measuring days in the weekend e-diary, whether or not these 2 days were consecutive. If the first morning catheterized volume was recorded on 1 single day of the weekend e-diary, the average morning catheterized is the first morning catheterized that day. If no first morning catheterized volumes are recorded on any day of the weekend e-diary, the average first morning catheterized volume was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Leakage Episodes Per Day</title>
        <description>For each participant, the mean number of leakage episodes per day (during day and night time) was calculated using all available/non-missing number of leakage episodes for the 2 measuring days in the weekend diary during day and night time. If the number of leakage episodes was recorded on 1 single day in the 7-day diary during day and night time, the mean number of leakage episodes per day during day and night time is equal to the total number of leakage episodes recorded that day during day and night time. If no leakage episodes were recorded on any day of the weekend diary during day and night time, the mean number of leakage episodes per day was zero. If nothing was recorded/diary not completed the result was missing. A valid bladder diary day in the weekend diary was any e-diary day for which &gt;=1 catheterized volume &gt;0 mL was recorded with complete date and time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Dry Days Per 7 Days (Day and Night Time)</title>
        <description>Dry days were defined as leakage-free days, this included day and night time. Participants recorded dry days in the 7-day diary. Dry days were calculated as follows: Ddry was the number of valid diary days where the response to the question 'Did you leak between this catheterization and the last one' was 'No' each time a new catheterization was entered in the e-diary during the day &amp; night time period. Dwet was the number of valid diary days where the response to the question 'Did you leak between this catheterization and the last one' was 'Yes' for at least one catheterization entered during the day and night time period. If (Ddry + Dwet) &gt; 3, the number of dry days per 7 days was calculated as Ddry/(Ddry + Dwet) x 7, otherwise the value was missing.</description>

        <description>PIN-Q measured quality of life via an e-diary. Total score ranged from 0 (no effect) to 80 (worst effect); decrease in score indicated improvement. Total score was 20x average of individual PinQ items, the 20 Likert scales were converted to a score: Items 6 &amp; 17; 0: &quot;No&quot; to 4: &quot;Definitely&quot; was used; &amp; For the other 18 items; 0: &quot;No&quot; to 4: &quot;All the time&quot; was used. Expectation that questionnaires had limited missing values; if answers &gt;2 questions were missing, total score was not calculated &amp; was missing. Individual item scores were directly imputed. Change from baseline to each post-baseline visit in the total score was post-baseline visit value minus baseline value. If either baseline or post-baseline visit value was missing, change from baseline was missing. If change was: &lt;0, improvement between 2 time-points; =0, no change between 2 time points; &gt;0, worsening between 2 time points.</description>

        <description>The PGI-S was an answer to the question: &quot;How did you feel about your bladder condition during the past 3 days?&quot; Participants evaluated their recent condition as &quot;Really Bad&quot;(0), &quot;Bad&quot; (1), &quot;Not Bad, Not Good&quot; (2), &quot;Good&quot; (3) &amp;&quot;Really Good&quot; (4). An increase indicated improvement. The total score ranged from 0 to 4, where higher scores indicated improvement.The change from baseline to each postbaseline visit in the PGI-S score is the value at the post-baseline visit minus the value at the baseline visit. If either the baseline or the post-baseline visit value is missing, the change from baseline was missing. A positive change indicated an improvement while a negative change indicated a worsening.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who was given the study drug or who had undergone study procedures and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any AE with date of onset occurring on or after the first dose of study medication and up to the end of study.</description>
