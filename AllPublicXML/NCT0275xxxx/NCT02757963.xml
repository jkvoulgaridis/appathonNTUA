    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, interventional study will be conducted in a general practice setting to
      assess the utility of a benign prostatic enlargement (BPE)/benign prostatic obstruction (BPO)
      screening tool in conjunction with prostate specific antigen (PSA) in finding men confirmed
      to have BPH on full urologist assessment of diagnostic test results. The tool may help a
      General Practitioners (GP) to identify subjects who may have BPH for further tests and
      improve the speed of referrals to specialists when this is appropriate. The utility of the
      screening tool will be compared to the validated tool in wide clinical use, the International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). This study does not have any formal hypothesis in terms of the
      primary and secondary endpoint proportions. A BPE/BPO screening tool identifies lower urinary
      tract symptoms (LUTS) probably due to BPH in men not yet presenting with LUTS. The results of
      this screening tool will be used for further investigation. All subjects testing positive on
      the BPE/BPO screening tool (score &gt;=3) tool or on the IPSS (score &gt;=8) will be enrolled and
      offered a PSA test and urinalysis to establish a diagnosis of probable BPH (Part I-Visit 1).
      The GP may perform a digital rectal examination (DRE) which will be repeated by the urologist
      to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out an abnormality suggesting prostate cancer. The GP
      will make a diagnosis of probable BPH based upon screening results and lab tests which
      suggest that they are related to BPH and not other causes of such symptoms. The GP will phone
      the subject to report yes or no for probable BPH Part II (Visit 2). If the subject has
      probable BPH, the GP will schedule the subject for Visit 3 with an urologist. If the subject
      does not have probable BPH, then it will be considered that the subject has completed the
      study. Subjects that proceed to Part II (Visit 3) will be scheduled for a urology assessment
      performed by an urologist. This assessment includes a DRE and a brief physical exam and
      review of the PSA test, for a confirmatory diagnosis of BPH and estimation of risk of
      progression of BPH. Approximately 1,500 subjects presenting to a GP for reasons unrelated to
      this study will be screened for probable BPH to yield 500 subjects being referred to an
      urologist. The duration of the study will be 1 week (+/- 4 days) and up to 6 weeks to allow
      for GP and urologist visit scheduling.

    <description>Confirmed diagnosis of BPH was based on full urologist diagnostic testing with a positive result on the BPE/BPO screening tool (score &gt;=3) and serum PSA &gt;=2 ng/mL. The BPE/BPO questionnaire consists of three questions each with a score ranging from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. Participants with probable BPH underwent full urologist diagnostic testing, which included review of medical history, symptoms and previous tests, brief physical examination, Digital rectal examination (DRE). Proportion of participants was calculated by dividing number of participants with a positive result on the BPE/BPO screening tool (Score &gt;= 3) and a diagnosis of BPH by the urologist (Numerator) by number of participants with a positive result on the BPE/BPO screening tool (Score &gt;= 3) and a BPH assessment by the urologist (Denominator). 95% confidence interval on the proportion was calculated by using the exact (Clopper-Pearson) method.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed risk for BPH was based on full urologist diagnostic testing with a positive result on the BPE/BPO and/or IPSS screening tool and probable GP BPH diagnosis. The BPE/BPO questionnaire consists of 3 questions each with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. IPSS tool is used to assess the severity of LUTS symptoms with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. Participants with probable BPH underwent full urologist diagnostic testing, which included review of medical history, symptoms and previous tests, physical examination, DRE. Participants with PSA &gt;=2.0 ng/mL and other tests were considered as at risk for BPH. Proportion of participants was calculated by dividing number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and diagnosis of BPH progression risk (Numerator) by number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and a BPH progression risk assessment by the urologist (Denominator).</description>

    <measure>Number of Men That Are Diagnosed With Probable BPH as Assessed by the GP Among Men With a Positive Result on the BPE/BPO, IPSS, BPE/BPO and IPSS, and BPE/BPO or IPSS Screening Tools</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnosis of probable BPH was based on GP assessment among men with a positive result on the BPE/BPO and/or IPSS screening tool. The BPE/BPO questionnaire consists of 3 questions each with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. IPSS tool is used to assess the severity of LUTS symptoms with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. Probable BPH is the presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction from an enlarged prostate based on clinical symptoms and findings where urinary symptoms are not apparently related to any other cause. Participants underwent GP assessment and lab result review by GP. Participants with PSA &gt;=2 ng/mL were assessed for probable BPH. Proportion of participants was calculated by dividing number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and diagnosis of probable BPH (Numerator) by number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and a BPH assessment by GP (Denominator).</description>

    <measure>Summary of Agreement Between BPE/BPO and IPSS Screening Tools</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement between the IPSS and BPE/BPO tools had to utilize the screened population, as the evaluable population did not include any participants with IPSS &lt;8 and BPE/BPO&lt;3. All screened participants with IPSS and BPE/BPO results were utilized (2327 of the 2343 participants had IPSS and BPE/PO results). There were 16 participants (2343 minus 2327) in the screened population without IPSS and BPE/BPO results, and hence were not included in the calculation of the Kappa statistic. Kappa statistic values of &lt;0 were characterized as no agreement, 0 to 0.20 as slight, 0.21 to 0.40 as fair, 0.41 to 0.60 as moderate, 0.61 to 0.80 as substantial, and 0.81 to 1.00 as almost perfect agreement. The 95% confidence interval for the Kappa statistic is based on the asymptotic standard error.</description>

    <description>Subjects presenting to a GP with a primary complaint other than LUTS will be screened for probable BPH using BPE/BPO screening tool and the IPSS screening tool. Subjects testing positive on the BPE/BPO screening tool or on the IPSS will be enrolled and offered a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test and urinalysis to establish a diagnosis of probable benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Part I - Visit 1). If the GP determines that the subject has probable BPH (IPSS &gt;=8 and/or BPE/BPO questionnaire &gt;=3 with a PSA &gt;=2 ng per ml), the subject will proceed to Part II and will be scheduled for an urologist assessment and diagnostic tests to confirm or refute a BPH diagnosis and to assess risk of progression of BPH.</description>

          <description>Participants were screened using the Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE)/ benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) screening tools. Participants with positive responses (i.e. met entry criteria, including positive IPSS score &gt;= 8 and/or BPE/BPO score &gt;= 3) were enrolled and proceeded to Part I (GP Assessment). Participants with probable BPH [PSA&gt;= 2 Nano gram per milliliter (ng/mL)] proceeded to Part II and were scheduled for a urologist assessment which was to confirm or refute a diagnosis of BPH and to estimate whether the participant is at risk of progression of BPH.</description>

        <title>Number of Men With Confirmed Diagnosis of BPH</title>
        <description>Confirmed diagnosis of BPH was based on full urologist diagnostic testing with a positive result on the BPE/BPO screening tool (score &gt;=3) and serum PSA &gt;=2 ng/mL. The BPE/BPO questionnaire consists of three questions each with a score ranging from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. Participants with probable BPH underwent full urologist diagnostic testing, which included review of medical history, symptoms and previous tests, brief physical examination, Digital rectal examination (DRE). Proportion of participants was calculated by dividing number of participants with a positive result on the BPE/BPO screening tool (Score &gt;= 3) and a diagnosis of BPH by the urologist (Numerator) by number of participants with a positive result on the BPE/BPO screening tool (Score &gt;= 3) and a BPH assessment by the urologist (Denominator). 95% confidence interval on the proportion was calculated by using the exact (Clopper-Pearson) method.</description>

IPSS tool is used to assess the severity of LUTS symptoms with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. Participants with probable BPH underwent full urologist diagnostic testing, which included review of medical history, symptoms and previous tests, physical examination, DRE. Participants with PSA &gt;=2.0 ng/mL and other tests were considered as at risk for BPH. Proportion of participants was calculated by dividing number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and diagnosis of BPH progression risk (Numerator) by number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and a BPH progression risk assessment by the urologist (Denominator).</description>

        <description>Diagnosis of probable BPH was based on GP assessment among men with a positive result on the BPE/BPO and/or IPSS screening tool. The BPE/BPO questionnaire consists of 3 questions each with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. IPSS tool is used to assess the severity of LUTS symptoms with a score from 0= never experienced to 5= almost always experienced. Probable BPH is the presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction from an enlarged prostate based on clinical symptoms and findings where urinary symptoms are not apparently related to any other cause. Participants underwent GP assessment and lab result review by GP. Participants with PSA &gt;=2 ng/mL were assessed for probable BPH. Proportion of participants was calculated by dividing number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and diagnosis of probable BPH (Numerator) by number of participants with a positive result on the screening tool and a BPH assessment by GP (Denominator).</description>

        <description>Agreement between the IPSS and BPE/BPO tools had to utilize the screened population, as the evaluable population did not include any participants with IPSS &lt;8 and BPE/BPO&lt;3. All screened participants with IPSS and BPE/BPO results were utilized (2327 of the 2343 participants had IPSS and BPE/PO results). There were 16 participants (2343 minus 2327) in the screened population without IPSS and BPE/BPO results, and hence were not included in the calculation of the Kappa statistic. Kappa statistic values of &lt;0 were characterized as no agreement, 0 to 0.20 as slight, 0.21 to 0.40 as fair, 0.41 to 0.60 as moderate, 0.61 to 0.80 as substantial, and 0.81 to 1.00 as almost perfect agreement.

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected from screening (Visit 1) through 6 weeks</time_frame>
      <desc>On-therapy SAEs and non-serious AEs are reported for members of All Evaluable Subjects Population which comprised of all participants who met the entry criteria, including a positive IPSS screening result (score &gt;=8) and/or a positive BPE/BPO screening result (score &gt;=3)</desc>

          <description>Participants were screened using the BPE/BPO and IPSS screening tools. Participants with positive responses to these tools (i.e. Participants met entry criteria, including a positive IPSS score &gt;= 8 or BPE/BPO score &gt;= 3) were enrolled and proceeded to Part I (GP Assessment) of the study. Participants with probable BPH (PSA &gt;= 2 ng/mL) proceeded to Part II and were scheduled for the urologist assessment to confirm diagnosis of BPH and to estimate whether the participant was at risk of progression of BPH</description>
