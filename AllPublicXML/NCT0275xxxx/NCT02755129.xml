      The aim of this study is to evaluate sit-stand phases and gait speed detection using an
      externally worn Reveal LINQ (TM) compared to an external reference (3D accelerometer, and/or
      the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) system) in one center in the
      Netherlands

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by reduced homeostatic reserves, exposing the
      organism to extreme vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors.

      Frailty is prevalent in older people and involves a progressive physiological decline of
      multiple body systems, typical signs and symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, muscle
      weakness, slow or unsteady gait declines in activity.

      Frailty is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic indicator in heart failure (HF)
      and is more prevalent in HF than the general population.

      The identification of frailty in its early stage is important because interventions may
      potentially prevent, or delay the clinical consequences of frailty.

      Of particular focus in this study will be walking speed as prior research has demonstrated
      that slow gait speed has the strongest prognostic ability of the traditional components used
      to assess frailty, and has been reported as one of the strongest to predict adverse outcomes,
      such as mobility disability, falls, or hospitalization.

      Also of interest is the detection of posture changes as this may have implications for
      detecting changes in sleeping habits and could also provide context for other biomarker
      signals collected by the LINQ device.

      The literature has been reviewed and the scientific soundness of the proposed analytical
      techniques evaluated. The rationale for this study design is to evaluate the feasibility of
      using the Reveal LINQ™ to monitoring walking patterns.

      HF patients (the target population for the study in discussion) would make it possible to
      test the sensitivity of the accelerometer embedded in the LINQ device in a small cohort of
      subjects with reduced mobility and for which frailty is more prevalent than the general
      population, as well as recognized as an important prognostic indicator.

      No risk to the subjects is expected with this study.

    <description>The gait speed will be calculated from the Reveal LINQ accelerometer signals, from the validation accelerometer and / or from the computer assisted rehabilitation system during the walking exercises.
We will calculate the average correlation coefficient over all patients and exercises.
It is reported as score on a scale, with minimum value= -1 and maximum value = 1.
Higher absolute values mean higher correlation.</description>

    <description>Single arm, all the patients enrolled will perform the same walking exercises.
On arrival to the rehabilitation center subjects will have the Reveal LINQ, the 3D-accelerometers (one on the chest by medical-grade adhesives and a second at the level of the waist over the top of a medical grade adhesive) and the Holter attached externally. Then, they will be asked to perform the following exercises:

It will be repeated 3 times within the aforementioned 6MW test (after approximately 1, 3 and 5 minutes) to get variability due to subject tiredness. The test will be performed within the CAREN system environment. - single arm</description>

            <description>Patients with Chronic Heart Failure. No control group used. All patients enrolled performed the same walking exercises. On arrival to the rehabilitation center subjects will have the Reveal LINQ, the 3D-accelerometers (one on the chest by medical-grade adhesives and a second at the level of the waist over the top of a medical grade adhesive) and the Holter attached externally. Then, the correlation coefficient for gait speed across devices for Six Minute Walk (6MW) Test is calculated.</description>

          <title>Correlation of Gait Speed Between Reveal LINQ Accelerometer, Validation Accelerometer and/or Computer Assisted Rehabilitation System by Walking Exercises</title>
          <description>The gait speed will be calculated from the Reveal LINQ accelerometer signals, from the validation accelerometer and / or from the computer assisted rehabilitation system during the walking exercises.
We will calculate the average correlation coefficient over all patients and exercises.
It is reported as score on a scale, with minimum value= -1 and maximum value = 1.
Higher absolute values mean higher correlation.</description>
