  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-blind study is to compare the frequency of primary
      patency at 6 months in patients with stenosis of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) treated either
      by conventional angioplasty + angioplasty with balloon impregnated with paclitaxel or by
      conventional angioplasty + angioplasty with placebo balloon (balloon not impregnated with
      paclitaxel).

      The other objectives of the study are:

        1. To compare the frequency of primary patency at 3 months and 12 months.

        2. To compare the rate of restenosis &gt; 50% at the site of angioplasty at 3, 6 and 12
           months.

        3. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the proportion of patients with arteriovenous fistula
           deteriorating back to preoperative flow rate (within 20% of preoperative flow rate).

        4. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the proportion of AVF with a flow rate &lt; 500 ml /
           min.

        5. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the cumulative rate of thrombosis.

        6. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the medical costs related to direct medical care,
           initial treatments, monitoring, diagnosis and treatments of complications.

      Experimental design: prospective randomized, double blind, multicenter controlled study, with
      2 experimental arms.

      12 centers will participate in France, targeting to enrol 150 patients in total. Each patient
      will undergo angiography at the beginning of the intervention in order to confirm the
      presence of only one stenosis, to assess the degree of stenosis and to evaluate the vascular
      diameter.

      All patients will first undergo angioplasty using standard balloons. thereafter, depending on
      randomization arm, an additional angioplasty will be performed during 1 minute with a
      paclitaxel impregnated balloon (active arm) or with a placebo balloon (placebo arm).

      The duration of inclusion is planned for 18 months.

      Each patient will have a 12-month follow-up.
