  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the LINQ™ HF study is to characterize Reveal LINQ™ derived data from patients
      with heart failure by assessing the relationship between changes in LINQ™ derived data and
      other physiologic parameters with subsequent acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) events.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, observational, pre-market clinical
      study. The study is expected to be conducted at up to 30 centers in the United States. Up to
      300 subjects will be enrolled to achieve approximately 40 heart failure events (no more than
      two per subject will contribute to the cumulative total). Study subjects will be followed for
      up to 3 years post-insertion or until official study closure defined as when Medtronic and/or
      regulatory requirements have been satisfied per the Clinical Investigation Plan and/or by a
      decision by Medtronic or regulatory authority, whichever occurs first. The expected study
      duration is approximately 4 years representing 1.5 years of enrollments and 2.5 years of
      follow-up.

      The LINQ™ HF study is a Non-Significant Risk Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study.
      The study is utilizing the Reveal LINQ™ device with an investigational LINQ™ HF RAMware
      download.

    <description>A heart failure (HF) event is defined as any cardiovascular-related Health Care Utilizations (HCUs) for any one of the following events.
Admission with primary diagnosis of HF
Intravenous HF therapy (e.g. IV diuretics/vasodilators) or ultrafiltration at any one of the following settings:
Admission with secondary/tertiary diagnosis of HF
Emergency Department
Ambulance
Observation Unit
Urgent Care
HF/Cardiology Clinic
Up to 2 ADHF events were intended to be allowed per subject:
One had to be at least 30 days post-Reveal LINQ insertion and is summarized in this section, and
A possible second ADHF event must be greater than 90 days after the first ADHF event
Only subjects with a LINQ device were included in the analysis, as the goal was to acquire LINQ-collected data leading up to the ADHF event.</description>

        <description>A heart failure (HF) event is defined as any cardiovascular-related Health Care Utilizations (HCUs) for any one of the following events.
Admission with primary diagnosis of HF
Intravenous HF therapy (e.g. IV diuretics/vasodilators) or ultrafiltration at any one of the following settings:
Admission with secondary/tertiary diagnosis of HF
Emergency Department
Ambulance
Observation Unit
Urgent Care
HF/Cardiology Clinic
Up to 2 ADHF events were intended to be allowed per subject:
One had to be at least 30 days post-Reveal LINQ insertion and is summarized in this section, and
A possible second ADHF event must be greater than 90 days after the first ADHF event
Only subjects with a LINQ device were included in the analysis, as the goal was to acquire LINQ-collected data leading up to the ADHF event.</description>
