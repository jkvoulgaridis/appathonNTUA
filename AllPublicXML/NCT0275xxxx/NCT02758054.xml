      The study proposes to evaluate a patient navigation intervention among a sample of 446
      individuals referred for CT-based lung cancer screening in an urban safety-net setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Widespread implementation of CT-based lung cancer screening is underway, but its impact on
      cancer morbidity and mortality can only be achieved IF people are screened at appropriate
      intervals and abnormal findings are appropriately assessed. The degree to which individuals,
      especially those from medically underserved populations with highest lung cancer risks, will
      adhere to the complex, multi-step process of CT-based lung cancer screening has emerged as a
      key question with immediate need for solution. Specific aims of the study are as follows:

        -  Aim 1: Compare rates of completion for clinically recommended steps in the lung cancer
           screening process between patients referred for CT-based lung cancer screening who are
           randomized to the navigation intervention versus patients who receive usual care.

        -  Aim 2: Compare changes in patient-reported outcomes, including satisfaction with care,
           psychosocial distress, and tobacco use between patients in the navigation intervention
           versus those who receive usual care for the CT-based lung cancer screening process.

        -  Aim 3 (Exploratory): Explore whether differences seen in Aims 1 and 2 are moderated
           theory-based patient attitudes and beliefs (perceived susceptibility, severity of lung
           cancer, perceived benefits/barriers to screening, self-efficacy).

      This study will offer unprecedented insight into implementation of lung cancer screening for
      high-risk individuals in underserved settings. Findings will show whether navigation
      interventions increase adherence to the screening process and affect patient-reported
      outcomes among underserved populations. The proposed program aims to address these issues for
      lung cancer screening at its inception, rather than after disparities in screening uptake
      have already emerged.
