    <textblock>
      This phase I pilot trial studies the side effects of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T
      cells in treating patients with gastrointestinal tumors that have spread to other places in
      the body. Tumor cells and blood are used to help create an adoptive T cell therapy, such as
      CD8+ T cell therapy, that is individually designed for a patient and may help doctors learn
      more about genetic changes in the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving CD8+ T cell therapy and pembrolizumab
      may work better in treating patients with gastrointestinal tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety of using a personalized adoptive T cell therapy in patients with
      advanced gastrointestinal malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the persistence of an immune response after T cell infusion. II. Determine the
      clinical benefit of adoptive T cell therapy in advanced gastrointestinal cancers.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 2 days prior to CD8+ T cell infusion, patients receive cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients undergo CD8+ T cell infusion IV over 2 hours on
      day 0 and receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Beginning
      on day 1 about 24 hours after CD8+ T cell infusion, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over
      30-60 minutes on weeks 3, 6, 12, and 15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 24 weeks.

        Inclusion:

          1. Histopathologic documentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma,
             cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal cancer and gastric cancer with radiographic evidence of
             metastatic disease.

          2. Male or female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          3. ECOG/ Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1.

          4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk
             of pregnancy is minimized. Suggested precautions should be used to minimize the risk
             or pregnancy for at least 1 month before start of therapy, and while women are on
             study for at least 8 weeks after pembrolizumab is stopped. WOCBP include any female
             who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is
             not postmenopausal. Acceptable forms of birth control include condom, diaphragm,
             hormonal, IUD, or sponge plus spermacide. Abstinence is also an acceptable form of
             birth control.

          5. Men must be willing and able to use an acceptable method of birth control, during and
             for at least 3 months after completion of the study, if their sexual partners are
             WOCBP.

          6. Willing and able to give informed consent.

          7. Adequate vein access: consider PICC or other central line.

          8. Patients must have adequate tissue (fresh or frozen) available or planned removal of
             adequate tissue for analysis. At least 250mg of tumor are needed for peptide elution.
             There is no specific time limit on how long the tissue can remain frozen prior to use.
             The tissue will be collected and analyzed under Lab protocol PA15-0176.

          9. Patients can have any lines (including zero) of prior therapy to sign consent prior to
             tissue harvest.

         10. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to &lt;/= grade 1, baseline,
             or been deemed irreversible.

         11. ELIGIBILITY FOR TREATMENT: ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2.

         12. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease by radiographic imaging (CT scan) that represents
             at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1.

         13. At least 4 Weeks must have elapsed since the last chemotherapy, radiotherapy or major
             surgery.

         14. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to less than or equal to
             grade 1, baseline, or been deemed irreversible.

         15. Subjects must have received at least one line of chemotherapy prior to receiving
             adoptive T cell therapy and should have exhausted standard of care systemic therapy
             options. The decision to implement the T cell therapy will be at the discretion of the
             treating physician. The timing and total exposure to chemotherapy will depend on the
             tumor type in question (more systemic options for breast cancer; fewer for gastric
             cancer, for example). Due to the heterogeneity of tumors being treated in this
             protocol, the discretion of the treating physician in terms of timing of immunotherapy
             will be critical.

        Exclusion:

          1. EXCLUSION FOR ENROLLMENT: Any other malignancy from which the patient has been
             disease-free for less than 5 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix.

          2. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, men or women of reproductive ability who are
             unwilling to use effective contraception. Women of childbearing potential with a
             positive pregnancy test within 3 days prior to entry.

          3. Significant cardiovascular abnormalities as defined by any one of the following: 1.
             Congestive heart failure NYHA classes II-IV. Patients with asymptomatic class I CHF
             may participate in conjunction with a Cardiology consultation. 2. Clinically
             significant hypotension. 3. Symptoms of coronary artery disease. 4. Presence of
             arrhythmias in EKG requiring drug therapy.

          4. Active and untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases (including metastasis
             identified during screening MRI or contrast CT). Patients with asymptomatic, treated
             metastases may be eligible if their lesion(s) have demonstrated stability over 2
             months.

          5. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease are excluded
             from this study, as are patients with a history of autoimmune disease (e.g. Systemic
             Lupus Erythematosus, vasculitis, infiltrating lung disease) whose possible progression
             during treatment would be considered by the Investigator to be unacceptable.

          6. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events, such as a condition associated with frequent
             diarrhea.

             2.5 x ULN. Bilirubin greater than or equal to 2.0 x ULN

          8. Positive screening tests for HIV, Hep B, and Hep C. If positive results are not

             therapy.

         12. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         13. Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for the prevention of infectious disease within
             1 month before or after any anti-PD-1 dose.
