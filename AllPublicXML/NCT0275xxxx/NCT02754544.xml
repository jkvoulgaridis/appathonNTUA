  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well electrocorticography works in mapping functional
      brain areas during surgery in patients with brain tumors. Using a larger than the standard
      mapping grid currently used during brain tumor surgery or a high-definition grid for
      electrocorticogram brain mapping may help doctors to better identify which areas of the brain
      are active during specific limb movement and speech during surgery in patients with brain
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To record electrocorticogram (ECoG) data intraoperatively with surface electrode grids
      during various motor, sensory (tactile) and speech tasks, and identify functional brain areas
      through the spectral analysis, and compare the preliminary data with our current pre-surgical
      mapping methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), and the gold standard, intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To perform a preliminary assessment of the utility of using ECoG data in these patients to
      quantify new neurological deficits in the short term (24 hours) and long-term (1 and 3
      months), and achieve a safe maximal tumor resection.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo tumor resection. During surgery, patients also undergo electrocorticography
      with either the CorTec high resolution hybrid grid, the PMT high-resolution grid, or the
      Ad-Tech grid followed by direct electrocortical stimulation.

      Following completion of study, patients are followed up within 24 hours from surgery and at 1
      and 3 months.

    <description>Will be assessed by cortical electrical activity based on individual hand muscle function. ECoG will be compared to direct electrical stimulation (DES), navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The data obtained using ECoG will be correlated with the fMRI and TMS data acquired preoperatively and intraoperative DES. The categorical variables would be preoperative Karnofsky performance status and functional status, tumor location, fMRI, TMS, ECoG, and DES data points. Other variables involved in the analysis would be extent of resection and neurological outcome. The Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests will be used to explore associations between categorical variables. Additional analysis may be performed.</description>
