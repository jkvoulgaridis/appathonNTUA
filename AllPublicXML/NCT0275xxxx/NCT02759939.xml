      Right For Me is a study that aims to improve the conversations patients and health care
      providers have about birth control. Right For Me will test two different strategies for
      improving these conversations. The first strategy is to give patients a video to watch that
      encourages them to ask three specific questions in their health care visit, as well as a
      prompt card that reminds them of the three questions. The second strategy is to give health
      care providers a set of decision aids that describe available birth control methods, as well
      as training in how to use them with patients during the health care visit. Right For Me will
      test whether introducing one or both of these strategies leads to better conversations than
      providing health care as usual.

    <measure>Shared Decision-making About Contraceptive Methods</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the index health care visit (Time 1 (T1)) [for both pre-implementation and post-implementation participants]</time_frame>
    <description>Shared decision-making about contraceptive methods in the health care visit, measured using the three-item CollaboRATE measure (Barr et al., 2014; Elwyn et al., 2013). We used the version of CollaboRATE with a five-point response scale and adopted the binary scoring approach, which yields a score of 0 (no shared decision-making) and 1 (shared decision-making) for each participant. Note: 'pre-implementation participants' comprise those enrolled in the trial before clinics began implementing interventions and 'post-implementation participants' comprise those enrolled in the trial after clinics began implementing interventions (if relevant).</description>

        <description>Shared decision-making about contraceptive methods in the health care visit, measured using the three-item CollaboRATE measure (Barr et al., 2014; Elwyn et al., 2013). We used the version of CollaboRATE with a five-point response scale and adopted the binary scoring approach, which yields a score of 0 (no shared decision-making) and 1 (shared decision-making) for each participant. Note: 'pre-implementation participants' comprise those enrolled in the trial before clinics began implementing interventions and 'post-implementation participants' comprise those enrolled in the trial after clinics began implementing interventions (if relevant).</description>
