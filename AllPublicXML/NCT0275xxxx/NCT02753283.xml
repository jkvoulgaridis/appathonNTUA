      The purpose of this research study is to find out if denosumab (Prolia®), an injection given
      in the arm under the skin every 6 months, works to treat bone loss and prevent it from
      worsening in older men and women (ages 65 and older) who have osteoporosis and reside in
      long-term care (LTC) facilities.

      Objective:

      The long term goal is to improve health, well-being and quality of life in the frail
      long-term care (LTC) elderly population by reducing fractures. The short term goal is to
      demonstrate efficacy of the non-bisphosphonate denosumab to improve bone mineral density
      (BMD), a necessary (but not sufficient) pre-condition of a large fracture reduction trial.
      The investigators propose to conduct a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, calcium-vitamin D
      controlled trial to test the efficacy and predictability of the antiresorptive RANK ligand
      inhibitor, denosumab (60 mg), among a cohort of 212 institutionalized, under-served, frail
      men and women ≥65 years old in LTC.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: To evaluate efficacy of denosumab in improving/maintaining bone mineral density. The
      investigators will measure conventional hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD).

      Primary Hypothesis: After 2 years, women and men on denosumab will have greater hip and spine
      BMD increases.

      Zoledronic Acid Infusion Safety Treatment and Follow-up Extension:

      After the trial was started, case reports suggested a potential increase in fracture risk
      with disuse. A post hoc analysis that combined the pivotal denosumab trial and extension
      trial data suggested there was an increase in multiple vertebral fractures when patients
      discontinued therapy. Following discontinuation of denosumab/placebo, all patients will be
      offered treatment with 1 dose of intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg. For those consenting to
      receive end of study treatment, the zoledronic acid will be given at month 27 for an
      individual patient.

      Zoledronic Acid Safety Infusion Extension Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: To evaluate maintenance of bone mineral density (BMD). Zoledronic acid will be
      administered intravenously at 9 months post-denosumab (month 27) and assess BMD by DXA at
      months 33 and 39 (6 months and 12 months after zoledronic acid infusion).

      Primary Hypothesis: Zoledronic acid will prevent BMD loss at the spine and hip following
      denosumab discontinuation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ambulatory male and female residents with osteoporosis or low bone mass (at risk for
        fracture) ages 65 and older will be considered if:

          -  Reside in long-term care institution (nursing home or assisted living facility); and

          -  HaveOsteoporosis: (1) by bone density [spine, hip or forearm Bone Mineral Density
             (BMD) T-score ≤ -2.5]; (2) A previous adult fragility fracture of the spine or hip; or
             (3) Would be treated based on FRAX® and the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)
             treatment thresholds of a 10 year risk of ≥ 20% for a major fracture or ≥ 3% for hip
             fracture suing femoral neck BMD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Institutionalized residents with subacute illnesses who are not expected to survive or
             who will be discharged in &lt; 2 years.

          -  Non-ambulatory residents (those who cannot stand and pivot with assistance in order to
             transfer to the DXA table).

          -  Those currently on therapy (including bisphosphonate, denosumab, or teriparatide) or
             who have been on a bisphosphonate for &gt; 1year during the previous 2 years because some
             bisphosphonates are long acting.

          -  Those with a history of hypocalcemia or contraindication for treatment. We will screen
             for these conditions by detailed history, chart review, and baseline laboratory
             analyses.

          -  Those with vitamin D levels &lt; 25ng/mL will be treated with vitamin D 50,000 IU/wk for
             8 weeks; they will be enrolled if the follow-up vitamin D level is 25 ng/mL or more
             (if after 2 rounds of vitamin D repletion their vitamin D level is not at least 25
             ng/mL, they will not be eligible to be randomized into the study).

          -  Those on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (eGFR&lt;15ml/min) will be
             excluded at screening.

          -  Those requiring tooth extraction or oral surgery will not be enrolled until cleared by
             a dentist.

          -  Patients will be allowed to continue on glucocorticoids and anticonvulsants because
             their use is common in this population.

          -  Those on glucocorticoids and anticonvulsants will be allowed to continue in the study
             because their use is common in this population.

          -  Those on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), raloxifene, or prescribed protective hip
             pads by their Primary Care Physician (PCP) will be allowed to participate and continue
             on these therapies.

          -  We will suggest that participants stop long-term calcitonin as it has been
             discontinued in Europe due to cancer concerns.
