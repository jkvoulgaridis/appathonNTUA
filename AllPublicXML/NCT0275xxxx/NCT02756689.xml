  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing a randomized controlled-trial investigating starting
      cervical ripening in the outpatient setting with a mechanical method, the transcervical Foley
      catheter. This is a pilot study to establish the efficacy of this method in decreasing time
      as in inpatient and evaluate patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is necessary in one-fourth of women and a large proportion requires
      cervical ripening. Cervical ripening is necessary to shorten the time to delivery and
      increases the chances of a vaginal delivery.

      Outpatient cervical ripening is an attractive alternative to women and physicians because of
      the decreased amount of time spent in the hospital and opportunity for patients to be in the
      comforts of their home.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing outpatient to
      inpatient cervical ripening using a transcervical Foley catheter. Women will be randomized to
      undergo inpatient or outpatient transcervical Foley catheter cervical ripening beyond their
      39th week of gestation. Women and their infants will be followed until the time of their
      discharge.
