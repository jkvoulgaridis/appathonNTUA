      This study will be a multicenter and open label trial. The trial has three phases; the
      screening phase, treatment phase and post-treatment phase. The screening phase comprises a
      screening visit where subject's initial eligibility will be evaluated. During open label
      treatment phase, all patients will be administered NPC-15 1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg on the basis of
      their doctors' judgements.
