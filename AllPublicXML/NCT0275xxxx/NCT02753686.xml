  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of efficacy, generalization of
      these results to patients in the real-world setting is challenging, given RCTs are conducted
      in highly selected patient populations.

      An understanding of the effectiveness of approved cancer therapies in routine clinical
      practice is essential in order to optimize the management of these patients and to identify
      treatment and monitoring gaps.

      This is the first Canadian study to describe real-world treatment patterns/sequencing,
      effectiveness and monitoring for men and pre/postmenopausal HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer
      patients. This registry incorporates an observational prospective cohort design and will
      enroll 500 men and pre/postmenopausal HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer women that have been
      exposed to endocrine therapy (ET) or ET in combination with targeted therapy (TT) including
      patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy combinations..

          4. Patient has ER positive and/or PgR positive HER2-negative breast cancer by local
             laboratory testing (based on most recently analyzed biopsy).

          5. In the case of women, both pre/perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients are allowed
             to be included in this study.

               1. Postmenopausal status is defined as per investigator's judgment. Definition
                  included as guidance only:

        1. Prior bilateral oophorectomy 2. Or age ≥60 3. Or age &lt; 60 and amenorrhea for 12 or more
        months (in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifen, or ovarian suppression), and
        FSH and estradiol in the postmenopausal range per local normal range. If patient is taking
        tamoxifen or toremifene and age &lt; 60, then FSH and plasma estradiol levels should be in
        postmenopausal range per local normal range.

        b) Premenopausal status is defined as per investigator's judgment. Definition included as
        guidance only:

        1. Patient had last menstrual period within the last 12 months 2. Or if on tamoxifen or
        toremifene within the past 14 days, plasma estradiol and FSH must be in the premenopausal
        range per local normal range 3. Or in case of therapy induced amenorrhea, plasma estradiol
        and/or FSH must be in the premenopausal range per local normal range.

        c) Perimenopausal status is defined as neither premenopausal nor postmenopausal as per
        investigator's judgment.

        6. Patient having received maximum one prior chemotherapy line for advanced/metastatic
        breast cancer is allowed.

        Note: A chemotherapy line in advanced disease is an anticancer regimen(s) that contains at
        least 1 cytotoxic chemotherapy agent and given for 21 days or longer. If a cytotoxic
        chemotherapy regimen was discontinued for a reason other than disease progression and
        lasted less than 21 days, then this regimen does not count as a &quot;prior line of
        chemotherapy&quot;.

        7. Patient receiving targeted therapy plus endocrine therapy (ET+TT) in either the 1st, 2nd
        or 3rd line or endocrine therapy alone (ET) in either the 2nd or 3rd line advanced
        metastatic setting:

          1. as per approved Health Canada indication OR

          2. as per available expanded treatment protocol(s) only if efficacy assessments in these
             protocols are considered routine standard of care OR

          3. as per available compassionate / expanded access program

             Notes: 1. Date of initiation of treatment should be a maximum of 12 months prior to
             the date of enrollment in this study for patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy
             based combinations. Date of initiation of treatment should be a maximum of 1 month
             prior to the date of enrollment in this study for patients receiving all other
             endocrine monotherapies or combination therapies. 2. 1st, 2nd and 3rd line therapy in
             the advanced setting is defined as the first, second and third treatment received
             respectively in the metastatic setting (which could include endocrine monotherapy,
             targeted therapy combination with endocrine therapy or chemotherapy). 3. 3. Patients
             enrolled in the ET cohort must have received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor for
             advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Patients who have received two subsequent lines of
             CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy are allowed.

             8. The decision to use ET or ET+TT has been reached prior to and independently of the
             current study.

             9. Patient willing to be followed according to routine standard of care practice.

                  (however patient could have received up to one line of chemotherapy in the
                  metastatic setting prior to study entry or as a subsequent therapy after
                  completion of ET or ET+TT treatment).

               2. Patient having received more than 3 lines of therapy in the metastatic setting.

               3. Any contraindications to the study treatments as presented in the respective

                  with the exception expanded treatment protocol or access program where efficacy
                  assessments are considered routine standard of care.

               5. Patient is undergoing any treatment that is not considered standard of care as
                  per regional policies and guidelines with the exception of treatments accessed
