  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide oral domperidone to patients with gastroparesis,
      between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age, who have failed standard treatment. Standard
      therapy at the University of Iowa is eating blended foods, liquid diet, Eryped syrup (125 mg
      TID) 30 minutes before meals, or reglan (20 mg BID).

    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use research study for a non-FDA approved drug. We are inviting
      patients to participate in this research study because they have nausea and vomiting related
      to gastroparesis and have failed standard therapy. The purpose of this research study is to
      prescribe patients with domperidone. Domperidone is considered investigational, which means
      that it has not been approved by the FDA.
