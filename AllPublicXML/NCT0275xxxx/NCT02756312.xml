  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although bench data and retrospective studies have provided a promising picture of the
      possible influence of anesthetic technique on the risk of tumor progression and patients
      mortality, current evidence from RCTs is inadequate to show whether the type of anesthetics
      might influence tumor progression and patient survival.There are many thousands of patients
      with a cancer diagnosis undergoing surgery every year, and in the context of biological
      plausibility, it should lead to the urgent undertaking of RCTs to further evaluate the
      association between the anesthetic management and postoperative high-grade glioma
      progression.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single centre, randomized, parallel group controlled clinical trial in patients with primary HGG. All eligible patients will be 1:1 randomized to the TIVA or INHA group. The object of the trail is to evaluate the effect of propofol or sevoflurane on the prognosis of supratentorial HGG patients after craniotomy.</intervention_model_description>
