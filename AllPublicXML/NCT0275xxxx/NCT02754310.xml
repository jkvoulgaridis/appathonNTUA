  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated exposure to simulated cases has been shown to improve performance, but repeating the
      same scenario may impair the ability of learners to transfer their knowledge and skills to
      slightly different situations. The objective of this study is to compare the use of repeated
      versus varied simulation cases for teaching the management of pediatric asthma exacerbation
      to 3rd year medical students.

    <measure>Management Score on Transfer Scenario n°1</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°1 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric asthma exacerbation rapidly worsening.
The scale &quot;Asthma exacerbation rapidly worsening&quot; includes different items related to the sequence, the dose, and the administration technique of the treatments. The score ranges between 0 and 10, 10 meaning perfect management of the medical condition. The detailed scale can be found in the supplementary material of the article published here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-017-3054-1.</description>

    <measure>Management Score on Transfer Scenario n°2</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°2 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric pneumonia. Students are expected to realize that the child's presentation differs from an asthma exacerbation and should not start short-acting beta agonists nor steroids.
The scale &quot;Pediatric Pneumonia&quot; includes different items related to the sequence of the treatments administered. The score ranges between 0 and 4, 4 meaning perfect management of the medical condition. The detailed scale can be found in the supplementary material of the article published here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-017-3054-1.</description>

    <measure>Management Score on Evaluation Scenario n°1</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation scenario n°1 is a scenario of a moderate asthma exacerbation not responding to treatment, used during the learning phase of both groups (3 times for the group &quot;repetition&quot; and just once for the group &quot;variation&quot;).
The scale &quot;moderate asthma exacerbation&quot; includes different items related to the sequence, the dose, and the administration technique of the treatments. The score ranges between 0 and 16, 16 meaning perfect management of the medical condition. The detailed scale can be found in the supplementary material of the article published here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-017-3054-1.</description>

The score ranges between 0 and 9, 9 meaning perfect management of the medical condition.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°3 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a severe asthma exacerbation improving before relapsing.The scale &quot;Asthma exacerbation improving then relapsing&quot; includes different items related to the sequence, the dose, and the administration technique of the treatments. The score ranges between 0 and 16, 16 meaning perfect management of the medical condition. The detailed scale can be found in the supplementary material of the article published here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-017-3054-1.</description>

    <measure>Management Score on Transfer Scenario n°4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°4 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric laryngitis. Students are expected to realize that the child's presentation differs from an asthma exacerbation and should not start short-acting beta agonists.
The scale &quot;Pediatric laryngitis&quot; includes different items related to the sequence and the dose of the treatments provided. The score ranges between 0 and 3, 3 meaning perfect management of the medical condition.

The scale &quot;Asthma exacerbation rapidly worsening&quot; includes different items related to the sequence, the dose, and the administration technique of the treatments. The score ranges between 0 and 10, 10 meaning perfect management of the medical condition. The detailed scale can be found in the supplementary material of the article published here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-017-3054-1.</description>

        <title>Management Score on Transfer Scenario n°4</title>
        <description>The transfer scenario n°4 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric laryngitis. Students are expected to realize that the child's presentation differs from an asthma exacerbation and should not start short-acting beta agonists.
The scale &quot;Pediatric laryngitis&quot; includes different items related to the sequence and the dose of the treatments provided. The score ranges between 0 and 3, 3 meaning perfect management of the medical condition. The detailed scale can be found in the supplementary material of the article published here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-017-3054-1.</description>
