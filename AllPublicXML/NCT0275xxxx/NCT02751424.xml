  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I, first-time-in-human (FTIH), randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      dose-escalation study is conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of GSK3342830 after administration of single intravenous (IV) infusion in Part 1
      and repeat IV infusion in Part 2 in healthy subjects. Part 1 will investigate escalating
      single IV doses of GSK3342830. Part 2, will investigate escalating repeat IV doses of
      GSK3342830 with repeat dosing for 15 days as follows: a single IV infusion on Day 1, TID
      (three times a day) IV infusions on Days 2 through 14 (approximately every 8 hours), and a
      single IV infusion on Day 15. The planned starting GSK3342830 dose in Part 1 is 250 milligram
      (mg) administered as a single IV infusion. The dose is planned to increase in subsequent
      cohorts to 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and less than or equal to (≤) 6000 mg. Part 1 will be
      divided into 6 cohorts (A-F) and each cohort will enroll 10 subjects (6 in active and 2 in
      placebo). Dose escalation will be conducted only if it is supported by the preliminary
      safety, tolerability, and PK results from the preceding dose levels in the study. The repeat
      dose escalation component (Part 2) of this study will be planned to be initiated after
      completion and evaluation of the all single dose cohorts up to and including 4000 mg.

             &gt;450 msec.. Also apart from this, subject having evidence of previous myocardial
             infarction, bundle branch block and Any conduction abnormality (including but not

Single ECGs were obtained at all other time points on Day 1 at 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 1.5 hr, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hr, Day 2 (36 hr) and Day 3 (48 hr) during Part 1 (single dose escalation phase) of the study. All the 12-lead ECGs were measured using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals.</description>

The number of participants with vital values, of PCI were reported. These were collected on Day 1 at pre-dose, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 1.5 hr, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hr, Day 2 (36 hr) and Day 3 (48 hr) during Part 1 (single dose escalation phase) of the study.</description>
