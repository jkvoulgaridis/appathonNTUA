        <description>Percentage of participants who did not require rescue medication for Sedation (Midazolam) based on the data of investigator's judgement and State Behavioral Scale (SBS) (which was a sedation assessment instrument for intubated participants and its score ranges from 2 to -3, where 2= agitated, 1= restless and difficult to calm, 0= awake and able to calm, -1= responsive to gentle touch or voice, -2= responsive to noxious stimuli and -3= unresponsive. During intubation [placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs], the target sedation depth by SBS was -2 to 0, where higher score indicated more responsive and after extubation [removal of endotracheal tube], the target sedation depth was −1 to 0, where higher score indicated more responsive) were reported.</description>

          <description>Percentage of time duration for which the target sedation level was maintained during the specified evaluation period within participants was reported. Target sedation level was analyzed by target sedation scores by using the state behavioral scale (SBS). SBS is a sedation assessment instrument and it's score ranges from 2 to -3, where 2= agitated, 1= restless and difficult to calm, 0= awake and able to calm, -1= responsive to gentle touch or voice, -2= responsive to noxious stimuli and -3= non-responsive. During intubation the target sedation depth by SBS was -2 to 0, where higher score indicated more responsive and after extubation, the target sedation depth was −1 to 0, where higher score indicated more responsive.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. Here “N” signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this specified outcome measure.</population>

        <description>Time duration for which the target sedation level was maintained during the specified evaluation period within participants was reported. Target sedation level was analyzed by target sedation scores by using the state behavioral scale (SBS). SBS is a sedation assessment instrument for intubated participants and its score ranges from 2 to -3, where 2= agitated, 1= restless and difficult to calm, 0= awake and able to calm, -1= responsive to gentle touch or voice, -2= responsive to noxious stimuli and -3= unresponsive. During intubation (placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs), the target sedation depth by SBS was -2 to 0, where higher score indicated more stability and after extubation (removal of endotracheal tube), the target sedation depth was −1 to 0, where higher score indicated more stability.</description>

        <title>Duration of Maintenance of Target Sedation Level After Extubation</title>
        <description>Time duration for which the target sedation level was maintained during the specified evaluation period within participants was reported. Target sedation level was analyzed by target sedation scores by using the state behavioral scale (SBS). SBS is a sedation assessment instrument for intubated participants and its score ranges from 2 to -3, where 2= agitated, 1= restless and difficult to calm, 0= awake and able to calm, -1= responsive to gentle touch or voice, -2= responsive to noxious stimuli and -3= unresponsive. During intubation (placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs), the target sedation depth by SBS was -2 to 0, where higher score indicated more responsive and after extubation (removal of endotracheal tube), the target sedation depth was −1 to 0, where higher score indicated more responsive.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. Here “N” signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this specified outcome measure.</population>
