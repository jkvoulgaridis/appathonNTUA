    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of RefortrixTM (Tdap) when administered
      during pregnancy in a maternal immunization program in Brazil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this retrospective cohort study the safety of RefortrixTM (Tdap) administered during
      pregnancy as part of the National immunization program in Brazil will be assessed by
      comparing the risk of pre-defined adverse events before and after introduction of the
      RefortrixTM (Tdap) maternal immunization program.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Gestational Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>After week 27 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Gestational diabetes was defined as: Onset or first recognition of abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy (the diagnosis is based on administration of glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks of gestation). Includes Class A1: Euglycaemia achieved with diet and/or exercise and Class A2: Euglycaemia achieved with medication.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Pregnancy-related Hypertension, Pre-eclampsia, Eclampsia, and HELLP Syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>After week 27 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy-related hypertension is defined as:
Blood pressure systolic higher than (&gt;) 140 and/or diastolic &gt; 90 millimetre of mercury (mmHg), documented in at least two separate measurements after 20 weeks of gestation, without proteinuria or other stigmata of pre-eclampsia, and returning to normal post-partum. Hypertension usually resolves by 12 weeks post-partum, included pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and haemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelet (HELLP) Syndrome for this study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Pregnancy Hemorrhage</measure>
    <time_frame>After week 27 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy vaginal hemorrhage is defined as: excessive blood loss after delivery i.e. estimated blood loss in excess of 500 milliliters (ml) after vaginal delivery and estimated blood loss in excess of 1000 ml after Caesarean delivery. The other symptoms are higher than or equal to (â‰¥) 10 percent (%) drop in hematocrit, need for blood transfusion, symptomatic hypotension, dizziness, pallor and oliguria.
Vaginal or intrauterine hemorrhage that encompasses antepartum (i.e. bleeding from the genital tract after 24 weeks of gestation), intrapartum, and postpartum bleeding (i.e. within 24 hours post-delivery).
A major obstetric hemorrhage is defined as blood loss from uterus or genital tract &gt;1500 ml or a decrease.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Pre-specified Neonate-related Outcomes, Resulting in Neonates Small for Their Gestational Age</measure>
    <time_frame>After week 27 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Small for gestational age is defined as: Birth weight less than (&lt;) 10% for infants of same gestational age and gender in same population.</description>

    <time_frame>After week 27 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy-related AEs of interest and neonate-related events are defined as: premature rupture of membranes, preterm premature rupture of membranes, premature uterine contraction, neonatal death, maternal death, still birth, neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Cases of Congenital Anomalies in the Neonates</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 27 of pregnancy up to birth</time_frame>
    <description>Congenital anomalies include morphological, functional, chromosomal or genetic anomalies, regardless of whether detected at birth or not, the foetus is delivered dead or alive, or defects are identified by prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the products of conception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Pregnancy-related AEs and Birth Outcomes Per Calendar Year</measure>
    <time_frame>After week 27 of pregnancy</time_frame>

        <description>Pregnancy vaginal hemorrhage is defined as: excessive blood loss after delivery i.e. estimated blood loss in excess of 500 milliliters (ml) after vaginal delivery and estimated blood loss in excess of 1000 ml after Caesarean delivery. The other symptoms are higher than or equal to (â‰¥) 10 percent (%) drop in hematocrit, need for blood transfusion, symptomatic hypotension, dizziness, pallor and oliguria.
Vaginal or intrauterine hemorrhage that encompasses antepartum (i.e. bleeding from the genital tract after 24 weeks of gestation), intrapartum, and postpartum bleeding (i.e. within 24 hours post-delivery).
A major obstetric hemorrhage is defined as blood loss from uterus or genital tract &gt;1500 ml or a decrease.</description>
