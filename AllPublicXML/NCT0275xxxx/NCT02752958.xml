  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, non-comparative design study will monitor the impact of long term
      management of DH with daily use of a sensitivity toothpaste on the quality of life of a
      population of sensitivity sufferers. Changes in oral health related quality of life will be
      monitored using the Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ). The study will
      be conducted in participants in good general health, with pre-existing self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at screening.

      This will be multicenter, non-comparative design to monitor the impact of long term
      management of DH with daily use of a sensitivity toothpaste on the quality of life of a
      population of sensitivity sufferers, using the DHEQ. Changes in DH will be monitored
      clinically over the 24 week treatment period.

    <description>All participants scored first 34 questions present in section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Section 2 had questions about the ways in which the sensations in the teeth affected participants in daily life. It was grouped into domains as follows: Restrictions (Section 2, Q1-4), Adaptation (Section 2, Q5-16), Social Impact (Section 2, Q17 to 21), Emotional Impact (Section 2, Q22 to 29), and Identity (Section 2, Q30 to 34).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Score (34 Item Total From Section 2) of Dentine Hyersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ) at Week 4</title>
        <description>All participants scored first 34 questions present in section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Section 2 had questions about the ways in which the sensations in the teeth affected participants in daily life. It was grouped into domains as follows: Restrictions (Section 2, Q1-4), Adaptation (Section 2, Q5-16), Social Impact (Section 2, Q17 to 21), Emotional Impact (Section 2, Q22 to 29), and Identity (Section 2, Q30 to 34).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean DHEQ Score of Domain - Restrictions (4 Item Total From Section 2 Questions 1 to 4) at Week 12</title>
          <description>All participants scored first 4 questions present in Domain Restriction of section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Restriction domain consisted of following questions Q1: Having sensation in my teeth takes a lot of the pleasure out of eating and drinking, Q2: there have been times when I can't finish my meal because of the sensations, Q3: It takes a long time to finish some foods and drinks because of sensations, and Q4: there have been times when I have had problems eating ice cream because if these sensations.</description>
          <population>The intention to treat (ITT) population was the primary population of analysis, defined as all participants who received the study toothpaste and had at least one post - baseline DHEQ/clinical assessment.</population>

        <description>All participants scored first 4 questions present in Domain Restriction of section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Restriction domain consisted of following questions Q1: Having sensation in my teeth takes a lot of the pleasure out of eating and drinking, Q2: there have been times when I can't finish my meal because of the sensations, Q3: It takes a long time to finish some foods and drinks because of sensations, and Q4: there have been times when I have had problems eating ice cream because if these sensations.</description>

        <description>All participants scored first 4 questions present in Domain Adaptation of section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Adaptation domain consisted of following questions Q5: I have to change the way I eat or drink certain things, Q6: I have to be careful how I breathe on a cold day, Q7: I have leave some cold foods/drinks to warm up before having them, Q8: I have to cool some foods/drinks down before I can have them, Q9: I have to cut up some fruits before eating, Q10: I have to wear scarf over my mouth on cold days, Q11: I have avoided very cold drinks/foods, Q12: I have avoided very hot drinks/foods, Q13: when eating some foods I have made sure they don't touch certain teeth, Q14: I have changed the way I brush, Q15: I bite some foods in small pieces, and Q16: there are other foods I have avoided.</description>

          <description>All participants scored first 4 questions present in Domain Adaptation of section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Adaptation domain consisted of following questions Q5: I have to change the way I eat or drink certain things, Q6: I have to be careful how I breathe on a cold day, Q7: I have leave some cold foods/drinks to warm up before having them, Q8: I have to cool some foods/drinks down before I can have them, Q9: I have to cut up some fruits before eating, Q10: I have to wear scarf over my mouth on cold days, Q11: I have avoided very cold drinks/foods, Q12: I have avoided very hot drinks/foods, Q13: when eating some foods I have made sure they don't touch certain teeth, Q14: I have changed the way I brush, Q15: I bite some foods in small pieces, and Q16: there are other foods I have avoided.</description>

Identity domain consisted of following questions Q30: I find it difficult to accept that I am a person who has these sensations in my teeth, Q31: Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel different from others, Q32:Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel old, Q33:Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel damaged, Q34: Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel as though I am unhealthy.</description>

        <description>All participants scored first 4 questions present in Domain Identity of section 2 of the DHEQ using a 7-point scale, where 7= Strongly agree, 6=Agree, 5= Agree a little, 4= neither agree or disagree, 3= disagree a little, 2= disagree, and 1= strongly disagree. Identity domain consisted of following questions Q30: I find it difficult to accept that I am a person who has these sensations in my teeth, Q31: Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel different from others, Q32:Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel old, Q33:Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel damaged, Q34: Having these sensations in my teeth makes me feel as though I am unhealthy.</description>

Section 1 of DHEQ consisted questions about participant's sensitive teeth and the impact they had on participant's everyday life.</description>
          <population>The intention to treat (ITT) population was the primary population of analysis, defined as all participants who received the study toothpaste and had at least one post - baseline DHEQ/clinical assessment.</population>
