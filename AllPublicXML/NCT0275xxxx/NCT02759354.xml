    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death or is life threatening. Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.</description>

             studies.

          8. Participant with suspected or known blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type

               -  Criteria 5 and 6 are temporary exclusion criteria. If a participant meets
                  criteria 5 and/or 6 at the time of Visit 1, a further appointment is to be
