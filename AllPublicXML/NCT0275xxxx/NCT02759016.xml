      Intravenous BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients who have been pre-treated with at least one prior line of
      systemic therapy, and who are eligible for treatment with ibrutinib. Objectives of the trial
      are to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of BI 836826, and to document the safety and
      tolerability of BI 836826 when given in combination with ibrutinib

    <description>The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D ) of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib would be either the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or a lower dose and would be determined by the safety review committee based on safety and efficacy considerations.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During the First Treatment Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>First treatment cycle, 4 weeks from first administration of BI 836826.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) during the first treatment cycle. DLT was defined as any non-hematologic adverse event (AE) of Grade ≥ 3 related to BI 836826 and/or ibrutinib except infusion-related reaction (any Grade), Grade 3 Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)- and/or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) elevation without concomitant bilirubin, elevation or any other asymptomatic Grade 3 laboratory abnormality with spontaneous recovery within 1 week. The following hematologic AEs related to BI 836826 and/or ibrutinib were considered DLT: Grade 4 neutropenia with concomitant infection, Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, and Grade 3 febrile neutropenia not resolving within 72 hours with appropriate treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, growth factor support), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, Grade 4 anemia, any Grade 5 hematologic AE.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Ibrutinib</measure>
    <time_frame>First treatment cycle, 4 weeks from first administration of BI 836826.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib, participants were entered sequentially into dose cohorts starting at 100 mg of BI 836826 and escalating to the MTD in combination with ibrutinib (fixed dose of 420 mg daily). Stepwise dose escalation of BI 836826 was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose control. The BLRM estimates the MTD by updating estimates of the probability of observing a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in the first treatment cycle (4 weeks) for each dose level as participant information becomes available. The MTD would be considered reached if the following criteria were fulfilled. The posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval [0.16 - 0.33) of the MTD is above 0.50 or at least 15 participants have been treated in the study, of which at least 6 at the MTD.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This trial was planned to consist of 2 parts. First part was a Phase Ib, open-label, single arm, multi-center, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase II dose of intravenous BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib. Original protocol planned a Phase II part which was not conducted.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that the subjects strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Abbreviations: SD=Stable Disease, PR-MRDpos=Minimal Residual Disease positive Partial Response, PR-L=Partial Response with Lymphocytosis.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Dose Cohort BI 836826 100 Milligram (mg) + Ibrutinib</title>
          <description>Participants underwent a 2-week run-in phase with ibrutinib prior to the start of BI 836826. In combination with ibrutinib (420 mg daily dose, orally administered) BI 836826 was administered intravenously as a rate controlled injection in 4-week cycles, every two weeks for the first 16 weeks (Cycles 1-4), and every 4 weeks starting at week 17 (Cycle 5) until week 48 (Cycle 12). BI 836826 was administered in Cycle 1 on day 1 (10 mg), days 2 and 8 (50% of the assigned dose on each day), day 15 (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 2-4 on days 1 and 15 of each cycle (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 5-12 on day 1 (100% of the assigned dose). Participants could have initiated 12 cycles with BI 836826 and could be treated with ibrutinib unless progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurred earlier. Continued treatment beyond Cycle 12 (up to a maximum of 24 treatment cycles) was possible for participants with a pre-specified response status at end of Cycle 12.</description>

          <description>Participants underwent a 2-week run-in phase with ibrutinib prior to the start of BI 836826. In combination with ibrutinib (420 mg daily dose, orally administered) BI 836826 was administered intravenously as a rate controlled injection in 4-week cycles, every two weeks for the first 16 weeks (Cycles 1-4), and every 4 weeks starting at week 17 (Cycle 5) until week 48 (Cycle 12). BI 836826 was administered in Cycle 1 on day 1 (10 mg), days 2 and 8 (50% of the assigned dose on each day), day 15 (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 2-4 on days 1 and 15 of each cycle (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 5-12 on day 1 (100% of the assigned dose). Participants could have initiated 12 cycles with BI 836826 and could be treated with ibrutinib unless progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurred earlier. Continued treatment beyond Cycle 12 (up to a maximum of 24 treatment cycles) was possible for participants with a pre-specified response status at end of Cycle 12.</description>

Participants underwent a 2-week run-in phase with ibrutinib prior to the start of BI 836826. In combination with ibrutinib (420 mg daily dose, orally administered) BI 836826 was administered intravenously in Cycle (=4 weeks) 1 on day 1 (10 mg), days 2 and 8 (50% of the assigned dose on each day), day 15 (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 2-4 on days 1 and 15 of each cycle (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 5-12 on day 1 (100% of the assigned dose). Participants could have initiated 12 cycles with BI 836826 and could be treated with ibrutinib unless progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurred earlier. Continued treatment beyond Cycle 12 (up to 24 treatment cycles) was possible for participants with a pre-specified response status at end of Cycle 12.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Ibrutinib</title>
        <description>To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib, participants were entered sequentially into dose cohorts starting at 100 mg of BI 836826 and escalating to the MTD in combination with ibrutinib (fixed dose of 420 mg daily). Stepwise dose escalation of BI 836826 was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose control. The BLRM estimates the MTD by updating estimates of the probability of observing a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in the first treatment cycle (4 weeks) for each dose level as participant information becomes available. The MTD would be considered reached if the following criteria were fulfilled.

            <title>BI 836826 + Ibrutinib</title>
            <description>Treatment group “BI 836826 + ibrutinib” comprises all dose cohorts during the dose escalation phase, that is, “Dose cohort BI 836826 100 mg + ibrutinib” and “Dose cohort BI 836826 200 mg + ibrutinib”.
Participants underwent a 2-week run-in phase with ibrutinib prior to the start of BI 836826. In combination with ibrutinib (420 mg daily dose, orally administered) BI 836826 was administered intravenously in Cycle (=4 weeks) 1 on day 1 (10 mg), days 2 and 8 (50% of the assigned dose on each day), day 15 (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 2-4 on days 1 and 15 of each cycle (100% of the assigned dose), in Cycles 5-12 on day 1 (100% of the assigned dose). Participants could have initiated 12 cycles with BI 836826 and could be treated with ibrutinib unless progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurred earlier. Continued treatment beyond Cycle 12 (up to 24 treatment cycles) was possible for participants with a pre-specified response status at end of Cycle 12.</description>

          <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Ibrutinib</title>
          <description>To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib, participants were entered sequentially into dose cohorts starting at 100 mg of BI 836826 and escalating to the MTD in combination with ibrutinib (fixed dose of 420 mg daily). Stepwise dose escalation of BI 836826 was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose control. The BLRM estimates the MTD by updating estimates of the probability of observing a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in the first treatment cycle (4 weeks) for each dose level as participant information becomes available. The MTD would be considered reached if the following criteria were fulfilled. The posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval [0.16 - 0.33) of the MTD is above 0.50 or at least 15 participants have been treated in the study, of which at least 6 at the MTD.</description>
