  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to demonstrate substantial equivalence of visualization using BLI to
      the predicate device, FICE, so as to support the addition of BLI as an adjunct to white light
      imaging in the company's video processor.

    <description>Likert score ratings of image quality for Blue Light Imaging (BLI), Blue Light Imaging-bright (BLI-brt) and Flexible spectral-Imaging Color Enhancement (FICE) images. Each BLI and BLI-Brt setting was compared to FICE, to determine which settings were equivalent to FICE.
Likert Score Scale:
Not seen;
poor but usable, characteristic features are detectable but details are not fully reproduced; features just visible;
good; allows an adequate assessment, details of anatomical structures are visible but not necessarily clearly defined; details emerging;
very good; allows an excellent assessment, anatomical details are clearly defined; details clear
This was a blinded and randomized Reader assessment of all BLI and FICE images.</description>
