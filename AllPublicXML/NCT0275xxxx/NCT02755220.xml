    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patient who had heart valve disease requiring a
        surgical replacement as indicated in the preoperative evaluation; 2) patient aged between
        60-85 years; 3) patient whose preoperative heart function less than NYHA functional class
        IV; 4) patient who signed the informed consent before surgery; 5) patient who agrees to
        finish the follow-up. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patient with prior valve
        replacement; 2) patient who requires concomitant tricuspid or pulmonary valve replacement;
        3) patient who requires concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery; 4) patient with
        active infective endocarditis or drug abuse; 5) patient whose life time expectancy less
        than 12 months; 6) patient who was unable to follow anticoagulation treatment.
