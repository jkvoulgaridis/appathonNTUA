    <textblock>
      A comparative study was conducted and the patient underwent a conventional urodynamic study.
      In order to successfully determine if the Air-Charged (AC) and Water-Perfused (WP)
      measurements are equivalent, the two sources of intravesical pressure (Pves) and abdominal
      pressure (Pabd) were collected concurrently at various fill volumes for the bladder.

      The objective of this study was to compare the use of water-filled and air-charged catheters
      in determining equivalency between the two technologies during cystometric assessment.

      A total of 25 patients (9M/16F) were recruited. All patients underwent cough and Valsalva
      manoeuvre pressure tests to measure vesicle pressure (Pves) and abdominal pressure (Pabd). A
      single dual-lumen catheter (T-DOC 7Fr Air-ChargedÂ® catheter) was used to record air and water
      pressures simultaneously.

      The primary outcome was to determine if the maximum pressures during Valsalva manoeuvres, as
      measured with a single dual-lumen water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent
      when the bladder is filled to 200 cc during a urodynamic evaluation.

      Exploratory endpoints included the following:

        1. To determine if maximum pressures for cough, as measured with a single dual-lumen
           water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent when the bladder is filled to
           100, 200 and Maximum Bladder Capacity (MBC) cc during a urodynamic evaluation.

        2. To determine if maximum pressures for Valsalva manoeuvres, as measured with a single
           dual-lumen water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent when the bladder is
           filled to 100 and MBC cc during a urodynamic evaluation (as well as 200 cc which is the
           primary objective).

        3. To determine if the maximum voiding pressure, as measured with a single dual-lumen
           water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent.

        4. To determine if the clinical impressions of the urodynamic study are equivalent for the
           water-perfused and air-charged catheters.

        5. To determine if the compliance of the bladder is equivalent when measured by air-charged
           catheters as compared to water-perfused catheters.
