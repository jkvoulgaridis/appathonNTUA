    <textblock>
      Breast cancer treatment often results in long-term arm morbidity. A prospective surveillance
      model with arm assessment pre-surgery followed by ongoing surveillance and targeted
      physiotherapy treatment after breast cancer surgery may improve early detection and
      management of arm morbidity. This study aims to determine the effect of prospective
      surveillance to target physiotherapy on the prevalence of arm morbidity in the surveillance
      group compared to control group at 12-months after breast cancer surgery.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Arm Morbidity at 12 Months Post-surgery - Shoulder Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Arm morbidity due to decreased shoulder mobility was defined as ≥10% decrease in mobility from pre-surgery. This was measured using a goniometer and evaluated the degrees of shoulder mobility in flexion, abduction and external rotation.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Arm Morbidity at 12 Months Post-surgery - Upper Body Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Arm morbidity due to decreased upper body muscle strength was defined as ≥25% decrease in muscle strength from pre-surgery. This was measured using a hand-held dynamometer and evaluated in kilograms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Arm Morbidity at 12 Months Post-surgery - Upper Body Function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Arm morbidity due to decreased upper body function was defined as ≥10 points decrease in function from pre-surgery. This was measured using the Upper Extremity Functional Index that scores 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater level of function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Arm Morbidity at 12 Months Post-surgery - Arm Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Arm morbidity due to increase in arm volume was defined as a ≥200 mL increase from pre-surgery. Arm volume was measured using a perometer.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Arm Morbidity at 12 Months Post-surgery - Upper Body Muscle Strength</title>
          <description>Arm morbidity due to decreased upper body muscle strength was defined as ≥25% decrease in muscle strength from pre-surgery. This was measured using a hand-held dynamometer and evaluated in kilograms.</description>

        <description>Arm morbidity due to decreased upper body function was defined as ≥10 points decrease in function from pre-surgery. This was measured using the Upper Extremity Functional Index that scores 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater level of function.</description>

Prospective Surveillance Group: Participants received a pre-surgery arm assessment for shoulder mobility, upper body muscle strength, upper body function, and arm volume. Same assessment was repeated at 12 months post-surgery. After surgery, participants randomized to the surveillance group underwent the same arm assessment at 3, 6, and 9 months post-surgery. If arm morbidity was detected at any of those time points, then the participant was referred to individual physiotherapy treatment until the issue was resolved.</description>
