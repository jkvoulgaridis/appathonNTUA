  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tedizolid phosphate and its active
      metabolite, tedizolid, and the safety of tedizolid phosphate following administration of a
      single IV (Part A) or oral suspension (Part B) administration to hospitalized participants
      ages 6 to &lt;12 years (Groups 1 and 3, respectively), and 2 to &lt;6 years (Groups 2 and 4,
      respectively).

      Part A (IV):

        -  Group 1 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) (6 to &lt;12 years)

        -  Group 2 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) (2 to &lt;6 years)

      Part B (Oral Suspension):

        -  Group 3 (6 to &lt;12 years)

        -  Group 4 (2 to &lt;6 years)

      In Cohort 1 of Group 1 (IV) participants received a single administration of tedizolid
      phosphate at 5 mg/kg of total body weight. After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 1
      received study drug, a preliminary analysis of the safety and PK data was performed and
      results were used to select 4 mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 1 and Group
      3, and to select 6 mg/kg as the starting dose for the younger participants, Cohort 1 of Group
      2. After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 2 receive study drug, another preliminary
      analysis of the safety and PK data will be performed and results will be used to confirm 6
      mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 2. Similarly, the Group 4 dose will be
      confirmed after data review of Group 3 results.

    <description>The area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of tedizolid (active metabolite) from time zero to infinity following administration of IV or oral dose, normalized to dosage, was calculated.

Pharmacokinetic sampling occurred at the following time points: Group 1 (part of the IV Group): Day 1 immediately after infusion and 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours; Group 2 (part of the IV Group): Day 1 immediately after infusion and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours; Group 3 (part of the Oral Group): Day 1 at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after oral dose; Group 4 (part of the Oral Group): Day 1 at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 hours after oral dose.</description>

    <description>Palatability of oral tedizolid phosphate suspension in participants ages 6 to &lt;12 years (Group 3) and 2 to &lt;6 years (Group 4). Palatability was assessed using a 5-point hedonic scale and spontaneous verbal judgment. This hedonic scale consists of 5 pictures of line drawn faces corresponding to very bad, bad, neither good nor bad, good and very good. The participant was asked to mark or point to the face to show how they felt about the taste of the study drug. For preverbal children, the score was assessed by the parent/caregiver, or study staff administering or witnessing administration of the study drug.</description>

        <description>The area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of tedizolid (active metabolite) from time zero to infinity following administration of IV or oral dose, normalized to dosage, was calculated. Per protocol, this outcome used pooled groups as follows: The IV Group pooled Groups 1 and 2, who received tedizolid phosphate via intravenous (IV) administration; the Oral Group pooled groups 3 and 4, who received tedizolid phosphate via oral administration. Pharmacokinetic sampling occurred at the following time points: Group 1 (part of the IV Group): Day 1 immediately after infusion and 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours; Group 2 (part of the IV Group): Day 1 immediately after infusion and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours; Group 3 (part of the Oral Group): Day 1 at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after oral dose; Group 4 (part of the Oral Group): Day 1 at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 hours after oral dose.</description>
        <time_frame>IV: immediately after the end of the infusion, and various time points up to 48 hours after the start of infusion as described above. Oral: at various time points up to 48 hours after the dose as described above.</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received a dose of tedizolid phosphate and had adequate quantifiable (above the lower limit of quantification) post-administration concentrations of tedizolid necessary to calculate the AUC.

        <title>Palatability of Oral Tedizolid Phosphate Suspension in Participants Who Received Oral Tedizolid Phosphate</title>
        <description>Palatability of oral tedizolid phosphate suspension in participants ages 6 to &lt;12 years (Group 3) and 2 to &lt;6 years (Group 4). Palatability was assessed using a 5-point hedonic scale and spontaneous verbal judgment. This hedonic scale consists of 5 pictures of line drawn faces corresponding to very bad, bad, neither good nor bad, good and very good. The participant was asked to mark or point to the face to show how they felt about the taste of the study drug. For preverbal children, the score was assessed by the parent/caregiver, or study staff administering or witnessing administration of the study drug.</description>
