      The objective is to establish community priorities for strategies to improve young children's
      health behaviors based on focus groups of stakeholders in the greater Baton Rouge area.

      Pause and Play (Aim 3) objective will be achieved through a series of taskforce and focus
      group meetings administered by the Mayor's Healthy City Initiative (MHCI). Meetings will
      include monthly meetings of the MHCI advisory boards composed of community stakeholders and
      focus groups of childcare center directors and parents. Stakeholders will create
      dissemination and implementation plans to leverage the findings of the project. We plan to
      conduct 2-3 focus groups of 8-10 parents and childcare directors, for a total of 16-30
      participants. Participation in the focus group part of the study will last approximately 1
      day.

    <description>Generation of key words, phrases, and quotes coded as variable themes agreed upon by at least one other participant in the group and repeated independently in other focus groups. Transcripts will be imported into NVivo software (Version 10, QSR, Victoria, Austrailia) to allow for thematic evaluation. The evaluation process will include the following: 1) generation of key words, phrases, and quotes coded as variable themes agreed upon by at least one other participant in the group and repeated independently in another focus group; 2) grouping of variables based on unifying concepts and themes; and 3) review of the variable groupings to ensure consistency and relevance of proposed unifying concepts.</description>
