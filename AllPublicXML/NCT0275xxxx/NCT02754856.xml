  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well tremelimumab and durvalumab work in
      treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver and can be removed by
      surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and durvalumab, may
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and feasibility of adding tremelimumab 75 mg intravenously (IV) plus
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg administered once pre-operatively and 4 cycles of durvalumab
      1500 mg IV every 4 weeks for 4 cycles post-operatively in patients who are candidates for
      resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the changes in various immune parameters, including programmed cell death-1 ligand
      1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death1 (PD-1) expression in the tumor, over treatment and
      correlate with response and survival with goal of biomarker discovery.

      II. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) in all enrolled subjects.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 4 hours during week 11.
      Between weeks 15 and 17, patients undergo liver surgery. Patients then receive durvalumab IV
      over 1 hour during weeks 21, 25, 29, and 33.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice a year for 5 years.
