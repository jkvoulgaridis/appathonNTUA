    <textblock>
      Social isolation and loneliness of the elderly have become major public health problems,
      because of the deleterious consequences if not lethal they can generate.

      Because of frequent resignation to these phenomena, support must be given to all means of
      prevention to prevent or at least mitigate their impacts. It appears from the literature that
      are isolated or living as they have adjustment difficulties which are linked to fragility. If
      geriatric frailty have been defined to date in somatic and cognitive criteria, psychological
      fragility criteria have been little discussed outside of psychiatric disorders (depression,
      anxiety disorders in particular).

      This study aims to test in the elderly in isolation psychological fragility questionnaire and
      to study the statistical qualities and relations with socio-demographic variables,
      environmental and other known vulnerabilities.
