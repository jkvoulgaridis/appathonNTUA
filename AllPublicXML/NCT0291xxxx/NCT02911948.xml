    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>During 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

    <time_frame>week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>For the DTR-QOL questionnaire, change from baseline in the 'Total score' and the following four 'Domain scores' were analysed:
Burden on social activities and daily activities
Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment
Hypoglycaemia
Satisfaction with treatment. The scoring range of 'Total score' was converted to 0-100 (best case response = 100; worst case response = 0).
The scoring range for each of four domains was converted to 0-100 (best case response = 100; worst case response = 0).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) of Treatment: EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Overall health state was rated by patients using the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ-5D-5L index score. The EQ-5D-5L VAS is a vertical scale where patients can rank their health from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable).
The EQ-5D-5L index score was calculated based on the 5 dimensions, i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g., work, study), pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression with five response levels for each dimension, i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The scores from 5 dimensions are then converted to the EQ-5D-5L index score scale: 0 - 1 (full health/best-case response = 1; death/worst-case response = 0).</description>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide</title>
          <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) in combination with metformin (at stable pre-trial dose and frequency level) for 26 weeks. The starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide), with the option of choosing up to 16 dose steps (16 units IDeg/0.6 mg liraglutide) at the investigator’s discretion. IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). IDegLira was injected subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. One follow-up contact was scheduled at least 7 to 10 days after end of treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes According to American Diabetes Association (ADA) Definition</title>
        <description>Results represent total number of treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes that fall under ADA's definition of hypoglycaemia. ADA's definition of hypoglycaemia includes following categories:
Severe hypoglycaemia
Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia
Probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia
Pseudo-hypoglycaemia. Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) in combination with metformin (at stable pre-trial dose and frequency level) for 26 weeks. The starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide), with the option of choosing up to 16 dose steps (16 units IDeg/0.6 mg liraglutide) at the investigator’s discretion. IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). IDegLira was injected subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. One follow-up contact was scheduled at least 7 to 10 days after end of treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product. Nocturnal period: The period between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m. (both inclusive).
Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) in combination with metformin (at stable pre-trial dose and frequency level) for 26 weeks. The starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide), with the option of choosing up to 16 dose steps (16 units IDeg/0.6 mg liraglutide) at the investigator’s discretion. IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). IDegLira was injected subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. One follow-up contact was scheduled at least 7 to 10 days after end of treatment.</description>

        <description>Overall health state was rated by patients using the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ-5D-5L index score. The EQ-5D-5L VAS is a vertical scale where patients can rank their health from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable).
The EQ-5D-5L index score was calculated based on the 5 dimensions, i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g., work, study), pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression with five response levels for each dimension, i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The scores from 5 dimensions are then converted to the EQ-5D-5L index score scale: 0 - 1 (full health/best-case response = 1; death/worst-case response = 0).</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) in combination with metformin (at stable pre-trial dose and frequency level) for 26 weeks. The starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide), with the option of choosing up to 16 dose steps (16 units IDeg/0.6 mg liraglutide) at the investigator’s discretion. IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). IDegLira was injected subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. One follow-up contact was scheduled at least 7 to 10 days after end of treatment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) of Treatment: EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire</title>
          <description>Overall health state was rated by patients using the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ-5D-5L index score. The EQ-5D-5L VAS is a vertical scale where patients can rank their health from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable).
The EQ-5D-5L index score was calculated based on the 5 dimensions, i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g., work, study), pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression with five response levels for each dimension, i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The scores from 5 dimensions are then converted to the EQ-5D-5L index score scale: 0 - 1 (full health/best-case response = 1; death/worst-case response = 0).</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised subjects (210 subjects). The statistical evaluation of the FAS followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and subjects contributed to the evaluation “as randomised”. Missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.</population>
