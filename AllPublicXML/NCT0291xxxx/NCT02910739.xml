    <textblock>
      This study consists of Part I and an optional Part II. The purpose of Part I is to compare
      the plasma pharmacokinetics of verubecestat (MK-8931) following administration of a single
      oral dose of 40 mg MK-8931 to participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency (HI) to that
      of healthy matched controls. An interim safety and pharmacokinetic analysis on the basis of
      Part I will be performed in order to support the decision to continue with the optional Part
      II. If a decision to continue with Part II is made, participants with mild HI will be
      enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 40mg MK-8931. If any healthy participants from Part
      I do not meet the matching criteria for Part II additional healthy participants will be
      enrolled.

    <time_frame>Predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after MK-8931 40 mg dose</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected at each pre-specified time point and plasma was isolated for analysis. Plasma MK-8931 concentration was then quantified at each time point to determine AUC0-∞, defined as the area under the MK-8931 concentration versus time curve from 0 (predose) extrapolated to infinity after a single oral dose of MK-8931 40 mg. Individual AUC0-∞ values were natural log (ln) transformed and evaluated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model containing a categorical factor for participant group (Moderate HI, Healthy Matched Control) and continuous covariates for age and BMI. This ANCOVA model was used to compute a geometric least-squares mean and 95% confidence interval for AUC0-∞ in each arm.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected at each pre-specified time point and plasma was isolated for analysis. Plasma MK-8931 concentration was then quantified at each time point to determine Cmax, defined as the maximum plasma concentration of MK-8931 observed following oral dosing.

Individual AUC0-24hr values were ln-transformed and evaluated with an ANCOVA model containing a categorical factor for participant group (Moderate HI, Healthy Matched Control) and continuous covariates for age and BMI.

      <pre_assignment_details>Per protocol, this study was divided into Part I and an optional Part II, with Part II initiating only after interim analysis (IA) of Part I. Following Part I IA, the pharmacokinetic (PK) criterion necessary to initiate enrollment for Part II was not met. As a result, the study was completed normally without enrollment into the optional Part II.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at each pre-specified time point and plasma was isolated for analysis. Plasma MK-8931 concentration was then quantified at each time point to determine AUC0-∞, defined as the area under the MK-8931 concentration versus time curve from 0 (predose) extrapolated to infinity after a single oral dose of MK-8931 40 mg. Individual AUC0-∞ values were natural log (ln) transformed and evaluated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model containing a categorical factor for participant group (Moderate HI, Healthy Matched Control) and continuous covariates for age and BMI. This ANCOVA model was used to compute a geometric least-squares mean and 95% confidence interval for AUC0-∞ in each arm.</description>
