  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare disease with no standard treatment. Researchers
      want to see if a drug called lenalidomide along with common chemotherapy drugs may be
      effective in treating PEL.

      Objective:

      To test a new treatment for PEL.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with PEL.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with blood tests, imaging studies, a physical exam, and other
      tests.

      Participants will have tests to evaluate their disease. These may include:

      Blood tests

      Scans

      Lumbar puncture. Fluid around the spinal cord will be removed with a needle.

      Bone marrow removed with a needle and studied

      Samples of skin or lymph nodes removed

      Fluid removed from around organs

      Lung and eye tests

      Tubes with cameras taking pictures of airways or digestive tract

      Participants will take lenalidomide pills for 10 days. They will keep a pill diary.

      Participants will have a catheter (small tube) placed in the large vein in the arm or chest.

      Participants will get DA-EPOCH-R as intravenous infusions by catheter over several days. This
      will be repeated in 21-day cycles. Most participants will have 6 cycles.

      Participants will get the drug filgrastim by injection under the skin. They will get the drug
      methotrexate injected into the spinal fluid.

      During the study, participants will have the following tests done at least once:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and stool tests

      Lesions photographed and measured

      Lumbar puncture

      Participants will have follow-up visits for 5 years. They will repeat the screening tests
      plus have urine and stool tested.

      Participants may be contacted later by phone to see how they are doing.

      Background

        -  Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an
           aggressive B cell neoplasm with clinicopathologic and molecular profiles distinct from
           other AIDS-related lymphomas.

        -  There are no prospective studies on these rare lymphomas. Clinical experience is
           limited; however, reported prognosis is poor, with median survival estimated at less
           than 6 months using conventional CHOP-like chemotherapy.

        -  Novel treatment is urgently needed for KSHV-associated lymphomas, and the therapeutic
           approach must take into account concurrent KSHV-associated malignancies which are
           commonly seen in this patient population

        -  Lenalidomide, an immune-modulatory derivative of thalidomide (IMiD drug) has in vitro
           direct antitumor effect in KSHV-lymphomas as well as immune modulatory and
           antiangiogenic effects that may be beneficial in treating PEL

        -  Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has recently been shown to be an active
           agent in the management of KSHV-MCD. Although PEL is a CD20-negative tumor, advances in
           the understanding the biology of KSHV-infection of B-cells, the pathobiology of IL-6
           syndromes in KSHV-MCD and KSHV-NHL, and clinical experience using rituximab in the
           treatment of KSHV-MCD, support use of rituximab in the treatment of PEL, especially in
           patients with concurrent KSHV-MCD.

        -  Modified dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and
           doxorubicin (DA)-EPOCH is an anthracycline-based regimen that allows for personalization
           of dose-intensity showing that inclusion of etoposide and infusional administration
           decreases tumor cell resistance.

        -  The use of DA-EPOCH in combination with rituximab for the treatment of HIV associated
           diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma has been shown to be safe and
           effective.

        -  Given the central role of controlling HIV viremia with combination antiretroviral
           therapy (cART) in the management of KSHV-associated malignancies, as well as the likely
           contribution of uncontrolled HIV viremia to PEL pathogenesis, cART will be employed as
           an important part of the treatment regimen.

      Objectives

      Phase I

      - Evaluate safety and tolerability of lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R and
      determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of this regimen.

      Phase II

      - Evaluate overall survival in treatment-naive patients with primary effusion lymphoma
      treated with lenalidomide in combination with, DA-EPOCH and rituximab (DA-EPOCHR^2).

      Eligibility

        -  Adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years with pathology confirmed primary
           effusion lymphoma, including extracavitary variants, and KSHV-associated large cell
           lymphoma

        -  Lymphoma that is measurable or assessable

        -  Any HIV status

        -  Hematologic and biochemical parameters within pre-specified limits at screening

        -  Willing to use effective birth control, as defined in the full protocol

        -  Neither pregnant nor breast feeding

        -  Excluded if other serious co-morbid condition that would prohibit administration of
           planned chemotherapeutic intervention is present

      Design

        -  This is a phase I/ II study of lenalidomide in combination rituximab and modified
           DAEPOCH (EPOCH-R^2) in patients with PEL and KSHV-associated large cell lymphoma

        -  Phase I of the study will evaluate lenalidomide 25 mg days 1-10 in combination with
           modified DA-EPOCH-R to determine safety and tolerability. Dose de-escalation doses of
           lenalidomide are 20 mg and 15 mg.

        -  Patients with HIV will generally be prescribed cART.

        -  In phase I, with up to 3 dose levels, 6-18 patients will be accrued (3-6 patients per
           level).

        -  In the phase II portion of the study, 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled over 48-60
           months and 12 months follow-up after the last patient has enrolled, a 1-tailed 0.10
           alpha level test would have 80% power to determine if OS curve would demonstrate a
           1-year OS consistent with 45% or better and ruling out 20% or worse.

          -  Breast feeding (if lactating, must agree not to breast feed while taking
             lenalidomide). Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide.

          -  Uncontrolled severe intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: bacterial,
             fungal, or life-threatening viral infection; symptomatic congestive heart failure;
             unstable angina pectoris; cardiac arrhythmia; or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients with severe intercurrent

             designee s discretion.

          -  Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator or Lead Associate Investigator, would prohibit administration
             of planned chemotherapeutic intervention, places the subject at unacceptable risk if
             they were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from
             the study

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is a Category X agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.
