    <description>Subjects assigned to this arm will be randomized to either 0.25% Timolol or 0.5% Timolol for 180 days. If during the 180 days the subject is considered a treatment failure, the subject will be unblinded. If the subject is on 0.25% timolol they will be changed to 0.5% timolol, if on 0.5% timolol the treating physician will decide to either continue 0.5% timolol or withdraw the subject and begin alternative treatment.</description>
