      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BPI-15086. In
      addition, the anti-cancer effect of BPI-15086 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC
      patients who have progressed on a previous EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy will also
      be evaluated. Biomarkers related to the efficacy of BPI-15086 will be investigated.
