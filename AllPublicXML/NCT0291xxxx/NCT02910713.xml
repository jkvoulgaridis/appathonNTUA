  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the Intranasal Tear Neurostimulator
      applied intranasally (active) compared with the same device applied extranasally (control)
      relating to symptoms of dry eye exacerbated by the Controlled Adverse Environment model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to a single application sequence, either sequence &quot;A&quot;
      (intranasal application followed by control application) or sequence &quot;B&quot; (control application
      followed by intranasal application) using the device. Upon entering the CAE, participants
      will complete dry eye questionnaires every five minutes and will administer the device either
      intranasally or extranasally in randomized sequence when a certain level of ocular discomfort
      has been reached.

    <measure>Change From Pre-Application to Post-Application in Eye Dryness Score (EDS) Using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application to Post-application on Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The participant rated their eye dryness (both eyes simultaneously) at all visits and every 5 minutes during CAE exposure by placing a vertical mark on the 100 mm horizontal line to indicate the level of eye dryness. 0 corresponds to &quot;no dryness&quot; and 100 corresponds to &quot;maximal dryness&quot;. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. A cross-over linear model was used with symptom relief as the response variable; sequence, application location, period, and the application location by period interaction as fixed effects; and participant (sequence) as a random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pre-Application to Post-Application in the Ora Calibra Ocular Discomfort Scale (ODS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application to Post-application on Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The participant graded their eye discomfort prior to CAE entry, during CAE exposure to threshold, then starting 1 minute after treatment application every 5 minutes in each eye separately using the Ora Calibra ODS where: 0=no discomfort to 4=constant discomfort. Data from the analysis eye was used to determine effectiveness. The analysis eye was defined as the eye that reached the threshold triggering the first application or if both eyes reach the threshold at the same time, the eye with the higher discomfort score or if both eyes are the same, the right eye was used. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. A cross-over linear model was used with symptom relief as the response variable; sequence, application location, period, and the application location by period interaction as fixed effects; and participant (sequence) as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre-Application to Post-Application in the Ora Calibra Ocular Discomfort Scale (ODS) Score</title>
        <description>The participant graded their eye discomfort prior to CAE entry, during CAE exposure to threshold, then starting 1 minute after treatment application every 5 minutes in each eye separately using the Ora Calibra ODS where: 0=no discomfort to 4=constant discomfort. Data from the analysis eye was used to determine effectiveness. The analysis eye was defined as the eye that reached the threshold triggering the first application or if both eyes reach the threshold at the same time, the eye with the higher discomfort score or if both eyes are the same, the right eye was used. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. A cross-over linear model was used with symptom relief as the response variable; sequence, application location, period, and the application location by period interaction as fixed effects; and participant (sequence) as a random effect.</description>
