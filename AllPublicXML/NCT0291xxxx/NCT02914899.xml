  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new community health worker (CHW) program. This
      program will help support and guide at-risk Chinese livery drivers through shared decision
      making for lung cancer screening. Shared decision making is a process where a health care
      worker and a patient work together to make a decision about the patient's medical care.

      After the pre-pilot, the pilot phase will be conducted with materials adapted using results
      and lessons learned from the pre-pilot. In addition to the materials mentioned, the pilot
      will strengthen CHW and participant communication with proivders by including a patient
      communication guide that has tips for the participant on how to talk to their doctors. In
      addition, a primary care physician (PCP) packet will be included, giving providers a better
      sense of USPTSF criteria, the evidence behind recommending LCS for high-risk patients, an
      overview of insurance and the logistics of referring patients to LCS, as well as a checklist
      for what needs to be completed for shared decision making.

    <description>Approximately 10 drivers will participate in the pre-pilot phase. Bilingual study staff will approach Chinese livery drivers for potential participation. A brief screening questionnaire will be administered to ascertain eligibility. Participants will be consented in Mandarin Chinese and will be apprised that their participation is purely voluntary and that their names will not be included in the final narrative. Navigation as well as intake and exit surveys can be completed over phone. The exit survey will be administered either right after LCS with LDCT is complete, or at the 12 month point, whichever comes first.</description>

    <description>After the pre-pilot, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to assess the feasibility of the refined CHW model versus written materials to facilitate SDM and LCS (when appropriate) in an extremely high-risk group, NYC Chinese livery drivers eligible (by USPTSF criteria) for LCS. Approximately 50 drivers will be randomized to the CHW intervention group or the written materials only control group and will participate for 12 months. CHW intervention group drivers will receive the written materials and navigation for SDM/LCS while drivers in the control group will only receive the written materials. Navigation as well as intake and exit surveys will be completed over phone. The exit survey will be administered either right after LCS with LDCT is complete, or at the 12 month point, whichever comes first.</description>

    <description>Each intake survey will take about 40 minutes. The survey will include questions on demographics and workplace profile, financial profile, health care access, cancer screening behavior, medical history, tobacco use, alcohol use, physical activity, perceived stress, sleep, and smoking knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.
Each exit survey will take about 15 minutes. The survey will include questions on whether drivers received counseling for shared decision making (SDM), made a decision about LCS, completed LCS with LDCT (if appropriate), if LCS screening was completed - results and follow-up recommendations (if any) and follow-up appointments attended (if recommended), barriers to SDM and LCS and suggestions to address barriers, a section on satisfaction with the CHW program including what aspects were most and least helpful, suggestions to improve the CHW program, and smoking knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.</description>

    <description>CHWs will facilitate SDM and LCS (if appropriate) for participating drivers, assisting/providing navigation at any step needed, from finding a PCP, scheduling appointments with PCPs or for LCS, assisting with insurance barriers, clinic paperwork, etc., through to following up on results and next steps (if indicated). CHWs will maintain regular contact with drivers, communicating by phone (or in person if preferred) at least every month (at least 12 attempts per month will be made to reach drivers), and more frequently as needed.</description>

        Participants for the focus groups will be recruited in concert with 6-8 Chinese livery
        bases identified through our preliminary work, the Taxi Network, 3 of which previously
        collaborated with us in our health needs assessment.
