    <textblock>
      This trial studies the acceptability and how well decision making tool works in supporting
      decision making in contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in patients with newly diagnosed
      breast cancer. Decision making tool may help patients with early stage breast cancer make
      decisions regarding their surgical options.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. An online decision support tool will be field tested that provides patients facing a
      decision about contralateral prophylactic breast cancer (CPM) with evidence-based information
      about the expected incidence of contralateral breast cancer and the life expectancy benefit
      of CPM. The tool will be designed for use in clinical settings and viewed jointly by the
      patient and physician as part of a shared decision making process around CPM.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients use decision making tool during consultation with breast cancer surgeon and complete
      questionnaires before and after consultation.

    <description>Patients' rating of the acceptability of the decision support tool will be assessed using questions from the Ottawa Acceptability Measures, including the clarity, amount, and balance of the information provided by the tool. Acceptability data from patients enrolled in the field test will be reported descriptively.</description>
