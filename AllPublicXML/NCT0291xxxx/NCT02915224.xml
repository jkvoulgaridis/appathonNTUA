  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, single arm, non-interventional, observational study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab in daily clinical practice in participants with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study will also assess cost of disease management. The total
      length of the study is 42 months.
