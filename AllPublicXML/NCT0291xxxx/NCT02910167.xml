  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      What AE occur in routine clinical practice, what is the incidence of AE and Adverse Drug
      Reaction, how many patients present with AE symptoms related to a potential liver injury.
      What are the drug utilization patterns in patients, what are the predisposing factors for the
      occurrence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions.
