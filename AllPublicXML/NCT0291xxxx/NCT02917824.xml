  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) can reverse or delay the complications from the
      deterioration of inspiratory muscle function in asthma. Thus, the IMT has been considered a
      treatment option for people with asthma. The aim of this study is to investigate the training
      principles of intensity, specificity and reversibility of IMT in asthmatics.
