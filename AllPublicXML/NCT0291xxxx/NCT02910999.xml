        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic
             NSCLC, Stage IIIB/Stage IV

          -  Decision to initiate a treatment with Nivolumab for the first time already undertaken
             by physician

          -  Males and Females, â‰¥18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current primary diagnosis of a cancer other than advanced NSCLC. Example: A cancer
             other than NSCLC that requires systemic or other treatment.

          -  Pre-treatment with Nivolumab and/or Ipilimumab (pre-treatment with
             checkpoint-inhibitors other than Nivolumab and Ipilimumab, and Tyrosine Kinase
             Inhibitors(TKIs) is allowed)

          -  Current participation in an interventional clinical trial for treatment of NSCLC.
             (Patients who have completed their participation in an interventional trial or who are
             not receiving study drug anymore and who are only followed-up for overall survival can
             be enrolled. For blinded studies, the treatment administered needs to be known)
