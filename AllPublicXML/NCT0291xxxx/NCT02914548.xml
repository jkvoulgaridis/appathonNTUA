  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate of Investigator's Global Assessment(IGA) of Disease Severity at Week4</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub investigator assessed the skin symptoms using IGA. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 =mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe/very severe) of the overall symptoms of the treatment area (erythema, infiltration, papules, effusion and scab formation) from baseline to Week4. Incidence of success in IGA was defined as the rate of subjects whose IGA score was 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and had improved by at least 2 grades (responders) from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub investigator assessed the symptoms of AD using EASI. EASI's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 72 scores respectively. The higher the EASI score is, the more severe the symptoms of AD, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0-3 points) and affected BSA (%) based on the 4 symptoms (erythema, infiltration/papules, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4 body regions (face, neck and head ; upper limbs ;trunk; and lower limbs). Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) for Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator evaluated the level of pruritus based on VAS. The subjects will mark the point of pruritus intensity during the last 24 hours on the line of a 100- mm VAS sheet between the left end (no pruritus: the score is 0 ) and the right end (very severe pruritus: the score is 100), and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Verbal Rating Scale(VRS) for Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Hour 156</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator evaluated the pruritus intensity based on VRS. The subjects aged 7 to 14 years old evaluated the pruritus intensity according to the following criteria. The subjects recorded the level of pruritus and the time and date of evaluation in a pruritus diary.
0 : None
: Mild
: Moderate
: Severe For subjects aged 2 to 6 years, this would not be evaluated. Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure(POEM) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub investigator evaluated eczema according to the POEM. The subjects answered 7 questions about their eczema by 0-4 points per question. The POEMS's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 28 scores respectively. The higher the POEM score is, the more severe the symptoms are, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. If it is difficult for subjects to answer the questions, their parents answered them instead. Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percentage Affected Body Surface Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator drew the affected BSA (range of skin eruption at the time of examination) on the human body drawing to determine the affected areas (%) on the respective 4 body regions (face, neck, and head; upper limbs; trunk; and lower limbs). One palm of the subject corresponds to 1% BSA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean (SD) OPA-15406 Plasma Trough Concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Week1, Week4, Week8</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma concentration of OPA-15406 was measured at Week1, Week4 and Week8. On the day of measurement, the subjects visited the trial site without morning Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration.
Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at each point. Participants who have no effective data were excluded.</description>

    <measure>Mean (SD) Normalized OPA-15406 Plasma Trough Concentrations by Dose Derived From %BSA</measure>
    <time_frame>Week1, Week4, Week8</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma concentration of OPA-15406 was measured at Week1, Week4 and Week8. On the day of measurement, the subjects visited the trial site without morning Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration.Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at each point.

    <measure>OPA-15406 Plasma PK Parameters, Cmax</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>OPA-15406 plasma PK parameter (Cmax) was measured on Day 1 and at Week 4 following topical administration of OPA-15406 0.3% and 1% ointment to adult subjects with AD.Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with effective data at each point. Participants who have no effective data were excluded.</description>

        <description>The investigator or sub investigator assessed the skin symptoms using IGA. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 =mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe/very severe) of the overall symptoms of the treatment area (erythema, infiltration, papules, effusion and scab formation) from baseline to Week4. Incidence of success in IGA was defined as the rate of subjects whose IGA score was 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and had improved by at least 2 grades (responders) from baseline.</description>

        <description>The investigator or sub investigator assessed the symptoms of AD using EASI. EASI's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 72 scores respectively. The higher the EASI score is, the more severe the symptoms of AD, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0-3 points) and affected BSA (%) based on the 4 symptoms (erythema, infiltration/papules, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4 body regions (face, neck and head ; upper limbs ;trunk; and lower limbs). Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure(POEM) Score</title>
        <description>The investigator or sub investigator evaluated eczema according to the POEM. The subjects answered 7 questions about their eczema by 0-4 points per question. The POEMS's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 28 scores respectively. The higher the POEM score is, the more severe the symptoms are, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. If it is difficult for subjects to answer the questions, their parents answered them instead. Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
