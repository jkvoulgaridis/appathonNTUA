  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung isolation technique and one-lung ventilation (OLV) are the mainstays of thoracic
      anesthesia. Two principal lung isolation techniques are mainly use by clinicians, the double
      lumen tubes (DLT) and the bronchial blockers (BB). The physiology of lung collapse during OLV
      is not well described in the literature. Few publications characterized scant aspects of lung
      collapse, only with the use of DLT and sometime in experimental animals. Two phases of lung
      collapse have been described. The first phase is a quick and partial secondary to the
      intrinsic recoil of the lung. The second phase is the reabsorption of gas contained in the
      alveoli by the capillary bed. The investigators plan to describe the physiology of the second
      phase of lung deflation using of DLT or BB, in a human clinical context.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung isolation and one-lung ventilation (OLV) have been used for more than 60 years,
      principally via double lumen endotracheal tubes (DLT). Since the beginning of the 21st
      century, modernisation of bronchial blockers (BB) has favoured their more frequent use.
      Meanwhile, video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has increased, becoming the standard
      for the majority of intra-thoracic pulmonary surgeries.

      Lung collapse during OLV undergoes two distinct phases. The first phase occurs at the opening
      of the pleural cavity and corresponds to a quick but partial collapse of the lung due to its
      intrinsic recoil. This phase probably ends when small airways are closed. Thereafter, the
      second phase, a slower one, corresponds to the reabsorption, by the capillary bed, of gas
      contained into the alveoli. The speed of this reabsorption depends on the solubility of the
      gas contained in the alveoli.

      Intriguingly, the physiology of lung collapse under OLV remains poorly understood, especially
      with the use of BB. Theoretically, many aspects of lung isolation may influence lung
      collapse, including the ventilation strategy before OLV, the timing and the lung isolation
      devices being used. While oxygen at 100% is widely used for ventilation before OLV, the
      timing of initiation of lung isolation varies from centers to centers. Indeed, the most
      conservative will begin the lung isolation just before the opening of the pleural space,
      whereas others begin the lung isolation following the appropriate positioning of the patient
      and confirmation that the lung isolation device is properly positioned by fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy (FOB) examination. Therefore, the period between initiation of lung isolation
      and pleural opening may vary from a few minutes to &gt;30 minutes. The mechanic of lung
      isolation differs between DLT and BB and consequently the physiology of lung deflation may be
      different. When using DLT, the lumen that corresponds to the collapsed lung is disconnected
      from the ventilator and is continuously in communication with the ambient air. When using BB
      a bronchial cuff is inflated within the main bronchus following a 30 seconds apnea period,
      allowing the initial lung deflation to be mediated by elastic lung recoil. After this initial
      phase, the only communication with ambient air is through the small (2 mm) and long internal
      (67 mm) channel, which is completely different from the larger lumen of the DLT.

      Rapid and complete lung collapse is essential during lung isolation for VATS otherwise; there
      is no alternative available for the surgeon to get proper view of the pulmonary hilum.
      Previous studies suggested that BB allow a less effective lung collapse than the one obtained
      with DLT. However, the authors recently documented that the use of BB with its internal
      channel occluded creates a statistically significant shorter time to complete lung collapse
      during VATS compared to DLT (36.6 ± 29.1 vs 7.5 ± 3.8 min; p&lt;0.001). In contrast to the
      previous studies, the authors used off-line review videos recorded during the surgery to
      obtain a more objective evaluation of the complete lung collapse time which probably
      reflected the second phase of lung deflation. Although, our definition of lung collapse was
      very strict, meaning complete collapse of all the lung areas, graded using a standardized
      visual scale and chart. However, authors do not have any data to explain why this internal
      channel occlusion may have some positive impact. The authors hypothesized that their results
      could be explained by the optimisation of the reabsorption phases following enhanced
      atelectasis by gas reabsorption (phase 2) after bronchial blockade. This latter hypothesis is
      supported by a pilot observation that ambient air (FiO2 at 0.21) was &quot;sucked up&quot; within the
      collapsing lung when using DLT to a greater extent than with the use of BB (unpublished
      data). The presence of ambient air (21%) in the alveolar space may likely slowing subsequent
      gas reabsorption compared to intra-alveolar 100% O2 . However, these hypotheses remain to be
      confirmed.

      The investigators proposed this study to update the knowledge about lung collapse with the
      actual lung isolation devices: DLT and BB. This protocol will describe the lung collapse
      physiology and allows getting data for the elaboration of further studies.

      Thus the present hypothesis is that during the second phase of lung collapse, the inflow of
      air through the lumen of the non-ventilated lung of the DLT is greater than through the
      internal channel of the BB, in the course of lung isolation for OLV.

      The main objective of this study is the gas volume quantification (GVQ) coming from ambient
      air towards the alveoli space of the non-ventilated lung during OLV with the use of DLT and
      BB. These measurements will be performed from the beginning of OLV until 60 minutes after,
      meaning approximatively 45 minutes after the opening of the pleura by the surgeon. The
      secondary objective is the intra-pulmonary pressure measurement (IPM) in the non-ventilated
      lung with the use of DLT and BB during the same period.

    <description>Intra-pulmonary pressure measured from initiation of OLV to pleural opening were similarly analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. Two experimental factors, one associated to the comparison between two groups (DLT versus BB), factor fixed and one associated to the comparison among results from the time periods (0 to 10 minutes), factor fixed with interaction terms between the fixed factors were defined. The data was analyzed using a repeated mixed model. An autoregressive covariance structure was used to consider the dependency among repeated measurements.</description>

The catheter will then be connected to a differential pressure transducer (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), allowing direct visualisation of the bronchial pressures. Along with intra-bronchial pressure, esophageal pressure will also be measured to eliminate the pressure generated by the positive pressure of the ventilated lung (Adult esophageal balloon catheter, Cooper Surgical, Trumbull, CT, USA).

Immediately prior to opening of the pleura, the volume measurement bag was closed and apnea was re-established in both groups for one minute as described above, after which measurements resumed for a total duration of 60 minutes of OLV. At the end of the observation period, the bag was emptied with the one-liter syringe through the pneumotachometer to measure its residual volume.</description>

          <description>For patients randomized to the intra-pulmonary pressure measurements, a pressure-tubing catheter was connected to the luerlock adaptor of the BB or to the adaptor located on the side of the occluding system mounted at the extremity of the DLT. The catheter was connected to a differential pressure transducer. Signals were amplified with a CD15 Carrier Demodulator then digitized at 5 Hz and sampled using an MP100 analogic/numeric system. Continuous pressure measurements were recorded before and after pleural opening by the surgeon. Tracings were recorded and subsequent off-line analyses were accomplished using ACQKnowledge and pressures were averaged every 30 seconds, excluding aberrant measures (above and below 2 SD of the mean).</description>

        <title>Measurement of Intra-pulmonary Pressure in the Non-ventilated Lung With the Use of DLT and BB</title>
        <description>Intra-pulmonary pressure measured from initiation of OLV to pleural opening were similarly analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. Two experimental factors, one associated to the comparison between two groups (DLT versus BB), factor fixed and one associated to the comparison among results from the time periods (0 to 10 minutes), factor fixed with interaction terms between the fixed factors were defined. The data was analyzed using a repeated mixed model. An autoregressive covariance structure was used to consider the dependency among repeated measurements.</description>

            <description>For patients randomized to the intra-pulmonary pressure measurements, a pressure-tubing catheter was connected to the luerlock adaptor of the BB or to the adaptor located on the side of the occluding system mounted at the extremity of the DLT. The catheter was connected to a differential pressure transducer. Signals were amplified with a CD15 Carrier Demodulator then digitized at 5 Hz and sampled using an MP100 analogic/numeric system. Continuous pressure measurements were recorded before and after pleural opening by the surgeon. Tracings were recorded and subsequent off-line analyses were accomplished using ACQKnowledge and pressures were averaged every 30 seconds, excluding aberrant measures (above and below 2 SD of the mean).</description>

The pneumotachometer signal was amplified with Pneumotach Amplifier 1 and digitized at 200 Hz using MP100 analogic/numeric system. Volume were measured with ACQKnowledge by integration of flows measured with the pneumotachometer. One minute after initiation of OLV, the three-way valve was connected to the non-ventilated lumen of the DLT or to the internal chanel of the BB through an adaptor. Immediately prior to opening of the pleura, the volume measurement bag was closed and apnea was re-established in both groups for one minute as described above, after which measurements resumed for a total duration of 60 minutes of OLV. At the end of the observation period, the bag was emptied with the one-liter syringe through the pneumotachometer to measure its residual volume.</description>
