    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two arm study for patients with low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk
      prostate cancer as defined by 1.2016 NCCN criteria.

      Patients will be randomized to either rectal spacer placement or endorectal balloon
      placement, daily prior to each radiation treatment.

        1. Endorectal balloon (ERB): Immobilization device manually placed into the rectum prior to
           radiation treatment planning CT and daily treatment delivery, to immobilize the prostate
           and reduce prostate motion.

        2. Rectal spacer (RS): Biodegradable gel that is transperineally injected between the
           rectum and prostate under transrectal ultrasound guidance, to increase physical distance
           and thereby reduce radiation dose to the anterior rectal wall. The spacer begins to
           biodegrade in 2-3 months, and is fully absorbed within 6 months.

      This study plans to enroll a total of 40 patients with an accrual period of 4 years.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) instrument for bowel, urinary and sexual domains. scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale (see following page: EPIC scoring), with higher scores representing better HRQOL. American Urological Association (AUA) scores ranges from 0-30 scores where, score greater than 15 indicate high degree of urinary symptoms and scores less than 15 indicate low degree of urinary symptoms.</description>

          <description>Group 1 : Endorectal balloon (ERB): Immobilization device manually placed into the rectum prior to radiation treatment planning CT and daily treatment delivery, to immobilize the prostate and reduce prostate motion.Patients on each arm will receive 5 fractions of radiation, 7.25Gy per fraction, delivered 2-3 times a week (every other day excluding weekends), to total dose of 36.25 Gy. The total duration of treatment will be no shorter than 10 days.

          <description>Group 2 : Rectal spacer (RS): Biodegradable gel that is transperineally injected between the rectum and prostate under transrectal ultrasound guidance, to increase physical distance and thereby reduce radiation dose to the anterior rectal wall. The spacer begins to biodegrade in 2-3 months, and is fully absorbed within 6 months.
