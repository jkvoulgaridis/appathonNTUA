    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of fixed dosed intranasal esketamine
      compared to intranasal placebo, as an add-on to an oral antidepressant in Japanese
      participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), in improving depressive symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score as Measured by the Change From Baseline (Prior to Randomization) to the end of the 4-Week Double-Blind Induction Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of the 4-week (Day 28) double-blind induction phase</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) in the Double-Blind Induction Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 28 (Approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure of the severity of the participant's illness that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function. The CGI-S evaluates the severity of psychopathology on a scale of 0 to 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) in the Double-Blind Induction Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 28 (Approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a brief and validated measure of overall anxiety. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale. Item responses are summed to yield a total score (range of 0 to 21), with higher scores indicating more anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score in the Double-Blind Induction Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 28 (Approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a participant-reported outcome measure and is a 5 item questionnaire which has been widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. The score for the first 3 items are summed to create a total score of 0 to 30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment.</description>

          -  Participant has received vagal nerve stimulation or has received deep brain
             stimulation in the current episode of depression

          -  Participant previously received esketamine or ketamine as treatment for their MDD

          -  Participant has homicidal ideation/intent, per the investigator's clinical judgment,
