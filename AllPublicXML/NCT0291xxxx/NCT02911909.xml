  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if there is a difference in post operative
      rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery while using
      moderated blood flow therapy vs. standard physical therapy. All patients undergoing ACL
      reconstruction, between the ages of 18-30, that consent to taking part in the study, and meet
      eligibility criteria, will be included in the study. Patients will be followed for two years
      to determine any differences in muscle strength, thigh circumference, knee range of motion,
      pain, functional and activity levels, patient satisfaction, levels of Human growth hormone
      HGH), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF), and Creatine Kinase (CK), KT2000, and Lachman
      physical examination.

      The study will be a prospective, randomized, controlled trial between two treatment cohorts.
      A total of 50 patients will be enrolled in the study. Informed consent will be obtained in
      clinic prior to any surgical intervention, per the IRB protocol. Enrollees will receive a
      copy of the consent and HIPAA form. All patients that meet inclusion criteria who consent to
      participate in the study will then be randomly assigned to either the control group or
      moderated blood flow therapy group. Randomization will occur by autogenerated permutated 1:1
      block randomization using electronic assignment from the orthopaedic research team prior to
      initiation of post-operative therapy. The control group will undergo standard of care,
      post-operative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation. The treatment group will also receive
      standard ACL rehabilitation combined with Delfi moderated blood flow restriction therapy.
      Patients will follow up at standard of care clinic visits and participate in the same
      standard of care physical therapy protocol for ACL reconstruction. Baseline measurements of
      thigh circumference, knee ROM, KT 2000, Lachman exam, and labs for HGH, IGF, and CK will be
      obtained preoperatively. Patients will also complete preoperative IKDC, Tegner, PROMIS, and
      VAS pain surveys. Measurements of thigh circumference and knee range of motion will occur at
      2 week intervals post operatively. Strength testing will start at 6 weeks post-operatively.
      These measurements will occur during standard therapy sessions. KT 2000 and Lachman exam will
      be performed at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months post operatively. A standard functional return to
      sport evaluation will be performed at the 4, 6, 8, and 12 month postoperative visits. Labs
      for HGH, IGF, and CK will be drawn at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. VAS pain scores will be
      recorded before and after each therapy session. The PROMIS, IKDC, and Tegner surveys will be
      given at 4, 6, 8, 12 month intervals. The study will conclude at 12 month follow up. All
      post-operative visits will be standard of care. No additional clinic visits will be required
      for this study. Background patient information will be collected including age, sex, BMI, and
      co-morbidities.

      The control group will be necessary to provide a baseline measure on which moderated blood
      flow therapy will be compared.

      Blinding of the subject will not be possible as the patient will be able to recognize if they
      have or have not had the moderated blood flow (Delfi) device applied during therapy and
      application of a sham-device is not practical or considered standard of care. Evaluators
      performing measurements will be blinded to the patient's treatment group during assessment of
      muscle strength, thigh circumference, knee range of motion, Lachman exam, and KT2000.
      Surgeons will also be blinded to the respective treatment groups. All other outcome measures
      are objective and quantitative.

    <description>Compare the Tegner Activity Survey score mean between the Delfi and the control group.
Tegner activity level scale is a scale that aims to provide a standardized method of grading work and sporting activities. Tegner activity level scale is a graduated list of activities of daily living, recreation, and competitive sports. The patient is asked to select the level of participation that best describes their current level of activity and that before injury. The score varies from 0-10. A score of 0 represents sick leave or disability pension because of knee problems, whereas a score of 10 corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports &gt;6 score can only be achieved if the person participates in recreational or competitive sport.</description>

PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. It can be used with the general population and with individuals living with chronic conditions. The Score is represented in a 0 to 100 scale. Zero is the worst possible outcome and 100 is teh best possible outcome</description>

    <measure>International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Survey Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the mean International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) survey score between the delfi and the control group The IKDC Questionnaire is a subjective scale that provides patients with an overall function score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Meanwhile, the sports activity subscale focuses on functions like going up and down the stairs, rising from a chair, squatting and jumping. The knee function subscale asks patients one simple question: how is their knee at present versus how was their knee prior to injury?
Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function.</description>

Tegner activity level scale is a scale that aims to provide a standardized method of grading work and sporting activities. Tegner activity level scale is a graduated list of activities of daily living, recreation, and competitive sports. The patient is asked to select the level of participation that best describes their current level of activity and that before injury. The score varies from 0-10. A score of 0 represents sick leave or disability pension because of knee problems, whereas a score of 10 corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports &gt;6 score can only be achieved if the person participates in recreational or competitive sport.</description>

        <title>International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Survey Score</title>
        <description>Compare the mean International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) survey score between the delfi and the control group The IKDC Questionnaire is a subjective scale that provides patients with an overall function score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Meanwhile, the sports activity subscale focuses on functions like going up and down the stairs, rising from a chair, squatting and jumping. The knee function subscale asks patients one simple question: how is their knee at present versus how was their knee prior to injury?
Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function.</description>
