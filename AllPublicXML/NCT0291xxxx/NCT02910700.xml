  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab and trametinib with or
      without dabrafenib work in treating patients with BRAF-mutated or wild type stage III-IV
      melanoma that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may induce changes in the body's
      immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Trametinib and dabrafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known if nivolumab and trametinib with or without
      dabrafenib may work better in treating patients with BRAF-mutated or wild type metastatic
      melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (objective response rates by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) of nivolumab in combination with dabrafenib
      and/or trametinib in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of the triplet combination (nivolumab-dabrafenib-trametinib
      [NDT]).

      II. Efficacy of the combinations as measured by the depth and duration of response by RECIST
      1.1 on Cohort A, and modified RECIST 1.1 (to include intracranial response) in Cohort B III.
      Pharmacodynamic evaluation of combination on circulating markers (immune monitoring).

      IV. Pharmacodynamic evaluation of combination on tumor tissues. V. Progression- free survival
      and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (NDT): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1,
      dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on
      days 1-28.

      ARM B (NT, CLOSED TO ACCRUAL ): Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and 15
      and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days for 3 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then every 3 months
      for up to 3 years.
