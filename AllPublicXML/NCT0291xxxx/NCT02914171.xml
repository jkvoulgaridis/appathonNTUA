  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of autologous
      mononuclear cells (MNS) collected from bone marrow (BM) and using an add-on intramyocardial
      delivery for individuals with Ebstein anomaly undergoing surgical intervention compared to
      the control group undergoing the same surgical procedure without cell delivery. This add-on
      procedure has the potential to foster a new strategy for individuals with congenital heart
      disease.This is an open-label study of autologous MNC derived from bone marrow with a 2-year
      follow-up to document 1) incidence and severity of adverse event and 2) monitor changes in
      cardiac structure and function.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open label Phase I trial to determine the safety and feasibility of bone
      marrow-derived mononuclear cells to the right ventricle of subjects with Ebstein anomaly at
      the time of a planned surgical Ebstein repair compared to the control group undergoing the
      same planned surgical intervention without the cell delivery add-on procedure. Subjects will
      be screened at outpatient clinic visits at Mayo Clinic and interested qualified subjects will
      be consented and offered participation in this trial. Subject/Family will decide to
      participate in cell delivery or control arm. Once informed consent has been obtained,
      subjects will undergo identical evaluation (other than Hematology consultation and BM harvest
      occurring only in the cell-treatment group),preoperative values will be established/confirmed
      and a selection committee will review subjects within three days prior to planned procedure
      to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria.However, individuals at high-risk, primarily
      neonates and those with preoperative advanced right heart failure will NOT be included such
      that the risk of this add-on procedure may not be acceptable. Following surgical Ebstein
      repair for the control group and following cell-based product delivery for the treatment
      group, all subjects will be followed for 24-months according to a pre-determined schedule
      that includes imaging studies along with a questionnaire, electrophysiology and laboratory
      studies at 1, 6, and 24 months post procedure. All subjects will be contacted for
      surveillance by phone at 3, 12, and 18 month post procedure.

    <description>Safety assessment of adverse events from time of index procedure will be analyzed by counts and percents using the chi-square test and Cochran-Armitage test for trends, and the two groups compared using the Fisher exact test. A Fisher's exact test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect a difference in a sample size of 10 in each group. Thus having reasonable power to distinguish common rates for adverse events from very rare rates. Analysis of cardiac adverse events is in terms of the yes/no information at 24 months. Subjects will be censored upon lost to follow up. If some subjects are lost to follow-up then fractions at 24 months will be described using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparison between the two groups using the log-rank test. A confidence interval for the difference between groups will be given.</description>
