  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary data on the efficacy (digital
      ulcer net burden) and safety of riociguat administered 3 times daily (TID) in comparison to
      placebo in patients with scleroderma-associated digital ulcers
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a US, multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled,
      parallel- group study with a total of 20 participants planned to be randomized (approximately
      10 participants to the riociguat group and 10 to the placebo group). In addition, a
      standardized wound care protocol will be followed by the investigators and digital
      photography will be taken of the cardinal ulcer.

      The study will allow standard of care medications for the management of DU as background
      therapy. These may include calcium channel blockers, low dose aspirin, angiotensin enzyme
      inhibitors, etc. and will be determined by the participant's local physician.

      The study design consists of three phases:

        -  Screening phase: up to 2 weeks

        -  Double-blind Treatment phase: 16 weeks of double-blind treatment, consisting of:

        -  Dose titration period of up to 8 weeks, and

        -  Stable dosing period of up to 8 weeks

        -  Open-label Extension phase for participants with active DU at the end of the double-
           blind treatment phase or development of an active DU within a month of completing
           double-blind phase, consisting of:

        -  Dose titration phase of up to 8 weeks

        -  Stable dosing period for 8 weeks

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Digital ulcer net burden is defined as the total number of &quot;active&quot; and indeterminate digital ulcers at an assessment. Active ulcers are defined as having a denuded area with defined border and loss of epithelialization, loss of epidermis and dermis. An indeterminate ulcer is defined as denudation that could not be visualized and no other clinical features of activity. A healed ulcer has complete re-epithelialization.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participant whose active digital ulcer that was identified and designated by the investigator as the cardinal ulcer at Baseline is healed by week 16. The cardinal ulcer will be selected by the investigator based on the clinical judgment that it was amenable to and evaluable for healing. If there are several active digital ulcers, the cardinal ulcer could be either the largest or the most painful ulcer, or the ulcer that disturbed the patient the most. Active ulcers are defined as having a denuded area with defined border and loss of epithelialization, loss of epidermis and dermis.</description>

    <description>The Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis - Digital Ulcers (HDISS-DU) questionnaire is a 24-item PRO measure. Each item is scored from 1-6 (1=yes, without difficulty; 2=yes, with a little difficulty; 3=yes, with some difficulty; 4=yes with much difficulty; 5=nearly impossible to do &amp; used unaffected hand only; 6=impossible). The total HDISS-DU score is the mean of valid items, ranging from 1 to 6. Higher scores represent increased disability in hand functioning.</description>

                  3 days is required for sildenafil and 7 days for tadalafil or vardenafil prior to
                  the baseline visit

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Healing of Their Cardinal DU by Week 16</title>
        <description>The proportion of participant whose active digital ulcer that was identified and designated by the investigator as the cardinal ulcer at Baseline is healed by week 16. The cardinal ulcer will be selected by the investigator based on the clinical judgment that it was amenable to and evaluable for healing. If there are several active digital ulcers, the cardinal ulcer could be either the largest or the most painful ulcer, or the ulcer that disturbed the patient the most. Active ulcers are defined as having a denuded area with defined border and loss of epithelialization, loss of epidermis and dermis.</description>

        <title>Time to Healing of Cardinal DU</title>
        <description>This is defined as the number of weeks from randomization to the earliest of healing, end of the double-blind period, or drop-out. Participants are censored if they drop-out or their cardinal DU has not healed by the end of the double-blind period. One active digital ulcer must be identified and designated by the investigator as the cardinal ulcer at Baseline. If several digital ulcers qualified, the cardinal ulcer could be either the largest or the most painful ulcer, or the ulcer that disturbed the patient the most. The cardinal ulcer will be selected by the investigator based on the clinical judgment that it was amenable to and evaluable for healing. Active ulcers are defined as having a denuded area with defined border and loss of epithelialization, loss of epidermis and dermis. Week 16 is defined as the end of the double-blind period; however, the protocol allowed a visit window of +/- 4 weeks.</description>

          <title>Time to Development of New ('Active' or 'Indeterminate') DU</title>
          <description>This is defined as the number of weeks from randomization to the earliest of new DU, end of the double-blind period, or drop-out. Participants are censored if they drop-out or have not developed a new DU by the end of the double-blind period. Active ulcers are defined as having a denuded area with defined border and loss of epithelialization, loss of epidermis and dermis. An indeterminate ulcer is defined as denudation that could not be visualized and no other clinical features of activity. A healed ulcer has complete re-epithelialization. Week 16 is defined as the end of the double-blind period; however, the protocol allowed a visit window of +/- 4 weeks.</description>

        <description>The Raynaud's condition score is a daily patient assessment of Raynaud's phenomenon activity using a 0 -10 ordinal scale. It incorporates the cumulative frequency, duration, severity and impact of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks, reflecting the overall degree that Raynaud's has affected use of the participant's hands. A score of 0 indicates no difficulty and 10 indicates extreme difficulty with Raynaud's condition. A higher score means a worse outcome. The mean score will be calculated across the 7-day screening and week 16 periods for each participant.</description>

          <description>Numbness because of Raynaud's disease (characterized as numbness during a Raynaud's attack) is defined on a visual analogue scale, where 0 indicates no numbness and 100 indicates very severe numbness. A higher score means a worse outcome. The mean of the scales over a 7-day period are reported. For the days when a participant does not have an attack, a score of 0 will be used. The mean scale score for each symptom will be calculated across the 7-day screening and week 16 periods for each participant.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in PROMIS-29 Pain Intensity</title>
          <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29-item short-form health-reported quality of life measures (PROMIS-29) were administered. The transformed score (T-score) for the pain intensity domain was used, where 50 (10) is the mean (standard deviation) of a relevant reference population. Higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (i.e., worse outcome).</description>

        <description>The Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis - Digital Ulcers (HDISS-DU) questionnaire is a 24-item PRO measure. Each item is scored from 1-6 (1=yes, without difficulty; 2=yes, with a little difficulty; 3=yes, with some difficulty; 4=yes with much difficulty; 5=nearly impossible to do &amp; used unaffected hand only; 6=impossible). The total HDISS-DU score is the mean of valid items, ranging from 1 to 6. Higher scores represent increased disability in hand functioning.</description>
