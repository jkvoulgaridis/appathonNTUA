    <textblock>
      The feasibility of using the Apnea Risk Evaluating System (ARESTM) device to take
      longitudinal measures of sleep parameters in asymptomatic men with prostate cancer who are
      about to initiate androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will be evaluated. Study participants
      will complete serial questionnaires relating to sleep quality, hot flashes, and quality of
      life.

      The primary purpose of our study is to examine the feasibility of using the ARESTM device to
      measure sleep parameters of prostate cancer patients who are beginning ADT. Although some
      evidence links ADT to poor quality of sleep, no research has assessed the impact of ADT on
      most sleep parameters. We chose the ARESTM device for this study because the device can
      comprehensively measure sleep parameters. Furthermore, unlike polysomnography, the ARESTM
      device is easy to use and the measurements can be done at participants' home, without
      requiring them to adapt to a new sleeping location (e.g., sleep lab). ARESTM is a wireless
      device that is worn on the forehead during sleep to record physiological parameters. In
      addition, the feasibility of obtaining serial questionnaires from patients will be assessed.
      In this pilot study, the study investigators will attempt to make some preliminary
      correlations between sleep quality (as measured by ARESTM) with subjective sleep quality,
      morphometric measures, urinary symptoms, and hot flashes. Data collected from this study will
      help to determine the acceptability of and compliance with using the ARESTM device by this
      patient population.

    <description>The ARESTM device is a commercial home sleep-testing device that can record the following parameters (for up to 7 continuous hours) when participants are asleep:
NREM and REM sleep frequency and duration
Duration and number of arousal
Blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate via a silicone-embedded optical sensor
Fluctuation in nasal airflow pressure via a nasal cannula and pressure transducer
Head movement actigraphy and flux in snoring as measures of sleep/wake patterns via two accelerometers and an acoustic microphone
Apnea/hypopnea index and respiratory disturbance index</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed prostate cancer starting hormone therapy with or without concomitant
             radiation therapy for at least 6 months, or

          2. Biochemical relapse of prostate cancer without metastatic symptoms (i.e. rising
             Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive therapy with no evidence of
             metastatic disease)*.

          3. Serum testosterone in the hypogonadal range or above, but not at castrate levels.

          4. About to start ADT with a Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) analogue for at
             least 6 months.

          5. Fluent in English (able to read, write, and speak in English).

             pressure) machine to sleep may join the study.

               -  Note: For participants who are having both hormone therapy and radiation, sleep
                  parameters will only be measured before the participant starts radiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receiving antiandrogen monotherapy.

          2. Previous history of sleep disorder (e.g., being treated for obstructive sleep apnea
             (and wear a CPAP machine), narcolepsy, parasomnia, circadian rhythm abnormalities).

          3. Use of routine prescription or over the counter sleep medications (e.g., melatonin,
             zolpidem, suvorexant, eszopiclone, ramelteon, benzodiazepine, antihistamine).

          4. Active medical problems that interfere with sleep (e.g. congestive heart failure).
