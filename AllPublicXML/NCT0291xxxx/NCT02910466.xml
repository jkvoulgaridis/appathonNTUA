  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a life-long and irreversible disease for which the chronic
      administration of rhPTH(1-84) is a potential treatment option. The group of participants in
      the AAAE0544 core study has been taking rhPTH(1-84) for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism
      for up to 11 years. This study is designed to extend this experience and gain knowledge about
      how safe and effective rhPTH(1-84) is in participants with hypoparathyroidism over a
      long-term duration.

For items 1-9, the individual score ranges from None=0 to Very severe=4 and for items 10-13, it ranges from Not at all=0 to Very much=2. For symptom subscale score, the average score of the symptom items 1-7 will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in FACT-Cog assessment will be assessed. The FACT-Cog assessment is a 37-item tool. The items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale ranged 0 from 4. It includes 4 subscales: 2 subscales ranged as following: 0 (never), 1 (About once a week), 2 (two to three times a week), 3 (Nearly every day) and 4 (several times a day): Perceived cognitive impairments subscale and comments from others subscale and two others subscale ranged as following: 0 (not at all), 1 (a little bit), 2 (somewhat), 3 (quite a bit) and 4 (very much): Perceived cognitive abilities and impact on quality of life subscales. The total score is obtained with the sum of these 4 subscales.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) (Fatigue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT fatigue questionnaire contains 13 fatigue-related questions. The responses to the 13 items on the FACIT fatigue questionnaire are each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent less fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The scale is designed to avoid reliance on aspects of conditions that are also common somatic symptoms of illness. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3, therefore, a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. For each of the two subscores, if a participant obtain a score ranged from: 0 to 7, he is considered as &quot;normal&quot;; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case) and 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire that questions participants about perceived physical and mental health and function. The SF-36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight; the lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability that is (ie), a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. The eight sections included in the SF-36 assessment are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health.</description>
