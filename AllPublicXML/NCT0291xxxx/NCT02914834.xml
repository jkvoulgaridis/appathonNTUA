  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT aims to determine if it is possible to perform acupuncture on men and women
      diagnosed with stable angina who have symptoms, chest pain, and/or chest discomfort. The
      investigators want to determine if acupuncture reduces the pain and other symptoms of angina,
      chest pain, and chest discomfort. The investigators also want to examine whether this study
      is acceptable to the participants, and by carrying out this study the investigators will be
      able to tell how many participants they will need in a future larger study to further test
      acupuncture to reduce the symptoms of angina in women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a RCT aimed at gathering feasibility, and initial efficacy
      for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of acupuncture on anginal
      symptoms, chest pain, and chest discomfort in men and women. The investigators long term goal
      is pain and symptom management resulting in improved functional status and quality of life
      for men and women with stable angina, chest pain, and chest discomfort. This study will
      include 69 community dwelling men and women with a medically confirmed diagnosis of stable
      angina, chest pain which includes non-ischemic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, microvascular
      coronary dysfunction (MCD), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or chest discomfort whose pain and associated
      symptoms have not been completely controlled with guideline-directed medical management. The
      investigators will use a randomized attention control design with 13 men and women assigned
      to initial acupuncture and 13 to control. Participants in the experimental group will receive
      a standardized acupuncture point prescription two treatments per week, for 5 weeks. The
      attention control group will receive non-pain related video health education over 5 weeks
      equal to the approximate 10 hours of treatment for the acupuncture group.
