  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent
      (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in patients
      with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy and radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.
      Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled
      PSMA-11 in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data to
      obtain further approvals of the Ga-68-PSMA-11 compound, so that this agent will become
      available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients. In the biochemical recurrence
      population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive
      value (PPV) on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor
      location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy.
