  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of perampanel during the
      Maintenance Period of the Core Study following oral suspension administration given as an
      adjunctive therapy in pediatric participants from 1 month to less than 4 years of age with
      epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study comprised of pretreatment, treatment (core study),
      and extension phases that is designed to evaluate the PK of an oral suspension of perampanel
      (maximum dose must not exceed 12 milligrams per day [mg /day] for participants taking
      non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug [non-EIAED] or 16 mg/day for participants taking
      EIAED) when given as an adjunctive therapy in participants ranging from 1 month to less than
      4 years of age with epilepsy. The Pretreatment Phase will last up to 2 weeks, during which
      participants will be assessed for their eligibility to participate in the study. The
      Treatment Phase will consist of 3 periods: Titration (12 [for participants taking non-EIAED]
      to 16 weeks [for participants taking EIAED]), Maintenance (4 weeks), and Follow-Up (4 weeks;
      only for those participants who complete the Maintenance Period but do not continue into the
      Extension Phase and those participants who discontinue study participation). Extension Phase:
      The Extension Phase will consist of 2 periods: Maintenance (32 weeks [for participants taking
      EIAED]; 36 weeks [for participants taking non-EIAED]) and Follow-Up (4 weeks).

      The maximum total duration of treatment for each participant will be 52 weeks and the maximum
      total duration of the study for each participant will be 58 weeks (2 weeks Pretreatment+52
      weeks of treatment+4 weeks Follow-up).
