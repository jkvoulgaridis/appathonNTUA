      Next generation real-time monitoring for PrEP adherence in young Kenyan women
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a longitudinal study of young Kenyan women at high risk for HIV who
      will be offered HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for up to two years. Adherence will be
      monitored in all women with the next generation Wisepill; half will be randomized to receive
      short message service (SMS) reminders. The technical function, acceptability, cost, and
      validity of the next generation Wisepill device coupled to SMS reminders will be determined
      among this cohort of young Kenyan women. Additionally, SMS will be used for longitudinal
      assessment of risk perception and its alignment with PrEP adherence.
