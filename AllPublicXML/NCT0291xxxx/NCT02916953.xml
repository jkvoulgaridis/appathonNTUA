      The study will evaluate the immediate procedure and post-procedure profile of the AGN1
      Femoral LOEP™ Kit. All subjects will receive the treatment and be evaluated for any adverse
      or serious adverse events that could occur during the procedure or immediately
      post-procedure.

      This research study will be conducted as a post-CE Mark prospective multi-center study within
      Europe. In total 60 patients will be treated with the OSSURE LOEP kit.

      Follow-up visits will be conducted ten (10) and forty-two (42) days after the procedure. In
      addition, all subjects will have the option to consent for a long term follow-up evaluation
      at twelve (12) months post-procedure.

          1. Subject is postmenopausal female (at least 1-year post menses).

          2. Subject has osteoporosis as defined by a documented DXA scan T score of ≤ -2.5 in the
             femoral neck of at least one hip within the last year. If no documented T-score, then
             a DXA scan will be performed during eligibility screening.

          3. Subject has one hip without previous surgery or fracture.

          4. Subject is medically stable from any previous treatment or medical procedure in the
             opinion of the investigator and with an ASA score of I or II.

          5. Subject has willingness, ability, and commitment to participate in baseline and
             follow-up evaluations for the full length of the study.

          6. Subject is capable of giving written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is less than six (6) months removed from having a hip fracture repair or
             prosthesis, or less than three (3) months removed from an elective THA.

          2. Subject has progressive increase in undiagnosed hip pain over the previous six months
             that in the opinion of the Investigator may suggest other underlying bone or joint
             pathology (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, fracture, etc.).

          3. Subject is dependent on the use of a wheel-chair or is bed-ridden.

          4. Subject has albumin corrected serum calcium levels outside the normal lab range or has
             a pre-existing calcium metabolism disorder (e.g. hypercalcemia).

          5. Subject has severe renal insufficiency defined as an estimated glomerular filtration
             rate (eGFR) ≤ 30 mL/min or is being treated with dialysis.

          6. Subject has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).

          7. Subject has Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35.

          8. Subject exhibits excessive smokeless tobacco use or excessive smoking as determined by
             the principal investigator*.

             investigator*.

         10. Subject has radiological evidence of gross bony or joint pathology, including signs
             predictive of atypical femoral fractures (e.g. Cortical beaking) or has been diagnosed
             and/or treated for atypical femoral fractures.

         11. Subject treated with corticosteroids or systemic glucocorticoids for ten (10) days in
             the previous six (6) months.

         12. Subject has history of oral or parenteral use of immune-suppressive drugs in the
             previous twelve months.

         13. Subject has history of metabolic bone disease other than osteoporosis (ex. Paget's
             disease).

         14. Subject has a history of auto-immune arthritic diseases including rheumatoid,
             psoriatic, or those associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthropathy,
             Reiter's Syndrome or Crohn's Disease.

         15. Subject has a history of radiation therapy to the hip or pelvic region.

         16. Subject has a history of any invasive malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma), unless
             treated and with no clinical signs of symptoms of malignancy for five (5) years.

         17. Subject has known allergies to implanted device.

         18. Subject has severe comorbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate.

         19. Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical study. *AgNovos's recommendation is
             &gt;1 pack per day smoking and &gt;3 alcoholic drinks per day
