  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a prescribed beverage
      intervention in 50 obese Hispanic adults ages 18-64 years over 6 weeks; and 2) assess
      preliminary effects of the beverage intervention on cholesterol and triglyceride levels as
      well as other markers of health such as blood pressure, glucose and markers of inflammation.
      This project, if successful, will provide early evidence that targeting dietary behavior
      around beverage intake could be a novel and easily adopted approach to reduce the burden or
      delay the onset of metabolic abnormalities in obese Hispanic adults. The expected outcome of
      the proposed project is the identification of feasible and appropriate beverage intervention
      strategies to improve engagement and adherence to dietary modification approaches for control
      of metabolic health indicators in this vulnerable ethnic group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., Hispanics have the highest rates of overweight and obesity when compared to
      other racial/ethnic groups placing them at a greater risk for obesity-related disease. Yet,
      current literature is limited to information on best practices to engage Hispanics in
      health-promoting lifestyle interventions. Without this information the health consequences
      associated with obesity, including high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose and high
      cholesterol, will continue. Evidence exists to support diet-specific behavioral interventions
      in reducing obesity-related health risks. Among the more adoptable interventions to date are
      efforts targeting beverage intake. Yet, there are limited data to suggest these approaches
      are effective for Hispanics despite this being the fastest growing and highest burdened group
      for obesity-related disease within the U.S. population.

      This study aims to 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a prescribed beverage
      intervention in 50 obese Hispanic adults ages 18-64 years over 6 weeks; 2) assess preliminary
      effects of the beverage intervention on cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as other
      markers of health such as blood pressure, glucose and markers of inflammation. This project,
      if successful, will provide early evidence that targeting dietary behavior around beverage
      intake could be a novel and easily adopted approach to reduce the burden or delay the onset
      of metabolic abnormalities in obese Hispanic adults. The expected outcome of the proposed
      project is the identification of feasible and appropriate beverage intervention strategies to
      improve engagement and adherence to dietary modification approaches for control of metabolic
      health indicators in this vulnerable ethnic group.

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was short in duration. It is possible that this was not an adequate amount of time to observe changes in our primary outcomes. In addition, the small sample size may have reduced effect size, thus hindering our capacity to detect changes.</limitations_and_caveats>
