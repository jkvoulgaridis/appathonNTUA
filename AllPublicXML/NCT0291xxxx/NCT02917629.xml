    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well ACTOplus met XR works in treating in
      patients with stage I-IV oral cavity or oropharynx cancer that are undergoing definitive
      treatment. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep oral cavity or oropharynx cancer from
      forming or coming back. The use of ACTOplus met XR may slow disease progression in patients
      with oral cavity or oropharynx cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether 10-21 days of treatment with ACTOplus met XR will result in a
      decrease in proliferation index (Ki-67) expression in oral cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue
      as compared to placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare differences in proliferation index (Ki-67) expression from baseline to
      post-exposure in visually normal appearing oral cavity/oropharyngeal tissue.

      II. Compare immunohistochemical differences in the apoptosis biomarker cleaved caspase 3 from
      baseline to post-exposure in oral cavity/oropharyngeal adjacent visually normal appearing
      tissue and tumor tissue samples.

      III. Compare immunohistochemical differences from baseline to post-exposure in oral
      cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue samples with regard to cyclin D1, p21 and biguanide or PPAR
      gamma associated pathway biomarkers; prospective biomarkers on the panel will include
      phosphorylated (p)AKT, pAMPK, pS6 (metformin), and PPAR gamma.

      IV. Compare immunohistochemical differences from baseline to post-exposure of oral
      cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue samples with regard to tumor infiltrating immune cells
      (effector CD8 [CD8+]), regulatory CD4 T regulatory (Treg) (CD4+Foxp3+), tumor associated
      myeloid cells (CD68), PD1 and PD-L1.

      V. Compare and correlate pre- and post-ACTOplus met XR treatment human ribonucleic acid
      (RNA)-sequencing (seq) gene analysis on total RNA samples from oral cavity/oropharyngeal
      adjacent visually normal appearing tissue and tumor tissue pre-and post-study treatment.

      VI. Determine human papillomavirus (HPV) status in pre-treatment tumor tissue using p16
      immunohistochemistry.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Compare pre- and post-study treatment fludeoxyglucose F-18
      (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans with regard to
      standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG and tumor burden using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 in those participants with a preintervention standard
      of care staging FDG-PET/CT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive ACTOplus met XR orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 10-21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue ACTOplus met
      XR PO QD for a maximum of 25 days if end of treatment biopsy/surgical treatment is delayed
      beyond day 22.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD daily for 10-21 days.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, stage I-IV squamous cell
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the oral cavity or oropharynx and will
             be undergoing definitive surgical, radiotherapy, or chemoradiation treatment; patients
             who are NOT candidates for localized treatment (surgery, radiation or chemoradiation)
             with curative intent (i.e.patients with distant metastasis or contra-indication to
             localized treatment) are not eligible OR

          -  Participant has a lesion in the oral cavity or oropharynx that is not yet biopsied but
             is highly suspicious for cancer; (randomization will be placed on hold until the
             presence of cancer is histologically confirmed, and a treatment plan is established;
             if the presence of cancer is not confirmed, the participant will be considered a
             screen failure)

          -  The participant's primary tumor is accessible for the collection of 4 mm samples of
             tumor and adjacent visually normal appearing tissue for biomarker analysis and the
             participant is willing to have these samples collected at baseline and at the end of
             study visit. (The protocol requires the collection of fresh tissue for biomarker
             analysis)

               -  Patients who have not yet had a diagnostic biopsy:

                    -  The tissue samples for biomarker analysis may be collected in conjunction
                       with the patient's standard of care diagnostic biopsy but not until after
                       the patient has signed informed consent and it has been determined that they
                       meet all of the eligibility criteria for this protocol with the exception of
                       normal organ and marrow function as defined by the clinical laboratory test
                       results listed for that criterion. In this situation, because the patient
                       would be having a biopsy regardless of whether or not they were
                       participating in this study, it is not required to obtain these results
                       prior to conducting the biopsy. It is however, required to confirm normal
                       organ and marrow function prior to randomization.

                    -  Patients who are scheduled for a direct operative laryngoscopy with biopsy
                       (DL biopsy) for diagnostic purposes may be candidates for this study
                       provided the following criteria are met:

                         -  The lesion to be biopsied is within the anatomic confines of the
                            oropharynx (i.e. above the epiglottis).

                         -  Tissue samples for biomarker analysis of the required 4 mm size are
                            able to be obtained from both the lesion and an area of visually normal
                            appearing tissue adjacent to but 1 cm distant from the lesion.

        In this situation, randomization will be placed on hold until the following criteria are
        met:

          -  Normal organ and marrow function is confirmed.

          -  There is histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma.

          -  It has been determined that surgical excision will be the first line standard of care
             treatment and the end of study tissue samples will be obtained in conjunction with
             that surgery.

        Because these patient's lesions are not accessible to end of study tissue sample collection
        in the outpatient clinic setting, the only way to obtain those samples is in conjunction
        with standard of care surgical excision of the lesion. If the first line of treatment will
        be non-surgical, the patient will be considered a screen failure. Under no circumstances
        will DL biopsy be used for the sole purpose of collecting tissue samples for biomarker
        analysis.

          -  Patients who have already had a diagnostic biopsy:

               -  The baseline tissue samples for biomarker analysis will be collected in the
                  outpatient clinic setting as a &quot;for research purposes only&quot; procedure. The
                  samples may not be collected until it has been determined that the participant
                  meets all eligibility criteria for this protocol.

          -  End of study tissue sample collection:

               -  If surgical excision will be the patient's first line treatment, the end of study
                  tissue samples for biomarker analysis will be collected in conjunction with that
                  surgery. If, for any reason, the patient's surgery is delayed beyond Day 26, the
                  end of study tissue samples may be collected in the outpatient clinic setting.

               -  If the patient's first line of treatment will not be surgical excision, the end
                  of study tissue samples for biomarker analysis will be collected in the
                  outpatient clinic setting prior to initiation of the non-surgical treatment.

                    -  Participant is able to complete a minimum of 10 days of study agent dosing
                       prior to initiation of definitive treatment for their cancer

                    -  Participant is scheduled for an end of study biopsy within 22 days of
                       starting study agent and within 52 days of their study screening visit; (if
                       the participant is scheduled for surgical excision of the tumor and the
                       surgery is delayed for any reason after the participant has started taking
                       the study agent, study agent dosing may be extended up to a maximum of 25
                       days without compromising the evaluability of the end of study biomarkers)
