  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent chronic inflammation is an important underlying event in multiple diseases
      including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and type 2 diabetes. These
      disorders are characterized as inflammatory in part because of the important mediating role
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines in their pathogenesis. This study will investigate whether
      transcutaneous auricular electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve will affect and decrease
      the inflammatory cytokine response in healthy individuals.

    <intervention_name>Vagus Nerve Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will receive transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the left vagus nerve for 5 minutes. Blood will be withdrawn prior to stimulation and 1 hour following the stimulation. The device is a handheld electrical pulse generator and a pair of electrodes to be placed at the ear for stimulation. The specific target at the ear will be the auricular branch of the vagus nerve which innervates the skin of the ear canal. Electrodes will be placed near/at the entrance to the canal of the ear to provide stimulation to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive sham transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the left vagus nerve for 5 minutes. Blood will be withdrawn prior to stimulation and 1 hour following the stimulation. Sham stimulation will be performed in the identical manner as true transcutaneous stimulation except that the patient will not receive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve.</description>
