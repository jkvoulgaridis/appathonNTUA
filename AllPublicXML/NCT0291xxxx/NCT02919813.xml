  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about Mindfulness based Group Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy (M-gCBT) as a treatment for Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV). M-gCBT is a
      counseling technique that has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety with other medical
      conditions, including chronic pain conditions. The investigators wish to see if participation
      in M-gCBT course will help reduce anxiety, fear, and pain in women with PLV greater than
      education alone. Both techniques use a group setting including other women with PLV.
      &quot;Mindfulness-Based Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Women with Localized Vulvodynia&quot; is a
      study designed to learn more about the use of mindfulness based group cognitive behavior
      therapy for PLV pain and anxiety over education alone. Participants will be randomized to one
      of two groups: mindfulness based cognitive behavior therapy or group education seminars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      M-gCBT is a type of counseling that teaches women to have more control over their pain.
      Educational seminars teach women about the different aspects of PLV that affect emotional and
      physical health. Both groups will be given a binder containing course material at the first
      session and homework at each session that you will be asked to complete. The group education
      seminars will include an informational video clip reviewing an aspect of PLV and sexuality
      and will be followed by a group discussion facilitated by an instructor. Each session will
      involve a teacher and a small group of 6 to 12 women with PLV. Additionally, women in both
      groups will be asked to perform a weekly test to measure pain and to complete a daily diary.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampon Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in pain measured by the Tampon Test at 6 months. The tampon test is a validated tool used to measure (vulva) vestibular skin pain by having participants insert and remove a tampon. Participants will be asked to rate their pain along a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale on a scale of 0 (No pain) to 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). This test will occur at baseline and 6 months follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Distress Survey Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in sexual distress at 6 months. Participants will complete a Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) survey to rate their feelings associated with sexual activities; range 0 (better outcome) - 52 (worse outcome). The FSDS surveys will be completed at baseline and 6 months follow up. A negative change in FSDS score from baseline indicates less sexual distress over time (better outcome) and a positive change in FSDS score from baseline indicates more sexual distress over time (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in sexual function at 6 months. Participants will complete a Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) survey which asks questions about participants sexual feelings over the past 4 weeks; range 2 (worse outcome) - 95 (better outcome). The FSFI surveys will be completed at baseline and 6 months follow up. A negative change in FSFI score from baseline indicates less sexual function over time (worse outcome) and a positive change in FSFI score from baseline indicates more sexual function over time (better outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in depression at 6 months. Participants will complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-PC) questionnaire, which consists of 21 groups of statements where participants selects which statement best describes how they have been feeling during the past 2 weeks. Total score = sum of 21 statement subscales; range 0 (better outcome) - 63 (worse outcome). The BDI-PC surveys will be completed at baseline and 6 months follow up. A negative change in BDI-PC score from baseline indicates less depression over time (better outcome) and a positive change in BDI-PC score from baseline indicates more depression over time (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in anxiety at 6 months. Participants will complete the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale questionnaire. The GAD-7 consists of 7 problems where participants rate how often they have been bothered by those problems during the past 2 weeks. Total score = sum of 7 subscales; range 0 (better outcome) - 21 (worse outcome). The GAD-7 surveys will be completed at baseline and 6 months follow up. A negative change in GAD-7 score from baseline indicates less anxiety over time (better outcome) and a positive change in GAD-7 score from baseline indicates more anxiety over time (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in pain catastrophizing at 6 months. Participants will complete the Pain Catastrophizing Scale survey. The survey consists of thirteen statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain. Total score = sum of 13 statement subscales; range 0 (better outcome) - 52 (worse outcome). The pain catastrophizing surveys will be completed at baseline and 6 months follow up. A negative change in score from baseline indicates less pain catastrophizing over time (better outcome) and a positive change in score from baseline indicates more pain catastrophizing over time (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Questionnaire Response</measure>

        <description>The change from baseline in pain measured by the Tampon Test at 6 months. The tampon test is a validated tool used to measure (vulva) vestibular skin pain by having participants insert and remove a tampon. Participants will be asked to rate their pain along a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale on a scale of 0 (No pain) to 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). This test will occur at baseline and 6 months follow up.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in pain catastrophizing at 6 months. Participants will complete the Pain Catastrophizing Scale survey. The survey consists of thirteen statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain. Total score = sum of 13 statement subscales; range 0 (better outcome) - 52 (worse outcome). The pain catastrophizing surveys will be completed at baseline and 6 months follow up. A negative change in score from baseline indicates less pain catastrophizing over time (better outcome) and a positive change in score from baseline indicates more pain catastrophizing over time (worse outcome).</description>
