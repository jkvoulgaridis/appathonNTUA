    <measure>Change in BMI SDS (Week 0, Week 56)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 56</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in BMI SDS was evaluated at week 56. BMI SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' BMI provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the world health organisation (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation. Results are based on both participants who completed the week 0-56 trial period and participants who prematurely discontinued the trial product but attended the follow-up visit at 56.</description>

    <description>Change in height standard deviation score (SDS) was evaluated from baseline (week 0) to weeks 30 and 56, and from week 56 to week 82. Height SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' height provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. Results are based on both participants who completed the trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82, and participants who could not complete the corresponding trial period, but attended the follow-up visit at week 30, 56 or 82, respectively.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This trial was conducted at 32 sites in 5 countries: Belgium (6 sites), Sweden (4 sites), Russia (8 sites), Mexico (2 sites) and the United States of America (USA - 12 sites). Additionally, 1 site in the USA was approved by the independent review board, but did not randomise any participant.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This trial consisted of a 12-week run-in period, during which participants received counselling on healthy nutrition and physical activity. Completed numbers include participants who completed the trial without prematurely discontinuing the trial product and participants who discontinued the trial product but came for the week 82 follow-up visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in BMI SDS (Week 0, Week 56)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in BMI SDS was evaluated at week 56. BMI SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' BMI provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the world health organisation (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation. Results are based on both participants who completed the week 0-56 trial period and participants who prematurely discontinued the trial product but attended the follow-up visit at 56.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, week 56</time_frame>
        <population>Results are based on the full analysis set (FAS) which included all randomised participants who had received at least one dose of trial product and had any post-randomisation data (according to the intention-to-treat [ITT] principle). “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” = number of participants with available data.</population>

        <description>Change in BMI SDS was evaluated from baseline (week 0) to weeks 30 and 82, and from week 56 to week 82. BMI SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' BMI provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a Z (SDS) score was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation. Results are based on both participants who completed the trial period, week 0-30 or week 0-82, and participants who could not complete the corresponding trial period, but attended the follow-up visit at week 30 or 82, respectively.</description>

        <description>Change in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids (IWQOL-Kids) was evaluated from baseline (week 0) to weeks 30 and 56, and from week 56 to week 82. The IWQOL-Kids is a 27-item measure of weight-related quality of life. There are four domain scores (Physical Comfort, Body Esteem, Social Life and Family Life) and a total score. Scores for all domains and total score range from 0-100, with higher scores representing better health-related quality of life. IWQOL-kids data at week 82 was not collected, thus could not be evaluated. Results are based on the participants who completed the corresponding trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82.</description>

          <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes (Novo Nordisk/ISPAD Classification)</title>
          <description>Severe hypoglycaemia episodes were recorded as per the ISPAD definition. And the following presented hypoglycaemia episodes were recorded as per Novo Nordisk definition: Symptomatic BG-confirmed: An episode that is blood glucose (BG) confirmed by plasma glucose (PG) value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Asymptomatic BG-confirmed: An episode that is BG-confirmed by PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. 4) Severe or BG-confirmed symptomatic: An episode that is severe according to the ISPAD classification or BG-confirmed by a PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. 5) BG-confirmed: An episode that is BG-confirmed by a PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. 6) Severe or BG-confirmed: An episode that is severe according to the ISPAD classification or BG-confirmed by a PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

          <description>This outcome measure presents number of subjects with electrocardiogram findings, &quot;normal; abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS) or abnormal, clinically significant (CS)&quot; recorded at baseline (week -14), week 30 and week 56. These findings were categorised by the investigator. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data at week 82 was not collected, thus could not be evaluated. Week 30 and 56 results are based on the participants who completed the corresponding trial period, week 0-30 or week 0-56.</description>

          <title>Change in Biochemistry: Urea (BUN), Sodium, Potassium, Calcium Total and Calcium Albumin-corrected</title>
          <description>Change in biochemistry parameters, &quot;urea (blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), sodium, potassium, calcium total and calcium (Ca) albumin-corrected&quot; was evaluated from baseline (week [Wk] 0) to weeks 30 and 56, and from week 56 to week 82. Results are based on the participants who completed the corresponding trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82.</description>
          <population>Results are based on the SAS which included all randomised participants exposed to at least one dose of trial product. “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” = SAS. “Number Analyzed” = number of participants with available data.</population>

        <description>This outcome measure presents number of subjects with physical examination findings, &quot;normal; abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS) or abnormal, clinically significant (CS)&quot; at baseline (week 0), week 30, week 56 and week 82. These findings were categorised by the investigator. Results include examination of: &quot;general appearance&quot;; &quot;head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck&quot;; &quot;respiratory system&quot;; &quot;cardiovascular system (CVS)&quot;; &quot;gastrointestinal (GI) system including mouth&quot;; &quot;musculoskeletal system&quot;; &quot;central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS)&quot;; &quot;skin&quot;; &quot;thyroid gland&quot; and &quot;lymph node palpation&quot;. Week 30, 56 and 82 results are based on the participants who completed the corresponding trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82.</description>

        <title>Change in Height SDS</title>
        <description>Change in height standard deviation score (SDS) was evaluated from baseline (week 0) to weeks 30 and 56, and from week 56 to week 82. Height SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' height provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. Results are based on both participants who completed the trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82, and participants who could not complete the corresponding trial period, but attended the follow-up visit at week 30, 56 or 82, respectively.</description>

        <description>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was evaluated from baseline (week 0) to weeks 30 and 56, and from week 56 to week 82. The PHQ-9 questionnaire is a 9-item depression module included in the patient health questionnaire, a self-administered diagnostic tool used for assessment of mental disorders. The PHQ-9 total score ranges from 0−27; total scores of 1-4 represent no depression, total scores of 5-9 represent mild depression, total scores of 10-14 represent moderate depression, total scores of 15−19 represent moderately severe depression and total scores of 20-27 represent severe depression. Results are based on the participants who completed the corresponding trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82.</description>

          <title>Change in PHQ-9</title>
          <description>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was evaluated from baseline (week 0) to weeks 30 and 56, and from week 56 to week 82. The PHQ-9 questionnaire is a 9-item depression module included in the patient health questionnaire, a self-administered diagnostic tool used for assessment of mental disorders. The PHQ-9 total score ranges from 0−27; total scores of 1-4 represent no depression, total scores of 5-9 represent mild depression, total scores of 10-14 represent moderate depression, total scores of 15−19 represent moderately severe depression and total scores of 20-27 represent severe depression. Results are based on the participants who completed the corresponding trial period, week 0-30, week 0-56 or week 0-82.</description>
