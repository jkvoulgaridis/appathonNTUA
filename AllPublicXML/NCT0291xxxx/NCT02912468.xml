      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 milligram (mg) every 2 weeks (q2w) compared to
      placebo on a background of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in reducing nasal
      congestion/obstruction (NC) severity and endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) in participants
      with bilateral nasal polyposis (NP). In addition for Japan participants, reduction in
      computed tomography (CT) scan opacification of the sinuses was a coprimary objective.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving total symptoms score (TSS).

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the sinuses
           (primary objective for Japan).

        -  To evaluate ability of dupilumab in reducing proportion of participants requiring
           treatment with systemic corticosteroids or NP surgery.

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on participant reported outcomes and health related
           quality of life outcome by sinonasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22).

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in the subgroups of participants with prior surgery
           and co-morbid asthma (including non-steroid antiinflammatory drug [NSAID] exacerbated
           respiratory disease [ERD]).

        -  To evaluate residual effect in follow up.

        -  To evaluate the safety of dupilumab in participants with bilateral NP.

        -  To evaluate functional dupilumab concentrations (systemic exposure) and incidence of
           treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies.

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Nasal Polyp Score: Subgroup of Participants With Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. For each nostril, NPS was graded from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. LS mean and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were involved in the study from 05 December 2016 to 05 July 2018 at 67 active centers in 13 countries. A total of 506 participants were screened, of which 276 participants were enrolled and randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg or placebo. A total of 230 participants failed screening mainly due to failure to meet inclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by the presence of comorbid asthma and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD), prior nasal polyposis (NP) surgery (yes or no), and country.</pre_assignment_details>

For each nostril, NPS was graded based on polyp size from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyps) to 8 (large polyps), with higher score representing more severe disease.</description>

The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <description>ACQ-6 had 6 questions which assessed the most common asthma symptoms (woken by asthma, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, puffs/inhalations use). Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale ranged from 0 = no impairment to 6 = maximum impairment. The ACQ-6 score was the mean of the scores of all 6 questions and therefore, ranged from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled), with higher scores indicated lower asthma control. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI.

        <title>Change From Baseline at Weeks 36 and 48 in Nasal Polyp Score (Assessments Performed 12 and 24 Weeks After End of Treatment)</title>
        <description>NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. For each nostril, NPS was graded based on polyp size from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. LS mean and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model.</description>

Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. LS mean and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 48 in Opacification of Sinuses Measured by Lund-Mackay Score (Assessment Performed 24 Weeks After End of Treatment)</title>
        <description>The LMK scoring system rated each of both the left and right frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, ostiomeatal complex, anterior ethmoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses using following grading: 0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total opacification. The total score was the sum of scores from each side and ranges from 0 (normal) to 24 (more opacified)Í¾ higher score indicated more severe disease. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Weeks 36 and 48 in 22-item Sino-nasal Outcome Test Scores (Assessments Performed 12 and 24 Weeks After End of Treatment)</title>
        <description>The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire that was used to assess the impact of CRSwNP on HRQoL. It is a 22 item questionnaire with each item assigned a score ranging from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be). The total score may range from 0 (no disease) to 110 (worst disease), lower scores representing better health related quality of life. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <description>The VAS for rhinosinusitis was used to evaluate the total disease severity. The participants were asked to indicate on a 10 cm VAS the answer to the question, &quot;How troublesome are your symptoms of your rhinosinusitis?&quot; The range of the VAS was from 0 (not troublesome) to 10 (worse thinkable troublesome), where higher score indicated worse thinkable troublesome. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 48 in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second for Participants With Asthma (Assessment Performed 24 Weeks After End of Treatment)</title>
        <description>FEV1 was the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline, treatment group, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 48 in Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 Scores for Participants With Asthma (Assessment Performed 24 Weeks After End of Treatment)</title>
        <description>ACQ-6 had 6 questions which assessed the most common asthma symptoms (woken by asthma, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, puffs/inhalations use). Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale ranged from 0 = no impairment to 6 = maximum impairment. The ACQ-6 score was the mean of the scores of all 6 questions and therefore, ranged from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled), with higher scores indicated lower asthma control. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with the corresponding baseline value, treatment group, prior surgery, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and TEAEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study treatment. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened in grade or became serious during TEAE period which was defined as the period from the time of first dose of study drug until 98 days following the last administration of study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a medically important event.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D was a standardized HRQoL questionnaire consisting of EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ VAS. EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension had 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. EQ-VAS recorded the participant's self-rated health on a vertical VAS that allowed them to indicate their health state that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Nasal Congestion Symptom Severity Score: Subgroup of Participants With Prior Nasal Polyp Surgery</title>
        <description>NC symptom severity was assessed by the participants on a daily basis from Visit 1 and throughout the study using an e-diary on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms, with higher scores indicated more severity. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Nasal Polyp Score: Subgroup of Participants With Asthma</title>
        <description>NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. For each nostril, NPS was graded from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. LS mean and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model.</description>
