  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter phase II study with patients receiving
      haploidentical transplantation for Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA). The primary objective is to
      assess overall survival (OS) at 1 year post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired SAA is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 2
      cases per million and with over 600 new cases in the United States each year. A major
      challenge in treating acquired SAA is the management of patients who are refractory to
      immunosuppressant therapy (IST) or have relapsed after IST. HSCT is the only curative option
      for these patients but many are ineligible because they lack a suitable donor. The Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) seeks to increase options for these
      patients by using novel therapeutic strategies of GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy to expand the
      donor pool to include haploidentical donors. The goal of this protocol is to test whether
      optimized approaches using haploidentical donors will achieve acceptable outcomes in SAA
      patients.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neutrophil Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 and 56</time_frame>
    <description>Neutrophil recovery is achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 0.5 x10^9/L for three consecutive measurements on different days, with the first of the three days being defined as the day of neutrophil engraftment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Platelet Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 and 56</time_frame>
    <description>Platelet recovery is defined by achieving a platelet count &gt; 20 x 10^9/L with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of the sustained platelet count will be defined as the day of platelet engraftment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alive with Sustained Engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Being alive and engrafted is defined as not having experienced death, primary graft failure, or secondary graft failure. Donor cell engraftment is defined as donor chimerism greater than or equal to 5% on or after Day 56 after transplantation. Chimerism may be evaluated in whole blood or blood cell fractions, including CD3 and CD33 or CD15 fractions. For this protocol, lineage-specific, myeloid, and T cell chimerisms are required.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidences of Graft Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Primary graft failure is defined by the lack of neutrophil engraftment by Day +56 post-HSCT or failure to achieve at least 5% donor chimerism (whole blood or marrow) on any measurements up to and including Day +56. For this protocol, lineage-specific, myeloid, and T cell chimerisms are required. Myeloid engraftment might not proceed at the same rate as T cell engraftment. If myeloid has greater than or equal to 5% donor, even if T cell compartment does not, this is not considered primary graft failure. Secondary graft failure is defined by initial neutrophil engraftment (ANC greater than or equal to 0.5 x 108/L measured for 3 consecutive measurements on different days) followed by sustained subsequent decline in ANC to less than 0.5 x 10^9/L for three consecutive measurements on different days or initial whole blood or marrow donor chimerism greater than or equal to 5%, but then declining to less than 5% on subsequent measurements or second infusion/transplant given for graft failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alive with autologous recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Autologous recovery is defined as ANC &gt; 0.5 x 109/L and transfusion independence but with &lt; 5% donor chimerism (whole blood or marrow).</description>

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of SAA, either from initial diagnosis or follow-up assessments,
             defined as:

               1. Bone marrow cellularity &lt; 25% or marrow cellularity &lt; 50% but with &lt; 30% residual
                  hematopoietic cells.

               2. Two out of three of the following (in peripheral blood): Neutrophils &lt; 0.5
                  x10^9/L, Platelets &lt; 20 x10^9/L, or Reticulocyte count &lt; 20 x10^9/L (&lt;60 x 10^9/L
                  using an automated analysis)

          3. No suitable fully matched related sibling donor (6/6 match for human leukocyte antigen
             (HLA)-A and B at intermediate or high resolution and DRB1 at high resolution using
             DNA-based typing) available.

          4. Failed at least one trial of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) by being refractory or
             having relapsed. IST could have included ATG based regimens, calcineurin inhibitors
             and/or other higher dose therapy directed at the treatment of primary SAA.

          5. Available relative of the patient who is a haploidentical match, including biological
             parents, siblings or half siblings, children, uncles/aunts, first cousins, etc.
             Eligible haploidentical donors will have 2-4 mismatches if HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1
             typing is used; 2-5 mismatches if HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 typing is used; and
             2-6 mismatches if HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, and -DPB1 typing is used. A
             unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus host or host versus graft direction
             is considered a mismatch. The donor and recipient must demonstrate that they are a
             full haplotype match by being identical at a minimum of one allele (at high resolution
             DNA-based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 if 8 allele
             typing is used; HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 if 10 allele typing is used; and
             HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1-, DQB1, and -DPB1 is 12 allele typing is used by the local
             center. See Section 2.4 for additional information.

         10. Adequate organ function defined as:

               1. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest ≥ 40%. For patients
                  aged &lt; 13 years, shortening fraction (SF) ≥ 26% by echocardiogram or Multi Gated
                  Acquisition Scan (MUGA) may be substituted for LVEF.

               2. Hepatic: Total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age
                  (patients who have been diagnosed with Gilbert's Disease are allowed to exceed
                  this limit) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
                  (AST) &lt; 5.0 x ULN for age.

               3. Renal: For patients &gt; 13.0 years of age at the time of enrollment: estimated
                  creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/minute (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and actual

                  m2. If the estimated GFR is &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2, then renal function must be
                  measured by 24-hour creatinine clearance or nuclear GFR, and must be &gt; 50
                  mL/min/1.73 m^2.

                  supplemental oxygen and (3) O2 saturation &gt; 92% on room air at sea level (with
                  lower levels allowed at higher elevations per established center standard of care
                  (e.g., Utah, 4,200 feet above sea level, does not give supplemental oxygen unless
                  below 90%)).

         11. Karnofsky or Lansky performance status ≥ 60%.

         12. Females and males of childbearing potential must agree to practice 2 effective methods
             of contraception at the same time or agree to abstinence.

             a positive cross-match test of any titer by complement-dependent cytotoxicity or flow
             cytometric testing or the presence of anti-donor HLA antibody to the high expression
             loci HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, or DPB1 with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) &gt; 1000 by solid
             phase immunoassay).

          4. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          5. Prior solid organ transplant.

          6. Known life-threatening reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) to Thymoglobulin® that would
             prohibit use for the patient as this study requires use of the Thymoglobulin®
             preparation of ATG.

          7. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection at the time of enrollment.
             Uncontrolled is defined as currently taking medication and with progression or no
