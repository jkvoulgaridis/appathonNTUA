  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to test a procedure called deep brain simulation (DBS) to treat focal hand
      dystonia (FHD). A device called a neurostimulator is placed in the chest. It is attached to
      wires placed in brain areas that affect movement. Stimulating these areas can help block
      nerve signals that cause abnormal movements.

      Objectives:

      To test DBS as treatment for FHD. To learn about brain and nerve cell function in people with
      dystonia.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with severe FHD who have tried botulinum toxin treatment at least
      twice

      Design:

      Participation lasts 5 years.

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Videotape of their dystonia

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Brain MRI scan

      Chest X-ray

      Neuropsychological tests: answering questions, doing simple actions, and taking memory and
      thinking tests.

      Hand movement tests

      Participants will have surgery: A frame fixes their head to the operating table. A small hole
      is made in the skull. Wires are inserted to record brain activity and stimulate the brain
      while they do simple tasks. The wires are removed and the DBS electrode is inserted into the
      hole. The neurostimulator is placed under the skin of the chest, with wires running to the
      electrode in the brain. They will have CT and MRI scans during surgery.

      Participants will recover in the hospital for about 1 week.

      The neurostimulator will be turned on 1 4 weeks after discharge. Participants will have
      regular visits until the study ends. Visits include:

      Checking symptoms and side effects

      MRI

      Movement, thinking, and memory tests

      If the neurostimulator s battery runs out, participants will have surgery to replace it.

      Objectives

      To confirm the safety and efficacy of thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the
      ventralis oralis anterior/ventralis oralis posterior (VOA/VOP) nuclear complex in the
      treatment of subjects with focal hand dystonia (FHD); and to study the electrophysiologic
      properties of neurons in the VOA/VOP complex. Deep brain stimulation DBS is FDA approved for
      Parkinson s disease, Essential tremor, Dystonia (humanitarian exemption), Obsessive-
      Compulsive disorder (humanitarian exemption) but not for focal hand dystonia.

      Study population

      Five adults with focal hand dystonia will be studied.

      Design

      This is a pilot study of 5 subjects with severe intractable FHD whose activities of daily
      living and quality of life are severely impaired. They will be recruited from our clinic and
      referring practices. The subjects will undergo unilateral VOA/VOP DBS implantation, followed
      by programming to optimal parameters. The subjects will be followed at monthly intervals for
      3 months, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months until 5 years from the
      start. The safety of the procedure will be the primary outcome of the study. Efficacy will be
      assessed in several secondary outcomes, the most important ones being the change in dystonia
      severity and a quality of life scores. The electrophysiologic features of the motor ventral
      thalamic neurons will be recorded intraoperatively.

      Outcome measures

      Primary

      -Number and severity of adverse events in the 5-year follow-up period.

      Secondary

        -  Upper extremity sub-score of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) scale and Arm Dystonia
           Disability Scale (ADDS) at baseline and every follow up visit

        -  For subjects with FHD type musician s dystonia: Tubiana and Chamagne scale at every
           follow up visit

        -  For subjects with FHD type Writer s cramp: Writer's Cramp Impairment Scale

        -  Improvement on patient reported outcomes evaluated by the SF-12 Health Status Survey at
           baseline and at every follow up visit

        -  Intraoperatory electrophysiologic characteristics of the motor ventral thalamic neurons

        -  Neuropsychological evaluation at baseline, 3 and 12 months post DBS surgery

        -  Dose of botulinum toxin injection required at baseline, 1 and 5 years.
