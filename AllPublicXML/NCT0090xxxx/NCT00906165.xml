    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of Straumann® Bone
      Level Implant SLActive placed in healed alveolar ridge (at least 8 weeks post extraction) and
      immediately provisionalised versus the same type of implants placed in healed alveolar ridge
      but not provisionalised. In both cases the implants will be loaded at 16 weeks (final
      restorations). The outcomes will be evaluated over a 2-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single blind, and single center study. The
      total study duration for each patient should be 24 months.

      Straumann Bone Level Ø 4.1 mm SLActive implants will be placed for single tooth replacement,
      followed by either immediate provisional prosthetic loading or no provisionalised. The final
      prosthetic loading is made at 16 weeks after implant loading. The implant length will be
      selected according to the clinical indication of the site based on previous radiographic
      evaluation.

      In total 11 visits per patient are scheduled in this study. Bone level changes, implant
      success and survival rate, soft tissue changes, aesthetic outcome and adverse events (AEs)
      will be assessed.

      The study devices are CE- (Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity) marked
      products.

      One center in the United Kingdom will participate.

    <measure>Radiographic Bone Level Change at the Mesial and Distal of the Implants Between Baseline and One Year Post Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and one year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary parameter derives from the subtraction of mesial and distal bone level linear x-ray measurements at baseline and one year after implant placement. The distance between the alveolar bone at the level of the first radiographic bone contact with the implant surface and the shoulder of the implant will be measured to the closest 0.1mm at the mesial and distal surfaces of all implants, on digitized standardized peri-apical x-rays using an image analysis computer program.</description>

The PES index includes assessment of seven variables and each variable is measured with a 2, 1, or 0 score with 2 being the best and 0 being the poorest score. Based on its definition the PES is a cumulative score with 14 being the best and 0 the worst.</description>

Straumann® Bone Level SLActive Implant (4.1mm diameter): Straumann® Bone Level Implants will be placed in healed alveolar ridge (at least 8 weeks post extraction). Implants in Arm 1 will be immediately provisionalized. Implants in Arm 2 will not be immediately provisionalized.
