  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine progression-free survival (PFS) in participants
      with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have received no prior systemic therapy when
      treated with IMC-A12 administered every three weeks in combination with oral sorafenib
      administered twice daily.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of first dose of study drug up PD or death up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until the date of objective PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions using as reference the smallest sum LD since baseline or ≥1 new lesions. Participants who died without PD were considered to have progressed on the date of death. Participants who were alive and without PD were censored at the time of the last objective tumor assessment. Participants who did not progress and are subsequently lost to follow-up were censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment before loss to follow-up. Participants who progressed or died after ≥2 missed tumor assessment visits were censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment before missed assessments. Participants who begin a new anticancer therapy were censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment before initiation of new therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Date of first dose of study drug to PD up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and the normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as having a ≥30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Participants who did not have a tumor response assessment for any reason were considered nonresponders and were included in the denominator when calculating the response rate. Percentage of participants was calculated as: CR + PR / total number of participants in the treatment group * 100.</description>

    <description>TTP is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug until the date of objective disease progression. Participants without PD were censored at the time of the last objective tumor assessment. Participants who did not progress and lost to follow-up were censored at the date of the last objective tumor assessment before loss to follow-up. Participants who began new anticancer therapy prior to PD or death were censored at date of last tumor assessment prior to new therapy.

CR was defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. PD defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions using as reference the smallest sum LD since baseline or ≥1 new lesions. Participants with no PD, who discontinued treatment for toxicity or a reason other than PD, or were lost to follow-up, were censored at date of last tumor assessment. Participants who began new anticancer therapy prior to PD or death were censored at date of last tumor assessment prior to new therapy.

    <description>A participant's serum sample was considered positive for antibodies against cixutumumab if it exhibited a post-treatment antibody level that exceeded the positive upper cut point determined from the anti-cixutumumab level seen in healthy untreated individuals. A participant was considered to have an anti-cixutumumab response if there were 2 consecutive positive samples or if the final sample tested was positive.</description>

        <description>PFS is defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until the date of objective PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions using as reference the smallest sum LD since baseline or ≥1 new lesions. Participants who died without PD were considered to have progressed on the date of death. Participants who were alive and without PD were censored at the time of the last objective tumor assessment. Participants who did not progress and are subsequently lost to follow-up were censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment before loss to follow-up. Participants who progressed or died after ≥2 missed tumor assessment visits were censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment before missed assessments. Participants who begin a new anticancer therapy were censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment before initiation of new therapy.</description>
