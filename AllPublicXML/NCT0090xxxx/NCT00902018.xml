  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the effects that eltrombopag (and
      romiplostim) have on platelets in subjects with chronic ITP. Eltrombopag is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of low platelets in patients with
      chronic ITP. It is being further studied by GlaxoSmithKline (now Novartis) in other
      conditions associated with low platelets. This research study is being done because
      eltrombopag has been shown to increase platelet counts in a different way than other
      therapies for ITP. The investigators want to further study how eltrombopag and romiplostim
      affect subjects and their platelets to determine how the study drug should best be used in
      ITP treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL/Bak) balance has been identified as an intrinsic
      mechanism that is critical in determining platelet lifespan (Mason, Cell 2007). There is
      evidence that Bcl-xL protein expression in megakaryocytes is regulated by Thrombopoietin
      (TPO) mediated activation of Akt pathways mediated by Jak2 and Stat 5 (possibly by Stat 3 as
      well). (e.g., Kozuma et. al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis). Little is known about
      the Bcl-xL / Bak axis in patients with ITP, or the effect of TPO-R stimulation on platelet
      survival in patients with ITP. The TPO effect may be a result of stimulation of
      thrombopoietin-receptor (TPO-R) signalling in megakaryocytes altering the packaging of Bcl-xl
      into platelets, or be a direct effect of platelet TPO-R stimulation as described above.

    <description>To assess the safety of eltrombopag, in particular the number of patients with serious adverse events and/or abnormal liver tests reaching a level of more than twice the upper limit of normal for the test these outcomes were assessed periodically for liver tests but other SAEs were not systematically assessed but only with complaints or events</description>

    <time_frame>testing on days 8 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Samples were drawn weekly for 2 weeks on days 1, 8, and 15 for the treatment arms and day 1 for the healthy control group. Platelet samples were exposed to small molecule Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737 ex-vivo to explore resistance to apoptosis by determining the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) which was measured for each weekly sample drawn. If the half maximal concentration of ABT737 was increased this meant increased resistance to apoptosis.
The AKT pathway intermediates were measured since these would indicate the mechanism of the platelet resistance to apoptosis so the two sets of measures confirm each other the AIPF is a measure of how many new platelets are made and the large platelets are similar to that</description>

        <description>Samples were drawn weekly for 2 weeks on days 1, 8, and 15 for the treatment arms and day 1 for the healthy control group. Platelet samples were exposed to small molecule Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737 ex-vivo to explore resistance to apoptosis by determining the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) which was measured for each weekly sample drawn. If the half maximal concentration of ABT737 was increased this meant increased resistance to apoptosis.
The AKT pathway intermediates were measured since these would indicate the mechanism of the platelet resistance to apoptosis so the two sets of measures confirm each other the AIPF is a measure of how many new platelets are made and the large platelets are similar to that</description>
