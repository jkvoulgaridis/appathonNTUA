  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Solid organ transplantation provides life-saving treatment for end-stage organ disease
           but is associated with an increased cancer risk because of the need for long-term
           immunosuppression

        -  End-stage renal disease (ESRD), the most common type of end-stage organ disease leading
           to transplant, is itself linked to increased risk for some cancers

        -  The role of immunosuppression and other factors causing cancer in this setting are not
           fully understood.

      Objectives:

        -  To characterize cancer risk in transplant recipients and identify risk factors.

        -  To characterize risk for transmission of cancer from organ donors to recipients.

        -  To describe cancer risk in ESRD.

      Eligibility: Patients are not required for this study. Data are gathered from existing
      databases of ESRD patients, organ transplant patients and cancer registries.

      Design:

        -  Databases of 1) U.S. transplant recipients, donors and wait list candidates and 2) U.S.
           ESRD patients will be linked to multiple U.S. cancer registries to identify cancers in
           transplant recipients and ESRD patients.

        -  The spectrum of cancer risk in transplant recipients and ESRD patients will be evaluated
           in detail.

        -  The cancer risk in transplant recipients will be examined in relation to whether the
           donors had cancer.

        -  The proposed cancer risk factors (e.g., underlying medical condition, infection with
           cancer-causing viruses, immunosuppressive medications) documented in transplant and ESRD
           files will be studied for association with increased risk of particular types of cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplantation provides life-saving treatment for end-stage organ disease but is
      associated with substantially elevated cancer risk, largely due to the need to maintain
      long-term immunosuppression. Despite previous research, important research questions remain
      concerning the role of immunosuppression and other factors in causing cancer in the setting.
      Staff at two federal agencies, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Health Resources
      and Services Administration (HRSA), will link a database containing information on U.S.
      transplant recipients, wait list candidates, and donors to multiple U.S. cancer registries.
      These data will be used to conduct research concerning the spectrum of cancer risk in
      transplant recipients. The data will also be used by HRSA in its public health role
      overseeing the U.S. solid organ transplant network to maintain and improve safety of organ
      transplantation.
