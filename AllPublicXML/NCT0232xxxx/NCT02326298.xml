    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve a Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI75) Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI75 response assessments are based on at least 75% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Clear or Almost Clear (With at Least 2-category Improvement) Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the overall severity of Psoriasis (PSO) using the following 5-point scale: 0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve a Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI90) Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI90 response assessments are based on at least 90% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a subject-reported questionnaire designed for use in adult participants with PSO. The DLQI is a skin disease-specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect patients' health related quality of life (HRQoL). This instrument asks participants about symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has been shown to be valid and reproducible in PSO patients. The DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower HRQoL. A higher than of equal to (&gt;=) 4-point change in the DLQI score (DLQI response) has been reported to be meaningful for the patient (within-patient minimal important difference Basra et al, 2015) a DLQI absolute score of lower than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 indicates DLQI remission (i.e., no or small impact of the disease on HRQoL).</description>

          <description>Placebo sc injection Q2W.
Treatment received from Week 16 - 48 was based on initial treatment and response to treatment:
PASI50 responders at Week 16, who did not achieve a PASI75 response at Week 16 received CZP 400 mg at Weeks 16, 18 and 20 (loading doses) followed by CZP 200 mg Q2W starting at Week 22.
PASI75 responders at Week 16 continued to receive Placebo.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 16 were removed from blinded study medication and escaped to unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W. Participants who received unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W for 16 weeks and did not achieve a PASI50 response were withdrawn from the study.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 32 or a later time point were withdrawn from the study.
Participants who completed the Maintenance Period (with PASI50 response at Week 48) entered the Open-label Extension (OLE) Period on CZP 200 mg Q2W. Week 48 completers in the escape arm continued to receive CZP 400 mg Q2W or may have switched to CZP 200 mg Q2W.</description>

Treatment received from Week 16 - 48 was based on initial treatment and response to treatment:
PASI50 responders at Week 16, who did not achieve a PASI75 response at Week 16 received CZP 400 mg at Weeks 16, 18 and 20 (loading doses) followed by CZP 200 mg Q2W starting at Week 22.
PASI75 responders at Week 16 continued to receive Placebo.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 16 were removed from blinded study medication and escaped to unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W. Participants who received unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W for 16 weeks and did not achieve a PASI50 response were withdrawn from the study.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 32 or a later time point were withdrawn from the study.
Participants who completed the Maintenance Period (with PASI50 response at Week 48) entered the Open-label Extension (OLE) Period on CZP 200 mg Q2W. Week 48 completers in the escape arm continued to receive CZP 400 mg Q2W or may have switched to CZP 200 mg Q2W.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve a Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI75) Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI75 response assessments are based on at least 75% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

        <description>The PASI90 response assessments are based on at least 90% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a subject-reported questionnaire designed for use in adult participants with PSO. The DLQI is a skin disease-specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect patients' health related quality of life (HRQoL). This instrument asks participants about symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has been shown to be valid and reproducible in PSO patients. The DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower HRQoL. A higher than of equal to (&gt;=) 4-point change in the DLQI score (DLQI response) has been reported to be meaningful for the patient (within-patient minimal important difference Basra et al, 2015) a DLQI absolute score of lower than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 indicates DLQI remission (i.e., no or small impact of the disease on HRQoL).</description>

A higher than of equal to (&gt;=) 4-point change in the DLQI score (DLQI response) has been reported to be meaningful for the patient (within-patient minimal important difference Basra et al, 2015) a DLQI absolute score of lower than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 indicates DLQI remission (i.e., no or small impact of the disease on HRQoL).</description>

        <description>The PASI75 response assessments are based on at least 75% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>
