  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are (1) to determine the efficacy of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT), given as oral capsules, compared with placebo for the treatment of
      refractory diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D); (2) determine the impact of
      FMT on the intestinal microbiome of patients with IBS-D; and (3) assess the safety,
      feasibility, and tolerability of FMT for patients with IBS-D.

      This is a multicenter study including Montefiore Medical Center, Concorde Medical Group PLLC
      and the Medical Research Center of Connecticut/Yale-New Haven Hospital Langone Medical
      Center. Patients with IBS-D will be recruited from outpatient gastroenterology clinics at
      these institutions and referrals from the medical community.

      FMT capsules and placebo capsules, provided by OpenBiome, Medford, MA, will be used for this
      study. Patients will be randomized to undergo FMT using fecal capsules (experimental group)
      or placebo capsules (control group) via a computer-generated program. All patients will
      cross-over into the alternate arm of the study at 12 weeks. Therefore, all patients enrolled
      will receive the experimental drug during the course of the study. Each patient will be
      enrolled in the study for a total of 6 months.

      Intestinal microbiome analyses using DNA sequencing and non-cultivation-based approaches (16S
      DNA technology) will be performed in all patients in the experimental and control groups to
      assess stability of the microbiome over time.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (before cross-over), Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Within and between group comparisons of changes (from baseline) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), obtained via administration of a Questionnaire, for each of the two arms/groups (FMT capsules first, and placebo capsules first). The scale range was 0-500 (min-max). Scores were averaged among time points to yield an overall mean score. Higher scores were indicative of greater disease severity (worse outcome). Subjects were categorized as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300), or severe (&gt;300) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based on symptomology.
Only the following time points were analyzed: Baseline vs Week 12 and Week 24.</description>

    <description>Within and between group comparisons of changes (from baseline) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life (IBS-QOL), obtained via administration of a Questionnaire, for each of the two arms/groups (FMT capsules first, and placebo capsules first). Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) is administered via a questionnaire of 34 items each with an individual five-point response scale. The responses to these items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 100-point scale for ease of interpretation based on a validated method. IBS-QOL is measured on a scale range of 0-100. Higher IBS-QOL scores are indicative of a better IBS-specific quality of life.

    <description>Microbiota composition before and after FMT were assessed among FMT responders and FMT non-responders. Only patients who received FMT capsules at the start of this clinical trial were included. Placebo capsule recipients were not included in these analyses. Data were analyzed up to 12 weeks and not beyond. Microbiome data following cross-over were not analyzed because of the potential for carry-over and order effects in the second half of the trial.
Outcomes assessed included alpha and beta diversity (Jensen-Shannon divergence) and abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Prevotella. All of the microbiome data that were analyzed are included in the table below. No additional microbiome data from this clinical trial were analyzed.</description>

    <description>Anxiety at baseline and at the time of cross-over (Week 12) as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS-A (Anxiety)
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale which was administered via questionnaire. Seven of the items relate to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven relate to depression (HADS-D). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. Higher HADS scores are indicative of more severe depression and anxiety.

    <description>Bowel consistency as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale on a daily basis.
The Bristol Stool Form Scale was administered via questionnaire. This scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories. Assigned categories range from 1-7 based on appearance of the stool. Type 1 and 2 stools indicate constipation. Type 4 are the ideal stools as they are easy to defecate while not containing excess liquid, Type 5 tends towards diarrhea, and Types 6 and 7 indicate diarrhea.

          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale which is administered via questionnaire. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. Higher HADS scores are indicative of more severe depression and anxiety.

        <description>Within and between group comparisons of changes (from baseline) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), obtained via administration of a Questionnaire, for each of the two arms/groups (FMT capsules first, and placebo capsules first). The scale range was 0-500 (min-max). Scores were averaged among time points to yield an overall mean score. Higher scores were indicative of greater disease severity (worse outcome). Subjects were categorized as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300), or severe (&gt;300) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based on symptomology.
Only the following time points were analyzed: Baseline vs Week 12 and Week 24.</description>

          <description>Within and between group comparisons of changes (from baseline) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), obtained via administration of a Questionnaire, for each of the two arms/groups (FMT capsules first, and placebo capsules first). The scale range was 0-500 (min-max). Scores were averaged among time points to yield an overall mean score. Higher scores were indicative of greater disease severity (worse outcome). Subjects were categorized as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300), or severe (&gt;300) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based on symptomology.
Only the following time points were analyzed: Baseline vs Week 12 and Week 24.</description>
          <population>Participants were randomized to FMT first followed by placebo (n=25) OR to placebo first followed by FMT (n=23) and analyzed in these groups. Participants who received FMT 1st and those who received FMT 2nd were not pooled together into one group because of potential carry-over effects.</population>

        <description>Within and between group comparisons of changes (from baseline) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life (IBS-QOL), obtained via administration of a Questionnaire, for each of the two arms/groups (FMT capsules first, and placebo capsules first). Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) is administered via a questionnaire of 34 items each with an individual five-point response scale. The responses to these items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 100-point scale for ease of interpretation based on a validated method. IBS-QOL is measured on a scale range of 0-100. Higher IBS-QOL scores are indicative of a better IBS-specific quality of life.

        <description>Anxiety at baseline and at the time of cross-over (Week 12) as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS-A (Anxiety)
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale which was administered via questionnaire. Seven of the items relate to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven relate to depression (HADS-D). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. Higher HADS scores are indicative of more severe depression and anxiety.

        <title>Depression as Measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS-D (Depression)</title>
        <description>Depression at baseline and at the time of cross-over (Week 12) as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS-D (Depression)
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale which was administered via questionnaire. Seven of the items relate to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven relate to depression (HADS-D). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. Higher HADS scores are indicative of more severe depression and anxiety.
Only the following time points were analyzed: Baseline vs Week 12</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (before cross-over), Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were randomized to FMT first followed by placebo (n=25) OR to placebo first followed by FMT (n=23) and analyzed in these groups. Participants who received FMT 1st and those who received FMT 2nd were not pooled together into one group because of potential carry-over effects. As such, data for crossover intervention couldn't be reported.</population>

        <description>Bowel consistency as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale on a daily basis.
The Bristol Stool Form Scale was administered via questionnaire. This scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories. Assigned categories range from 1-7 based on appearance of the stool. Type 1 and 2 stools indicate constipation. Type 4 are the ideal stools as they are easy to defecate while not containing excess liquid, Type 5 tends towards diarrhea, and Types 6 and 7 indicate diarrhea.

Only patients who received FMT capsules at the start of this clinical trial were included. Placebo capsule recipients were not included in these analyses. Data were analyzed up to 12 weeks and not beyond. Microbiome data following cross-over were not analyzed because of the potential for carry-over and order effects in the second half of the trial.
Outcomes assessed included alpha and beta diversity (Jensen-Shannon divergence) and abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Prevotella. All of the microbiome data that were analyzed are included in the table below. No additional microbiome data from this clinical trial were analyzed.

        <description>Microbiota composition before and after FMT were assessed among FMT responders and FMT non-responders. Only patients who received FMT capsules at the start of this clinical trial were included. Placebo capsule recipients were not included in these analyses. Data were analyzed up to 12 weeks and not beyond. Microbiome data following cross-over were not analyzed because of the potential for carry-over and order effects in the second half of the trial.
Outcomes assessed included alpha and beta diversity (Jensen-Shannon divergence) and abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Prevotella. All of the microbiome data that were analyzed are included in the table below. No additional microbiome data from this clinical trial were analyzed. Information on abundance of Prevotella was only available at baseline and week 1.</description>
