  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the anti-tumor efficacy of oral single-agent
      rociletinib, as measured by investigator assessment of the PFS, with that of single-agent
      cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, advanced/metastatic NSCLC after failure
      of at least 1 previous EGFR-directed TKI and at least 1 line of platinum-containing doublet
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of oral rociletinib at 500 mg BID and 625 mg BID compared with that of single-agent
      cytotoxic chemotherapy, in patients with previously treated mutant EGFR NSCLC. Eligible
      patients are those with mutant EGFR NSCLC previously treated with at least 1 EGFR inhibitor
      and at least 1 line of platinum-containing chemotherapy doublet for advanced/metastatic
      NSCLC.

      After providing informed consent to participate and screening to confirm eligibility,
      patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either oral rociletinib 500 mg BID, oral
      rociletinib 625 mg BID, or single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy (investigator choice of
      pemetrexed, gemcitabine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel; choice of chemotherapy agent must be
      specified before randomization).

    <description>PFS was calculated as 1+ the number of days from the date of randomization to documented radiographic progression as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions, defined by and assessed as: Complete Response (CR), is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. Partial Response (PR),at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. Overall Response (OR),is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment was dependent on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>

          4. Multiple lines of prior treatment are permitted and there is no specified order of
             treatment, but in the course of their treatment history, patients must have received
             and have radiologically documented disease progression following:

             At least 1 line of prior treatment with a single-agent EGFR-TKI (e.g., erlotinib,
             gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib)

             If EGFR-TKI is a component of the most recent treatment line, the washout period for
             the EGFR-TKI is a minimum of 3 days before the start of study drug treatment

             treatment-free interval or after a maintenance treatment).

             If cytotoxic chemotherapy is a component of the most recent treatment line, treatment
             with chemotherapy should have been completed at least 14 days prior to start of study
             treatment. When an EGFR-TKI is given in combination with platinum-containing doublet
             chemotherapy, treatment with the EGFR-TKI may continue until at least 3 days before
             start of treatment.

          1. Any other malignancy associated with a high mortality risk within the next 5 years and
             for which the patients may be (but not necessarily) currently receiving treatment

             Patients with a history of malignancy that has been completely treated, with no
             evidence of that cancer currently, are permitted to enroll in the trial provided all

         12. Presence of any serious or unstable concomitant systemic disorder incompatible with
             the clinical study (e.g., substance abuse, uncontrolled intercurrent illness including
             uncontrolled diabetes, active infection, arterial thrombosis, and symptomatic
             pulmonary embolism)

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST Version 1.1 as Determined by Investigator Review (invPFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was calculated as 1+ the number of days from the date of randomization to documented radiographic progression as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 1 to End of Treatment, up to approximately 35 months. This Time Frame includes the cross-over period, however, participants who crossed over to rociletinib were not analyzed for PFS.</time_frame>
        <population>Intent-to-treat: All patients randomized. 1 patient in the Chemotherapy treatment group was not included in the analysis, due to discontinuation of study shortly after randomization and prior to first dose of study drug.</population>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST Version 1.1 as Determined by Investigator Review (invPFS)</title>
          <description>PFS was calculated as 1+ the number of days from the date of randomization to documented radiographic progression as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
