      This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN
      0702 protocol (NCT01109004), &quot;A Trial of Single Autologous Transplant with or without
      Consolidation Therapy versus Tandem Autologous Transplant with Lenalidomide Maintenance for
      Patients with Multiple Myeloma&quot;. It is hypothesized that use of novel anti-myeloma agents
      will improve long-term progression-free survival (PFS) after high-dose melphalan followed by
      autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as compared to a second autologous
      transplantation.

      This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN
      0702 protocol (NCT01109004). All patients who consent will be followed for death,
      progression, Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs), and Quality of Life (QOL). Patients who do
      not consent to the long-term follow-up mechanism or who have experienced progression on the
      BMT CTN 0702 study will be followed through the standard Center for International Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) long-term follow-up mechanism. Additionally, patients who
      are eligible and are willing to continue with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy will be
      provided lenalidomide free of charge. These patients will continue to receive lenalidomide as
      maintenance therapy until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or
      withdrawal from the study. The endpoints assessed will include progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), incidence of second primary
      malignancies (SPM) and health quality of life (QOL).

    <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from the BMT CTN 0702 protocol classified according to their randomized treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Progression-free survival is defined as survival without disease progression or initiation of non-protocol anti-myeloma therapy. To account for loss to follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate progression-free survival during the 5 year post-randomization follow-up period.</description>

    <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from the BMT CTN 0702 protocol classified according to their randomized treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Overall survival is defined as survival of death from any cause. To account for loss to follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate overall survival during the 5 year post-randomization follow-up period.</description>

    <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from the BMT CTN 0702 protocol classified according to their randomized treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Event-free survival is defined as survival without disease progression, second primary malignancy, and death. To account for loss to follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate event-free survival during the 5 year post-randomization follow-up period.</description>

    <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from the BMT CTN 0702 protocol classified according to their randomized treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). SPM is defined as development of any second malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. To account for loss to follow-up, the Aalen-Johansen estimator was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of SPM during the 5 year post-randomization follow-up period.
The development of any SPMs excludes non-melanoma skin cancers. Death without SPMs will be considered a competing risk for this event. The cumulative incidence of SPMs will be compared between treatment arms.</description>

    <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from BMT CTN 0702, classified by their treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Disease progression is defined as progression of multiple myeloma, including one or more of the following:
Reappearance of serum monoclonal paraprotein at a level &gt;= 0.5 g/dL
24-hour urine protein electrophoresis of at least 200mg paraprotein/24 hours
Abnormal free light chain levels of &gt;10 mg/dl, only in patients without measurable paraprotein in serum and urine
At least 10% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy
Definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum Ca &gt;11.5 mg/dL or &gt;2.8 mmol/L) not attributable to other causes
To account for loss to follow-up, the Aalen-Johansen estimator was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of progression during the follow-up period.</description>

Lenalidomide: In BMT CTN 0702, maintenance therapy with lenalidomide started at 10 mg daily for three months and increased to 15 mg daily. The duration of maintenance was three years in all treatment arms. Lenalidomide will be administered initially at the patient’s last documented dose prior to discontinuation of BMT CTN 0702 lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Cycle duration is 28 days. Patients will continue lenalidomide until disease progression, or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or withdrawal from the study.</description>

          <description>Participants on this study will be stratified for the purposes of statistical analysis into high-risk and standard risk-groups. High-risk multiple myeloma is defined by the presence of high beta-2 microglobulin (&gt; 5.5mg/L) or the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities including t(4;14), t(14;20), t(14;16), deletion (17p) detected by FISH or standard cytogenetics, deletion 13 detected by standard cytogenetics only or aneuploidy. Participants without cytogenetic analysis available and beta-2 microglobulin ≤ 5.5mg/L or with deletion 13 detected by FISH will be classified as standard-risk disease.</description>

        <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from the BMT CTN 0702 protocol classified according to their randomized treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Progression-free survival is defined as survival without disease progression or initiation of non-protocol anti-myeloma therapy. To account for loss to follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate progression-free survival during the 5 year post-randomization follow-up period.</description>

        <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from BMT CTN 0702, classified by their treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Disease progression is defined as progression of multiple myeloma, including one or more of the following:
Reappearance of serum monoclonal paraprotein at a level &gt;= 0.5 g/dL
24-hour urine protein electrophoresis of at least 200mg paraprotein/24 hours
Abnormal free light chain levels of &gt;10 mg/dl, only in patients without measurable paraprotein in serum and urine
At least 10% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy
Definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum Ca &gt;11.5 mg/dL or &gt;2.8 mmol/L) not attributable to other causes
To account for loss to follow-up, the Aalen-Johansen estimator was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of progression during the follow-up period.</description>

Lenalidomide: In BMT CTN 0702, maintenance therapy with lenalidomide started at 10 mg daily for three months and increased to 15 mg daily. The duration of maintenance was three years in all treatment arms. Lenalidomide will be administered initially at the patient’s last documented dose prior to discontinuation of BMT CTN 0702 lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Cycle duration is 28 days. Patients will continue lenalidomide until disease progression, or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or withdrawal from the study.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression</title>
          <description>This analysis includes all randomized subjects from BMT CTN 0702, classified by their treatment assignment (intention-to-treat). Disease progression is defined as progression of multiple myeloma, including one or more of the following:
Reappearance of serum monoclonal paraprotein at a level &gt;= 0.5 g/dL
24-hour urine protein electrophoresis of at least 200mg paraprotein/24 hours
Abnormal free light chain levels of &gt;10 mg/dl, only in patients without measurable paraprotein in serum and urine
At least 10% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy
Definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum Ca &gt;11.5 mg/dL or &gt;2.8 mmol/L) not attributable to other causes
To account for loss to follow-up, the Aalen-Johansen estimator was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of progression during the follow-up period.</description>
