  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of alirocumab 150 mg every 2
      weeks (Q2W) in comparison with placebo on the frequency of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      apheresis treatments in participants with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)
      undergoing weekly or bi-weekly LDL apheresis therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LDL apheresis removes low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that transport cholesterol in the plasma
      portion of the blood. This treatment is mainly used for familial hypercholesterolemia, but
      can be used in other rare diseases. Familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is an inherited
      genetic condition that causes accumulation of cholesterol in the blood, which can lead to
      atherosclerosis and heart disease. This treatment is recommended for patients who do not
      respond to dietary and/or medication control of LDL cholesterol.

    <measure>Change in Standardized Rate of Apheresis Treatments From Week 7 to Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 7 to Week 18 (before start of open-label treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of apheresis treatments were normalized by the number of planned apheresis treatments according to each participant's established schedule at screening, week -10 to week -2. The normalized rate of apheresis was defined for each participant as the number of actual apheresis treatments received from week 7 to week 18 divided by the number of planned apheresis treatments per randomization strata at baseline (6 for Q2W and 12 for QW).</description>

    <description>Adjusted Least-squares (LS) means and standard errors at Week 6 were obtained from a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) to account for missing data. All available post-baseline data from Week 2 to Week 18 regardless of status on or off-treatment were used in the model (ITT analysis).</description>

    <measure>Change in Standardized Rate of Apheresis Treatments From Week 15 to Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 15 up to Week 18 (before the start of open-label treatment dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of apheresis treatments were normalized by the rate by the number of actual apheresis treatments according to received from week 15 to week 18 divided by the planned apheresis treatments per randomization strata at baseline (2 for Q2W and 4 for QW). Only legitimate apheresis treatment skipping per point-of-care LDL-C value is counted as &quot;apheresis not occurred&quot;. Missing apheresis treatment information (any reason) from week 7 to week 18 is assigned an outcome of the apheresis treatment occurred at the visit (i.e. impute 1 apheresis treatment for that visit).</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in Germany and the United States between 09 Mar 2015 and 20 Apr 2016. A total of 76 participants were screened, of which 62 were enrolled and randomized in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified according to the frequency of the apheresis procedure (every 7 or 14 days) and lipoprotein (a) (Lp [a]) levels (normal or elevated). Assignment to treatment arms was done using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in 1:2 ratio to placebo or alirocumab 150 mg Q2W.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Frequency in which participants are undergoing LDL apheresis</title>
          <description>LDL apheresis removes low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that transport cholesterol in the plasma portion of the blood. This treatment is mainly used for familial hypercholesterolemia, but can be used in other rare diseases. Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited genetic condition that causes accumulation of cholesterol in the blood, which can lead to atherosclerosis and heart disease. This treatment is recommended for patients who do not respond to dietary and/or medication control of LDL cholesterol.</description>

        <title>Change in Standardized Rate of Apheresis Treatments From Week 15 to Week 18</title>
        <description>Rate of apheresis treatments were normalized by the rate by the number of actual apheresis treatments according to received from week 15 to week 18 divided by the planned apheresis treatments per randomization strata at baseline (2 for Q2W and 4 for QW). Only legitimate apheresis treatment skipping per point-of-care LDL-C value is counted as &quot;apheresis not occurred&quot;. Missing apheresis treatment information (any reason) from week 7 to week 18 is assigned an outcome of the apheresis treatment occurred at the visit (i.e. impute 1 apheresis treatment for that visit).</description>
