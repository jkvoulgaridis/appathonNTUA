  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the drugs prazosin and naltrexone will decrease
      alcohol cravings and drinking in individuals who have problems with alcohol and have used
      alcohol at risky levels in the past 90 days.

      Prazosin is a medication that is FDA approved for treating people with high blood pressure.
      Some studies have shown that prazosin may also decrease nightmares and improve sleep in
      Veterans suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The use of prazosin for PTSD
      nightmares is an off-label use. That means that the FDA has not approved prazosin for PTSD
      nightmares. The current study is evaluating an &quot;off-label&quot; use of prazosin to determine
      whether it is helpful in decreasing alcohol cravings and consumption among people with
      alcohol problems.

      Naltrexone is a medication that is FDA approved for treating alcohol problems.

      This study is sponsored by the Department of Defense and the Congressionally Directed Medical
      Research Program (DoD/CDMRP). We expect approximately 240 participants in this study, which
      will run over approximately 4 years. Study participants will be involved in the study for 7
      weeks, or until they complete the Final Assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the proposed double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled study of
      prazosin and naltrexone participants will undergo two craving inductions, one oriented
      towards relief craving and the other towards reward craving. Daily IVR (Interactive Voice
      Recording System) data on craving and consumption and PTSD symptomatology will be collected
      during the 7 days immediately following the initial assessment visit to establish a
      pre-medication baseline. One hundred twenty individuals with adequate IVR compliance and
      whose screening lab tests indicate it is safe for them to take the study medications will
      enter the medication phase of the study within 14 days of the initial assessment initiating
      prazosin/placebo as well as 50mg naltrexone/placebo treatment. Randomization will be blocked
      by gender, PTSD status, and desire to abstain vs. desire to cut down. Prazosin will be
      titrated to three times daily dosing (9 am: 4mg; 3pm: 4 mg; 9pm: 8mg) at the end of two
      weeks. Naltrexone will be taken once daily 50 mg/day with no titration schedule. The stable
      dose of both medications will continue for four more weeks and medication compliance will be
      evaluated through pill counts, the IVR daily monitoring, and riboflavin trace in urine
      analysis. On approximately day 49 participants will come into the lab for the craving
      inductions (there will be a two week window after day 49 in which participants may still be
      seen if scheduling issues arise). The order of the craving inductions will be
      counterbalanced, and their administration will be separated in time by 30 minutes to minimize
      carry over between them. Subjective responses to the craving inductions will be obtained via
      relief oriented craving items and reward oriented craving items from the Desire for Alcohol
      Questionnaire. Participants will then be assisted in returning their craving levels to
      baseline prior to debriefing. They will all be offered VA or community referrals to
      treatment. Both prazosin and naltrexone can be safely discontinued without tapering.
