  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this recruitment plan (ADAPT-BX) is to collect image and technical data on both
      digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and full-field digital mammography (FFDM), along with
      other subject data including histology results from biopsy specimen examination and cancer
      classification data from initially asymptomatic women referred for biopsy after recall from
      screening and diagnostic work-up. These data will be included in a subsequent and
      prospectively planned pooled analysis described in a separate protocol (ADAPT-BIE) examining
      superiority of DBT to FFDM for breast cancer diagnosis and other clinical performance
      measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADAPT program consists of 2 recruitment plans (ADAPT-SCR and ADAPT-BX) followed by an
      off-line read of the images and data collected (ADAPT-BIE). This study involves the
      comparison of two devices that can identify abnormalities in routine breast screening and
      diagnostic mammography. Mammography is usually done with full-field digital mammography
      (FFDM), which takes flat, two-dimensional X-ray images of the breast. Doctors use the
      two-dimensional images to look for cancers and other abnormal tissue. The purpose of this
      study is to learn more about the accuracy of full-field digital mammography devices and a new
      mammography device called digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT is similar to full-field
      digital mammography, but can also move around the breast to get X-ray images from different
      angles, which provides a three-dimensional view that doctors can use to look for cancers and
      abnormal tissue. Subjects will be recruited from an initially asymptomatic population that
      have been referred for clinically indicated breast biopsy based on suspicious breast imaging
      results. Subjects will undergo a DBT mammogram prior to biopsy. If FFDM was not performed
      within 30 days, subjects will also undergo FFDM prior to biopsy. Results of biopsy(ies) and
      histopathology, including lesion characteristics, will be recorded and considered as truth if
      positive for cancer status. Subjects with negative or benign histological findings will be
      followed for approximately one year (10-16 months) by FFDM and any additional standard of
      care practice.
