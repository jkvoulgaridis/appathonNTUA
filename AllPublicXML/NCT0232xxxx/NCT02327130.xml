  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are naturally-abundant isotopes in exhaled breath carbon dioxide. The
      ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in exhaled breath is known as the breath delta value (BDV).
      This study is seeking to determine if the breath delta value of critically ill adults is an
      early indicator of the onset of infection that may lead to sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a major complication for any patient, and its management is an acknowledged
      challenge for intensivists. Sepsis has unpredictable onset and progression, and is a leading
      cause of death in ICUs with a mortality rate of 30-50%. Annually in the US, 1.4M cases
      involve hospitalization, 750,000 cases of severe sepsis or septic shock, and ~260,000 cases
      of sepsis related death have been reported in recent years. Current experience of UF Health
      investigators in surgical ICUs is 1 -2 sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock patients per
      day, of which ~10% are trauma patients. Of trauma patients, ~8% develop sepsis during their
      ICU stay.

      Breath delta value is hypothesized to be a biomarker of infection. Breath delta value is not
      a defined clinical outcome related to human health, because this study is seeking to
      establish breath delta value as a biomarker of infection. This study is measuring the
      feasibility of the Isomark Canary™ device. If the Canary does not detect a significant
      decrease in breath delta value in those subjects who subsequently get an infection, it will
      not be feasible to use it for this purpose.

      Breath delta value will be collected to determine its relationship to infection, no health
      outcomes are being measured.

      This study is designed to determine if the BDV of adult ICU patients is an early indicator of
      the onset of infection that may lead to sepsis.

      The objectives of this study are: (1) to measure variation of BDV with time in adult ICU
      patients who agree to participate as research subjects; (2) to determine the magnitude of
      change of BDV in subjects who are subsequently diagnosed with severe infection and sepsis;
      (3) to define variation of BDV in adult trauma subjects who do not develop severe infection.

    <description>The variation in breath delta value was assessed regardless of infection status. Exhaled breath samples were collected from participants upon enrollment and every four hours thereafter until the end of the subject's study duration per protocol. Each subject was used as its own control for the purpose of trend analysis.The first breath sample collected was considered an individual's &quot;baseline&quot; sample. The change in the breath delta value was calculated from this baseline sample.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Based on an ROC analysis the optimal cutoff value for indicating the presence of infection using the BDV is 1.4‰.
Based on this cutoff value the sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Sensitivity, or the true positive rate, is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. In this case, the sensitivity is the percentage of people who have an infection and were identified by the Isomark Canary as having an 'infection'.
The specificity, or the true negative rate, is the promotion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as negative. In this case, the specificity is the proportion of people without infections that were correctly classified by the Isomark Canary as having 'no infection'.</description>

    <description>Exhaled breath samples will be collected 6 times per day and blood samples will be collected once per day for 7 days. Subjects will be followed for an additional 3 days. We will use the Isomark Canary™ to determine the BDV of breath samples collected during this study. Analysis results of these samples will be combined with data that is abstracted from the subjects' medical records.</description>

Exhaled breath samples were collected from participants upon enrollment and every four hours thereafter until the end of the subject's study duration per protocol. Each subject was used as its own control for the purpose of trend analysis.The first breath sample collected was considered an individual's &quot;baseline&quot; sample. The change in the breath delta value was calculated from this baseline sample.</description>

            <description>An endpoint adjudication committee (EAC), composed of three independent senior infectious disease experts, not involved in the subject clinical care, reviewed each study subjects’ data to determine the clinical time and date of infection. Each EAC member independently reviewed the subject cases and completed the EAC Infection Status case report form. In cases where an infection developed the EAC placed a time and date stamp for time of first suspicion of infection and confirmation based on clinical judgement culture, or diagnostic imaging.</description>

        <title>Positive and Negative Predictive Value of BDV for Infection Diagnosis</title>
        <description>Based on an ROC analysis the optimal cutoff value for indicating the presence of infection using the BDV is 1.4‰.
Based on this cutoff value the sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Sensitivity, or the true positive rate, is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. In this case, the sensitivity is the percentage of people who have an infection and were identified by the Isomark Canary as having an 'infection'.
The specificity, or the true negative rate, is the promotion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as negative. In this case, the specificity is the proportion of people without infections that were correctly classified by the Isomark Canary as having 'no infection'.</description>
