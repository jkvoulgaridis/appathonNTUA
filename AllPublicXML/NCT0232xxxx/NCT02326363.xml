  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide important information concerning the used of mindfulness-based
      relapse prevention (MBRP) as a continuing care strategy for Veterans who have completed
      primary treatment for a SUD. Most research is focused on the acute care of SUDs, but the risk
      of relapse to substance use is highest during the period immediately following treatment and
      attention to continuing care is critical. If this trial demonstrates that MBRP promotes
      sustained abstinence and improved functional outcomes, this will provide a valuable treatment
      to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery for Veterans with SUDs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of substance use disorders (SUDS) are high among military personnel and Veterans. While
      much research is focused on the acute care of SUDs, the risk of relapse to substance use
      following treatment is high and attention to continuing care is critical. New continuing care
      strategies targeting life-style change and improved coping mechanisms are important in
      facilitating maintenance of abstinence, promoting rehabilitation and functional recovery for
      Veterans with SUDs. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), a manualized treatment
      integrating cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention therapy with mindfulness practices, has
      shown promise in continuing care for SUDs. The proposed project will compare MBRP to a
      12-Step Facilitation treatment as a continuing care strategy following primary treatment for
      SUDs. Participants will be randomized to participate in 8-weeks of weekly 90-minute,
      group-based MBRP or 12-Step Facilitation followed by a 10-month follow-up period with regular
      assessments of substance use, mood/anxiety symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes.
      Two VAMC sites (Charleston and Tuscaloosa) with a history of successful collaboration will
      work together to recruit an adequate sample size to address the primary study questions
      within a 4-year period and to ensure generalizability of the results. If this trial
      demonstrates that MBRP promotes sustained abstinence and improved functional outcomes, this
      will provide a valuable treatment to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery for Veterans with
      SUDs.

    <description>The Introductory session covers the 12-Step view of addiction and therapy overview. The manual, originally developed for individual sessions, has been adapted for group delivery. The eight selected sessions include four topics chosen by the manual developers as core topics and four elective topics. The intervention involves helping participants understand and incorporate core principles of 12-Step approaches while encouraging active participation in 12-Step meetings and related activities. The primary goal is to promote abstinence by facilitating the patient's acceptance and surrender of addiction. Sessions begin with a check-in during which participants introduce themselves, report on meeting attendance and participation in related activities, any alcohol/drug use or craving to use. The remainder of the session focuses on discussion of the topic content followed by a &quot;take home&quot; summary and homework assignment.</description>

        <title>Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) - Number of Participants With Alcohol, Illicit Substance and Cigarette Use During Treatment, 8 Weeks. Available Date</title>
        <description>The TLFB will be used to obtain retrospective self-report of alcohol and illicit drug (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, stimulants, sedatives, opioids) use using calendar and memory prompts to stimulate recall. The TLFB yields consistently high test-retest correlations and correlates well with other self-reports and collateral reports. Quantity and frequency assessments as well as time-to-event measures can be obtained. Drug/alcohol use in treatment, 8 weeks will be assessed.</description>

Participants that failed to return for any treatment or follow up visits are considered censored at study day 1.</description>

This will be used as the primary biologic assessment of drinking status as breathalyzer tests only assess very recent alcohol use. The assay will be done in the Charleston VAMC laboratory on samples collected at baseline, end of treatment and 3-, 6-, and 10-month follow-up visits.</description>
