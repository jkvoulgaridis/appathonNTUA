    <measure>Adjusted Percentage of Patients With Successful Overall Colon Preparation, Assessed by the Global Score of the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Colonoscopy was performed on Day 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The BBPS score for each colon segment (right, transverse and left colon) was assessed by 3 blinded experts as follows: 0=unprepared segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared , 1=portion of mucosa of the segment seen, but other areas not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid, 2=-minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of segment seen well, 3=entire mucosa of segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid.
A reconciled score based on the 3 blinded reviews was used to calculate the global BBPS score, ranging from 0 to 9 (worst to best). A successful overall colon preparation was defined as a global score ≥6 for the 3 colon segments.
The percentage of patients with a successful preparation was determined using a logistic regression model, adjusted on centre, age class (&lt;= 65; &gt; 65), gender and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean BBPS Score by Segment and Globally (ITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Colonoscopy was performed on Day 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The mean global BBPS scores and scores by colon segment are presented for the ITT population.
For each of the 3 colon segments (right, transverse and left colon) the BBPS score ranges from 0 - 3 (worst to best), and was assessed by 3 blinded experts:
unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared = 0
portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid = 1
minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well = 2
entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid = 3.
The global score is the total of the 3 segment scores ranging from 0 - 9 (worst to best). Reconciled scores were based on 3 blinded reviews. Results of analysis for the PP population for right + transverse colon segments presented separately.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean BBPS Score for Right Colon and Transverse Colon Segment (PP Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Colonoscopy was performed on Day 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The mean colon segment BBPS scores for the Right Colon and Transverse Colon segments for the PP population are presented.
For each of the colon segments (right and transverse colon) the BBPS score ranges from 0 - 3 (worst to best), and was assessed by 3 blinded experts as follows:
unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared = 0
portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid = 1
minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well = 2
entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid = 3.

    <measure>Investigator Satisfaction as Determined by Mean Likert Scale Score for Global Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Colonoscopy was performed on Day 2.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator satisfaction with the procedure was measured by the mean Likert scale score for global evaluation by the investigator.
The Likert scale consists of 5 points, and ranges from 0 (poor cleansing) to 4 (excellent cleansing) as follows:
presence of faeces and soiled fluid: investigation could not be reliably performed = 0
presence of faecal material and of unclear fluid, with negative effect on the reliability of the investigation = 1
brown liquid, no solid faecal material, presence of unclear residual fluid that could be aspirated: no effect on the reliability of the investigation = 2
absence of solid faecal material, presence of clear residual fluid = 3
no faecal material, no residual fluid, empty colon = 4.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Percentage of Patients With Successful Overall Colon Preparation, Assessed by the Global Score of the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).</title>
        <description>The BBPS score for each colon segment (right, transverse and left colon) was assessed by 3 blinded experts as follows: 0=unprepared segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared , 1=portion of mucosa of the segment seen, but other areas not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid, 2=-minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of segment seen well, 3=entire mucosa of segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid.
A reconciled score based on the 3 blinded reviews was used to calculate the global BBPS score, ranging from 0 to 9 (worst to best). A successful overall colon preparation was defined as a global score ≥6 for the 3 colon segments.
The percentage of patients with a successful preparation was determined using a logistic regression model, adjusted on centre, age class (&lt;= 65; &gt; 65), gender and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) status.</description>

The first dose was taken the evening of Day 1 before the colonoscopy and the second dose was taken 10 - 12 hours after the evening dose on the day of the colonoscopy. Colonoscopy was performed on Day 2 at least 3 hours and no more than 6 hours after the last dose of Fortrans®.</description>

          <title>Mean BBPS Score for Right Colon and Transverse Colon Segment (PP Population)</title>
          <description>The mean colon segment BBPS scores for the Right Colon and Transverse Colon segments for the PP population are presented.
For each of the colon segments (right and transverse colon) the BBPS score ranges from 0 - 3 (worst to best), and was assessed by 3 blinded experts as follows:
unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared = 0
portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid = 1
minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well = 2
entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid = 3.
Reconciled scores were based on the 3 blinded reviews.</description>
          <population>The PP population consisted of all randomised patients who received the preparation of study treatment (whether complete or partial), who underwent the colonoscopy procedure and for whom no protocol violation occurred until colonoscopy. Patients were assessed according to the randomised treatment, regardless of treatment received.</population>

        <title>Investigator Satisfaction as Determined by Mean Likert Scale Score for Global Evaluation</title>
        <description>Investigator satisfaction with the procedure was measured by the mean Likert scale score for global evaluation by the investigator.
The Likert scale consists of 5 points, and ranges from 0 (poor cleansing) to 4 (excellent cleansing) as follows:
presence of faeces and soiled fluid: investigation could not be reliably performed = 0
presence of faecal material and of unclear fluid, with negative effect on the reliability of the investigation = 1
brown liquid, no solid faecal material, presence of unclear residual fluid that could be aspirated: no effect on the reliability of the investigation = 2
absence of solid faecal material, presence of clear residual fluid = 3
no faecal material, no residual fluid, empty colon = 4.</description>
