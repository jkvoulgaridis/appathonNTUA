    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial exploring the
      efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban as compared to standard of care in reducing stroke,
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) and neurocognitive decline, in subjects with non-valvular AF
      and with low risk of stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who qualify will be approached and those consenting will be enrolled to undergo a
      baseline evaluation. Subjects without a clinical diagnosis of dementia and with a Mini Mental
      State Examination score (MMSE) score ≥ 25 will undergo neurocognitive assessment (MoCA),
      psychosocial and QoL assessment before randomization.

      During the follow-up period or double-blind treatment period, subjects will receive study
      medications as fixed doses. During the follow-up period, subjects will visit the clinic every
      6 months. Subjects will take either rivaroxaban 15 mg or standard of care.

      An independent clinical event committee will classify all endpoint events. An independent
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) was established to monitor the progress of the study
      and assure the safety of subjects enrolled in the trial.
