  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population surveys have shown a positive correlation between increased levels of total serum
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) and bronchial hyperreactivity. However, it is also clear that
      exacerbations of asthma are frequently triggered by viral respiratory tract infections,
      especially those caused by human rhinovirus (RV), also known as the &quot;common cold&quot; virus. This
      protocol explores the relationship between rhinovirus and allergen/IgE provoked inflammation.
      Experimental challenges with human (RV) result in more persistent upper respiratory tract
      symptom scores in asthmatics than in controls. Asthmatics with high levels of IgE also show
      greater sensitivity to methacholine and higher levels of expired nitric oxide (eNO) than
      those with low levels of IgE. These data suggest that patients with asthma and high levels of
      IgE are more likely to have pre-existing inflammation of the airways before virus challenge.
      This study is being done to determine whether anti-IgE therapy (with omalizumab) will lead to
      a significant decline in inflammatory biomarkers prior to virus inoculation, and thus reduce
      the severity of clinical manifestations after an experimental human RV challenge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study involving a group of 42 mild
      asthmatics. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to omalizumab (a humanized monoclonal anti-IgE
      antibody) or placebo for 8 weeks and then inoculated with rhinovirus (strain-16 produced
      under GMP conditions and approved for this research by the FDA). Clinical and laboratory
      (mechanistic) data will be evaluated for 8 weeks before and for 4 weeks after the virus
      challenge.

      The study is being done to test the hypothesis that the reduction of total free IgE in
      asthmatics treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks prior to and during an experimental RV
      challenge will lead to a significant decline in lower respiratory tract (chest) symptoms
      recorded by subjects during the first four days of infection following the challenge compared
      to lower respiratory tract symptoms recorded during the same period by asthmatic subjects who
      are treated with placebo.

      The primary endpoint will be based on the comparison of cumulative lower respiratory tract
      symptoms scores (CLRTS) in the asthmatic subjects treated with omalizumab compared to those
      treated with placebo over the first 4 days of acute infection. Diary cards will be scored
      daily for cough, shortness of breath, chest discomfort and wheezing using a modification of
      the Jackson criteria. To participate in this study, subjects must live within 90 minutes by
      car from the University of Virginia.

      Note: This protocol has been reviewed and is being monitored for safety by the NIH/NIAID
      Safety Monitoring Committee and by he IRB at the University of Virginia (IRB-HSR# 14427).

    <measure>Airway Symptom Scores Experienced by Participants During the First 4 Days of the Acute Infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was based on the comparison of cumulative lower respiratory tract symptoms scores (CLRTS) in the asthmatic subjects treated with omalizumab compared to those treated with placebo over the first 4 days of acute infection. The symptoms evaluated daily included wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Symptom scores were recorded by subjects twice daily (in the morning and evening). Each symptom was scored on a scale of 1 to 3. Therefore, the total maximum (worst) score for a day would be 18. The scores recorded daily could range from 0 to 18.</description>

        <title>Airway Symptom Scores Experienced by Participants During the First 4 Days of the Acute Infection.</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was based on the comparison of cumulative lower respiratory tract symptoms scores (CLRTS) in the asthmatic subjects treated with omalizumab compared to those treated with placebo over the first 4 days of acute infection. The symptoms evaluated daily included wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Symptom scores were recorded by subjects twice daily (in the morning and evening). Each symptom was scored on a scale of 1 to 3. Therefore, the total maximum (worst) score for a day would be 18. The scores recorded daily could range from 0 to 18.</description>

          <description>This secondary outcome was based on the comparison of cumulative lower respiratory tract symptoms scores (CLRTS) in the asthmatic subjects treated with omalizumab compared to those treated with placebo over the first 7 days of acute infection. The symptoms evaluated daily included wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Symptom scores were recorded by subjects twice daily (in the morning and evening). Each symptom was scored on a scale of 1 to 3. Therefore, the total maximum (worst) score for a day would be 18. The scores recorded daily could range from 0 to 18.</description>

        <title>Time to Peak Airway Symptoms (Lower Respiratory Tract) Following Virus Inoculation.</title>
        <description>Time to peak airway symptoms (lower respiratory tract) following virus inoculation was compared among the asthmatics in the omalizumab treatment arm compared to time to peak symptoms among those in the placebo treatment arm.</description>
        <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
        <population>Two participants in the mild asthmatics treated with omalizumab treatment arm had to be dropped according to protocol because one developed a positive qPCR test for rhinovirus (the virus used for inoculation) 4 weeks before virus inoculation, and the other developed a positive qPCR test for rhinovirus during the week before inoculation.</population>

            <description>Subjects with mild asthma will be treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks before and for 3 weeks after an experimental challenge with rhinovirus. Omalizumab will be given subcutaneously every 2 to 4 weeks according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
omalizumab: This medication has been approved for clinical use to treat patients with moderate to severe asthma by the FDA in 2003 and for use in this study (BB-IND# 10510)
