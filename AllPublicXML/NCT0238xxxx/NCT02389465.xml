  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 18% of Americans aged 65 years and older have depression. Recent evidence suggests that
      there is a link between depression and inflammatory disease. This study investigates the
      relationship between inflammation in the brain and depression. Comparing biological and
      psychological differences in depressed and non-depressed people allows researchers to find
      better ways to treat and prevent depression. All participants will have: neuropsychological
      tests, an EKG, a spinal tap, a blood draw, and, if depressed, given either an antidepressant
      coupled with an anti-inflammatory medication or an anti-depressant coupled with a placebo for
      six weeks. The investigators are trying to correlate brain function with depression levels
      and biomarkers from the blood and spinal fluid.

          5. Weight greater than 110 lbs

          6. Normal result on liver-function test

          7. No history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding

          8. No renal insufficiency

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Depressed Participants:

          1. DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder

          2. HAM-D greater than 18

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity (e.g. to Citalopram
             or Escitalopram, and/or to celecoxib, aspirin, or other NSAIDs only for Phase 2; known
             demonstration of allergic-type reactions to sulfonamides);
