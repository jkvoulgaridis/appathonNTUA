  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study was intended to demonstrate superiority of either sotagliflozin high dose
      or low dose versus placebo on glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) reduction at Week 24 when
      used as an adjunct in adult participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) who have
      inadequate glycemic control with insulin therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline value was defined as the last value collected prior to the first dose of double-blind study medication. Least square (LS) means were obtained from a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) that included fixed, categorical effects of treatment, randomization strata of insulin delivery method (MDI, CSII), randomization strata of Week -2 A1C (&lt;= 8.5%, &gt;8.5%), time (study week), a treatment-by-time interaction, and baseline A1C-by-time interaction as a covariate. A negative change from Baseline (a lower A1C value at Week 24) indicates an improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With A1C &lt;7.0% (at Week 24) and No Episode of Severe Hypoglycemia and No Episode of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Upto Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of Hemoglobin A1C to determine the participants with A1C value &lt;7.0%. A central blinded adjudication process determined whether participants experienced either DKA or Severe Hypoglycemia. Only positively adjudicated severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were included in the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline value was defined as the last value collected prior to the first dose of double-blind study medication. LS means were obtained from MMRM model. A negative change from Baseline indicates a loss in body weight from Baseline to Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily Bolus Insulin Dose at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The mean bolus insulin dose in international units per day (IU/day) for Week 24 was the average over the 3 to 5 days prior to the Week 24 visit. The Baseline value was defined as the last value collected prior to the first dose of double-blind study medication. LS means were obtained from MMRM model including all available post Baseline values. A negative change from Baseline indicated a reduction in the amount of bolus insulin used between Baseline and Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Baseline value was defined as the last value collected prior to the first dose of double-blind study medication. LS means were obtained from MMRM model including all available post baseline values. A negative change from baseline indicates a lower glucose at Week 24 compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Diabetes Total Treatment Satisfaction Scores as Measured by Total Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs) Scores at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DTSQs is a diabetes-specific measure used to evaluate overall treatment satisfaction and perception of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia events. It consists of 8 items and the response categories for all items were on a 7-point likert scale.The DTSQs response options ranged from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied). Responses to item 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were summarized to determine the total treatment satisfaction score which ranged from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 36 (very satisfied), with a higher score corresponding to higher satisfaction . LS means were obtained from MMRM model including all available post baseline values. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Diabetes Distress Scores as Measured by 2-item Diabetes Distress Screening Scale (DDS2) Scores at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DDS2 is a 2-item diabetes distress screening instrument where respondents rated, on a 6-point scale, the degree to which the following items caused distress: (1) feeling overwhelmed by the demands of living with diabetes, and (2) feeling that I am often failing with my diabetes regimen using a 6-point scale: where 1=no distress to 6=severe distress for a total possible score of 2 (not a problem) to 12 (very serious problem), with higher score corresponding to higher distress. LS means were obtained from MMRM model including all available post baseline values. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline value was defined as the last value collected prior to the first dose of double-blind study medication. LS means were obtained from MMRM model. A negative percent change from baseline indicates a loss in body weight from baseline to Week 24.</description>

Least square (LS) means were obtained from a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) that included fixed, categorical effects of treatment, randomization strata of insulin delivery method (MDI, CSII), randomization strata of Week -2 A1C (&lt;= 8.5%, &gt;8.5%), time (study week), a treatment-by-time interaction, and baseline A1C-by-time interaction as a covariate.

        <description>DTSQs is a diabetes-specific measure used to evaluate overall treatment satisfaction and perception of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia events. It consists of 8 items and the response categories for all items were on a 7-point likert scale.The DTSQs response options ranged from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied). Responses to item 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were summarized to determine the total treatment satisfaction score which ranged from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 36 (very satisfied), with a higher score corresponding to higher satisfaction . LS means were obtained from MMRM model including all available post baseline values. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
