  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a systematic early assessment of
      uncovered needs for information, supplemented by an interview about the needs with the
      patient's nurse who seeks to provide the information requested, will improve the caregivers'
      and the patients' satisfaction with information and communication and potentially also
      decrease anxiety and depression.

    <description>The intervention consists of an interview about the caregiver's responses (baseline measurement) to a list about 'lack of information' within 13 areas. For each area, the patient's nurse will enquire about what information is requested by the caregiver and the patient. Subsequently, the nurse provides the requested information. She may involve the doctor and arrange follow-up visits or phone calls until the need is covered</description>
