    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage change in Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score from baseline to Week 4. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) assesses extent and severity of clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris. Body surface is divided in 4 ares: head (incl. neck), arms (incl. hands), trunk (incl. flexures) and legs (incl. buttocks and feet). Each area is scored from 0-6 for extent of psoriasis and from 0-4 for redness, thickness, and scaliness, and an area PASI score is calculated. The total PASI score is calculated from each area's score. The PASI score ranges from 0 (clear skin) to 72 (maximum disease), a PASI score higher than 10 generally corresponds to moderate-to-severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in Itch as Assessed on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) From Baseline to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change in itch as assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline to Week 4 in the full analysis set, defined as the 106 subjects assigned to treatment. The assessments were made on a 100 mm (100 mm = 10 cm) horizontal VAS anchored at 0 ('no itch at all') and 10 ('worst itch you can imagine'). Subjects were asked to put a vertical line on the scale at the spot he/she felt best reflected the maximal itch intensity during the last 24 hours. The distance from 0 to the subject's indication line was measured in mm, thus higher scores indicated a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in PASI From Baseline to Week 4</title>
        <description>Percentage change in Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score from baseline to Week 4. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) assesses extent and severity of clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris. Body surface is divided in 4 ares: head (incl. neck), arms (incl. hands), trunk (incl. flexures) and legs (incl. buttocks and feet). Each area is scored from 0-6 for extent of psoriasis and from 0-4 for redness, thickness, and scaliness, and an area PASI score is calculated. The total PASI score is calculated from each area's score. The PASI score ranges from 0 (clear skin) to 72 (maximum disease), a PASI score higher than 10 generally corresponds to moderate-to-severe disease.</description>

        <description>Change in itch as assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline to Week 4 in the full analysis set, defined as the 106 subjects assigned to treatment. The assessments were made on a 100 mm (100 mm = 10 cm) horizontal VAS anchored at 0 ('no itch at all') and 10 ('worst itch you can imagine'). Subjects were asked to put a vertical line on the scale at the spot he/she felt best reflected the maximal itch intensity during the last 24 hours. The distance from 0 to the subject's indication line was measured in mm, thus higher scores indicated a worse outcome.</description>

After a subject had left the trial, the investigator followed up all non-serious AEs classified as possibly or probably related to the IMP for 14± 2 days or until the final outcome was determined, whichever came first. SAEs were followed up until a final outcome had been determined, that is, the follow-up could continue beyond the end of the trial.</desc>
