  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite efficient antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection, decrease in life expectancy
      remains. Excess mortality is mainly due to non-AIDS co-morbidity including cardiovascular,
      pulmonary, and liver related diseases. Both HIV-unrelated and HIV-related risk factors
      probably contribute to this pattern. At present, most evidence regarding co-morbidity in HIV
      infection rely on cross-study comparisons of HIV-infected persons with published population
      rates and few prospective studies in U.S. cohorts. Using well characterized participants from
      the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) as controls, we aim to include &gt;1500
      HIV-infected persons in the COCOMO study to determine if co-morbidity is more prevalent or
      develops at a higher rate in HIV-infected persons. The study will asses 1) cardiovascular, 2)
      pulmonary and 3) liver-related co-morbidity using uniformly collected data in the two
      cohorts. The investigators aim to study the relative impact of HIV-unrelated and HIV-related
      factors on development of co-morbidity.

      Primary hypothesis:

      Cardiovascular disease:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with higher prevalence of coronary
      atherosclerosis (assessed by CT angiography)

      Obstructive pulmonary disease:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with higher prevalence of COPD, and independently
      associated with loss of lung function

      Liver disease:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and liver
      fibrosis

      Lipid and fat metabolism:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with alterations in adipose fat tissue and
      dyslipidemia

      Secondary hypothesis:

      Cardiovascular disease:

        -  Viral load and CD4 are independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis (assessed
           by CT angiography) in HIV-infected individuals.

        -  Levels of inflammatory markers can predict coronary atherosclerosis in HIV-infected
           individuals.

        -  Microbial translocation and metabolism are associated with coronary atherosclerosis in
           HIV-infected individuals.

        -  Endothelial dysfunction (assessed by arterial elastography) can predict coronary
           atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals

      Obstructive pulmonary disease:

        -  Viral load and CD4 is independently associated with emphysema

        -  HIV is independently associated with pulmonary hypertension (assessed by CT
           angiography), and obstructive lung disease is independently associated with airway
           obstruction

        -  PCP colonization in HIV infected patients is independently associated with obstructive
           lung disease, emphysema and loss of lung function.

        -  Inflammatory markers in HIV infected patients are associated with obstructive lung
           disease and loss of lung function
