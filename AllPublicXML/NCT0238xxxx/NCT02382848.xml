      This research is being done to find out how effective Prazosin is in the treatment of bulimic
      patients experiencing distressing nightmares using subjective and objective measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To the investigators knowledge, there is no treatment trial for prazosin use in patients with
      bulimia nervosa struggling with nightmares, looking at either objective or subjective
      measures. The investigators plan to probe the effectiveness of prazosin in bulimic patients
      experiencing nightmares due to PTSD using both subjective and objective measures in order to
      improve future clinical care. The effects of prazosin on decreasing nightmares and bulimic
      symptoms on subjective scales and effects on sleep architecture using objective polysomnogram
      (PSG) measurements will help inform targeted psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic
      strategies to improve clinical care of bulimic patients struggling with distressing dreams
      secondary to PTSD. This study will be performed in two phases. Phase A will involve eight
      participants who will be tested using subjective scales (mentioned below). If Phase A data
      analysis leads to detection of a signal of efficacy 2 more participants will be recruited to
      participate in phase B of this trial using objective polysomnogram measurements. The results
      from this project will aid in establishing a fully powered clinical trial for treatment of
      nightmares in bulimic patients and improve outcomes in this high risk population.

    <measure>Decrease in Frequency of Nightmares Using the Sleep-50 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The individual question about frightening dreams from the Nightmares Subscale of a self-administered questionnaire (Sleep-50 Questionnaire), will be used to determine if there is a decrease in frequency of nightmares in patients undergoing drug intervention. For each question, respondents are provided with a scale ranging from 1 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;) and are asked to indicate the extent to which the statement has matched their experience over the study time frame. The scale values range from 1-4, where a lower value indicates lower frequency of nightmares. A higher score is a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>PSG (Polysomnogram) will be used in 2 participants to determine if there is a decrease in REM density in patients undergoing drug intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Bulimia Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EDI-3 (Eating Disorder Inventory 3 Scale) is a pencil and paper test consisting of 91 items and 12 sub-scales. The main scales are the drive for thinness and the bulimia scales, the remaining sub-scales are: low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, maturity fears, personal alienation, interpersonal alienation, interpersonal insecurity, perfectionism, interoceptive deficits, emotional dysregulation, and asceticism. The response options are based on a 6-point Likert-type scale are: Always, Usually, Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never. There are six composite scores, 12 primary scores, and three response style validity indicators. Software is used to calculate the raw scores, composite scores, validity scale scores and the T-scores. The t-score for the Bulimia scale will be used for this analysis with a range of 22-66. Higher scores indicate the likelihood of an eating disorder. A higher t-score on the bulimia scale indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Total CAPS Score (PTSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS (Clinician administered PTSD) rating scale consists of 30 questions rated on a 0-4 point scoring system and patient interview will be used to determine if there is a decrease in PTSD Symptoms among participants undergoing drug intervention. 17 of these questions are used to calculate the total severity score used in this analysis. This is done by summing the frequency and intensity ratings (each ranging from 0-4) for each of the 17 questions. The total severity score can have a range of 0-136. A higher score on this scale indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Depressed Mood as Measured by the HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and Subject Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rating scales and subject interview will be used to determine if there is a decrease in depressed mood among participants undergoing drug intervention. The HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) consists of 17 items, some scored on a 5-point scale (0-4) and others scored on a 3-point scale (0-2). Items from the scale can be summed to give a total score ranging from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. This analysis is based on a single item from the scale (Depressed Mood, measured on a 5-point scale) where a higher score again indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Self Harm Thoughts as Measured by the HDRS and Subject Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rating scales and subject interview will be used to determine if there is a decrease in self harm among participants undergoing drug intervention. The HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) consists of 17 items, some scored on a 5-point scale (0-4) and others scored on a 3-point scale (0-2). Items from the scale can be summed to give a total score ranging from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. This analysis is based on a single item from the scale (Self Harm, measured on a 5-point scale) where a higher score again indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The individual question about frightening dreams from the Nightmares Subscale of a self-administered questionnaire (Sleep-50 Questionnaire), will be used to determine if there is a decrease in frequency of nightmares in patients undergoing drug intervention. For each question, respondents are provided with a scale ranging from 1 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;) and are asked to indicate the extent to which the statement has matched their experience over the study time frame. The scale values range from 1-4, where a lower value indicates lower frequency of nightmares. A higher score is a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>EDI-3 (Eating Disorder Inventory 3 Scale) is a pencil and paper test consisting of 91 items and 12 sub-scales. The main scales are the drive for thinness and the bulimia scales, the remaining sub-scales are: low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, maturity fears, personal alienation, interpersonal alienation, interpersonal insecurity, perfectionism, interoceptive deficits, emotional dysregulation, and asceticism. The response options are based on a 6-point Likert-type scale are: Always, Usually, Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never. There are six composite scores, 12 primary scores, and three response style validity indicators. Software is used to calculate the raw scores, composite scores, validity scale scores and the T-scores. The t-score for the Bulimia scale will be used for this analysis with a range of 22-66. Higher scores indicate the likelihood of an eating disorder. A higher t-score on the bulimia scale indicates a worse outcome.</description>

This is done by summing the frequency and intensity ratings (each ranging from 0-4) for each of the 17 questions. The total severity score can have a range of 0-136.

        <title>Decrease in Depressed Mood as Measured by the HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and Subject Interview</title>
        <description>Rating scales and subject interview will be used to determine if there is a decrease in depressed mood among participants undergoing drug intervention. The HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) consists of 17 items, some scored on a 5-point scale (0-4) and others scored on a 3-point scale (0-2). Items from the scale can be summed to give a total score ranging from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. This analysis is based on a single item from the scale (Depressed Mood, measured on a 5-point scale) where a higher score again indicates a worse outcome.</description>

Symptoms will be reassessed and medication will be adjusted by 1-2 mg increments every 7 days for 3 weeks based on clinical response and severity of night mares, to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit while monitoring adverse effects using side effects scale on weekly basis (psychiatrist will be using the scale at every visit). The end point for capping the Prazosin dose will be 6 mg daily.</description>
