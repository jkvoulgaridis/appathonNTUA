  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects diagnosed with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, between ages of 40-85 inclusive, who
      have been referred for gait training. Since there can be subtle differences in the brain
      organization of left- and right-handed people that may influence some of the measurements,
      right handed participants are preferred. However, a left handed participant may be
      considered. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to undergo two weeks
      of twice-daily sessions. Group A receiving goggles fitted with lenses that distort vision and
      Group B patients receiving sham goggles
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will be trained to undergo two daily sessions of visual adaptation at home
      for 14 consecutive days. For each adaptation session, subject will sit in a chair within
      reaching distance of a wall or cabinet upon which two dime-sized targets will be placed (one
      above the other, approximately ten inches apart). While wearing goggles, you will point
      rapidly to one target then the next, bringing the hand back to his/her torso between each
      pointing movement. They will be instructed to perform these movements &quot;as quickly as
      possible&quot; for a total of 50 pointing movements in each treatment session. After performing
      the 50 pointing movements, they will remove their goggles. Throughout the treatment period
      they will be asked to keep a diary in which they will log the time and duration of each prism
      adaptation session. At the first and second site visits, participants will be assessed for
      posture, gait and activities of daily living which will include some questionnaires.
      Questionnaires will be sent via mail after post-treatment at one week,1 month and 3 months.

    <measure>Change in Postural Control - Reaction Time on the Limits of Stability Test (Smart Equitest Balance Master System)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The participant stood on the platform in front of a monitor. Nine squares were presented on the monitor representing locations relative to the upright starting position: one in the centre of the screen (upright) and the remaining eight forming an ellipse around the central square. The participant's COG was indicated on the screen by the position of a stick figure avatar. At the beginning of each trial the participant was instructed to stand upright, keeping the COG cursor over the central target. A circular target appeared in one of eight other targets. The participant was required to move the COG cursor towards the second target as quickly and as accurately as possible by leaning their body while keeping their feet in the same location, and to then hold a position as close to the target as possible. Reacting times were recorded for 8 trials per location. Mean change (post-pre) in seconds</description>

    <measure>Change in Postural Control - Composite Score on the Sensory Organisation Test SMART EquiTest Balance Master</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to maintain an upright posture under six different conditions of sensory feedback:
Condition 1:Normal vision, fixed support
Condition 2:Absent vision, fixed support
Condition 3:Sway-referenced vision, fixed support
Condition 4:Normal vision, sway-referenced support
Condition 5:Absent vision, sway-referenced support
Condition 6:Sway-referenced vision, sway-referenced support
The equilibrium score for each condition compares the subject's anterior/posterior (AP) sway during each trial to the theoretical sway stability limit of 12.5 degrees. A composite equilibrium score (0-100, higher score indicates better outcome) quantifies the overall COG sway or postural stability across the sensory conditions and is calculated by:
Independently averaging the score for conditions 1 and 2;
Adding these two scores to the equilibrium scores from each trial of sensory conditions 3, 4, 5, and 6; and
Dividing that sum by the total number of trials.</description>

    <measure>Change in Postural Control - Forward-backward Displacement of Centre of Gravity on the Sensory Organisation Test SMART EquiTest Balance Master</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to maintain an upright posture under different conditions of sensory feedback. Proprioceptive feedback to the feet and joints is manipulated by allowing the platform to tilt to directly follow the participant's anteroposterior body sway (constant proprioception) or by maintaining the standing platform in a fixed horizontal position (normal proprioceptive feedback). Visual feedback is provided by asking the participant to close their eyes (no visual feedback), asking the participant to open their eyes and allowing the visual surround to tilt directly following the participant's anterioposterior body sway (constant visual feedback), or by asking the participant to keep their eyes open and maintaining the visual surround in a fixed position (normal visual feedback). Forward-backward displacement of COG is recorded in degrees.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postural Control - Composite Latency Score on the Motor Control Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The MCT assesses the ability of the automatic motor system to quickly recover following an unexpected external disturbance. Sequences of small, medium or large platform translations (scaled to the patient's height) in forward and backward directions elicit automatic postural responses. Translation of the surface in one horizontal direction results in displacement of the COG away from center in the opposite direction relative to the base of support. To restore normal balance, a quick movement of the COG back to the center position is required. A composite latency value is provided as the time in milliseconds between the force plate translation and the patient's active corrective responses, averaged across all translation sizes and directions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Postural Control - Composite Latency Score on the Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale. This 14-item test assesses balance during different tasks. Items consist of specific items such as standing with eyes closed, retrieving an object from the floor, and turning to look behind. The assessor rates the patient's performance from 0 (&quot;lowest level of function&quot;) to 4 (&quot;highest level of function&quot;) and a total is calculated out of a maximum score of 56.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gait - Functional Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Gait Assessment. This 10-item test assesses dynamic balance and postural stability during gait. Items consist of specific walking tasks such as stepping over an obstacle, changing speed of walking upon the assessor's instruction, and walking backwards. The assessor scores the patient's performance from 0 (&quot;severe impairment&quot;) to 3 (&quot;normal&quot;) and a total is calculated out of 30.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activities of Daily Living - Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), mobility and activities of daily living sections. This 39-item questionnaire is the most widely-used Parkinson's Disease specific measure of health and daily function. Participants indicate the extent to which they have experienced problems with different aspects of mobility and self-care. Each item is scored from 0 (&quot;never have problems&quot;) to 4 (&quot;always have problems&quot;), and a percentage is calculated. In addition to the total score, the mobility (questions 1-10) and activities of daily living (questions 11-16) sub-sections can be analysed separately to assess changes in these specific outcomes. The responses are summed and scored as a percentage. We analysed the percentage scores for the mobility sub-section, the activities of daily living sub-section, and the total percentage. Higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will undergo twice daily adaptation to upward shifts in vision. Participants will be provided with goggles fitted with prismatic lenses that shift vision upward by 25 dioptres (about 17 degrees). While wearing the lenses, participants point to two 10cm-diameter visual targets positioned one above the other (about 20cm apart) on a wall, returning their pointing arm to their chest between each pointing movement. Participants make 50 pointing movements, as fast and as accurately as possible. Such a procedure induces a downward sensorimotor adaptation of pointing movements. Participants undergo this training twice a day (morning and evening) for two weeks in a self-guided fashion.</description>

        <description>The participant stood on the platform in front of a monitor. Nine squares were presented on the monitor representing locations relative to the upright starting position: one in the centre of the screen (upright) and the remaining eight forming an ellipse around the central square. The participant's COG was indicated on the screen by the position of a stick figure avatar. At the beginning of each trial the participant was instructed to stand upright, keeping the COG cursor over the central target. A circular target appeared in one of eight other targets. The participant was required to move the COG cursor towards the second target as quickly and as accurately as possible by leaning their body while keeping their feet in the same location, and to then hold a position as close to the target as possible. Reacting times were recorded for 8 trials per location. Mean change (post-pre) in seconds</description>

        <title>Change in Postural Control - Composite Score on the Sensory Organisation Test SMART EquiTest Balance Master</title>
        <description>The participant is asked to maintain an upright posture under six different conditions of sensory feedback:
Condition 1:Normal vision, fixed support
Condition 2:Absent vision, fixed support
Condition 3:Sway-referenced vision, fixed support
Condition 4:Normal vision, sway-referenced support
Condition 5:Absent vision, sway-referenced support
Condition 6:Sway-referenced vision, sway-referenced support
The equilibrium score for each condition compares the subject's anterior/posterior (AP) sway during each trial to the theoretical sway stability limit of 12.5 degrees. A composite equilibrium score (0-100, higher score indicates better outcome) quantifies the overall COG sway or postural stability across the sensory conditions and is calculated by:
Independently averaging the score for conditions 1 and 2;
Adding these two scores to the equilibrium scores from each trial of sensory conditions 3, 4, 5, and 6; and
Dividing that sum by the total number of trials.</description>

Condition 4:Normal vision, sway-referenced support
Condition 5:Absent vision, sway-referenced support
Condition 6:Sway-referenced vision, sway-referenced support
The equilibrium score for each condition compares the subject's anterior/posterior (AP) sway during each trial to the theoretical sway stability limit of 12.5 degrees. A composite equilibrium score (0-100, higher score indicates better outcome) quantifies the overall COG sway or postural stability across the sensory conditions and is calculated by:
Independently averaging the score for conditions 1 and 2;
Adding these two scores to the equilibrium scores from each trial of sensory conditions 3, 4, 5, and 6; and
Dividing that sum by the total number of trials.</description>

        <title>Change in Activities of Daily Living - Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), mobility and activities of daily living sections. This 39-item questionnaire is the most widely-used Parkinson's Disease specific measure of health and daily function. Participants indicate the extent to which they have experienced problems with different aspects of mobility and self-care. Each item is scored from 0 (&quot;never have problems&quot;) to 4 (&quot;always have problems&quot;), and a percentage is calculated. In addition to the total score, the mobility (questions 1-10) and activities of daily living (questions 11-16) sub-sections can be analysed separately to assess changes in these specific outcomes. The responses are summed and scored as a percentage. We analysed the percentage scores for the mobility sub-section, the activities of daily living sub-section, and the total percentage. Higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change in Postural Control - Forward-backward Displacement of Centre of Gravity on the Sensory Organisation Test SMART EquiTest Balance Master</title>
        <description>The participant is asked to maintain an upright posture under different conditions of sensory feedback. Proprioceptive feedback to the feet and joints is manipulated by allowing the platform to tilt to directly follow the participant's anteroposterior body sway (constant proprioception) or by maintaining the standing platform in a fixed horizontal position (normal proprioceptive feedback). Visual feedback is provided by asking the participant to close their eyes (no visual feedback), asking the participant to open their eyes and allowing the visual surround to tilt directly following the participant's anterioposterior body sway (constant visual feedback), or by asking the participant to keep their eyes open and maintaining the visual surround in a fixed position (normal visual feedback). Forward-backward displacement of COG is recorded in degrees.</description>

        <title>Change in Postural Control - Composite Latency Score on the Motor Control Test</title>
        <description>The MCT assesses the ability of the automatic motor system to quickly recover following an unexpected external disturbance. Sequences of small, medium or large platform translations (scaled to the patient's height) in forward and backward directions elicit automatic postural responses. Translation of the surface in one horizontal direction results in displacement of the COG away from center in the opposite direction relative to the base of support. To restore normal balance, a quick movement of the COG back to the center position is required. A composite latency value is provided as the time in milliseconds between the force plate translation and the patient's active corrective responses, averaged across all translation sizes and directions.</description>
