  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cement augmentation works in preventing
      vertebral body compression fracture following spine stereotactic radiosurgery in patients
      with solid tumors that have spread to the spine. Spine stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a
      high dose of radiation to vertebral metastases and can sometimes lead to a vertebral
      compression fracture. Using body cement on the largest part of the vertebra (a procedure
      called vertebral body cement augmentation) may help prevent a fracture after stereotactic
      spinal radiosurgery. It may also lessen pain and improve quality of life in patients with
      solid tumors and spinal metastases undergoing this surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether prophylactic cement augmentation reduces new or progressive vertebral
      body fracture at 3 months in high risk patients undergoing single fraction spine stereotactic
      radiosurgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of prophylactic cement augmentation on time to first new or
      progressive vertebral body fracture.

      II. To assess the impact of prophylactic cement augmentation on pain control measured every
      three months post treatment.

      III. To assess the impact of prophylactic cement augmentation on quality of life measured
      every three months post treatment.

      IV. To estimate local control in each arm. V. To estimate overall survival in each arm. VI.
      To document and assess post-treatment adverse side effects between the two arms.

      VI. To document and assess the relationship between radiographic vertebral body fracture,
      pain control and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic spinal radiosurgery per standard of care.

      ARM II: Patients undergo vertebral body cement augmentation within 4 weeks before or after
      standard stereotactic spinal radiosurgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <description>Participants are asked to recall symptom severity and interference during the past 24 hours. Part I, The severity of the symptoms, including pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, short of breath etc. Part II, How have the symptoms interfered with patient life, including mood, work, relations with other people etc. Part I, range 0-10. A score of 0 would mean the symptom is not present and a score of 10 means the symptom is as bad as you can imagine). Part II, range 0-10 (A score of 0 would mean the symptom did not interfere; A score of 10 means the symptom has interfered completely. The ratings in the MDASI can be averaged into several subscale scores: mean core symptom severity, mean module symptom severity, mean total symptom severity, and mean interference. The interference items can further be broken down into mean activity interference and mean affective interference. Symptom items may be presented individually</description>
