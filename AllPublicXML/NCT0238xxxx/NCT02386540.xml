  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether health coaching initiated in the emergency
      department (ED) reduces subsequent ED visits, increases primary care visits, and positively
      impacts health outcomes in patients with diabetes and/or hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited by health coaches from the Highland Hospital Emergency Department.
      Eligible patients who agree to participate will be randomized to the control and experimental
      groups in a 2:1 ratio respectively because experimental group size is limited by health coach
      availability and greater loss-to-follow up is expected among the control group. Repeated
      measures analysis will be used to compare each outcome over the study period. In addition,
      subgroup analyses will be performed in order to stratify by baseline survey measures or
      amount of ED visits in the pre-observation period.

    <description>The Alameda County Health Coach program pairs patients with a language-concordant health coach for six months following an ED visit. Health coaches are young adults from the local community employed through Alameda County and trained for three months in topics such as self-management support and motivational interviewing. Health coaches work one-on-one with participants in order to develop an action plan in order to achieve patient-identified health goals. Communication between the health coach and participant includes text messages (weekly), phone calls (twice a month), face-to-face visits (at least once), and accompaniment to a primary care visit (at least once). Health coaches may also assist participants in accessing community resources as related to the individualized action plan.</description>
