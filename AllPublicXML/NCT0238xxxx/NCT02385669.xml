  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine with ipilimumab. This
      study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide vaccine and ipilimumab
      on the immune system. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing tests in the
      laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tumor samples.

    <description>The vaccine drug product, 6MHP, consists of 6 class II MHC-restricted peptides derived from melanoma proteins. Each vaccine consists of 200 mcg of each of the six peptides. An aqueous solution of vaccine is mixed 1/1 with Montanide ISA-51 to form water-in-oil emulsions. Vaccines are administered days 1, 8, 15, 43, 64, and 85. All peptide vaccines are administered intradermally and subcutaneously.
Ipilimumab will be administered in accord with the official prescribing information: 3 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks, for 4 doses. Ipilimumab will be administered on days 1, 22, 43, and 64.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with stage IIA (with class 2 DecisionDx Score) through IV melanoma in
             cohorts defined below. These participants may have had cutaneous, uveal, mucosal
             primary melanoma, or an unknown primary melanoma. The diagnosis of melanoma must be
             confirmed by cytological or histological examination. Staging of cutaneous melanoma
             will be based on the revised AJCC staging system. Participants must be eligible to be
             treated with ipilimumab based on clinician judgment within standard of care.

               -  Cohort 1 (Advanced Patients): unresectable stage III or IV melanoma that have
                  clinical or radiographic evidence of disease.

               -  Cohort 2 (Neoadjuvant therapy): primary melanoma with clinically apparent lymph
                  node or in transit/satellite lesions with or without lymph node involvement, in
                  transit recurrence or metastatic recurrence amenable to complete resection to no
                  evidence of disease

               -  Cohort 3 (Adjuvant therapy): Stage IIA (with class 2 DecisionDx Score), IIB-IV
                  melanoma resected to no evidence of disease.

          -  Participants will be required to have radiological studies to define radiologically
             evident disease. Required studies include:

               -  Chest CT scan,

               -  Abdominal and pelvic CT scan, and

               -  Head CT scan or MRI PET/CT fusion scan may replace scans of the chest, abdomen,
                  and pelvis.

          -  Participants who have melanoma available for biopsy pre-treatment and on day 22 must
             consent to having those biopsies. Melanoma lesions may be in nodes, skin, soft tissue,
             liver, or other sites that can be accessed by core needle biopsy, or incisional or
             excisional biopsy, with or without image guidance.

          -  Participants who have had brain metastases will be eligible if all of the following
             are true:

               -  Each brain metastasis must have been treated by surgical removal, stereotactic
                  radiosurgery or managed to complete resolution with immunotherapy. Patients with
                  brain lesions managed by immunotherapy without excision or radiosurgery are
                  included provided that the brain metastases have completely resolved after
                  systemic therapy and there are no neurologic symptoms or need for systemic
                  therapy to control CNS-disease related symptoms.

               -  There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since the most recent
                  treatment. If a patient has been managed by immunotherapy alone, the prior
                  lesions must be completely resolved.

               -  No brain metastasis is &gt; 2 cm in diameter at the time of registration

                  either as monotherapy or as part of combination CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade will be
                  ineligible if CTLA-4 therapy:

                    1. was discontinued early for toxicity, or

             immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.
             Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also
             excluded. The following will not be exclusionary:

               -  The presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g. positive ANA
