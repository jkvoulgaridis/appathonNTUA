  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderately active amputees may have lost their limb due to diabetes, vascular conditions,
      trauma, tumour or congenital causes. These amputees currently cannot benefit from having a
      computerised knee because of the performance criteria associated with being given one.
      However, these amputees have a very high risk of falling because they use a non
      microprocessor controlled knee joint (NMPK) and because their physical ability, associated
      disability and persistent contralateral leg weakness do not allow them to compensate for a
      balance deficit. These amputees restrict how much they move around and their participation
      because of their instability and elevated risk of falling.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the 3C60 knee, a
      microprocessor-controlled knee joint for external leg prosthesis, on the reduction in the
      risk of falling after three months in moderately active persons with leg amputation above
      knee or knee disarticulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will be evaluated after one month of using his/her usual non micropressor
      controlled knee joint (NMPK). After fitting of the 3C60, the patient will undergo at least
      five rehabilitation sessions, adapted to his/her individual needs, so that he/she knows how
      to use the device and is ready to go along with the planned testing.

      After the trial with the 3C60 knee, the patient will again be fitted with his/her non
      microprocessor controlled knee joint (NMPK) and will be required to undergo one
      rehabilitation session to regain his/her walking abilities.

    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed at 3 months with 3C60 and at 1 month with NMPK</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of recording the amount of time needed for a person to stand up from a chair, walk 3 metres, make a half-turn and sit down again. The TGUG test score reflects a person's balance and as a consequence, the risk of falling.</description>

    <measure>Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed at 3 months with 3C60 and at 1 month with NMPK</time_frame>
    <description>The Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI-5) is a 14 item self-assessment questionnaire filled in by the patient that explores walking and ambulation. The LCI-5 is derived from the Prosthesis Profile of the Amputee Questionnaire (PPA). LCI-5 is sensitive to the use of walking aids or to the need of a third party. Ceiling effect is not expected with moderately active amputees. The global LCI-5 score is the addition of the 14 scores, noted between 0 and 4. The global score varies between 0 and 56, the highest being for persons with high locomotors capabilities. LCI-5 has two sub-scores: the basic score corresponds to 7 questions related to basic activities and the advanced score corresponds to 7 questions related to more advanced activities. The basic and advanced scores both range from 0-28. Higher scores correspond with a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>QUEST 2.0 Satisfaction Questionnaire (QUEST 2.0-G: German Version / ESAT: French Version)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed at 3 months with 3C60 and at 1 month with NMPK</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-evaluation questionnaire of the user's satisfaction, translated in French (ESAT) and in German (QUEST 2.0-G Section 17.5). The QUEST 2.0 questionnaire contains 8 items that evaluate the device's technology and 4 items that evaluate services surrounding the device. It allows patients to express themselves on the criteria that are most important to them. Each item has a score that varies between 0 (not satisfied at all) and 5 (very satisfied). The global score is the average obtained onto the 12 items. Two sub-scores related to the technology and services can also be calculated. They correspond to the average of the 8 first items and to the 4 last items respectively. All scores ranks between 0 and 5, 5 being the highest level of satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>SF-36v2™ Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed at 3 months with 3C60 and at 1 month with NMPK</time_frame>
    <description>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2TM) explores 8 dimensions of quality of life through 36 questions: PF= Physical Functioning (10 items), RP= Role Physical (4 items), BP = Bodily Pain (2 items), SF= Social Functioning (2 items), MH= Mental Health (5 items), RE= Role emotional (3 items), VT= Vitality (4 items), GH= General Health (5 items). All of the eight health domain scales contributes with different levels to score two component summary measures: PCS= Physical Component Summary and MCS= Mental Component Summary. All scores are calculated online through scoring software. Domain scales and component summary are ranging from 0 to 100. A high score is considered to be a better outcome, as indicating little or no problem.</description>

        <title>Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI-5)</title>
        <description>The Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI-5) is a 14 item self-assessment questionnaire filled in by the patient that explores walking and ambulation. The LCI-5 is derived from the Prosthesis Profile of the Amputee Questionnaire (PPA). LCI-5 is sensitive to the use of walking aids or to the need of a third party. Ceiling effect is not expected with moderately active amputees. The global LCI-5 score is the addition of the 14 scores, noted between 0 and 4. The global score varies between 0 and 56, the highest being for persons with high locomotors capabilities. LCI-5 has two sub-scores: the basic score corresponds to 7 questions related to basic activities and the advanced score corresponds to 7 questions related to more advanced activities. The basic and advanced scores both range from 0-28. Higher scores correspond with a better outcome.</description>

The LCI-5 is derived from the Prosthesis Profile of the Amputee Questionnaire (PPA). LCI-5 is sensitive to the use of walking aids or to the need of a third party. Ceiling effect is not expected with moderately active amputees. The global LCI-5 score is the addition of the 14 scores, noted between 0 and 4. The global score varies between 0 and 56, the highest being for persons with high locomotors capabilities. LCI-5 has two sub-scores: the basic score corresponds to 7 questions related to basic activities and the advanced score corresponds to 7 questions related to more advanced activities. The basic and advanced scores both range from 0-28. Higher scores correspond with a better outcome.</description>

        <description>It is a self-evaluation questionnaire of the user's satisfaction, translated in French (ESAT) and in German (QUEST 2.0-G Section 17.5). The QUEST 2.0 questionnaire contains 8 items that evaluate the device's technology and 4 items that evaluate services surrounding the device. It allows patients to express themselves on the criteria that are most important to them. Each item has a score that varies between 0 (not satisfied at all) and 5 (very satisfied). The global score is the average obtained onto the 12 items. Two sub-scores related to the technology and services can also be calculated. They correspond to the average of the 8 first items and to the 4 last items respectively. All scores ranks between 0 and 5, 5 being the highest level of satisfaction.</description>

        <description>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2TM) explores 8 dimensions of quality of life through 36 questions: PF= Physical Functioning (10 items), RP= Role Physical (4 items), BP = Bodily Pain (2 items), SF= Social Functioning (2 items), MH= Mental Health (5 items), RE= Role emotional (3 items), VT= Vitality (4 items), GH= General Health (5 items). All of the eight health domain scales contributes with different levels to score two component summary measures: PCS= Physical Component Summary and MCS= Mental Component Summary. All scores are calculated online through scoring software. Domain scales and component summary are ranging from 0 to 100. A high score is considered to be a better outcome, as indicating little or no problem.</description>
