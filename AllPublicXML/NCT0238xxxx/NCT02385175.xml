  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Eustachian tube links the middle ear to the back of the nose and is designed to open to
      allow the pressure in the air-filled middle ear to be equal to external (atmospheric)
      pressure. In some people this system fails to work properly leading to abnormal pressure in
      the middle ear, and complications such as middle ear fluid ('glue ear') or damage to the ear
      drum. The abnormal function of the Eustachian tube is called 'Eustachian tube dysfunction'.
      An affected person may feel pressure, pain or other symptoms in their ear, and their hearing
      can be temporarily or permanently reduced.

      This study is designed to find out which of a number of simple tests is best at detecting if
      the Eustachian tube is performing normally. Both patient-completed questionnaires and
      clinical tests using specialist machines will be compared as a way of diagnosing Eustachian
      tube dysfunction.

      A group of adults aged 18 and above, and children aged 5-17 years with normal ears, and a
      similar group of people that are already known to have Eustachian tube dysfunction, will both
      take six different tests and complete four different questionnaires. The differences in the
      results between the group with ETD and the healthy group will be compared. The results for
      each test or questionnaire will be compared to see which is best at telling the healthy and
      Eustachian tube function groups apart, and therefore at diagnosing Eustachian tube
      dysfunction. The investigators will also look to see if a combination of one or more of the
      tests or questionnaires is best at diagnosing the disease.

      The results of this study hope to provide a test or combination of tests that can be used on
      a daily basis by ENT doctors. The assessment technique would also be helpful in researching
      and comparing new treatments for ETD.
