  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most frequent cause of suffering and disability in society. Despite considerable
      involvement of genetic factors in pain sensation and sensitivity, the individual genes
      involved remain largely unidentified.

      In this project the investigators will follow patients undergoing elective major surgery for
      the development of acute and chronic pain. The investigators will search for clinical as well
      as genetic factors that can predict the development of pain. These can serve as biomarkers to
      predict acute and chronic pain development and progression in individual patients and help
      early individual treatment adaptation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most frequent cause of suffering and disability in society. Chronic pain
      seriously impairs quality of life of millions of people worldwide. 10-50% of surgical
      patients report chronic pain after surgery; up to 10% report severe pain. Thus, chronic pain
      is a significant medical and financial burden to society.

      Despite considerable involvement of genetic factors in pain sensation and sensitivity,
      individual genes involved remain largely unidentified. Knowledge of genetic factors, their
      phenotypic expression in pain processing, and their link to neuronal correlates can improve
      understanding of pain aetiology and processes involved in pain perception and chronification.
      Also, they can serve as biomarkers to predict chronic pain development and progression in
      patients and help early individual treatment adaptation.

      In this study the investigators will establish a prospective database and biobank of patients
      undergoing elective major surgery. Using data from the database and biobank, the
      investigators will identify genetic factors contributing to development of acute and chronic
      pain after surgery.

      Over a period of 10 years the investigators will prospectively include up to 10,000 patients
      visiting the hospital for elective major surgery. Data defining participants demographics,
      medical history and questionnaire data will be collected and stored in dedicated databases.
      Additional details (surgery and perioperative management, pain processing phenotypes and
      surgical and pain outcomes) will be stored.

    <description>All patients will be followed for 1 year after elective surgery, during this period the investigators will collect acute pain measures using a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 (no pain) -10 (pain)) before the operation and 1, 2, 3 and 7 days after the operation.</description>

    <measure>Genetic risk factors for the development of chronic pain (defined as pain (yes or no) for more than 3 months in one specific body area).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be followed for 1 year after elective surgery, during this period the investigators will collect chronic pain measures using a questionnaire before the operation and 1 week, 3 months and 6 months. Chronic pain is defined as pain at a specific body side (yes/no) for more than 3 months.</description>

    <measure>If the pain influences daily functioning will be assesed with the pain disability index.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pain disability index will be used to assess whether the observed acute or chronic pain influences daily life. The pain disability index will be collected before the operation and at week 1, 3 months and 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Is fear before an operation related to the development of acute and chronic pain after the operation.</measure>
    <time_frame>once pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Amsterdam Preoperative Fear and Information Scale (APAIS)(Moerman et al. Anesth Analg. 1996 Mar;82(3):445-51) will be used to assess whether the observed acute or chronic pain can be linked to fear before an operation. The measure will be collected before the operation. The scores on the anxiety scale of the APAIS range from 4 (not anxious) to 20 (highly anxious). And the scores on the information scale of the APAIS range from 2 (no need for information) to 10 (high need for information).</description>

    <measure>Is the Pain Catastrophizing Scale related to the development of acute and chronic pain after the operation.</measure>
    <time_frame>once pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan et al. Psychol Assess 1995;7:524-32) will be used to assess whether the observed acute or chronic pain are association with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale contains 13 items (all items are rated on a 5 point scale). The measure will be collected before the operation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Is Pain Sensitivity related to the development of acute and chronic pain after the operation.</measure>
    <time_frame>once pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ; Ruscheweyh et al.Pain. 2009 Nov;146(1-2):65-74) will be used to assess whether the observed acute or chronic pain are association with a higher pain sensitivity. This questionnaire consists of 17 questions, each describing a daily life situation on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (not painful at all) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). The pain sensitivity questionnaire will be collected before the operation.</description>
