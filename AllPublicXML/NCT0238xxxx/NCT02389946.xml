      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Orsiro Sirolimus
      Eluting Coronary Stent System in the treatment of subjects with up to three native de novo or
      restenotic (standard PTCA only) coronary artery lesions compared to the Xience coronary stent
      system.

      The BIOTRONIK BIOFLOW-V clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled
      trial combining data on the randomized subjects with data from two historical studies by
      employing a Bayesian approach.

      Subjects with CAD that qualify for PCI with stenting will be screened per the protocol
      inclusion and exclusion criteria to achieve a total of up to 1,400 randomized subjects.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio, stratified by study center, to undergo
      percutaneous coronary revascularization with either the Orsiro Sirolimus Eluting Stent System
      (treatment group) or the Xience Everolimus Eluting Stent System (control group).

      Subjects may receive treatment of up to three target lesions, one or two target lesions per
      target vessel, for a maximum of two target vessels. The target lesion(s) must be de novo or
      restenotic lesion(s) of ≤ 36 mm in length in native coronary artery(ies), with a reference
      vessel diameter of 2.25-4.0 mm. Treatment of restenotic lesions is allowed provided that the
      target lesion was previously treated with PTCA only. All treatment with study stents is to be
      performed during a single index procedure. Note: Concurrent treatment of non-target lesions
      during the index procedure is not allowed.

      Randomized subjects will have clinical follow-up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and at 2, 3,
      4 and 5 years following the index procedure.

      To assess the non-inferiority of the Orsiro stent compared to the Xience stent, BIOFLOW-V
      randomized subjects will be combined with historical subjects from the BIOFLOW-II and
      BIOFLOW-IV randomized trials employing a Bayesian approach. Only subjects who meet all
      clinical and angiographic eligibility criteria of the BIOFLOW-V trial will be included in the
      analysis.

          1. Target lesion is located within a saphenous vein graft or arterial graft.

          2. Target lesion is a restenotic lesion that was previously treated with a bare metal or
             drug eluting stent (in-stent restenosis).

          3. Target lesion has any of the following characteristics:

               1. Lesion location is within the left main coronary artery, or within 3 mm of the
                  origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX).

               2. Involves a side branch of &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter. Note: Lesions within 3 mm of the
                  origin of the right coronary artery may be treated.

          4. Target vessel/lesion is excessively tortuous/angulated or is severely calcified, that
             would prevent complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon. This assessment should be
             based on visual estimation.

          5. Target vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus.

          6. Target lesion is totally occluded (100% stenosis).
