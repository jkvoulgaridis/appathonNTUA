      ﻿The study's main objective is to investigate melatonin's anxiolytic, analgesic, and
      sleep-regulating effects in patients undergoing cosmetic breast surgery. Moreover, the
      investigators intend to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of melatonin in this
      patient population.

      The study is separated into two parts. All patients are undergoing cosmetic breast surgery.

      The first part is a cohort at 12 patients undergoing breast surgery. All patients in this
      group will be treated with melatonin, and the investigators intend to investigate the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of melatonin. Melatonin will be administrated 60 min. before
      surgery and the evening after surgery at 9 pm.

      All patients will receive an intravenous catheter. The intravenous catheter will be used for
      blood sampling. A baseline blood sample will be taken 65 min before surgery (baseline) and
      thereafter blood samples will be obtained 0 min., 15 min., 30 min., 45 min., 60 min., 90
      min., 120 min., 180 min., 240 min., 300 min., 360 min. and 420 min. after administration of
      melatonin. Blood samples will be obtained again after administration of melatonin at 9 pm. in
      the evening in the same manner as described above. Plasma samples will be stored at minus 80
      C and analyzed at the research laboratory of the Department of surgery, Herlev Hospital. The
      analysis will be preformed with the RIA-technique.

      Patients who are participating in this part one are not able to participate in part two.

      The second part is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a total of 72
      participants divided into a intervention group (36) and a placebo group (36). In this part
      the investigators intend to investigate the anxiolytic, analgesic and sleep-promoting effects
      of melatonin. Melatonin and placebo will be administrated at 9 pm. the evening before
      surgery, 120 min. before surgery, immediately after surgery in the PACU and at 9 pm. the
      evening after surgery.

      Anxiety will be measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a VAS-scale (0 mm =
      no anxiety and 100 mm = worst anxiety). Pain will be measured according to the VAS-scale (0
      mm = no pain and 100 mm = worst pain) during movement and at rest. . Quality of sleep will be
      measured at the VAS-scale as well (0 mm = best sleep and 100 = worst sleep).

      Randomization will be performed by a computer at randomization.com. The &quot;first generator&quot;
      function is used. The randomization will be preformed in blocks of 4 patients in each.
      Patients are stratified according to type of surgery: primary breast augmentation or
      replacement of existing implants.

      Manufacturing of medications and randomization will be made by an independent pharmacist.

      Two seperate sample size calculations were perfomed, because the study has 2 primary outcomes
      (preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain).

        1. The sample size is based on a previous study measuring preoperative anxiety applying
           STAI in patients undergoing various elective surgical procedures. Preoperative anxiety,
           specified as State-anxiety 1 hour before surgery, documented a mean (SD) value of 39.30
           (9.30) [18]. A power of 80% was defined, a significance level of 5% and a minimal
           relevant difference (MIREDIF) of 30%. From these assumptions, 10 patients in each
           treatment group is needed

        2. A power calculation is performed based on a mean VAS score at 6 hours postoperatively
           demonstrating a mean (SD) pain of 4,6 (2.1). The investigators defined a power at 0,80,
           a p-value of 5% was to be considered significant and and a minimum relevant difference
           of 30%. A minimum of 36 patients will be included in each group.

      Statistics Pain will be assessed as an integrated pain score of AUC VAS and opioid
      requirements. Anxiety and sleep quality will be compared at individual timepoints between
      groups Comparison will be performed either by Mann-whitheys-test or unpaired t-test,
      depending on the distribution of data. Values are considered significant at a p-value at 5%
      or less. Data will be reported as mean (SD) or median (IQR) depending on the distribution of
      data.

      Data for the blood samples will be presented as AUC plasma concentrations, half-life, maximum
      concentration and time to maximum concentration.
