      This study in patients with IBS-C is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group clinical trial with 12 weeks of study drug therapy.

      Screening/Baseline: Patients will undergo an up to 28-day Screening/Baseline period to allow
      for any necessary diagnostic procedures, allow for required washout of medications and to
      determine study eligibility. If otherwise eligible based on screening criteria, patients will
      undergo a 2-week baseline assessment using an electronic diary where they will record daily
      assessments of bowel movements (BMs), stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale-BSFS),
      abdominal pain and other IBS-related symptoms. Data from the two-week electronic diary
      assessment just prior to the randomization visit will be used to confirm IBS-C and study
      eligibility as well as define the patient's baseline from which change will be determined.

      Treatment: Patients who meet all entry criteria will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three
      blinded treatment groups on Day 1 of the Treatment period. Patients will take an oral dose of
      study drug OD for 12 weeks and continue the daily electronic diaries (BMs, rescue medication
      use, abdominal pain, and other symptoms). During treatment weeks 4, 8, and 12, patients will
      return to the clinic to undergo safety and efficacy assessments.

      Post-Treatment: For 2 weeks after completing dosing, patients will continue to complete daily
      electronic diaries. Patients will then return to the clinical site for a final follow-up
      visit during Week 14 following randomization.

      The planned duration of participation in this study will be at least 116 days from signing of
      informed consent through post-treatment or up to approximately 135 days with visit windows
      considered.

    <measure>Number of Overall Responders - ITT Population</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An Overall Responder was a patient who was a Weekly Responder (i.e., decrease of 30% from baseline for abdominal pain intensity and an increase of at least one complete spontaneous bowel movement in the same week) for at least 6 of the 12 treatment weeks.</description>

    <measure>Number of Abdominal Pain Responders for at Least 6 of 12 Treatment Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An Abdominal Pain Intensity Responder was a patient who had a decrease of 30% from baseline for abdominal pain intensity. Baseline was the mean of non-missing abdominal pain scores recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Stool Frequency Responder for at Least 6 of the 12 Treatment Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Stool Frequency Responder is defined as a patient who experienced an increase of at least one CSBM (complete spontaneous bowel movement) per week from baseline. Baseline was the mean number of CSBMs recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Sustained Efficacy Responders</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Sustained Efficacy Responder was a patient who was an Overall Responder who also was a Weekly Responder, i.e., decreased of 30% from baseline for abdominal pain intensity and increased of at least one CSBM (complete spontaneous bowel movement) in the same week for at least 2 of the 4 weeks in month 3 of the Treatment Period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Stool Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-Week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in stool consistency based upon the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) Rating 1 to 7. Baseline was the mean BSFS score recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. BSFS Rating 1 to 7:
Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
Sausage-shaped but lumpy
Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily)
Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Straining</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Straining Score over the 12-week treatment period. Baseline was the mean of non-missing straining scores recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. The severity of straining during a bowel movement was measured using an 11-point scale (0-10 rating; 0 = no straining; 10 = worst straining).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in CSBM Frequency Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-Week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline over the 12-week Treatment Period in CSBM (Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement) Frequency Rate (CSBMs/Week). Baseline was the mean number of CSBMs recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Stool Consistency</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in stool consistency based upon the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) Rating 1 to 7. Baseline was the mean BSFS score recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. BSFS Rating 1 to 7:
Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
Sausage-shaped but lumpy
Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily)
Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid</description>
