    <textblock>
      This roll-over protocol allows patients who are still receiving clinical benefit to continue
      to be treated from multiple protocols in one program spanning multiple indications during the
      completion of the parent study/(ies). The population for the roll-over study should be
      consistent with the population defined in the program parent study/(ies). The primary
      eligibility criteria for a patient to enter the roll-over protocol is the participation and
      completion of a Novartis GDD&amp;GMA/Incyte study with ruxolitinib monotherapy or combination of
      ruxolitinib and panobinostat. Efficacy parameters would not be measured; however safety data
      and an evaluation of clinical benefit will be collected.

      Patients who have completed a prior study with ruxolitinib monotherapy or combination of
      ruxolitinib and panobinostat and who are assessed by the Investigator to continue to benefit
      from ongoing treatment will be eligible.

      Protocol number: CINC424A2X01B Full title An open label, multi-center, Phase IV rollover
      protocol for patients who have completed a prior global Novartis or Incyte sponsored
      ruxolitinib (INC424) study or ruxolitinib and panobinostat (LBH589) combination study, and
      are judged by the investigator to benefit from continued treatment.

      Brief title An open label, multi-center, Phase IV rollover protocol to evaluate long term
      safety data Sponsor and Clinical Phase: Novartis, IV Investigation type Drug Study type
      Interventional Purpose and rationale The purpose of this study is to evaluate long term
      safety data and to allow patients continued use of ruxolitinib monotherapy or combination of
      ruxolitinib and panobinostat who have been receiving treatment in a Novartis-sponsored Global
      Drug Development (GDD) or Global Medical Affairs (GMA) study or Incyte-sponsored study that
      has reached its study objectives, are not progressing on the current study treatment as
      defined by the parent protocol, have completed their obligations, and are unable to access
      ruxolitinib or combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat outside of a clinical trial.
      Patients must be benefiting from treatment as judged by the investigator at the completion of
      the parent study.

      Primary Objective(s) To evaluate long term safety data i.e. SAEs and AEs Secondary Objectives
      To evaluate clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator.

      Study design This is a multi-center, open label study to evaluate long term safety of
      ruxolitinib monotherapy or combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat in patients from a
      Novartis-sponsored Global Drug Development (GDD) or Global Medical Affairs (GMA) study or
      Incyte-sponsored study that has reached its study objectives, or who are not progressing on
      the current study treatment or who are on parent study and have completed their obligations
      and are unable to access ruxolitinib or combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat, outside
      of a clinical study, and are benefiting from treatment as judged by the investigator at the
      completion of the parent study.

      Population Male and female patients who are currently enrolled in a Novartis-sponsored Global
      Drug Development (GDD) or Global Medical Affairs (GMA) study or Incyte-sponsored study that
      has reached its study objectives, or who are not progressing on the current study treatment
      as defined by the parent protocol, or who are on parent study and have completed their
      obligations and are unable to access ruxolitinib or combination of ruxolitinib and
      panobinostat outside of a clinical study. Patients must be benefiting from treatment as
      judged by the investigator at the completion of the parent study. This rollover study allows
      patients from parent studies with indications including but not limited to myelofibrosis
      (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), acute GvHD (aGvVHD) or chronic GvHD (cGvHD). The study must be
      in the process of being completed &amp; reported.

      For Pediatric GvHD Population*:

      • Male and females ages ≥28 days to &lt;18 years old with either grade II-IV aGvHD or grade
      II-IV SR-aGvHD or with either moderate to severe treatment-naive cGvHD or SR-cGvHD

      *Pediatric GvHD population herein refers to both pediatric and adolescents from parent
      protocols: CINC424F12201 (REACH-4) and CINC424G12201 (REACH-5).

      parent study due to any reason.

      Patient's indication is currently approved and reimbursed in the local country for
      ruxolitinib monotherapy or other study drugs in the combination treatment (panobinostat).

      Investigational and reference therapy INC424 / ruxolitinib / Jakavi / Jakafi (United States
      [US] brand) LBH589 / panobinostat / Farydak Efficacy assessments At every quarterly visit,
      the investigator is required to confirm that the patient continues to have clinical benefit
      and may continue receiving ruxolitinib monotherapy or combination of ruxolitinib and
      panobinostat.

      Safety assessments Frequency and nature of adverse events and serious adverse events GvHD
      Patient Population: At every quarterly visit, the investigator is required to confirm any
      infections or, second primary malignancies under Adverse Events.

      Pediatric GvHD population*: At every yearly visit, the investigator is to determine the
      Tanner staging (if applicable).

      *Pediatric GvHD population herein refers to both pediatric and adolescents from parent
      protocols: CINC424F12201 (REACH-4) and CINC424G12201 (REACH-5).

      Adolescent and Pediatric GvHD Patients: height and weight monitoring is required yearly by
      the investigator until 18 years old.

      Other assessments Not applicable Data analysis The statistical analysis will be descriptive
      only, summarizing safety data and clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, for the
      overall population and by indication. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events will
      be summarized by system organ class and/or preferred term, type of adverse event, severity
      (based on CTCAE grades), and relation to study treatment.

      For pediatric GvHD patients ≤18 years of age, height and Body Mass Index (BMI) will be
      summarized at yearly intervals, using descriptive statistics. All height/BMI data will be
      listed. ingThe statistical analysis will mainly focus on be imited to report frequency and
      severity of AEs and SAEs as outlined in Section 10.

          1. Patient is currently enrolled in a Novartis GDD or GMA-sponsored or Incyte-sponsored
             clinical study (where Incyte can delegate the sponsorship to a preferred CRO, if
             applicable) that is approved to enroll into this rollover study, and are receiving
             either ruxolitinib or combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat, and fulfilled all
             of the requirements of the parent protocol.

          2. Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with ruxolitinib monotherapy or
             combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat, as determined by the investigator

          3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent
             study protocol requirements

          4. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other
             study procedures

          5. Patient currently has no evidence of progressive disease, as determined by the
             investigator, following previous treatment with ruxolitinib or combination of
             ruxolitinib and panobinostat

          6. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in rollover study and receiving
             study medication. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally
             documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.

        Note 1: If the patient is a minor, the parent who signs the informed consent for the minor
        must be a legally recognized parent or guardian. Where deemed appropriate by the clinician,
        and the child's parent or guardian, the child will also be included in the all discussions
        about the trials and the minor aged 12 and above assent will be obtained. The parent or
        guardian will sign on the designated line on the ICF attesting to the fact that the child
        had given consent.

        Note 2: if the minor is an adolescent female, she will be informed during the assent
        process that for safety purpose, a pregnancy test is required. She will also be told that
        if it is positive, she will be counseled and will be assisted in telling her parents. If
        the minor does not want to proceed, she will be advised not to sign consent and her
        enrollment in this protocol will end.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients eligible for this study must not meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from study treatment in the parent study due
             to any reason.

          2. Patient's indication is currently approved and reimbursed in the local country.

          3. Patient has participated in a combination trial other than the panobinostat and

             combination with another study medication and until the termination of gestation,
             confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.

          4. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

          5. Female patients between ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years of age and of childbearing potential (e.g.
             are menstruating) who do not agree to abstinence or, if sexually active, do not agree
             to the use of highly effective contraception as defined below, throughout the study
             and for up to 30 days after stopping treatment.

             Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study duration inclusive of the 30-day safety follow up. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

             In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
             childbearing potential.

          6. For patients on the combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat:

               -  Women of childbearing potential unwilling to use highly effective methods of
                  contraception during dosing and for 3 months (female patients of childbearing
                  potential)

               -  Female sexual partner(s) of childbearing potential of male participants unwilling
                  to use highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 6 months
                  after stopping.

               -  Women of childbearing potential who use hormonal contraceptives and additionally
                  unwilling to use a barrier method for birth control.Sexually active males
                  (including vasectomised men) unwilling to use barrier contraception (condom with
                  spermicide) during intercourse and for 6 months after stopping treatment (in
                  order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid).
