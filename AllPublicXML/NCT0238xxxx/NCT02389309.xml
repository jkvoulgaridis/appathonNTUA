  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib and temsirolimus when
      given together with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread
      to other places in the body, have come back, or have not respond to previous treatment.
      Dasatinib and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving dasatinib and temsirolimus
      together with cyclophosphamide may be a better treatment for advanced solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      combination treatment with dasatinib, cyclophosphamide and temsirolimus.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of the combination of dasatinib, cyclophosphamide
      and temsirolimus administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of dasatinib,
      cyclophosphamide and temsirolimus within the confines of a phase 1 study.

      II. Preliminary assessment of biological markers and correlates of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib and temsirolimus.

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide PO
      once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing stable disease or better may
      continue treatment with the approval of the study chair.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
