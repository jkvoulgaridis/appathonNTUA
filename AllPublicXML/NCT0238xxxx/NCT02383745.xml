  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Kuopio University Department of Clinical Neurophysiology there have been designed a fast
      EEG electrode, that is suitable for acute emergency use. It is easy to set up, records high
      quality EEG and can detect the most important EEG abnormalities comparable to conventional
      EEG. This study will address the clinical use of acute EEG with fast electrode set in
      in-hospital patients who have been consulted by Medical Emergency Team because of seizure or
      altered mental state of uncertain etiology. Patients are going to be treated in ICU and EEG
      monitoring will continue for 24 hours.
