    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) in treating participants with head and neck cancer that has spread from where
      it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes and is at high risk for continuing to spread
      because the participant cannot undergo standard chemotherapy. Stereotactic body radiation
      therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers radiation directly to the tumor in
      smaller doses over several days, which may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to
      normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the maximum tolerated dose of head and neck stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) in a high risk participant population ineligible for standard chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess profiles of SBRT toxicity and examine participant (including co-morbidities), tumor
      and treatment related factors that are associated with SBRT related toxicity.

      II. Identify any dose volume parameters that are associated with SBRT related toxicity.

      III. Explore potential dose response relationships between higher SBRT dosing and
      radiographic response.

      IV. Assess impact of SBRT on participants' quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants undergo SBRT in 5 fractions at least 40 hours apart over 10-18 days.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 0.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months.

    <description>Participants undergo Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in 5 fractions at least 40 hours apart over 10-18 days.
Three dose levels: 40Gy and 45Gy all in 5 fractions. Each initial dose level will have 6 participants allocated to them. All participants are assessed at their 3 month post SBRT visit for Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). If ≤1 participant experiences a DLT, participants will be enrolled at the next dose level. If ≥3 participants experience a DLT, further accrual will be permanently halted and the study stopped. If 2 participants experience a DLT, then an additional 6 participants will be enrolled at the same dose level. In this setting, if ≤ 3/12 participants have a DLT, participants will be enrolled at the next dose level. If ≥ 4/12 participants have a DLT, further accrual will be permanently halted and the study stopped and 35 Gy will not be recommended as safe.
The dosing strategy for the 2nd (45Gy) cohort will be identical to the first.</description>

Three dose levels: 40Gy and 45Gy all in 5 fractions. Each initial dose level will have 6 patients allocated to them.
