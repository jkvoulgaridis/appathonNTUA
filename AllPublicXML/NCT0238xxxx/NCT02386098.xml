    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of BMS-955176 with
      atazanavir (ATV) [with or without ritonavir (RTV)] and dolutegravir (DTG) is efficacious,
      safe, and well-tolerated in HIV-1 infected treatment experienced adults.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;40 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24-Stage 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for quantitative analysis of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 c/mL at Week 24 was assessed using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm which used the last on-treatment plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement, within an FDA-specified visit window (18 to 30 weeks), to determine response. Analysis was performed on the modified intent to treat (mITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants who received atleast one dose of BMS-955176 or TDF.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected for quantitative analysis of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Response was assessed using the last plasma HIV-1 RNA value in the predefined visit window to classify a participant's response status. The percentage of responders with HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 c/mL at Weeks 48 and 96 using mITT Population (observed) which consisted of participants in the mITT Population excluding participants who had no HIV-1 RNA result data in the assessment visit windows due to discontinuation and who discontinued on or after the date of site notification of study termination by the sponsor (October 10, 2016) is presented. The study was terminated early during the primary end point analysis of Stage 1; hence, data was not collected for Week 96 analysis.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Baseline is the last value on or before the start of study treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit minus the Baseline value. Change from Baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA (log10) is summarized over time for the mITT Population using observed values, which excluded participants without HIV-1 RNA result data in the assessment visit windows due to discontinuation and who discontinued on or after the date of site notification of study termination by the sponsor (10 October 2016).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was planned to be conducted in two Stages (96 weeks each); but was terminated early during Stage 1 due to high rates of gastrointestinal (GI) intolerability and early end of the concurrent, 205891 (NCT02415595) formal dose-finding study. Hence, data was collected only in Stage 1 and no participants were enrolled in Stage 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 288 participants were screened, of which 86 were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms in Stage 1.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;40 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24-Stage 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for quantitative analysis of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 c/mL at Week 24 was assessed using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm which used the last on-treatment plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement, within an FDA-specified visit window (18 to 30 weeks), to determine response. Analysis was performed on the modified intent to treat (mITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants who received atleast one dose of BMS-955176 or TDF.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Baseline is the last value on or before the start of study treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit minus the Baseline value. Change from Baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA (log10) is summarized over time for the mITT Population using observed values, which excluded participants without HIV-1 RNA result data in the assessment visit windows due to discontinuation and who discontinued on or after the date of site notification of study termination by the sponsor (10 October 2016). NA indicates data was not available. The standard deviation could not be calculated as a single participant was analyzed at the specified time point.</description>
