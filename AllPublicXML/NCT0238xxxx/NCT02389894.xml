      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of embolic protection devices to reduce ischemic brain
      injury in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized trial in which patients diagnosed with calcific aortic
      stenosis (AS) with planned AVR will be randomized to 1) the treatment arm of the Edwards Life
      Science filter and cannula or the filter as a stand alone with any cannula or 2) to the
      treatment arm of the CardioGard cannula versus 3) standard care in a 1:1:1 ratio.
