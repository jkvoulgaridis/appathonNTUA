      The purpose of this study to permit continued access to dacomitinib for patients who
      participated in other dacomitinib monotherapy treatment protocols in Japan and have the
      potential to derive clinical benefit without unacceptable toxicity from continued dacomitinib
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intention of the study is to allow continued use of dacomitinib in Japan for patients on
      closed dacomitinib clinical trials and who continue to experience clinical benefit.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of investigational product administration.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With All-Causality Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of investigational product administration.</description>
