  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will examine the performance of a new dental implant that
      has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use to replace of missing teeth.
      The investigators will study two groups of patients: one group will receive a temporary crown
      to replace the missing tooth at the same day as implant surgery; the second group will
      receive a similar crown 3 months later. Both groups will receive a permanent crown on the
      implant 4 months after surgery, and will be followed up for a period of 12 months. The
      investigators want to examine whether the healing of the bone and gums surrounding the
      implant that receives a crown immediately is similar to the healing of the implant when the
      crown is delivered later. If this is indeed the case, then the investigators will be able to
      recommend faster treatment for all patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental implants are a widely used treatment option for the replacement of lost teeth due to
      trauma or oral diseases. The original protocol for placement of dental implants in edentulous
      spaces in the maxilla or the mandible was introduced more than thirty years ago and called
      for a two-stage approach, i.e., surgical placement of submerged dental implants and
      subsequent uncovering with abutment connection, prosthesis fabrication and functional loading
      approximately 6 months after. Today, the time between surgery and loading in a two-stage
      protocol has been commonly abbreviated to 3-4 months, while immediate implant
      provisionalization has emerged as a reliable and predictable option in cases of adequate
      osseous support, having similar survival and success rates to the two-step procedure.
      Comparison of histological healing has demonstrated no significant differences in bone to
      implant contact between implants surgically placed according to a two-stage protocol and
      those immediately provisionalized. However, substantial variability was noted among the
      clinical protocols used in the studies carried out so far, and additional well-designed
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to fully appreciate the clinical outcomes of
      immediate and early loading protocols.

      The design of dental implants is a subject of continuous improvement, and implant
      manufacturers regularly introduce new products the use of which may result in accelerated
      soft and hard tissue healing, increased initial implant stability, and enhanced aesthetic
      outcomes. The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial is to compare treatment outcomes
      when using a newly-introduced dental implant (NobelParallel™ CC) in a one-stage or a
      two-stage protocol. This new implant has the same titanium oxide surface coating (TiUnite®)
      and the same design principles of the parallel-walled NobelSpeedy Groovy™ implants, and an
      internal conical connection. The implant is marketed under the premarket notifications
      K050406 and K073142 (510(k), Food and Drug Administration).
