    <time_frame>Up to Cycle 6 (Cycle length =28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. DLTs were defined using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) Version 4.03 as: Neutropenia less than(&lt;) 0.5*10^9/liter(L) for greater than(&gt;) 5 days; neutropenia &lt;1*10^9/L with fever; thrombocytopenia &lt;25*10^9/L accompanied by bleeding or thrombocytopenia &lt;10*10^9/L; any Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicity for which the study drug could not be excluded as a cause (other than nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in the absence of appropriate prophylaxis) with the following clarification: Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological laboratory abnormalities for which there was no expected clinical correlation would not be considered DLTs; treatment delay of &gt;14 days required to recover from E7820-related toxicities.</description>

    <measure>Extension Phase Part A, and Treatment and Extension Phase Part B: Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug (Baseline) up to approximately 6.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>BOR based on RECIST 1.1 for target and non-target lesions is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for &gt;4 weeks or stable disease (SD) for &gt;5 weeks from first dose. CR: disappearance of target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (&lt;10 millimeter [mm] short axis). PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest SOD. PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>Duration of response based on RECIST 1.1 for target and non-target lesions is the time from the date of first documented confirmed CR/PR until the first documentation of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever came first. CR: disappearance of target and non-target lesions,normalization of tumor marker level,all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size(&lt;10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30% decrease in SOD of target lesions,taking as reference the baseline SOD persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.

    <description>PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions. For PD: participants with best response of PD have been reported. For Death: participants with death known to have died at any point have been reported.</description>

         12. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of

             contraceptive or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double-barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

        <title>Extension Phase Part A, and Treatment and Extension Phase Part B: Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR)</title>
        <description>BOR based on RECIST 1.1 for target and non-target lesions is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for &gt;4 weeks or stable disease (SD) for &gt;5 weeks from first dose. CR: disappearance of target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (&lt;10 millimeter [mm] short axis). PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest SOD. PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
