    <description>Avelumab will be administered in study location using a protocol-defined dose escalation scheme until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or investigational medicinal product occurs. After determination of the dose and regimen for Expansion Phase, avelumab will be administered to subjects divided into 4 primary cohorts: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) post platinum doublet, NSCLC first-line, gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer and metastatic breast cancer (MBC); 8 secondary cohorts: Colorectal cancer (CRC), castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), melanoma, ovarian cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) mesothelioma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC); and 4 efficacy expansion cohorts: gastric and GEJ cancer (third line), ovarian cancer (second-line only), urothelial carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for dose escalation and expansion phase:

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Male or female subjects aged greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally
             advanced solid tumors, for which no standard therapy exists or standard therapy has
             failed. Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies is optional for
             subjects in dose escalation

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at trial entry
             and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Disease must be measurable with at least 1 uni-dimensional measurable lesion by RECIST
             1.1, except for subjects with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or
             metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who may be enrolled with objective evidence of disease
             without a measureable lesion

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol

          -  Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception
             exists

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Inclusion Criteria for expansion phase:

          -  Subjects must have relapsed, refractory, or progressive disease following last line of
             treatment (with the exception of the gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
             cancer cohort, which does not require progression). Availability of tumor archival
             material or fresh biopsies (excluding bone biopsies) is mandatory for eligibility in
             the expansion cohorts. For subjects in the MBC cohort, the biopsy or surgical specimen
             must have been collected within 90 days prior to the first investigational medicinal
             product (IMP) administration. Specifically, the following will be required:

          -  NSCLC post platinum doublet: Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or
             stage IV NSCLC that has progressed after 1 line of platinum-containing doublet
             chemotherapy. Subjects should have received only 1 line of platinum-containing
             treatment for metastatic disease (i.e., adjuvant treatment with a platinum-containing
             regimen is not sufficient for eligibility because not received in the context of a
             metastatic disease). Subjects in the NSCLC cohort will only be enrolled in USA

          -  NSCLC first line: Stage IV (per 7th International Association for the Study of Lung
             Cancer [IASLC] classification) or recurrent NSCLC that is histologically proven.
             Subjects must not have received treatment for their metastatic or recurrent disease.
             No activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation nor ALK
             translocation/re-arrangement

          -  Gastric and GEJ cancer: Histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or
             metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastric and gastro-esophageal junction, treated with
             first-line chemotherapy combination with or without disease progression. Subjects
             should have received no more than 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease. Subjects
             should not have been treated with trastuzumab (but can be Human Epidermal growth
             factor Receptor 2 [HER2] positive). Subjects who received any platinum containing
             doublet or triplet as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy, but are not ultimately
             candidates for surgery will also be eligible, as long as they did not have progressive
             disease after completion of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, subjects with
             gastric cancer can enter in the study if their white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte
             count is as defined in the protocol

          -  MBC: Subjects must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or MBC and have
             tumor that is refractory to or progressive after standard of care therapy. Subjects
             must have received no more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic
             disease. Subjects must have received a taxane and an anthracycline, unless
             contra-indicated

          -  Secondary expansion cohorts: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), Metastatic
             castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), melanoma, ovarian cancer, ACC,
             mesothelioma, urothelial carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma as defined in the protocol

          -  Efficacy expansion cohorts: Gastric and GEJ cancer (third line), ovarian cancer
             (platinum Refractory + liposomal doxorubicin), urothelial carcinoma, and HNSCC as
             defined in the protocol

               -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria for expansion phase could apply

        Exclusion Criteria for dose escalation and expansion phase:

          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug

          -  Prior therapy with specific antibody/drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins
             (immune checkpoints)

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment, major surgery, or use of any investigational drug
             within 28 days before the start of trial treatment; or concurrent systemic therapy
             with immunosuppressive agents, use of hormonal agents within 7 days before the start
             of trial treatment as defined in the protocol. Note: Subjects receiving bisphosphonate
             or denosumab are eligible provided treatment was initiated at least 14 days before the
             first dose of avelumab.

          -  Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in this
             trial within the last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma

             eligible) or immunodeficiencies

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, any history of
             anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy greater than Grade 1 NCI-CTCAE v4.0,
             however sensory neuropathy less than or equal to Grade 2 is acceptable

          -  All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial
             treatment

          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of
             informed consent

             administration of the inactivated influenza vaccine
