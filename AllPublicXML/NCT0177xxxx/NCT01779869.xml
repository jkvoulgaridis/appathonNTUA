  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective for this pilot study is to develop an optimized, clinically usable myocardial
      PET-MR perfusion protocol and to determine which of all data potentially available should be
      acquired for a clinical myocardial perfusion examination. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that
      high resolution, high sensitivity DCE MRI could replace the rest PET myocardial perfusion
      imaging, significantly decreasing examination time and patient radiation dose while
      maintaining the comprehensive reference-quality PET myocardial stress perfusion coverage.

      The primary outcome will be comparison of diagnostic accuracy of each combination of imaging
      to detect clinically significant coronary artery stenosis (â‰¥70% diameter stenosis).

    <textblock>
      Simultaneous acquisition PET-MRI is a new technology that has the potential to significantly
      impact diagnostic patient care. It combines high signal resolution MRI anatomic imaging and
      PET biological measurements, with the added benefit of radiation dose reduction in comparison
      to PET-CT. As the incidence of false positive SPECT-MPI studies secondary to attenuation
      artifact is relatively high and MRI coverage of the left ventricular myocardium is limited,
      it is likely that one of the immediate applications of PET-MRI technology is myocardial
      ischemia assessment.

      PET has long been considered the noninvasive reference standard for myocardial perfusion.
      However, delayed contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI is very sensitive for infarct detection. Indeed,
      both PET and MR imaging have the potential to provide comprehensive whole heart ischemia and
      infarct detection.

      PET-MR technology, with its ability to obtain simultaneous perfusion information via both PET
      and MRI, has the potential to obtain multiple, possibly redundant, data sets. On the other
      hand, it also has the potential to combine the best of both techniques to provide a highly
      robust examination that is both shorter and of lower radiation dose than the standard
      myocardial PET perfusion examination. Optimization of a protocol is necessary to develop a
      comprehensive protocol without redundancy. Because of its single injection capability,
      regadenoson is ideally suited to a protocol that will assess and employ dual-modality
      myocardial perfusion data collection.

      It is expected that the best candidates for PET-MR myocardial perfusion imaging will likely
      be a) patients whose body habitus suggests that their SPECT-MPI examination would be limited
      by attenuation artifact -- women with large breasts and patients (usually men) with abdominal
      obesity and/or b) patients who may have a smaller region of ischemia that might be missed on
      an MRI examinations with limited perfusion coverage.

    <description>The accuracy of the cardiac PET and cardiac MR examination components of the PET/MRI, and the accuracy of the combined PET/MR examination, for ischemic heart disease will be compared to the accuracy of cardiac SPECT in patients who have had ICA as &quot;truth&quot; or the reference standard. To assess the accuracy of an abbreviated PET/MR examination, an additional accuracy analysis was made using only the stress PET perfusion imaging and the MR LGE data sets. The accuracy of this combined data set was also determined with ICA as &quot;truth&quot; or the reference standard. Accuracy is calculated as % difference = (experimental - true) x 100%.</description>

          <description>All patients will undergo PET-MR myocardial perfusion imaging during rapid intravenous administration of 0.4 mg regadenoson.
Regadenoson: Regadenoson 400 micrograms will be administered in a single IV bolus (&lt;10 seconds) via an antecubital cannula and followed by 5 mL of saline flush. 10-20 seconds after the regadenoson is administered, 10 mCi of 13N-ammonia as a bolus, and 0.075 mmol/Kg of gadobenate dimeglumine MR contrast agent at a rate of 5 mL/sec followed by a 15 mL normal saline flush will be administered simultaneous, each into an antecubital vein, and a 15 min list-mode PET acquisition will be acquired simultaneously with the MR perfusion imaging.</description>
