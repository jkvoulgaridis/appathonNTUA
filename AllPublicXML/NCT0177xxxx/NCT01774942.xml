  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gum disease and type 2 diabetes are common chronic diseases that affect each other. Diabetes
      is increasing, especially in Pakistan. People with diabetes have a greater risk for gum
      disease. Also, it is thought that that gum disease, a chronic infection, can be a source of
      systemic inflammation and may contribute to poorer diabetes control.

      The aims of this project are to study:

        1. Changes in sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes and severe gum disease after
           having all teeth removed and replaced with Straumann dental implants and full dentures

        2. Changes in certain inflammation markers seen with insulin resistance and other diseases
           and conditions more common in people with diabetes

        3. Retention of dental implants in people with type 2 diabetes.

      Part I (up to 12 months after implant placement):

      The study will recruit 30 patients with type 2 diabetes and severe gum disease from Dr. Amin
      Rahman's private practices in Pakistan. Their long-term sugar (HbA1c) must be 7.5% or more
      and the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (hsCRP) 1mg/dL or more. Consenting
      participants will first have an oral examination. Eligible patients will have impressions of
      the jaws and the color of their teeth and gums recorded. At the next visit, all teeth will be
      extracted and dentures provided. One week later, there will be a check-up visit. Three months
      after the teeth were removed, Straumann dental implants will be placed in the jaws. After one
      week, the patient will be checked again. After three months, the dentures will be adjusted to
      fit the implants. Follow-up visits will occur every three months until one year after the
      implants were placed to check the health of the patients as well as their implants, the gums
      around them, and the dentures. Blood samples will be taken at each follow-up visit.

      Part II (from 12 months to 11 years after implant placement):

      Follow-up visits will occur every six months for the next ten years, to check the health of
      the patients as well as their implants, the gums around them, and the dentures. The follow-up
      visit will be identical to those done in Part I, including blood samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I:

      Our hypotheses are that levels of HbA1c and hsCRP will:

        1. decrease after extraction of all teeth

        2. not increase after placement of dental implants

        3. not increase after prosthetic restoration with full dentures anchored on the dental
           implants.

      Part II:

      Our hypothesis is that:

      a) the implants will be retained over the long term

      Only one arm was included due to ethical reasons: Once potential participants would be
      diagnosed with terminal periodontal (gum) disease, they would need full-mouth extraction and
      prosthetic rehabilitation. It would be unethical to withhold or delay treatment that is known
      to work, especially because such severe gum infection can have very serious consequences.
      Therefore, no control group was included in study.

      Few studies have determined what happens to sugar control and inflammatory markers in people
      with diabetes if teeth with severe gum disease are removed and replaced with implants and
      dentures. Neither has any study followed for a total of 11 years after implant placement such
      subjects that initially had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes as well as recent severe periodontal
      infection, and several of whom smoke cigarettes.

      Therefore, the results of this study could add new understanding about diabetes and dental
      health. The results of this study could influence dental care guidelines for treating people
      with uncontrolled or poorly type 2 diabetes and severe gum disease. The option of implant
      supported dentures could potentially be added to the treatment choices for such patients.

    <description>One-arm clinical intervention study: All teeth out, full dentures, dental implants, blood draw. The interventions are not experimental in nature, they are standard procedures, namely extraction of all natural teeth followed by suturing to hold soft tissue in place during initial healing; surgical insertion of commercially available dental implants; and fabrication and re-lining (filling in with acrylic the base of the denture as needed during healing and shrinking of underlying tissue) of full dentures, that is full plates in upper and lower jaw to replace all teeth.</description>

    <description>All teeth were extracted and replaced by a set of provisional full dentures in upper and lower jaws. Three months after extractions, dental implants were surgically placed and mucosa sutured over them. Three monts later, the dentures were re-lined and fitted onto the implants.
