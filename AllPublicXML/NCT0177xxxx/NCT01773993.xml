    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The pain from fibromyalgia experienced during the past 24 hours was rated by participants at the time of getting up in the morning on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain possible). Mean change from baseline in the pain score at Week 52 was presented along with standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The problems associated with depression-related symptoms experienced during the last 2 weeks were rated by participants ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) in total 0 to 27(the higher the more severe) consisting the following 9 items: 1) little interest or pleasure in doing things; 2) depressed, or hopeless; 3) trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much; 4) feeling tired or having little energy; 5) poor appetite or overeating; 6) feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down; 7) trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television; 8) moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed. Or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual; and 9) thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Status of EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) at 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Health status (EQ-5D) was evaluated based on the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity (e.g., work, study, housework, family, or leisure activities), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension was rated in the three levels of response alternatives &quot;no problems,&quot; &quot;some problems,&quot; or &quot;extreme problems.&quot; For the analysis of EQ-5D, the response outcome for the five dimensions was converted to a utility value using tariff value set based on the Japanese version of EQ-5D. The utility value was not assigned if there was no response in any one of the five dimensions. 1 for full health and 0 for being dead: a positive (negative) number implies that the health state is better (worse) than dead. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fibromyalgia Activity Score (FAS-31) at 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FAS-31 (ranged from 0 to 31) is calculated as the combined score of the widespread pain index (WPI, ranged from 0 to 19) and the symptom severity (SS) scale (ranged from 0 to 12). The WPI is a measure of the number of painful body regions. The SS is the scale of the severity in the three symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms; ranged from 0 to 3 each) and general physical symptoms (ranged from 0 to 3). WPI ranged from 0 to 19 the higher score indicates more severe of activity, SS ranged from 0-12 also higher score shows more severe symptoms observed. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Japanese Version of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (JFIQR) at 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>JFIQR is a Japanese version of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), which was established for overall evaluation of the influence of fibromyalgia on patient's health. It consists of three linked sets of domains: &quot;function (9 questions),&quot; &quot;overall impact (2 questions),&quot; and &quot;symptoms (10 questions).&quot; Participants responded to the questions based on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst. For the analysis of JFIQR, the score for each domain was modified as follows: The summed score for &quot;function&quot; (ranged from 0 to 90) was divided by 3 and the summed score for &quot;symptoms&quot; (ranged from 0 to 100) was divided by 2. The summed score for &quot;overall impact&quot; (ranged from 0 to 20) was not modified. The total score, the sum of the three modified domain scores (ranged from 0 to 100, the lower score represents a better outcome), was used for the analysis. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>

Dosage should be adjusted, depending on age or symptoms. However, the daily maximum dose should not be beyond 450 mg, and should be orally administered twice daily.</description>

        <description>Health status (EQ-5D) was evaluated based on the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity (e.g., work, study, housework, family, or leisure activities), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension was rated in the three levels of response alternatives &quot;no problems,&quot; &quot;some problems,&quot; or &quot;extreme problems.&quot; For the analysis of EQ-5D, the response outcome for the five dimensions was converted to a utility value using tariff value set based on the Japanese version of EQ-5D. The utility value was not assigned if there was no response in any one of the five dimensions. 1 for full health and 0 for being dead: a positive (negative) number implies that the health state is better (worse) than dead.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fibromyalgia Activity Score (FAS-31) at 52 Weeks</title>
        <description>FAS-31 (ranged from 0 to 31) is calculated as the combined score of the widespread pain index (WPI, ranged from 0 to 19) and the symptom severity (SS) scale (ranged from 0 to 12). The WPI is a measure of the number of painful body regions. The SS is the scale of the severity in the three symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms; ranged from 0 to 3 each) and general physical symptoms (ranged from 0 to 3). WPI ranged from 0 to 19 the higher score indicates more severe of activity, SS ranged from 0-12 also higher score shows more severe symptoms observed. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Fibromyalgia Activity Score (FAS-31) at 52 Weeks</title>
          <description>FAS-31 (ranged from 0 to 31) is calculated as the combined score of the widespread pain index (WPI, ranged from 0 to 19) and the symptom severity (SS) scale (ranged from 0 to 12). The WPI is a measure of the number of painful body regions. The SS is the scale of the severity in the three symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms; ranged from 0 to 3 each) and general physical symptoms (ranged from 0 to 3). WPI ranged from 0 to 19 the higher score indicates more severe of activity, SS ranged from 0-12 also higher score shows more severe symptoms observed. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>
          <population>The analysis population for this outcome measure comprised of participants for whom the evaluation outcome of FAS-31 was available among the baseline analysis population.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese Version of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (JFIQR) at 52 Weeks</title>
        <description>JFIQR is a Japanese version of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), which was established for overall evaluation of the influence of fibromyalgia on patient's health. It consists of three linked sets of domains: &quot;function (9 questions),&quot; &quot;overall impact (2 questions),&quot; and &quot;symptoms (10 questions).&quot; Participants responded to the questions based on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst. For the analysis of JFIQR, the score for each domain was modified as follows: The summed score for &quot;function&quot; (ranged from 0 to 90) was divided by 3 and the summed score for &quot;symptoms&quot; (ranged from 0 to 100) was divided by 2. The summed score for &quot;overall impact&quot; (ranged from 0 to 20) was not modified. The total score, the sum of the three modified domain scores (ranged from 0 to 100, the lower score represents a better outcome), was used for the analysis. Mean change from baseline in the evaluation score was presented along with standard deviation.</description>
