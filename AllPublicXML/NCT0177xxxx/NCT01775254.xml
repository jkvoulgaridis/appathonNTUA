  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study was to address the following questions by describing the
      trajectory of early survivorship in individuals who undergo both surgical and medical
      management of colon cancer. What are the changes in quality of life, demands of illness,
      sexual function, and peripheral neuropathy, following curative resection during the first
      year of treatment and recovery? Is there an interaction between exposures to chemotherapy and
      changes over time in these outcomes?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population of interest included colon cancer survivors of both sexes, 18 to 90 years of
      age, who underwent one of two types of surgical resection and who may receive adjuvant
      chemotherapy. The prospective design with two cohorts representing exposure to chemotherapy
      (chemotherapy vs. no-chemotherapy) described the changes in quality of life, demands of
      illness, sexual function, and peripheral neuropathy, which occurred following curative
      resection. An analysis of the interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and the
      independent variable of chemotherapy group by mean values of quality of life, sexual
      function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness addressed the central thesis
      question.

      Specific Aims

        1. Examine the relationships among quality of life, demands of illness, sexual functioning,
           and peripheral neuropathy, for the total sample and by chemotherapy group.

        2. Examine changes within-subjects (four measurement occasions), between-group
           (chemotherapy, no-chemotherapy) differences, and the interaction between time and
           chemotherapy group for quality of life, demands of illness, sexual functioning, and
           peripheral neuropathy across four measurement occasions.

    <description>The Neurotoxicity Sub-scale (Ntx-13); a questionnaire about symptoms of nerve damage in persons receiving chemotherapy, will be utilized to assess symptoms of neurologic toxicities in persons receiving the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin.

    <description>Change in Sexual Function Questionnaire (CSFQ)will be used to describe the changes in sexual function reported by cancer survivors following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. The interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and chemotherapy group (chemotherapy, no chemotherapy ) by mean values of changes in sexual function will be examined.</description>
