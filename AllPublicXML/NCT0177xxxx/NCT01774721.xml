    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the
      efficacy and safety of treatment with dacomitinib (PF-00299804) to treatment with gefitinib
      in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, with epidermal
      growth factor receptor EGFR-activating mutation (s). Analyses of primary objective
      (Progression Free Survival) will be done as defined in the protocol.

CR for target lesion: disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease.

PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of sum of all target measurable lesions, short diameter was used in sum for target nodes, longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions.

        <title>Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR) Based on Investigator Assessment</title>
        <description>Number of participants with BOR based on investigator assessment (CR or confirmed PR) was recorded from randomization until disease progression based on RECIST v1.1. CR for target lesion: disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decreased to normal size (short axis &lt;10 mm); for non-target lesions: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. All lymph nodes must be 'normal' in size (&lt;short axis &lt;10 mm); for new lesions: repeated assessments of a new lesion if it was equivocal. PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of sum of all target measurable lesions, short diameter was used in sum for target nodes, longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions. PD was defined as 20% increase in sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28-35 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non- serious adverse events.</description>

        <population>Safety analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication, with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities of Grade 3 or Higher Severity Based on NCI CTCAE Version 4.03: Biochemistry and Haematology</title>
        <description>Laboratory parameters included haematological and biochemistry parameters. Haematology parameters included anaemia, activated partial thromboplastin time, haemoglobin, international normalized ratio, lymphocyte count, lymphopenia, neutrophils (absolute), platelets, prothrombin time and white blood cells. Biochemistry parameters included alanine aminotransferase (increased), alkaline phosphatase (increased), aspartate aminotransferase (increased), bilirubin (total), creatinine (increased), hypercalcaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypermagnesaemia, hypernatraemia, hypoalbuminaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia. Test abnormalities were graded by AEs according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 as Grade 1= mild; Grade 2= moderate; Grade 3= severe and Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling. Only categories with at least 1 participant with abnormality are reported in this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>An ejection fraction (EF) was the volumetric fraction of blood ejected from a ventricle of the heart with each heartbeat; it was a measure of the pumping efficiency of the heart. The EF of the left heart, known as the left ventricular ejection fraction, was a measure of the efficiency of pumping into the body's systemic circulation.</description>

        <description>HRQOL was measured by standardized questionnaires (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)) quality of life questionnaires (OLQ-C30) and its lung cancer module (QLQ-LC13). TTD in pain (chest, arm/shoulder), dyspnea, fatigue or cough was defined as time between baseline and first occurrence of increase in score of 10 points or greater from baseline in any of these 4 symptoms for at least two consecutive cycles. For those who had not shown deterioration, the data was censored at the last date when the participants completed an assessment for pain, dyspnea, fatigue or cough.</description>
