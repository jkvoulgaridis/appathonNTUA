      This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the objective response rate (defined as
      complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Etirinotecan pegol administered to
      subjects with metastatic and recurrent NSCLC after failure of 2nd line therapy. Up to 37
      eligible subjects will receive the investigational drug q3 weeks until they are no longer
      benefiting.

      This is a Phase 2 study designed to characterize the objective response rate (defined as
      complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102)
      administered to subjects with metastatic and recurrent NSCLC after failure of 2nd line
      therapy. Up to 37 eligible subjects will be enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania.

      One cycle will be defined as 3 weeks. Patients will be followed clinically every week for the
      first cycle with laboratory parameters and physical exam. Response will be determined by
      RECIST version1.1 after 2 cycles of therapy. Patients with stable disease (SD), PR or CR will
      continue on treatment for up to six cycles. Those who are benefitting after six cycles will
      have the option of continuing on treatment. Patients with progressive disease will be taken
      off study and will be followed for OS data.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. Primary or

          -  After failure of 2nd line treatment with up to two prior lines of therapy, one of
             which may be an oral TKI.

          -  Measurable disease (Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as
             &quot;nontarget&quot; lesions unless progression is documented incontrovertibly either
             radiographically or pathologically. For clinicians relying on biopsy documentation of
             recurrence, this must be obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following
             completion of radiation therapy).

        <description>The primary objective of this phase 2 trial is to estimate the objective response rate (Complete Response or Partial Response, as measured by RECIST version 1.1) for patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC being treated with etirinotecan pegol after failure of second-line therapy.</description>

            <title>Etirinotecan Pegol</title>
            <description>This Phase II, single-arm, open-label study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC after failure of 2nd line therapy. Eligible patients will receive etirinotecan pegol at a dose of 145 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks. One cycle will be defined as 3 weeks. Patients will be followed clinically every week for the first cycle with laboratory parameters and physical exam. Response will be determined with RECIST version 1.1 after 2 cycles of therapy. Patients with Stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) will continue on additional therapy for up to six cycles. In the absence of disease progression in subjects completing six full cycles, further treatment beyond cycle #6 will be left to the discretion of the treating physician and his/her staff. Patients with progressive disease will be taken off study and will be followed for overall survival.</description>
