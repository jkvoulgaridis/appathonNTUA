  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational multicenter study will evaluate the differences in progression-free
      survival defined in specific subgroups of participants with metastatic colorectal cancer
      receiving bevacizumab (Avastin). Further, safety and efficacy in daily routine will be
      assessed.
