      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The main goal of this study is to perform standardized testing of tumor tissue to learn which
      genes are mutated (have changed) to provide personalized cancer therapy options to patients
      at MD Anderson. Your doctor may be able to use testing information on your tumor to identify
      clinical trials that may be most relevant to you.

      Another goal of this laboratory research study is to learn how often different genes mutate
      in patients with different cancers. Researchers will also use the information learned from
      this study to develop a database of the different kinds of mutations in cancer-related genes.

      Researchers also hope to better understand how mutations in cancer-related genes may affect a
      patient's response to different therapies. Researchers can use this information to select
      specific therapies for future patients that are more likely to be effective.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 12,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically, radiographic, or cytologically documented cancer,
             suspected glioma, sarcoma, melanoma or hematologic cancer. Patients with benign tumors
             may also be consented at the discretion of the attending physician if molecular
             profiling is felt to have potential clinical implications.

          2. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          3. Patients may be consented without confirming the amount and quality of archival
             diagnostic or residual tissue available. However, research testing will only be
             performed on patients who have sufficient archived diagnostic tissue or residual
             tissue banked in one of the authorized tissue banks at MD Anderson available to
             proceed with testing. The extent of testing may be modified based on amount of tissue
             available. If any new tissue acquisition including a biopsy and/or surgical resection
             etc. is being ordered for clinical care or another research study, or an operation is
             being performed testing can be ordered on that sample.

          4. cfDNA Cohort: Circulating cell-free DNA next generation sequencing (NGS) testing will
             be performed with the CLIA-certified Guardant360 panel (or equivalent) for select
             patients. This particular cohort of research collaboration will be supported by
             Guardant Health, Inc. at no charge to MD Anderson. Patients who are being considered
             for enrollment into clinical trials in the next 2 lines of therapy may be enrolled.
             Selected patients may have cfDNA, circulating RNA /exosome/Circulating tumor cell
             testing approaches performed on alternate platforms (eg Foundation ACT).
