      The primary aim of this study is to compare the impact of early extubation to nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) versus nasal Bilevel positive airway pressure
      (n-BiPAP) and non invasive positive pressure ventilation(NIPPV) on the need for mechanical
      ventilation via endotracheal tube (MVET) to 7 days of age or less in preterm infants less
      than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation requiring intubation and surfactant if indicated for
      respiratory distress syndrome within 120 min of delivery . Second aim is to compare different
      outcomes of post-extubation n-CPAP , n-BiPAPand NIPPV.

    <description>The n-CPAP group will receive at extubation a single level continuous positive airway pressure of 7 cm water for at least 48 hours before weaning is commenced. If the infant is stable for the preceding 48 hours defined by having fewer than three minor apneas and no increase in oxygen requirement, weaning will be permitted.
CPAP will be decreased from 6 cm water by 1 cm water every 24 hours if tolerated based on the above criteria. This will be done until a pressure of 4 cm water is reached.
If a pressure of 4 cm water is successfully tolerated for 48 hours then time off n-CPAP will be allowed. Thereafter, no fixed weaning regime based on number of hours in a day the infant will be allowed to come off CPAP will be prescribed.</description>
