  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a
      booster dose of GSK Biologicals' MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 6 years post-primary
      vaccination with either GSK Biologicals' Hib-MenC-TT vaccine (Menitorix™) or Hiberix™ and
      Meningitec™, in healthy subjects aged 12-18 months at primary vaccination and to evaluate the
      long-term antibody persistence at 2 years after MenACWY-TT booster vaccination.

      This is an extension study of the Hib-MenC-TT-016 study (NCT number: NCT00326118).

             preceding the blood sampling at Visit 3.

        The following criteria should be checked for the long-term persistence phase at two years
        after booster vaccination (Visit 3):

        In case an exclusion criterion becomes applicable, the subject will not enter the long-term
        follow-up and the reason will be documented.

          -  Previous administration of a meningococcal vaccine with the exception of the
             meningococcal vaccination given in the primary study and the booster vaccination in
