      This is a 5-year cluster RCT of a video Advance Care Planning intervention vs. control among
      360 nursing home residents with advanced dementia (N=180/arm) in 20 matched nursing homes (10
      intervention/10 control). Clinical outcomes will be collected at baseline, and quarterly (up
      to 12-months) regarding goals of care preferences, advance care planning, and treatments
      received. The primary outcome is decisions not to be hospitalized at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-riding goal of the EVINCE study is to conduct a cluster RCT of a video Advance Care
      Planning intervention in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. A total of 360
      nursing home residents with advanced dementia (N=180/arm) in 20 matched nursing homes (10
      intervention/10 control) will be recruited. These residents' proxies with also be recruited
      for a total sample size of 720 residents and proxies (resident/proxy dyads). Outcomes will be
      compared between residents in the intervention vs, control nursing homes at baseline and
      every 3 months up to 12 months. At baseline proxies of residents in the intervention nursing
      homes will view a 12-minutes video describing three level of care options in advanced
      dementia (intensive, basic and comfort) and their choice will be communicated to the
      resident's primary care providers. Residents in the control nursing homes will receive the
      usual advance care planning practiced in those facilities.

      UPDATE SEPT 19, 2014: During the first 18 months of the study, recruitment of resident/proxy
      dyads was lower per facility than anticipated at the time of study design. Therefore, the
      number of matched pairs of NH recruited was increased. As of September 19, 2014, 19 NH pairs
      (38 NHs) were recruited and randomized with a plans to continue to up to 30 pairs as needed.

      NHs were originally randomized using a paired approach matched for for-profit status and
      whether or not the NH had a special care dementia unit (SCU). In March 2014, the state of
      Massachusetts changed legislation defining an SCU. Many of the changes focused on specifics
      of staff training. As a result, SCUs in several participating facilities did not meet the new
      criteria and lost this official designation, although the actual clinical structure of the
      existing units did not change. Nonetheless, we opted to maintain the initial matching
      criteria of the first 19 NHs which included SCU based on the definition before the
      Massachusetts legislation change, but dropped this matching criterion after the legislation
      change. Thus, beginning with matched pair 20, NHs were matched solely on for-profit status.

      UPDATE MARCH 2016 To reach subject recruitment numbers, additional facilities were recruited.
      As of this date, 60 NHs (30/arm) have been recruited, randomized and have had subject
      enrolled.

      To achieve additional for power for Outcome 2, (aquisition of new decisions to forego
      hospitalizations) the target sample size was increased to 400.

    <measure>Documented Decisions to Forgo Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>by six months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of residents with this outcome will be considered cumulatively at 6 months, including those who died; i.e., a composite of the percent of residents alive at six months who had a decision not to hospitalize and those who died before six months with this outcome prior to death. This cumulative outcome will only be based on time points following baseline as the baseline chart review data is conducted before the baseline proxy interview (i.e., before the proxy has seen the video in the intervention arm or heard options verbally in the control arm).
(Decisions to forehospitalizations will be examined in a similar fashion at 3, 9, and 12 months, however the six month time frame is the primary trial outcome)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acquisition of Decisions Not to Hospitalize</measure>
    <time_frame>by 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a sub primary outcome. The modified ITT population will be the subgroup of residents who begin the study without a documented decision to forego hospitalization, and the outcome will be acquisition of a documented decision to forego hospitalization over the 12 month follow-up period. The analysis will utilize Cox proportional hazards regression. Results will be summarized using a hazard ratio and associated 95% confidence interval as well as plots of the cumulative incidence by group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acquisition of Preference for Level of Care</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of proxies who have chosen comfort care (versus intermediate or intensive care) based on telephone interviews will be considered cumulatively at each assessment. At 6 months the outcome will include the proportion of proxies choosing comfort care up to and including the 6 month interview. Cumulative proportions will include data from the baseline interview for the control group, and baseline immediate post video interview for intervention group.The proportion of proxies choosing comfort care will be compared between the intervention and control groups using an extension of logistic regression based on general estimating equations (GEE) to account for clustering at the NH level at each time period.</description>

This cumulative outcome will only be based on time points following baseline as the baseline chart review data is conducted before the baseline proxy interview (i.e., before the proxy has seen the video in the intervention arm or heard options verbally in the control arm).
(Decisions to forehospitalizations will be examined in a similar fashion at 3, 9, and 12 months, however the six month time frame is the primary trial outcome)</description>
