  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, long-term, open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of retigabine immediate-release (IR) as adjunctive therapy
      in adult Asian subjects with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who successfully complete the Maintenance Phase of Study RTG114855 (parent study)
      and are expected to benefit from therapy with retigabine IR will be eligible for this OLE
      study. The study will consist of Screening (1 day), Open-Label Treatment and Follow-up (3
      weeks) phase. Subjects will initially receive a starting dose of retigabine IR at 900
      milligram (mg)/day and the same concurrent antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen that they were
      receiving at the final visit of the Transition Phase of the parent study. After the first
      week of the OLE study, the dose of retigabine IR may be adjusted to between 600 and 1200
      mg/day, with dose adjustments in increments or decrements of 150 mg/week, based on efficacy
      and tolerability. In addition, the dose and number of concurrent AEDs may also be adjusted to
      meet each individual subject's needs. The efficacy and safety issues will be assessed
      throughout the study; subjects will be instructed to call the investigator if they experience
      any efficacy or tolerability issues between the study visits. As the duration of the study
      will be determined based on the following four conditions: 1) regulatory approval and
      commercialisation of retigabine IR; 2) retigabine IR is not approved by the regulatory
      authorities; 3) the study is terminated by the Sponsor for reasons including, but not limited
      to, safety issues; or 4) the subject is withdrawn or withdraws consent, 4 years will be
      considered as a guide to the duration of the study. The safety and tolerability endpoints are
      incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs); proportion of subjects with AEs leading to
      discontinuation; change from Baseline in vital sign measurements and weight; change from
      Baseline in electrocardiogram parameters; change from Baseline in haematology, chemistry, and
      urinalysis parameters; changes from Baseline in American Urological Association Symptom Index
      and post-void residual bladder ultrasound volumes; and summary of the Columbia-Suicide
      Severity Rating Scale. Efficacy will be assessed by calculating the percent change from
      Baseline (parent study) in 28-day total POS frequency for the entire open-label Treatment
      Phase of this OLE study. This will also be calculated based on duration of exposure.
      Responder rate (defined as a &gt;/=50% reduction from Baseline in 28-day total POS frequency)
      will also be summarised for the entire open-label Treatment Phase and by duration of
      exposure.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, other situations and is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function is SAE. TEAE refers to an AE for which the onset was on or after the date of the first RTG dose in this study and on or before 30 days after the last RTG dose date. AEs that started in the parent study that worsened in this study were also considered as TEAEs. Safety population comprised of participants who take at least 1 dose of study medication after they have enrolled into this OLE study. Number of participants with TE-SAEs and non-SAEs (with incidence &gt;= 5%) have been presented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has successfully completed the Maintenance Phase and Transition Phase of
             Study RTG114855.

          -  The subject is expected, in the opinion of the investigator, to benefit from
             participation in this OLE study.

          -  The subject or the caregiver is able and willing to maintain an accurate and complete
             written daily seizure calendar for the entire duration of the study.

          -  The subject has given written informed consent, or has a legally authorized
             representative who has given written informed consent, prior to the performance of any
             study assessments.

          -  A female subject is eligible to enrol and participate in the study if she is of:
             nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is premenarchal or postmenopausal), premenopausal females
             with a documented (medical report verification) hysterectomy with or without
             oophorectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy when reproductive status has been confirmed by
             hormone level assessment, and postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrhoeic for
             &gt;1 year with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of
             vasomotor symptoms). However, if indicated, this should be confirmed by oestradiol and
             follicle stimulating hormone levels consistent with menopause (according to local
             laboratory ranges). Women who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal should be
             advised to use contraception.

          -  Childbearing potential, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at Screening.

          -  Is not pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has met any of the withdrawal criteria in the parent study (RTG114855) or has, in the
             opinion of the investigator, clinically significant abnormal laboratory or ECG
             findings that preclude entry into RTG114873.

          -  Is planning to begin treatment with an investigational drug (other than retigabine)
             and/or an experimental device for the treatment of epilepsy or any other medical
             condition.

          -  Has any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgement, is considered to be
             clinically significant and could potentially affect subject safety or study outcome,
             including but not limited to clinically significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic
             condition; or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or
             excretion of drugs.

          -  Is unwilling or unable to follow the study procedures or reporting of AEs.

          -  Has active suicidal plan/intent or has had active suicidal thoughts in the past 6
             months or has history of suicide attempt in the last 2 years or &gt;1 lifetime suicide
             attempt.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with partial-onset seizures (POS) who successfully completed the maintenance phase of study RTG114855 (NCT01648101) were recruited in this open-label extension (OLE) study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All the participants received at least 1 dose of retigabine (RTG) immediate release (IR). Screening was performed on the day of final visit of the parent study. A total of 30 participants, 12 from placebo and 18 from RTG group who completed the treatment and transition phases of the parent study were included in this OLE study.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>RTG IR</title>
          <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

          <title>RTG in Safety Follow-up Continuation Phase (SFUCP)</title>
          <description>Participants who withdraw from the Open-Label Treatment Phase and who had retinal pigmentation or unexplained vision loss, pigmentation of non-retinal ocular tissue or abnormal discoloration of nails, lips, skin or mucosa were followed-up in SFUCP which was the final reporting phase of the study. During SFUCP, participants underwent six monthly comprehensive eye examinations and/or dermatological assessments. Participants were followed-up until the discoloration /pigmentation either resolves or stabilizes, as defined by no change over two consecutive six monthly assessments over at least 12 months after discontinuation of RTG IR.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent (TE) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non-SAEs</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, other situations and is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function is SAE. TEAE refers to an AE for which the onset was on or after the date of the first RTG dose in this study and on or before 30 days after the last RTG dose date. AEs that started in the parent study that worsened in this study were also considered as TEAEs. Safety population comprised of participants who take at least 1 dose of study medication after they have enrolled into this OLE study. Number of participants with TE-SAEs and non-SAEs (with incidence &gt;= 5%) have been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Platelet Count, Total Neutrophils, and White Blood Cell Count (WBC)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in hematology parameters including basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes,monocytes, platelet count, total neutrophils, and WBC. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematocrit</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of hematocrit. Hematocrit is a ratio of red blood cells to the total volume of blood. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin and Mean Corpuscle Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in hemoglobin and MCHC levels. Baseline assessment in this OLE study was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Corpuscle Hemoglobin (MCH) Level</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in MCH levels. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Corpuscle Volume (MCV) and Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in MCV and MPV levels. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in RBC count. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in RDW. RDW is a parameter that measures variation in red blood cell size or red blood cell volume. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk. Phosph.), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Creatine Kinase (CK), Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD)</title>
        <description>Blood samples collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters included ALT, Alk. phosph., AST,CK, GGT and LD. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Albumin and Total Protein</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in albumin and total protein. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Creatinine Ratio</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in BUN/creatinine. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Calcium, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Content/Bicarbonate (Bicarb), Chloride, Glucose, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Urea/BUN</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in calcium, CO2 content/Bicarb, chloride, glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and urea/BUN. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Creatinine, Direct Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin, and Uric Acid</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in creatinine, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, and uric acid. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratio</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in urine albumin/creatinine ratio. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated. NA indicates data was not available as standard deviation could not be calculated for single participant.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Urinalysis Values (Categorical Data)</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants to analyze presence of abnormal urinalysis parameters including glucose, ketones, RBC, WBC, occult blood and protein. Abnormal urinalysis values have been presented for all parameters. Only those participants with data available at specific time points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Specific Gravity of Urine at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze specific gravity of urine. Specific gravity, is a measure of urine concentration and is measured using a chemical test. Specific gravity measurements provide a comparison of the amount of substances dissolved in urine as compared to pure water. If there were no solutes present, the specific gravity of urine would be 1.000 the same as pure water. Specific gravity between 1.002 and 1.035 could be considered as normal. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Potential of Hydrogen (pH) of Urine at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Urine Samples were collected to analyze pH. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of urine. pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A neutral pH is 7.0. The higher number indicates the more basic (alkaline) nature of urine and lower the number indicates the more acidic urine. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urine Creatinine Concentration</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants to evaluate change from Baseline in Urine creatinine concentration. Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). Mean and SD were calculated.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants initially received a starting dose of RTG IR 900 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the same doses of the same concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they were receiving at the final visit of the transition phase of the parent study. After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Scale Scores</title>
        <description>The effect of RTG on bladder function was assessed using AUA symptom index. It is a 7-item Likert-scored scale with seven questions, each with six potential responses. Responses to each of 7 questions were scored from 0 (no symptom at all) to 5 (almost always symptoms present) which were summmed to get total possible score ranging from 0 to 35 with higher scores indicating worse symptom severity. The total score for all questions was classified as mild (0-7), moderate (8-19) or severe (&gt;19). Baseline was defined as the last assessment of that endpoint in parent study RTG114855 taken prior to the first active treatment with RTG IR. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Number of participants with suicidal ideation or behavior during treatment were assessed using the C-SSRS score scale. It is a brief questionnaire designed to assess severity and change in suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation using a semi-structured interview to probe participant responses. It consists of an assessment of suicidal ideation (ranging from &quot;desire to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent&quot;) and an assessment of suicidal behavior (ranging from &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot; to &quot;completed suicide&quot;).</description>

After the first week of the OLE study, the dose of RTG IR could be increased or decreased in increments or decrements 150 mg/day on weekly basis based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall daily dose of RTG IR was to be maintained between a minimum dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in 28-day Total POS Frequency</title>
        <description>The 28-day total POS frequency was calculated as the number of total POS reported during the treatment phase, divided by the number of applicable days in the treatment phase, then multiplying this ratio by 28. In this formula, innumerable seizures were counted as 10 seizures and status epilepticus was counted as 1 seizure. As this was an OLE study, Baseline was defined by the parent study Baseline period. The percent change from Baseline was calculated as the 28-day total POS on-treatment frequency (during dosing in this study, not including the taper phase) minus the Baseline 28-day total POS frequency, with this difference being divided by the Baseline 28-day partial seizure rate, and the resulting quantity multiplied by 100. It was calculated as overall and by duration of exposure. Mean and SD were presented.</description>
