  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low prevalence of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adult Latinas
      likely contributes to the high rates of cancer and other chronic diseases in this population.
      The goals of the current study, based largely upon the core principles of the Social
      Ecological Model, are to design, implement, and evaluate an innovative multi-level
      intervention promoting physical activity among churchgoing Latinas.

      The evidenced-based intervention targets three &quot;tiers&quot; of environmental influences (i.e.,
      church, immediate neighborhood surrounding the church, and community) on activity, as well as
      MVPA-related personal factors (i.e.., interpersonal, cultural, and perceived environmental
      variables). The physical activity intervention will be compared with an attention-control
      condition providing health education on cancer screening and prevention.

      Sixteen churches will be randomly assigned to either the physical activity intervention or
      the attention-control condition. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether a
      multi-level intervention will increase MVPA among Latina churchgoers in the intervention
      condition relative to the attention-control condition.

      This two-group randomized controlled trial combines innovative and traditional methods for
      promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cancer screening (breast,
      cervical, colorectal, and skin) among Latinas, and is tested simultaneously in a two-group
      design. Both interventions lasted two years. The study's primary outcome was min/week of
      accelerometer-assessed MVPA at baseline (M1) and 12 months (M2) and 24 months (M3) following
      the start of the intervention.We selected cancer screening as a comparison condition given
      the relevance of this topic to our target community (i.e., low cervical and colorectal cancer
      screening rates and follow-up). It was hypothesized that over time, participants in the
      physical activity condition would engage in significantly higher levels of MVPA, compared to
      participants in the cancer screening condition. We also expected greater changes in
      individual-, interpersonal-, and environmental-level correlates of physical activity among
      participants in the physical activity condition compared to those in the cancer screening
      condition. Conversely, we expected that participants in the cancer screening condition would
      engage in higher screening rates compared to those in the physical activity intervention.We
      anticipated greater changes in individual, interpersonal, and environmental correlates of
      cancer screening in this condition compared to the physical activity condition.

    <description>Promotoras led 6 free physical activity (PA) classes per week (2 walking groups, 2 cardio dance, and 2 strength training) at participating churches randomized to the intervention condition. Classes included prayer, warm-up, moderate-to-vigorous PA, cool-down, followed by discussion of a monthly health handout. Participants received copies of the handouts each month by mail, which promoted healthy PA habits. Promotoras conducted up to 5 motivational interviewing calls with each participant over the 2-year intervention using a guide to evaluate participants' PA engagement, barriers to being active, and solutions to those barriers. Promotoras advocated for changes to the social and built environments of the churches and surrounding neighborhoods in order to promote PA and healthy behaviors.</description>

Physical activity: Promotoras led 6 free physical activity (PA) classes per week (2 walking groups, 2 cardio dance, and 2 strength training) at participating churches randomized to the intervention condition. Classes included prayer, warm-up, moderate-to-vigorous PA, cool-down, followed by discussion of a monthly health handout. Participants received copies of the handouts each month by mail, which promoted healthy PA habits. Promotoras conducted up to 5 motivational interviewing calls with each participant over the 2-year intervention using a guide to evaluate participants' PA engagement, barriers to being active, and solutions to those barriers. Promotoras advocated for changes to the social and built environments of the churches and surrounding neighborhoods in order to promote PA and healthy behaviors.</description>

Cancer screening: Promotoras provided a 6-session group-based workshop series on cancer screening and prevention (breast, cervical, colorectal, and skin cancers) at participating churches randomized to the attention-control condition. Participants received informational handouts developed by American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute to reinforce learning in addition to lists of local cancer screening resources. Promotoras conducted up to 4 motivational interviewing calls with each participant over the 2-year intervention to encourage screening, help overcome barriers to screening, and provide support for goals. Workshops were hosted at the church and promoted through bulletins and service announcements. Faith components were included throughout the intervention, including prayers before and after each workshop and phone call.</description>

        <time_frame>assessed at Baseline, 12 and 24 months following implementation of intervention activities, month 12 reported</time_frame>
        <population>A total of 361 participants (178 physical activity condition, 183 cancer screening condition) had valid waist circumference data at 12-month follow-up measures. Those without valid data (incomplete anthropometrics, etc) were not included in the analysis.</population>

            <title>Physical Activity</title>
            <description>Latinas exposed to multi-level Fe en Acción intervention promoting physical activity.
Physical activity: Promotoras led 6 free physical activity (PA) classes per week (2 walking groups, 2 cardio dance, and 2 strength training) at participating churches randomized to the intervention condition. Classes included prayer, warm-up, moderate-to-vigorous PA, cool-down, followed by discussion of a monthly health handout. Participants received copies of the handouts each month by mail, which promoted healthy PA habits. Promotoras conducted up to 5 motivational interviewing calls with each participant over the 2-year intervention using a guide to evaluate participants' PA engagement, barriers to being active, and solutions to those barriers. Promotoras advocated for changes to the social and built environments of the churches and surrounding neighborhoods in order to promote PA and healthy behaviors.</description>

            <description>Latinas exposed to Faith in Action intervention on cancer screening and prevention.
Cancer screening: Promotoras provided a 6-session group-based workshop series on cancer screening and prevention (breast, cervical, colorectal, and skin cancers) at participating churches randomized to the attention-control condition. Participants received informational handouts developed by American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute to reinforce learning in addition to lists of local cancer screening resources. Promotoras conducted up to 4 motivational interviewing calls with each participant over the 2-year intervention to encourage screening, help overcome barriers to screening, and provide support for goals. Workshops were hosted at the church and promoted through bulletins and service announcements. Faith components were included throughout the intervention, including prayers before and after each workshop and phone call.</description>
