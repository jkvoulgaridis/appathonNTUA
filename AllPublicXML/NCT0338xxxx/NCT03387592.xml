  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II non comparative study. Patients with metastatic Neuroendocrine
      Carcinomas (NEC) Grade 3, will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to
      receive FOLFIRI or CAPTEM as second line treatment. Disease control rate (DCR) and safety are
      primary objectives, secondary objectives are Disease control rate (OS), Progression Free
      Survival (PFS), quality of life and toxicity of subsequent line of therapy (after Progression
      Disease PD) with an observational purpose.

      This is a multicenter randomized phase II non comparative study. Patients with metastatic NEC
      G3, will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI or CAPTEM
      as second line treatment The primary objective is to assess DCR and the safety as co-primary
      objective. The secondary objectives are: OS, PFS, quality of life and toxicity of subsequent
      line of therapy (after Progression Disease PD) with an observational purpose.

      The secondary exploratory objectives are the assessment of the impact of PET with gallium on
      PFS and the evaluation of biomarkers

             expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and follow-up, must be obtained
             and documented according to the local regulatory requirement.

         11. Brain metastases allowed if asymptomatic at study baseline. Whole brain irradiation or
             focal treatment for Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases are permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ki67 index &lt; 20 %.

          2. Patients with metastatic NECs already treated with irinotecan regimen.

          3. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to fluorouracil or calcium levofolinate or

          4. All acute toxic effects of any prior therapy (including surgery radiation therapy,
             chemotherapy) must have resolved to a grade &lt;= 1 according to National Cancer
             Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE).

          8. Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:

               -  unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial
                  infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac
                  arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease.

               -  severely impaired lung function (spirometry and diffusing capacity of lung for
                  carbon monoxide (DLCO) that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or Oxygen
                  saturation that is 88% or less at rest, in room air).

               -  uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x UNL.

               -  any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infections/disorders

             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

         11. Patients with uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded because
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that can be confounding of
             neurologic and other adverse events

         12. Other malignancy with a disease-free interval of less than 5 years (except non
             melanoma skin cancer or low grade superficial bladder cancer).
