  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 1); Endpoint (week 2 or 3 depending on the arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pain level, assessed by the Visual Analog Scale, ranges from 0 - 10, with 10 being the highest level of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 1); Endpoint (week 2 or 3 depending on the arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life level assessed by Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The FIQ is composed of 19 questions, which measure functional capacity, work status, psychological disturbances, physical and painful symptoms. The greater the impact of the disease, the greater the score found. The FIQ consists of 10 items. The first item contains 10 questions (&quot;a&quot; through &quot;j&quot;) related to physical functioning - each issue is evaluated on a four-point Likert scale. In items 2 and 3, the patient is asked to mark the number of days he felt well and the number of days that were unable to work (including housework) because of fibromyalgia-related symptoms. Items 4 to 10 are horizontal lines of 10 cm in length (Visual Analog Scale), in which the patient measures the difficulty for work, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health assessment level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 1); Endpoint (week 2 or 3 depending on the arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in health assessed level assessed by Fibromyalgia Health Assessment (HAQ). It has eight categories: clothing and physical presence, wake up, feed, walk, hygiene, reach, footprint and other daily activities. For each of these categories, the patient indicates the degree of difficulty in four possible responses ranging from &quot;no difficulty = 0&quot; to &quot;unable to do it = 3&quot;. The score for each category appears in the highest number of any of your items. The final HAQ score is the average of the scores of the eight categories and the higher the final score the worse the test result. Questionaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 1); Endpoint (week 2 or 3 depending on the arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in sleep quality assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 1); Endpoint (week 2 or 3 depending on the arm)</time_frame>

    <description>Changes in the cortical electrical activity assessed by electroencephalogram</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 1); Endpoint (week 2 or 3 depending on the arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the resilience assessed by Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale. It has 25 items described positively with likert type response ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree). Scale scores range from 25 to 175 points, with high values indicating high resilience.</description>
