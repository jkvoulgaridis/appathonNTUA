  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the new
      formulation of brolucizumab 6 mg ophthalmic solution when given to the same patients who
      received brolucizumab in the core trial CRTH258A2301 (also known as CRTH258-C002). The
      medical condition treated in the core and extension trials was neo-vascular age-related
      macular degeneration (nAMD).

      Subjects in the United States who had completed the 96 week core trial, CRTH258A2301 (also
      referred as CRTH258-C002), were eligible to participate in the extension trial provided the
      core trial Visit 26 at week 96, was less than or equal to 12 weeks from the Baseline Visit in
      the extension trial, CRTH258A2301E1.

      Subjects who were treated with aflibercept during the core trial and met the eligibility
      requirements of this extension trial continued to receive aflibercept in this extension trial
      in order to maintain the masking during the extension trial. No hypothesis testing or
      descriptive analyses were planned.

      Subjects who were treated in the core trial with brolucizumab 3mg or brolucizumab 6 mg, and
      met the eligibility requirements of this extension trial, received the new formulation of
      brolucizumab 6 mg solution in the extension trial.

      Enrolled subjects were to receive three intravitreal (IVT) ophthalmic injections. The study
      eye was the same eye that received the treatment in the core study. The extension trial
      consisted of 7 study visits at 4 week intervals over a period of 24 weeks.

      Assessment of the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg was based on a within-patient
      comparison with the last 6 months of corresponding core-study efficacy and safety data
      serving as the reference. Neither the patient selection process nor expected sample sizes
      supported a valid comparison between aflibercept and brolucizumab. The aflibercept arm was
      included only to maintain the masking in the extension trial. Data was presented
      descriptively for only brolucizumab in line with the study objective. No formal hypothesis
      testing was planned.

    <description>Number of participants with ocular and non-ocular treatment emergent events with the new formulation brolucizumab 6 mg in this extension trial up to week 24 vs. the corresponding last 6 months of brolucizumab treatment in the Core trial &gt;= 2%. Safety assessment of the new formulation brolucizumab 6 mg was based on a within-patient comparison with the last 6 months of corresponding Core safety data. Missing brolucizumab data were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>

    <description>Best-corrected visual acuity for the study eye was tested at all study visits in a sitting position using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity testing protocol at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. Outcome measure was prespecified for brolucizumab arm only. Neither patient selection process nor expected sample sizes supported a valid comparison between aflibercept and brolucizumab. The aflibercept arm was included only to maintain the masking in the extension trial. Data presented descriptively for only brolucizumab in line with study objective.

    <description>The estimate for the proportion of patients with a positive q12w treatment status at Week 24 was derived from Kaplan Meier time-to-event analyses for the event 'first q8w-need'. The outcome of the Kaplan-Meier analysis was estimated probability for maintaining on q12w up to the Disease Activity Assessment (DAA) at exWeek 20. Outcome measure was prespecified for brolucizumab arm only. Neither the patient selection process nor expected sample sizes supported a valid comparison between aflibercept and brolucizumab. The aflibercept arm was included only to maintain the masking in the extension trial. Data was presented descriptively for only brolucizumab in line with the study objective.

        <description>The estimate for the proportion of patients with a positive q12w treatment status at Week 24 was derived from Kaplan Meier time-to-event analyses for the event 'first q8w-need'. The outcome of the Kaplan-Meier analysis was estimated probability for maintaining on q12w up to the Disease Activity Assessment (DAA) at exWeek 20. Outcome measure was prespecified for brolucizumab arm only. Neither the patient selection process nor expected sample sizes supported a valid comparison between aflibercept and brolucizumab. The aflibercept arm was included only to maintain the masking in the extension trial. Data was presented descriptively for only brolucizumab in line with the study objective. No formal hypothesis testing was planned. Missing brolucizumab data were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>
