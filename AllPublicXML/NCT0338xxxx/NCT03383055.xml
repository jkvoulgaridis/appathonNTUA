    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, interventional study administering 2 doses of the
      experimental vaccine (CMV-MVA Triplex) to 20 evaluable patients (10 CMV-seropositive and 10
      seronegative) undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for lymphoma or
      myeloma on days 28 and 56 post-HCT. The absolute number of adaptive NK cells
      (CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+) at various days will be compared.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Lymphoma or multiple myeloma

          -  Planned co-enrollment on current (at the time of this study version) or future
             (opening subsequent to this study) standard of care autologous stem cell transplant
             protocol.

             * Must meet all eligibility requirements of the co-enrolled parent study

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential and males with partners of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control until at least day
             100 post-HCT

          -  Voluntary written consent signed before performance of any study-related procedure not
             part of normal medical care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CMV immunoglobulin, valganciclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, or other anti-CMV therapy
             within 3 months before the first vaccine is planned. Acyclovir and valacyclovir are
             allowed.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. The FDA has not classified this agent into a specified
             pregnancy category. Females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine
             study within 14 days prior to registration to rule out pregnancy

          -  Planned immunotherapy post-HCT. Proteasome inhibitors and/or immunomodulators, such as
             but not limited to Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide, used for myeloma maintenance are
             allowed.
