  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at Vanderbilt is a multidisciplinary
      outpatient clinic treating patients with chronic pain and complex health issues via
      integrative services, with goals of improving overall health and wellbeing of those served.
      At OCIM, clinical hypnosis has been historically provided on an individual basis by the
      investigator. Due to its impact and increased patient demand for this service, the
      investigator will be conducting group hypnosis services in addition to individual services
      order to expand the reach of this program to participants. As such, the investigators see
      this as a tremendous opportunity to contribute to clinical research to contribute to the
      evidence based for this form of service by examining participant-reported outcomes associated
      with completing the treatment. For this project, the investigators seek to assess the impact
      of a manualized group treatment protocol utilizing clinical hypnosis as a treatment for
      chronic pain. The investigators will be evaluating participant-reported outcomes to assess
      the feasibility of conducting hypnosis in this setting, impact of group hypnosis on pain and
      how participants' responsiveness to hypnosis impacts treatment outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to test the efficacy and mechanisms of clinical hypnosis
      on chronic pain. Primary (characteristic pain intensity) and secondary (mood, quality of
      life) outcomes will be assessed at pre-treatment, three times during treatment,
      post-treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Potential treatment moderators and mediators
      will also be assessed. The study will address two aims:

      Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of 8 sessions of group delivered HYP training for reducing
      characteristic pain intensity in patients. The hypothesis associated with Aim 1 is:

      Hypothesis 1: Primary Study Hypothesis. Patients receiving 8 sessions of HYP training will
      report significantly reduced pre- to post-treatment decreases in average pain intensity.

      Aim 2 : To evaluate potential moderators (hypnotizability) associated with treatment outcomes
      following intervention. The hypothesis associated with Aim 2 is:

      Hypothesis 2a: Hypnotizability will augment treatment outcomes such that those with higher
      hypnotizability will experience significantly greater treatment gains.

      In addition to testing the above specific hypotheses, we will use the data obtained in this
      study to further explore (1) the longer-term (up to 6 months) effects of HYP and (2)
      additional potential moderators (e.g., treatment outcome expectancies, treatment motivation,
      demographic variables, pain type [neuropathic vs. nociceptive]) and mediators (pain
      acceptance, catastrophizing, mindfulness, therapeutic alliance, amount of skill practice
      between sessions) of treatment outcome.

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (severity scale only) is a 4-item subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory assessing the severity of pain over the past week. Questions inquire into an individual's worst, least, average, and current levels of pain on an 11-point likert scale, with 0 being no pain. It has been validated and is considered the gold standard to utilize in patient-reported outcomes studies. It takes &lt;1 minute to complete.</description>

        <description>Brief Pain Inventory (severity scale only) is a 4-item subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory assessing the severity of pain over the past week. Questions inquire into an individual's worst, least, average, and current levels of pain on an 11-point likert scale, with 0 being no pain. It has been validated and is considered the gold standard to utilize in patient-reported outcomes studies. It takes &lt;1 minute to complete.</description>
