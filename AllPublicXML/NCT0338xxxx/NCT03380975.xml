      Montelukast is a potent and selective blocker of the CysLT1 receptor. Accordingly, a recent
      study has shown that Montelukast can improve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and
      asthma in patients with both diseases. For treatment of asthma, Montelukast is administered
      once daily to adults as a 10-mg film-coated tablet, to children aged 6-14 years as a 5-mg
      chewable tablet, and to children aged 2-5 years as a 4-mg chewable tablet form. Asthma and
      allergic rhinitis have been linked clinically for many years as &quot;one airway one diseases&quot;.
      Patients with allergic asthma and rhinitis are significantly more likely to experience asthma
      attacks compared to patients with asthma alone. Side effects most commonly reported above
      placebo included headache, otitis media, upper respiratory infection, and pharyngitis

    <intervention_model_description>Montelukast is an orally active compound which binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT1 receptor. Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD4 at the CysLT1 receptor without any agonist activity. As a result, bronchoconstriction is inhibited with decreased airway and blood eosinophil's leading to improved control over asthma and allergic rhinitis</intervention_model_description>
