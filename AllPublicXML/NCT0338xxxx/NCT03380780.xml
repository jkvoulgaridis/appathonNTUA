    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events by Highest World Health Organization (WHO) Toxicity Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening to study completion (20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO Toxicity Grading Scale was used for assessing adverse event severity. Any adverse event not specifically listed in the WHO Toxicity Grading Scale was assessed according to the following levels of severity: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe; and Grade 4 is life-threatening. Investigator text for adverse events were encoded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 21.1. After informed consent had been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events (SAEs) caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were to have been reported. After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were to have been reported until the participant completed his last study visit. After this period, any SAEs believed to be related to prior study drug treatment were to be reported.</description>

    <description>Participants were considered to be 'ADA Negative (Treatment Unaffected)' if baseline and all post-baseline samples were negative, or if they were ADA positive at baseline but did not have any post-baseline samples with a titer that was at least 4-fold greater than the titer of the baseline sample. 'Total ADA Positive' is the sum of all participants who tested positive for ADA in the 2 following categories: 'ADA Positive (Treatment Induced)', those who were ADA negative at baseline and tested positive for ADA following study drug administration; and 'ADA Positive (Treatment Boosted)', those who were pre-dose ADA positive and had post-baseline samples with a titer that was at least 4-fold greater compared to the baseline measurement.</description>

    <description>The number of participants with a laboratory abnormality during treatment (numerator) is reported among the 'number analyzed' in the table below (denominator), which represents the number of participants without that abnormality at baseline (last observation prior to initiation of study drug). Note that samples from all participants were analyzed for each laboratory parameter. Values falling above or below the Roche predefined standard reference range were laboratory abnormalities labelled accordingly as 'high' or 'low'. Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event; only if it was accompanied by clinical symptoms, resulted in a change in study treatment or in a medical intervention, or was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. SGOT/AST = serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate transaminase; SGPT/ALT = serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase/alanine transaminase</description>

        <description>The WHO Toxicity Grading Scale was used for assessing adverse event severity. Any adverse event not specifically listed in the WHO Toxicity Grading Scale was assessed according to the following levels of severity: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe; and Grade 4 is life-threatening. Investigator text for adverse events were encoded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 21.1. After informed consent had been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events (SAEs) caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were to have been reported. After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were to have been reported until the participant completed his last study visit. After this period, any SAEs believed to be related to prior study drug treatment were to be reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities</title>
        <description>The number of participants with a laboratory abnormality during treatment (numerator) is reported among the 'number analyzed' in the table below (denominator), which represents the number of participants without that abnormality at baseline (last observation prior to initiation of study drug). Note that samples from all participants were analyzed for each laboratory parameter. Values falling above or below the Roche predefined standard reference range were laboratory abnormalities labelled accordingly as 'high' or 'low'. Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event; only if it was accompanied by clinical symptoms, resulted in a change in study treatment or in a medical intervention, or was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. SGOT/AST = serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate transaminase; SGPT/ALT = serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase/alanine transaminase</description>

The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests.

The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last sample prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of coagulation parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last sample prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>The INR is a standardized measure of the prothrombin time. Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of coagulation parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last sample prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Laboratory Test Results by Timepoint: Eosinophils, Absolute Count</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of hematology parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last sample prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Laboratory Test Results by Timepoint: Erythrocyte Mean Corpuscular Volume</title>
        <description>Erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume is a measure of the average volume of a red blood cell. Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of hematology parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last sample prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Laboratory Test Results by Timepoint: Hematocrit (as a Fraction of 1)</title>
        <description>Hematocrit is a measure of the ratio of red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood by volume. Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of hematology parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last sample prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>Vital signs were measured prior to blood sampling while the participant was in a supine position after they had been resting for at least 5 minutes. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last value prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>Vital signs were measured prior to blood sampling while the participant was in a supine position after they had been resting for at least 5 minutes. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last value prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>Vital signs were measured prior to blood sampling while the participant was in a supine position after they had been resting for at least 5 minutes. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests. Baseline was defined as the participant's last value prior to initiation of study drug.</description>

The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value. The post-baseline minimum and maximum change from baseline values are, respectively, the smallest and largest value changes obtained after baseline through the last study visit, including repeat and unscheduled tests.

      <desc>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. After informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious AEs (SAEs) caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were to be reported. After initiation of study drug, all AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, were to be reported until the participant completed his last study visit. After this period, any SAEs believed to be related to prior study drug treatment were to be reported.</desc>
