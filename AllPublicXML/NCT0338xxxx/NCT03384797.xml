  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no cures or disease modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD).
      This is partially due to the inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to a
      stage where there are clinical manifestations. The identification and validation of high
      throughput biomarkers to measure disease progression (as well as identify pre-clinical
      disease onset) is critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative
      therapies. In this study, we are testing a blood biomarker for PD. Several detection
      parameters will be assessed through enrollment of Parkinson's patients and age matched
      healthy volunteers over 50 years of age to learn more about the analytical process and
      biological variability.

        Parkinson's patients will be recruited from the Duke Movement Disorders Clinic. Healthy
        adult volunteers will be recruited from the healthy volunteer registry at DEPRU or
        caregivers of patients seen at the Duke Movement Disorders Clinic.
