      In cohort 1 of this study, we used an attenuated schedule of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and
      nivolumab. This cohort has now fully enrolled, and all eligible patients had resection of the
      bladder &lt;12 weeks from 1st cycle (23/24, 96%). In the current multicenter extension (cohort
      2), n=30 patients will be randomized between two neoadjuvant treatment schemes, both based
      upon an attenuated schedule of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label phase Ib trial to evaluate three different schedules of preoperative
      ipilimumab and nivolumab. Urothelial cancer patients will be included that are diagnosed with
      either:

        -  cT3-4aN0M0 OR

        -  T1-4aN1-3M0

      Cohort 1 (n=24) (Completed):

        -  Day 1: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg

        -  Days 22: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + Nivolumab 1 mg/kg

        -  Day 43: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg

        -  Day 56-84: Radical cystectomy or nefro/ureterectomy with appropriate lymph node
           dissection

      Patients in cohort 2 (n=30) will be randomized between cohort 2a and 2b

      Cohort 2a (n=15):

        -  Day 1: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + Nivolumab 1 mg/kg

        -  Days 22: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + Nivolumab 1 mg/kg

        -  Day 43: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg

        -  Day 56-84: Radical cystectomy or nefro/ureterectomy with appropriate lymph node
           dissection

      Cohort 2b (n=15):

        -  Day 1: Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg + Nivolumab 3 mg/kg

        -  Days 22: Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg + Nivolumab 3 mg/kg

        -  Day 43: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg

        -  Day 56-84: Radical cystectomy or nefro/ureterectomy with appropriate lymph node
           dissection

      The primary endpoint for cohort 1 in this trial is safety. We will determine the number of
      patients that have surgical resection &lt;12 weeks from first infusion, as this is an endpoint
      that is clinically meaningful for this population. After surgery, patients attend study
      visits at day 8 and day 29 . Their final study visit for physical examination and laboratory
      testing is at day 57 (+/- 7 days), which is scheduled to anticipate late-onset adverse events
      (particularly endocrine). After this final visit, patients will be followed according to
      standard clinical guidelines. Tumor biopsies/material preservation is required at baseline
      and during surgery.

      In cohort 2, we will randomize patients between 2 arms. Here, the main secondary outcomes
      are:

        -  To compare the efficacy of pre-operative ipilimumab + nivolumab in cohort 1 (sequenced
           ipilimumab/nivolumab), versus cohort 2a (ipi 3 mg/kg and nivo 1 mg/kg) and cohort 2b
           (ipi 1 mg/kg and nivo 3 mg/kg). Efficacy is defined as pCR rate at resection.

        -  Provide an estimate of ≥grade 3 immune-related toxicity in the ipi3/nivo1 and ipi1/nivo3
           cohorts as opposed to the initial cohort (Cohort 1)

      An important additional secondary endpoint is translational. The main testable hypothesis is
      that a significant percentage of nonresponse can be explained by immune-inhibitory processes.
      Absence of immune infiltrates, presence of significant numbers of regulatory T-cells and
      presence of significant numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells will be compared between
      responders and nonresponders. The efficacy will be defined as the percentage of pathological
      complete response (pCR) at cystectomy (secondary endpoint).
