    <textblock>
      Labor analgesia can alleviate intrapartum pain, in the importance of the delivery is very
      obvious.But some researches think labor analgesia may affect the progress of labor, increase
      the cesarean section rate.This research adopts the epidural anesthesia to study labor
      analgesia effects on delivery outcomes and long-term emotional and psychological effects on
      the mothers. Besides, we also want to study the effect of exercise during pregnancy on the
      mode of delivery.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1 minute Apgar index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute after the infant is born</time_frame>
    <description>The index indicates the infant s' conditions, including heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflex response, color. Each characteristic is given an individual score; two points for each of the five categories if all is completely well; then all scores are totaled. The score is from 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>The index indicates the infant s' conditions, including heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflex response, color. Each characteristic is given an individual score; two points for each of the five categories if all is completely well; then all scores are totaled. The score is from 0 to 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scores(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5min before analgesia;5min,15min, 30min,60min after analgesia; at the time of latent phase, active phase, full dilation of the cervix, crowning of head, and laceration repair.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is the most common pain scale for quantification. The score is from 0 to 10. The score is higher, the patient will be more painful. That will indicate if the analgesia is effective.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Bromage scores</measure>
    <time_frame>5min before analgesia;5min,15min, 30min,60min after analgesia; at the time of latent phase, active phase, full dilation of the cervix, crowning of head, and laceration repair.</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Bromage score is the most frequently used measure of motor block. The scores is from 0 to 3. In this scale, the intensity of motor block is assessed by the patient's ability to move their lower extremities (0: no motor paralysis; 1: inability to raise extended leg, but able to move knee and foot; 2: inability to raise extended leg and to move knee, but able to move foot; 3: inability to raise extended leg or to move knee and foot). That will indicate if the analgesia block the patient motor too much.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postpartum depression</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after delivery,6 weeks after delivery, 3 months after delivery, 6 months after delivery, 1 year after delivery.</time_frame>

    <description>The epidural analgesia technique was used to maintain analgesia for parturients who request labor analgesia.First, we injected a test dose of 5ml 1% lidocaine . If not adverse effects were observed 10 minutes after the test dose, the parturient then received a bolus injection of an initial dose of 8-10 ml mixed liquids of 0.075% ropivacaine and 0.2ug/ml sufentanil citrate. We then connected the epidural catheter with a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCA) pump, which provided patients the same mixed solution at 8-10ml/h until the delivery of neonates.</description>
