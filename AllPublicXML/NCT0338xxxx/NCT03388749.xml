  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study that will determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal annamycin as a single
      agent for the treatment of subjects with AML that has relapsed after standard induction
      therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment will occur in cohorts of 3 subjects in a conventional 3+3 escalating dose design,
      starting at a dose level of 120 mg/m2/day administered for 3 days. Dose escalation will take
      place on the basis of safety assessments in sequential cohorts of 3 subjects each. The
      initial cohort will receive 120 mg/m2/day for 3 days. For Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, dose
      escalation will occur in 30-mg/m2/day increments until subjects are enrolled at a
      240-mg/m2/day dose. For Cohorts 6, 7, and 8, dose escalation will occur in 60-mg/m2/day
      increments until subjects are enrolled at a maximum dose of 420 mg/m2/day. Thus subsequent
      cohorts will receive 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, and up to a maximum of 420 mg/m2/day for 3
      days in the absence of safety concerns.

      In each cohort during the dose escalation phase, if 1 of the 3 subjects experiences a DLT,
      the cohort of subjects at that dose level will be expanded to 6 subjects. If at least 2 of
      the 6 subjects experience a DLT, this will be considered a toxic dose and the next 3 subjects
      will be treated at a lower dose. The dose will be de-escalated in 30-mg/m2/day increments. As
      such, if at least 2 out of 6 subjects receiving 300, 360, or 420 mg/m2/day experience a DLT,
      the next 3 subjects will receive 270, 330, or 390 mg/m2/day, respectively. The MTD is defined
      as the highest dose of L-Annamycin at which fewer than 2 (of a cohort of up to 6) subjects
      experience a DLT.

      Once the MTD/RP2D is identified, up to 21 additional subjects will be enrolled at the
      MTD/RP2D to better define toxicity and evaluate efficacy at this dose.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML by World Health Organization
             classification.

          2. Subjects have AML that has relapsed after standard induction therapy (i.e., subjects
             relapsed after experiencing a CR with their prior therapy). To be defined as relapse,
             there must be &gt;5% blasts in the bone marrow.

          3. For the expansion phase only, the subjects' AML must have relapsed after first-line
             therapy that included an anthracycline.

          4. Subjects are age ≥18 years at the time of signing informed consent.

          5. Subjects have not received chemotherapy, radiation, or major surgery within 2 weeks
             prior to first dose of study drug and/or have recovered from the toxic side effects of

               3. Adequate renal function with creatinine levels ≤2 times the upper limit of

               1. Sexually active, fertile women must use 2 effective forms of contraception
                  (abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or double barrier device)
                  from the time of informed consent and until at least 6 months after discontinuing
                  study drug.

               2. Sexually active men and their sexual partners must use effective contraceptive
                  methods from the time of subject informed consent and until at least 3 months
                  after discontinuing study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects have been diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia or have primarily
             refractory AML.

          2. The subjects are receiving concomitant therapy that includes other chemotherapy that
             is or may be active against AML, except for hydroxyurea, up to Day 1 of L-Annamycin
             administration.

          3. Subjects have any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the
