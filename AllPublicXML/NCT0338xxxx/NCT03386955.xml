  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has the highest incidence rate in China and is also a very common cancer in the
      world. BPI-7711 is a new drug developed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK profile of BPI-7711. The
      first part of the study will recruit 3~6 patients for different dose levels to evaluate
      safety. The dose will increase from the lowest level. The second part of the study is the
      dose expansion. Once efficacy is observed in the dose increasing process, additional 20~30
      patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy. A recommended dose
      will be selected for Phase II study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study, including phase I (a &quot;dose escalation&quot; part and a
      &quot;dose extension&quot; part) and phase IIa.

      Dose escalation: on the basis of the traditional &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation plan; single dose PK
      test is added. The subjects of each dose group will first be given a single dose, and blood
      samples be collected for PK analysis. 7 days (wash-out period) after single dose delivery, an
      additional 21 days of continuous multiple dose delivery will be given as a treatment cycle to
      evaluate the dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The initial dose will be 30 mg once a day. In the
      initial dose group, the second subject will be enrolled and administered with the study drug
      7 days after the first dosing (single dose) to the first subject. If there is no occurrence
      of serious or unexplainable safety event, the subsequent following-up subjects will be
      enrolled and receive the dose. If suspected safety event occurs, the investigator will
      discuss with the sponsor whether to delay dose delivery to the following-up subjects of the
      said group.

      Every dose escalation group will enroll 3 to 6 subjects. Dose adjustment will be based on the
      following scheme:

        -  If there is 0 case of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group in the first treatment
           cycle, then the treatment dose of the subsequent 3 patients will be increased to level
           2.

        -  If there is 1 case of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group in the first treatment
           cycle, then additional 3 patients will be enrolled in the group and accept the level 1
           dose treatment.

             -  If there is 0 case of DLT in the 3 new subjects, the dose will be increased to
                level 2.

             -  If there is ≥1 case of DLT in the 3 new subjects, the principal investigator and
                the sponsor will discuss to determine the next step dose scheme.

        -  If there are ≥2 cases of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group, the principal
           investigator and the sponsor will meet to discuss the alternative dose delivery scheme.

      The same dose escalation rules shall be applicable to the following dose groups. Based on
      available tolerance, safety, and PK data, recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be selected.

      Dose extension group: If a certain dose is found to be safe and effective, dose expansion
      will be initiated and about 20-30 subjects will be enrolled into that dose level. There will
      be no DLT evaluation for subjects of the dose extension study.

          -  Phase I: Disease progressed after EGFR-TKI treatment as proved by radiological
             evidence. For dose level which does not provide satisfying efficacy in the escalation
             group, patients must receive chemo therapy before enrolled into that dose, unless not
             suitable for chemotherapy judged by investigator. Patients must have documented
             radiological progression before enrolled into the study. Phase IIa: Patients must be
             treatment- naïve for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Prior adjuvant and

             1 measurable lesion, the baseline CT must be performed before biospy or at least 14
             days after biopsy. The lesion received radiotherapy does not count as measurable
             lesion or a biopsy lesion unless it shows obvious progression after radiotherapy.
             Brain metastases and irradiated lesions are not taken as target lesions.

          -  Prior to enrollment, a central laboratory testing report confirmed the tumor has EGFR
             positive gene mutation sensitive to EGFR-TKI treatment (including G719X, exon 19 loss,

                  with heparin anticoagulant therapy, if these indicators have no abnormality, and
                  then they can be enrolled. For subjects who are receiving warfarin anticoagulant
                  therapy, within 28 days before enrolled into the study, relating to INR, use
