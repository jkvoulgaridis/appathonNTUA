      The purpose of the pre-study screening is to test for DNA abnormalities or biomarkers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This testing will be done on a samples of blood to see whether or not patients are eligible
      to take part in one of the sub-studies. Each study will be looking at what effects a new drug
      or drugs has on prostate cancer and will also be looking at the side effects of treatment.
      The purpose of the main studies is to see if the biomarkers that were identified screening
      samples can help predict which patients are most likely to be helped by that drug or drugs
      and to see how the cancer cells respond to treatment.

             is not listed, must be discussed and approved with CCTG prior to registration).
             Consult substudies for additional criteria

          -  Prior cytotoxic therapy: Patients may have received cytotoxic therapy in the castrate
             sensitive setting as well as up to 1 regimen of cytotoxic therapy in the CRPC setting

          -  Longest of one of the following:

               -  Standard cycle length of standard therapies;

               -  Two weeks;

               -  The longer of 30 days or 5 half-lives for investigational agents;

          -  Patients must have discontinued anti-androgens for at least 4 weeks prior to substudy
             entry/enrollment (at least 6 weeks for bicalutamide).

          -  LHRH agonist therapy must continue unless surgically castrated. Note: after
             discussion, CCTG selected patients may be screened prior to adequate washout.

          -  Patient must have progressed (biochemically or radiologically, as defined in 4.1.4)
             during or after their last systemic therapy

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered enrolled
             on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies
             there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving
             distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial.

          -  Investigators must assure themselves the patients enrolled on this trial will be
             available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, response
             assessment and follow-up.

          -  Patients must agree to return to their primary care facility for any adverse events,
             which may occur through the course of the trial.

             of patient enrollment.

          -  Men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective contraceptive
             method during study drug treatment for 6 months after stopping treatment and should
             not father a child or donate sperm during this period.

          -  In addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes
             heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect
             of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or
             bilateral tubal ligation, or vasectomy / vasectomized partner. However, if at any
             point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the
             time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma
