  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The congestive heart failure (HF) is a condition associated with substantial morbidity,
      mortality, and high healthcare expenditures. From the pathophysiological standpoint, several
      mechanisms contribute to the progression and dysfunction of the failing heart such as an
      increased hemodynamic overload, impaired myocyte calcium cycling, upregulated apoptotic
      activity, deficient or increased production of extracellular matrix, genetic predilections
      and, finally, excessive neurohumoral stimulation. The vasoactive neurohumoral systems such as
      sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and arginine
      vasopressin (AVP) system all play a role in maintaining volume and circulatory homeostasis in
      the situation of impaired cardiac output.

      Catestatin (CST), on another hand, is a novel endogenous peptide cleaved from chromogranin A
      (CgA) that is involved in the regulation of cardiac function and arterial blood pressure. The
      role of this peptide is to elicit potent catecholamine release-inhibitory activity by acting
      at the level of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Therefore, the main hypothesis of this
      study is that the observed serum CST levels will reflect the degree of neurohormonal
      activation in HF, showing a significant relationship with the degree of disease severity as
      measured by relevant functional classifications (such as NYHA class and/or similar).
      Secondly, investigators expect to detect correlation of catestatin serum levels with the
      established risk stratification scores in HF and with the echocardiographic parameters of the
      ventricular function, both in terms of systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Parameters of
      inflammation, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnI, renal function parameters, and basic
      hematologic/biochemistry indices from peripheral blood will also be obtained and analyzed for
      all study participants.

      Furthermore, according to the latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the
      diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF, participants with established congestive HF
      and the whole spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions ranging from &lt;40% to ≥50% will
      be included in the study.

      Finally, all echocardiographic and laboratory parameters obtained from peripheral blood will
      be recorded and compared with respective healthy and matched control participants while
      participants diagnosed with HF will additionally be analyzed for potential differences
      between subgroups of interest.

    <description>The goal is to determine and compare serum catestatin levels in patients with congestive heart failure, stratified by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in three groups: reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF). Furthermore, catestatin plasma levels will be compared between patients with congestive heart failure and healthy volunteers.</description>

Patients with a clinically documented diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), as assessed per New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification will be prospectively and consecutively enrolled in this group. Patients will be of both sexes, enrolled in 1:1 ratio.
All subjects in this group will undergo blood withdrawal for laboratory analysis, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination and will be treated with the Standard-of-care treatment according to their current clinical condition at admission.</description>
