  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preserving kidney function and improving the transition from CKD to End stage renal disease
      (ESRD) is a research and healthcare challenge. The Chronic Kidney Disease-Renal Epidemiology
      and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort was established to identify the determinants,
      biomarkers and practice patterns associated with chronic kidney disease outcomes. The study
      includes 3,033 adult patients with moderate to advanced CKD from a representative sample of
      40 nephrology clinics in France with respect to regions and legal status. Patients are
      recruited during a routine visit and followed up for 5 years, before and after starting renal
      replacement therapy. Patient-level clinical, biological, and lifestyle data are collected
      annually, as well as provider-level data on clinical practices, coordinated with the
      International Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Pattern Study (CKDopps). Blood and
      urine samples are stored in a biobank. The overall objective is to develop a research
      platform to address key questions regarding the determinants and biomarkers associated with
      adverse outcomes in CKD and to assess its effective management. It has the following
      hypotheses and specific aims:

        1. to evaluate a large set of social, environmental, bioclinical, and genetic factors, and
           their interactions in relation with CKD outcomes including progression to ESRD,
           mortality, metabolic and vascular complications, and the onset of a number of chronic
           and acute events;

        2. to assess several new biomarkers to predict adverse outcomes of CKD and its
           complications;

        3. to evaluate the associations of provider practices (management of hypertension, anemia,
           nutritional abnormalities, mineral and bone disorder, nutritional status, timing of
           dialysis initiation and transplant wait-listing) with achievement of clinical practice
           guidelines, clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PRO).

        4. to evaluate the associations of health care organization and clinic services (e.g., for
           nutrition, educational programs) with clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and
           achievement of clinical practice guidelines;

        5. to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of different provider practices and clinic
           services.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All cohort participants are assessed annually for at least 5 years, until 6 months after the
      start of renal replacement therapy.

      Each year, data are collected from both medical records and patients interview and
      self-administrated questionnaires are asked to report clinical events.

      Interviews and routine biological measurements are repeated annually.

      CKD-REIN is funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche through the 2010
      'Cohortes-Investissements d'Avenir' programme and by the 2010 national Programme Hospitalier
      de Recherche Clinique.

      CKD-REIN is also supported through a public-private partnership with Amgen, Fresenius Medical
      Care, and GlaxoSmithKline since 2012; Baxter and MerckSharp&amp;Dohme-Chibret (France) from 2012
      to 2017; LillyFrance since 2013; Otsuka Pharmaceutical since 2015; Vifor Fresenius since
      2017; AstraZeneca since 2018; and Sanofi-Genzyme from 2012 to 2015.

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The French translation of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (Version 2.0) is used to gather information on the time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity and in sedentary behavior. The GPAQ contains 16 items designed to assess the frequency and duration of physical activity in 3 domains: during work, transportation, and leisure time as well as time spent sitting during a typical week. It distinguishes physical activity duration by min/day and min/week for each physical activity domain, which allows for calculating the energy expenditure scored in metabolic equivalent tasks (METs). According to duration and energy expenditure, physical activity level was classified as low, moderate, and high.</description>
