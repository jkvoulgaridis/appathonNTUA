  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversies exist about the best treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.
      Adding screws in fractured segment has been proved in many literatures that can improve
      construct stiffness but sometimes aggravate the trauma of fractured vertebra. Therefore, we
      are eager to find an optimized placement of two additional pedicle screws at the fracture
      level for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. This is the first randomised
      controlled study investigating efficacy of diverse orders of pedicle screws placement and
      will provide recommendations for treating patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A blinded randomised controlled trial (blinding for the patient and statistician, rather than
      for the clinician and researcher) will be conducted. A total of seventy patients with single
      thoracolumbar AO type A3 or A4 fractures who are candidates for application of short-segment
      pedicle screws of fractured vertebrae will be randomly allocated to either the DS group
      (distraction-screws ) or the SD group (screws-distraction) at a ratio of 1: 1. The primary
      clinical outcome measures are compression ratio of anterior border of vertebral body height,
      depth of nail into injured vertebrae and kyphosis (Cobb) angle. Secondary clinical outcome
      measures are complications, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of back and leg pain, neurological
      function, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA)
      scores and Oswestry Disability Index. These parameters will be evaluated preoperatively,
      intraoperatively, on day 3 postoperatively and then at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
      postoperatively.
