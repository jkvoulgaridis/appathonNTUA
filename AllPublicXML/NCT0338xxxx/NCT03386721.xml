  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, basket trial Phase II study to evaluate the antitumor
      activity of RO6874281 in combination with atezolizumab in participants with advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors. Currently the focus is on patients with Head and Neck, oesophageal
      and cervical cancers with confirmed squamous cell carcinoma histology type.
