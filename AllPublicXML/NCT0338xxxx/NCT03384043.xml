  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition for patients and their caregivers marked by
      hallmark cognitive symptoms (e.g., memory loss) as well as an impact on quality of life.
      Researchers and clinicians are learning that a specific type of memory, called prospective
      memory, may be particularly affected in mild Alzheimer's disease. Prospective memory is
      memory for future intentions, goals, and chores, and the loss of the neurocognitive processes
      supporting prospective memory may reduce independent functioning (e.g., medication
      adherence). The current study investigates a technology-based intervention to assist
      participants with their daily prospective memory tasks. Participants with mild cognitive
      impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease will be trained to use a smartphone for four weeks.
      Smartphone acceptability, usability, and overall user experience will be measured.
      Furthermore, participants will be tested on completion of daily prospective memory tasks. In
      one group, participants will train to use the smartphone personal assistant reminder system,
      which reminds participants of their goals, tasks, and chores at the appropriate time or
      location. In a comparison group, participants will also carry a smartphone but will train to
      use a memory strategy in which they verbalize external cues to remind them to perform their
      goals, tasks, and chores. The goal of this research is to inform whether smartphone
      technology or a memory strategy can be used to reduce memory burden and improve daily,
      independent functioning in participants with mild Alzheimer's disease.

In the current study, participants will press a button and verbally state &quot;Cortana, I need to remember to...&quot; for time--based tasks (&quot;...take my medicine at 7pm&quot;) and event--based tasks (&quot;pick-up milk at the grocery store).</description>

In the current study, participants will verbally specify an external cue in a &quot;When…then&quot; format and record doing so using the smartphone's voice recorder app. They will use the implementation intention strategy for time--based tasks (&quot;When it is 7pm, then I will remember to take my medicine&quot;), and event--based tasks (&quot;When I am at the grocery store, then I will remember to pick--up milk).</description>

    <description>Electronic memory aids (e.g., pagers) are known to support memory for goals and intentions (prospective memory) in individuals with cognitive impairment. Smartphone technology has the potential to enhance the benefits of previous electronic memory aids because they can provide reminders not only at the correct time, but also at the correct location.</description>

             BSWH Temple region, or neuropsychology office visit in the RR BSWH region within 12
             months of the study contact (Specific ICD Codes outlined below).

          -  Interest in participating in research

          -  Able and willing to bring a legally authorized representative (spouse or medical power
             of attorney) to initial training session.

          -  Able to independently consent according to the results of a structured capacity to
             consent interview OR is interested after going through the consent process but does
             not pass capacity to consent inventory AND has a legally authorized representative
             available to provide proxy consent.

          -  Presence of no more than mild dementia on the basis of telephone administered
             cognitive screening instrument (TICS-M) &amp; Collateral/Informant ADL Measure

             o Using the TICS-M and published normative data, all subjects must have scores that
             are around -1 to -2 standard deviations for demographically corrected norms (National
             Institute of Aging-Alzheimer's Association recommended criteria for the very mild to
             mild stages of Alzheimer's disease; Albert et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011).

          -  Etiology of the dementia or MCI can be varied or unknown at the time of the screening
             criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of severe cognitive impairment defined by a TICS-M score &lt;-2 standard
             deviations from the mean.

          -  Semi-structured telephone clinical interview and/or chart review suggest:

               -  Serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar, or depression with suicidal
                  ideation in the last 30 days) are present and significantly contributing to the
                  current presentation

               -  Uncorrected hearing loss, visual loss, or motoric dysfunction would preclude
                  using the smartphone.

          -  English language proficiency (whether due to English as a second language or the
             presence of aphasia) significantly interferes with completion of telephone screening
             procedures or would be clinically suspected to interfere with completion of the study
             process.
