      The investigators will study the effect of pulmonary arterial vasodilation to see if it
      eliminates indices of persistent lung injury in smokers that are susceptible to emphysema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if smoking cessation combined with
      sildenafil, an FDA approved drug for pulmonary hypertension, will decrease inflammation in
      the lung. Even if a smoker stops smoking, the harmful effects caused by previous smoking may
      recruit inflammatory cells to those affected areas, leading to lung injury. In about 30-40%
      of smokers, this inflammation combined with irregular blood flow in the lungs may lead to
      emphysema. The study goal is to measure and compare individual responses to smoking
      cessation, Sildenafil and placebo used three times per day, and imaging of the lungs using
      non-contrast and contrast CT scans to see if there is a possible decrease of inflammation and
      an increase of blood flow in the lungs. The study also intends to see if using Sildenafil
      three times per day, in addition to smoking cessation will restore blood flow to the possible
      injured areas of the lungs. Sildenafil is an FDA approved medication for pulmonary
      hypertension but will be used off-label to study the effects it may or may not have on the
      blood flow in possible injured areas of the lungs. Non-smokers will be enrolled to compare
      lung imaging and the effects of Sildenafil on their lungs with that of smokers undergoing a
      smoking cessation program with placebo or Sildenafil. Non-smokers will complete identifical
      measurements as smokers, with Sildenafil used three times per day or no medication across a
      similar 90 day period of time. Vascular measurements of pulse wave velocity, carotid artery
      compliance/stiffness and pressure wave reflection will be done at baseline and 90 day visits.

    <description>80 normal smokers will be recruited (defined by Pulmonary Function Tests, questionnaires and interviews), between the ages of 25 and 65 will be studied to assess inflammation and heterogeneity of Perfused Blood Volume prior to and following a 3 month smoking cessation program. In 40 of the 80 subjects during the smoking cessation program, we will provide three times per day Sildenafil 20 milligrams (MG) (Viagra) for the full 3 months of the smoking cessation period. We select a three-month cessation program to maximize the likelihood of compliance with cessation yet providing enough time for a resolution of lung injury to take place. Pulse wave velocity, carotid artery compliance and stiffness and pressure wave reflection will be measured.</description>
