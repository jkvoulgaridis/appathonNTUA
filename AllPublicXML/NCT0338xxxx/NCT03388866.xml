  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease, prevalent between 1
      and 20% in the world population, with a predominance of childhood, but which may be present
      in adult life. AD results from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental
      factors, with the presence of a defect in the skin barrier and deregulation of the immune
      response, culminating in an inflammatory response in the skin predominantly type 2. Disease
      control is based on restoring skin hydration, smoothing itching and controlling the process
      specific sensitizing agents such as inhalant allergens and foods that may pathogenesis of the
      disease. In selected patients who present IgE mediated response to inhalant allergens,
      allergen-specific immunotherapy can be effective. Classically, the subcutaneous route is the
      most used, however, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used in increasing form. There
      are still few studies on the efficacy and safety of SLIT in atopic dermatitis. Therefore, the
      present study aims to to investigate the role of SLIT in the management of patients with AD
      allergic mites, through a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 94 patients, 3 years of age or older, with clinical diagnosis of AD, without
      distinction of gender, ethnicity or social group, will be selected at HCFMRP-USP Allergy and
      Dermatology outpatient clinics. These patients will undergo clinical evaluation and
      laboratory tests, including blood count, total IgE, inhalant panel specific IgE, and
      immediate hypersensitivity skin tests, and mite allergen-specific IgG4 (Der p 1 and Der p 2),
      before of the study. To calculate the sample size, a response rate to the medication was
      defined as a 15 - point decrease in SCORAD (a score that includes lesion extent, intensity
      and subjective symptoms such as pruritus and sleep), which was determined through the
      experience of the service. It was estimated that 40% of the patients in the treatment group
      and 15% of the placebo group reached the proposed rate through a test with 80% power, and the
      need for 47 individuals in each group was defined.

      Patients in the treatment group will undergo allergen-specific immunotherapy sublingually,
      with weekly doses of extracts of mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides
      farinae (60% and 40% respectively), according to the scheme described in Tables 1 and 2.
      Patients in the control group will be submitted to the same administration schedule, but with
      the diluent of the allergenic extract (doubly distilled water solution and glycerin).
      Patients will be divided into groups according to randomization.

      Subjects will be randomly divided into blocks of random size 4 or 6 and stratified according
      to age (less than 12 years and greater / equal 12 years) and severity (SCORAD less than 50
      and greater / equal 50), performed by through the RedCap platform, available at FMRPUSP. This
      process will be performed by laboratory staff who will provide the extracts and the
      researchers will not have access to the lists of patients in each group. As for blinding, the
      bottles with extract and placebo will be provided by the already coded laboratory, and the
      team will only be responsible for the delivery and storage of the same.

      Individuals will be selected during the SCORAD, of the outpatient clinics of the Allergy and
      Dermatology Service of the HCFMRP-USP. All medical records and clinical and dermatological
      examination will be recorded in medical records, as well as clinical evaluation by SCORAD ,
      quality of life questionnaire and personal scale of symptoms, being evaluated at the
      beginning of treatment, after two, three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen and eighteen months of
      evolution.

      Serum levels of IgG4 specific mite for Der p 1 and Der p 2 will be determined by ImmunoCAP
      and evaluated at the beginning and the end of treatment. Interleukins 4, 5, 9, 10 13, 17,
      TNFα, TGFβ and interferon-γ will be performed in plasma in the beginning, with 9 months of
      evolution and at the end of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measures at baseline and after 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD is calculated using the extent of the injury, intensity and subjective symptoms, the formula used for the calculation is A / 5 + 7B / 2 + C (A - extent B - intensity C-subjective symptoms). The extent can vary from zero to 100, applying the nine rule also used in large burned patients. The intensity varies from zero to 18, divided into six items, including erythema, edema, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness. Subjective symptoms range from zero to 30 evaluated by means of analog pruritus scale and sleep.
The SCORAD severity rating is:
0-20 mild 20-40 moderate &gt; 40 severe
Based on our clinical experience, it was decided to consider as the main outcome a 15-point decrease in SCORAD,in any degree of severity, in 40% of subjects in the treatment group and 15% in the placebo group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>EASI is based on the extension and severity of Atopic Dermatitis. To obtain EASI, the proportion of body areas are taken into consideration, with head being equivalent to 10%, trunk 30%, upper extremities 20% and lower extremities 40%. The percentage of involvement of these four regions is determined using a scale of 0 to 6. Clinical signs including erythema, infiltration and/or papulation, excoriation, and lichenification are evaluated each on a scale of 0 to 3.
Final score is calculated using the formula below. Severity is classified as: 0 = clear; 0.1 - 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1-7.0 = mild; 7.1-21.0 = moderate; 21.1-50.0 = severe; 50.1-72.0 = very severe. Any reduction in the EASI score will be accepted as a positive outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IGA (Investigator Global Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>3,6,9,12,15 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>IGA consists of evaluation of the severity of Atopic Dermatitis considering the inflammatory signs of the disease (erythema, papulation and infiltration). IGA is calculated according to the following scale: clear; almost clear; mild disease; moderate disease; severe disease; and very severe disease.
Any reduction in the IGA score will be accepted as a positive outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12,15 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a questionnaire of 10 questions used to measure how much skin problems affect patient´s life in the past seven days.
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much, score of 3; A lot, score of 2; A little, score of 1; Not at all, score of 0; Not relevant, score of 0. Question 7, 'prevented work or studying', score of 3. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score for each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
How to interpret meaning of DLQI scores:
0 - 1 no effect at all on patient's life; 2 - 5 small effect on patient's life; 6 - 10 moderate effect on patient's life; 11 - 20 very large effect on patient's life; 21 - 30 extremely large effect on patient's life.
The decrease of 4 or more points in DLQI is a secondary outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analog Visual Scale of Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12,15 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The analog visual scale consists of three questions that can be answered using a scale of 0 to 10, as described below:
How much your skin itched last week? How much your skin peeled last week? How atopic dermatitis interfered with last week's sleep? Any reduction in the analog visual scale will be accepted as a positive outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pruritus scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will provide information on their perception of pruritus in their daily life. The evaluation is subjective, varying from absence of pruritus to severe pruritus.
Any reduction in the Pruritus scale will be accepted as a positive outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IgG4 antibodies to mite allergens Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 10</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>It has been consistently shown that both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy increase levels of specific IgG4 antibodies. Therefore, we expect to find an increase in levels of IgG4 to mite allergens at the end of treatment. IgG4 specific to Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 10 can be measured by ImmunoCAP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific IgE antibodies to purified allergens and to Staphylococcal allerg</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>IgE antibodies to a panel of purified allergens will be assessed by ImmunoCAP and ImmunoCAP-ISAC, including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergens rDer p1, rDer p 2 e rDer p 10. In addition, levels of specific IgE to Staphylococcal enterotoxins, including enterotoxins A, B, C and TSST, will be determined in patients' sera before and after treatment. It is expected that levels of IgE antibodies to mite allergens and to Staphylococcal enterotoxins will be decreased at the end of treatment</description>
