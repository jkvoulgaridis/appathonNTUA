  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in collaboration with Propeller Health has developed a sensor, which
      can clip on to the ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI) and monitor the time and date that the
      ELLIPTA DPI cover is fully opened and closed. Additionally, a sensor will be attached to the
      rescue medication metered dose inhaler (MDI). The data from both sensors will be fed back to
      the subject via an application (app) on smart phone and will be reviewed by the subject's
      health care professional (HCP) via an online dashboard. The sensors, app, dashboard and
      systems to provide data comprise the CIS. This study will be the first to evaluate the effect
      of CIS on adherence to maintenance therapy in subjects with uncontrolled asthma. This is an
      open-label, randomized, parallel group study in asthmatic subjects currently on a fixed dose
      inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) maintenance therapy. Eligible
      subjects will receive RELVAR®/BREO® maintenance therapy via ELLIPTA DPI and salbutamol rescue
      medication via MDI with sensors attached to both inhalers during the run-in period, which may
      last for up to 3 months. Eligible subjects will then be randomized into five treatment arms
      depending on whether the data, from RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA or RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA and salbutamol
      MDI, is fed back to the subject or subject and HCP, or not at all. The treatment period for
      the study is approximately 6 months and there will be a follow-up period one week post last
      visit. The total duration of a subject in the study will be approximately 9 months. RELVAR,
      BREO and ELLIPTA are registered trademarks of GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

    <time_frame>Month 4 to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Daily adherence is defined as the participant taking one dose of Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA, within a 24-hour period, starting at 12.00 anti-meridiem (a.m.) each day of the treatment period. The percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken were determined by the clip-on sensor attached to ELLIPTA, which records the time and date when the ELLIPTA cover was opened and closed. Analysis was carried out by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Least Square mean percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily adherence) between Months 4 and 6 was determined by the maintenance sensor daily adherence over the last three months of the study period (between months 4 to 6). The daily adherence to ELLIPTA maintenance therapy when both the participant and the HCP were supplied with data from the maintenance sensor (Cohort 1) versus no data supplied to the participant or HCP (Cohort 5) is summarized.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a validated self-completed questionnaire utilizing 5 questions to assess asthma control on a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 1 (not controlled at all) to 5 (completely controlled). Total score is calculated as the sum of the scores from the 5 questions and can range from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating better control. An ACT total score of 5 to 19 suggests that the participant's asthma is unlikely to be well controlled, whilst a score of 20 to 25 suggests that the participant's asthma is likely to be well controlled. Baseline value was the latest assessment prior to randomization (Day 1, pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Cohort 1: Data on Maintenance Use Supplied to Par and HCP</title>
          <description>Eligible participants received Relvar/Breo maintenance therapy at doses of 100/25 microgram (mcg) or 200/25 mcg per actuation administered via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI), one inhalation once daily. Participants also received salbutamol rescue medication at dose of 100 mcg per actuation administered via metered dose inhaler (MDI), as and when required. Sensors were attached to both the inhalers to electronically record actuation data. Information from sensor attached to Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA was fed back to the participant via an application on smart phone and to the participant's healthcare professional (HCP) via an online dashboard.</description>

        <description>Daily adherence is defined as the participant taking one dose of Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA, within a 24-hour period, starting at 12.00 anti-meridiem (a.m.) each day of the treatment period. The percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken were determined by the clip-on sensor attached to ELLIPTA, which records the time and date when the ELLIPTA cover was opened and closed. Analysis was carried out by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Least Square mean percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily adherence) between Months 4 and 6 was determined by the maintenance sensor daily adherence over the last three months of the study period (between months 4 to 6). The daily adherence to ELLIPTA maintenance therapy when both the participant and the HCP were supplied with data from the maintenance sensor (Cohort 1) versus no data supplied to the participant or HCP (Cohort 5) is summarized.</description>

        <title>Percentage of ELLIPTA Doses Taken (Daily Adherence) Between Month 1 and Month 3 as Determined by the Maintenance Sensor</title>
        <description>Daily adherence is defined as the participant taking one dose of Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA, within a 24-hour period, starting at 12.00 a.m. each day of the treatment period. The percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken were determined by the clip-on sensor attached to ELLIPTA, which records the time and date when the ELLIPTA cover was opened and closed. Least Square mean percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily adherence) between Months 1 and 3 was determined by the maintenance sensor daily adherence. The effect on daily adherence to maintenance therapy when maintenance data was supplied to both the participant and the HCP (Cohort 1), maintenance data was only supplied to participants (Cohort 2), rescue and maintenance data were supplied to participant and HCP (Cohort 3), and rescue and maintenance data only supplied to participant (Cohort 4) versus no data supplied to the participant or HCP (Cohort 5) is summarized.</description>

          <title>Number of Doses of Rescue Medication Use Between Month 4 and Month 6 as Determined by the Rescue Medication Sensor</title>
          <description>Data for rescue medication use was collected by the clip-on sensor for salbutamol MDI which records time and date when the MDI was actuated. Total rescue use was determined by the rescue sensor records of date, time and number of inhaler actuations. The mean number of doses of rescue medicines between Months 4 and 6 when maintenance data was supplied to both the participant and the HCP (Cohort 1); maintenance data was only supplied to participants (Cohort 2); rescue and maintenance data were supplied to participant and HCP (Cohort 3) and rescue and maintenance data only supplied to participant (Cohort 4) versus no data supplied to the participant or HCP (Cohort 5) is summarized.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Total Score</title>
        <description>The ACT is a validated self-completed questionnaire utilizing 5 questions to assess asthma control on a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 1 (not controlled at all) to 5 (completely controlled). Total score is calculated as the sum of the scores from the 5 questions and can range from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating better control. An ACT total score of 5 to 19 suggests that the participant's asthma is unlikely to be well controlled, whilst a score of 20 to 25 suggests that the participant's asthma is likely to be well controlled. Baseline value was the latest assessment prior to randomization (Day 1, pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Increase From Baseline &gt;=3 in ACT Total Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>The ACT is a validated self-completed questionnaire utilizing 5 questions to assess asthma control on a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 1 (not controlled at all) to 5 (completely controlled). Total score is calculated as the sum of the scores from the 5 questions and can range from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating better control. An ACT total score of 5 to 19 suggests that the participant's asthma is unlikely to be well controlled, whilst a score of 20 to 25 suggests that the participant's asthma is likely to be well controlled. Baseline value was the latest assessment prior to randomization (Day 1, pre-dose). Percentage of participants with an increase from Baseline &gt;=3 in ACT total score at Month 6 is presented.</description>
