      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested to treat
      negative symptoms in participants who have schizophrenia.

      The study will enroll approximately 234 participants. Participants will then be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups in the
      double-blind periodâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 50 mg once daily

        -  TAK-831 125 mg once daily

        -  TAK-831 500 mg once daily

        -  Placebo once daily

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic,
      Poland, Bulgaria and Ukraine. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately
      20 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed up for safety
      assessment 10 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 98).

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the PANSS NSFS at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Negative subscale consists of 7 items which assess the negative symptoms with sub scale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 28 and 56</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assesses the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Negative subscale consists of 7 items which assesses the negative symptoms with subscale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The BNSS is a 13-item instrument designed for use in clinical trials and other studies that measures 5 domains of negative symptoms: blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition. All the items in the BNSS are rated on a 7-point (0-6) scale, with anchor points generally ranging from the symptom's being absent (0) to severe (6). A scale total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; total score range of 0 to 78, where higher score indicates higher severity of negative symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Composite Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The BACS is specifically designed to measure treatment-related improvements in cognition and includes alternate forms. BACS is a reliable and sensitive measure of cognitive function in schizophrenia. The BACS is a cognition assessment battery that assesses 6 domains of cognitive function found to be consistently impaired in schizophrenia: verbal memory, working memory, motor speed, attention, executive functions, and verbal fluency. The primary measure from each test of the BACS is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia-Severity (CGI-SCH-S) Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SCH scale is an adapted version of the CGI scale that is designed to assess global illness status in participant's with schizophrenia. CGI-SCH-S is a 7-point scale that requires the investigator to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. A participant is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1. normal, not at all ill; 2. borderline ill; 3. mildly ill; 4. moderately ill; 5. markedly ill; 6. severely ill; or 7. extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Schizophrenia Improvement (CGI-SCH-I) Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SCH-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The investigator is required to assess the participant's condition relative to baseline on a 7-point scale where 1. very much improved; 2. much improved; 3. minimally improved; 4. no change; 5. minimally worse; 6. much worse; or 7. very much worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The SCoRS is an interview-based measure of cognitive functioning that is developed to specifically assess aspects of cognitive functioning in participants with schizophrenia. The items assess the 7 cognitive domains of attention, memory, reasoning and problem solving, working memory, processing speed, language functions, and social cognition. The SCoRS global total scores is the sum of the 20 items and it varies from 20 to 80 with 20 being the best outcome and 80 being the worst.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
