  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, comparative, controlled study. Penn
      Medicine Princeton Medical Center will enroll a total of 296 subjects (18 years or older) who
      are electing to have total knee or hip replacement surgery. Subjects will be randomized to
      either the treatment group (Health Partner alongside standard care) or the control group
      (standard care alone). Health Partner is a combination of a mobile application and a
      web-based portal. The primary objective is to compare care plan adherence (pre- and
      post-surgery) for Health Partner vs. control subjects. Secondary objectives include
      evaluating all-cause medical resource utilization, communication with health care provider,
      well-being, fear of surgery, confidence in recovery from surgery, sleep, and patient
      satisfaction for 90 days post-surgery.
