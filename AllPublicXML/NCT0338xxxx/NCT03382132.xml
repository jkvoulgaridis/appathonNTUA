  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if information and support provided with a
      mobile-delivered (via iPad) momHealth Teen Pregnancy Program can promote healthy choices and
      behaviors during and after pregnancy.

      This is a RCT to pilot test an innovative multiple health behavior intervention to influence
      three areas of health for pregnant and parenting adolescents: breastfeeding, healthy
      eating/active living, and depression prevention. Intervention and control groups will be
      compared in the main outcomes of the study (see 4.2.c. and 4.3). Beginning in the last eight
      weeks of pregnancy and extending to one month after giving birth, we use mobile health
      technology (e.g., iPad minis) to deliver multi-media educational modules, text-messaging,
      virtual home visits with professionals using secure televideo, and real-time peer group
      support over televideo. At birth, five weeks, and three months after giving birth,
      effectiveness of the program outcomes will be assessed and compared to a usual care control
      group and include breastfeeding/infant-feeding practices; healthy eating and physical
      activity; and depressive symptoms. This is the first known study to address these multiple
      behaviors simultaneously with pregnant and parenting adolescent women.
