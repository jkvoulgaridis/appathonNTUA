  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to adapt, pilot, and examine the credibility, acceptability, and
      feasibility of an evidence-based mind-body program, the Relaxation Response Resiliency
      Program for Chronic Pain (p3RP), and the p3RP-Digital Monitoring Device (p3RP-DMD), which is
      the p3RP integrated with a commercial DMD, the Fitbit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has three phases. In phase I, the investigators are adapting the 3RP as a
      multidisciplinary team, and then conducting two focus groups. In phase two, the investigators
      are piloting the p3RP and p3RP-DMD. In phase three, the investigators are conducting a small
      randomized-controlled trial of the p3RP versus p3RP-DMD.

    <description>The GetActive program uses a multimodal approach to introduce and reinforce new skills, including didactics, in-session activities, discussions, and weekly practice assignments (homework). The GetActive sessions reflect a purposeful integration of the three treatment approaches (relaxation methods, stress appraisal &amp; coping, and growth enhancement). The format is a 10-week program with weekly meetings and a focus on relaxation response strategies, cognitive behavioral training, positive psychology and mind-body interactions.</description>
