  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements and advances in pancreas surgery, about 30-35% of patients who have
      pancreas surgery develop a type of complication called a pancreatic fistula. A pancreatic
      fistula occurs when fluid produced by the pancreas leaks into the abdomen after pancreas
      surgery. Patients who develop a pancreatic fistula can have poor short-term and long-term
      consequences.We are studying the effect of a medical device named HEMOPATCH on the
      development and seriousness of pancreatic fistulas. HEMOPATCH is a thin, flexible bovine
      protein-based pad that may improve tissue sealing where it is applied during surgery. Some
      small studies called case studies of between 2 and 7 patients, and two clinical trials have
      shown that HEMOPATCH is effective at stopping bleeding and reducing drain output after some
      types of surgery. However, there have been no completed clinical trials using HEMOPATCH to
      prevent or reduce pancreatic fistulas in patients having pancreas surgery, so we don't know
      if it works in this setting. Health Canada has approved the use of HEMOPATCH as a device to
      stop bleeding or seal other bodily fluids for procedures in which the control of bleeding or
      leakage of other body fluids or air by standard surgical techniques are either ineffective or
      impractical.
