      The aim of our study is to assess three anticoagulation strategies for intermittent
      hemodialysis(IHD) in patients at risk of hemorrhage. A registry of consecutive hemodialysis
      patients with high risk of hemorrhage was conducted at the Guangdong General Hospital, the
      First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, the Second Affiliated
      Hospital of Guangzhou Medicine University or Guangzhou Hospital of Chinese Medicine, between
      Sep 10, 2017 and June 30th,2018. In this multi-center prospective and randomized study,
      participants were randomly divided into three groups during IHD according to different
      anticoagulation, including with regular saline flushes, one stage regional citrate
      anticoagulation (RCA) and two-stage RCA.

      Briefly, there are two parts in this study. The first part of the study is to compare
      two-stage RCA with one stage RCA during IHD, and the second part is to compare two-stage RCA
      with regular saline flushes, with estimated total procedures, 78 and 48, respectively. The
      primary outcome was measured as therapy interruption based on visible serious circuit
      clotting or persistent alarms such as venous pressure (&gt; 200 mmHg) or TMP(transmembrane
      pressures) (&gt; 300 mmHg). The secondary outcomes included circuit survival time, the total
      clotting score of ECC(extracorporeal circuit ) and urea clearance (Kt/V and URR). The total
      clotting score was the sum of the clotting scores for the venous expansion chamber, arterial
      expansion chamber, and dialyzer.
