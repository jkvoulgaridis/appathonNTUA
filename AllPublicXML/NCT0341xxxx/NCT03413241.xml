      The proposed project will be first performed on individuals with HF-ASD with their expected
      heterogeneity and healthy control (HC) subjects in order to explore the pain processing and
      modulation mechanisms underlying the pain sensitivity profile of adults with HF-ASD.
      Secondly, we will focus on individuals with ASD and HC, without ASR (ASD-nonASR, HC-nonASR)
      and with SHR (ASD-SHR, HC-SHR). This 2X2 factorial design will enable us to determine whether
      the feature of SHR in individuals with HF-ASD contributes to pain sensitivity. This research
      project will comprise of two sessions. Session I will include the following tests ADOS-2 for
      ASD diagnosing (only for individuals with ASD), intelligence quotation testing (IQ Wechsler
      Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence® - Second Edition (WASI®-II)107, serving for inclusion
      criteria. Session II will include familiarization with the researchers and lab, thermal
      detection threshold testing for small fiber abnormality identification since detection
      thresholds in some reports found to be abnormal pain threshold testing, and completion of
      questionnaires (see section 3.6 for details), psychophysical testing and EEG recordings in
      the following order: i) rEEG recordings; ii) psychophysical pain assessments; simultaneously
      with iii) neurophysiological pain assessments with pain EPs recorded. Our research protocol
      will be approved by the Helsinki Committee of the Rambam Health Care Center and The Chaim
      Sheba Medical Center.

      A dysregulation of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activity (i.e. an E/I
      imbalance) underlies ASD pathology. Neural hyper-responsiveness and impaired top-down
      modulation represent the E/I imbalance, underpinning the ASD clinical characteristics. One of
      the most frequent ASD characteristics is atypical sensory responsiveness, including
      exaggerated behavioral responses to sensory stimuli (i.e. sensory hyper-responsiveness). In
      healthy subjects, sensory hyper-responsiveness was found to be associated with pain
      hyper-sensitivity.This study project aims to study whether : (1) the individuals with ASD
      exhibit pain hyper-sensitivity, namely a pro-nociceptive profile, supported by the E/I
      imbalance. (2) the pain sensitivity will be positively associated with ASD clinical
      characteristics, and (3) sensory hyper-responsiveness will be found to be a contributing
      factor to pain hyper-sensitivity in ASD individuals.

      We will perform a multi-method, comprehensive psychophysical and neurophysiological
      evaluation of pain sensitivity along with self-reports of clinical characteristics, daily
      function, and quality of life. The participants will be high functioning ASD (HF-ASD)
      individuals (IQ &gt;80). Pain processing by means of pain hyperalgesia and pain inhibition
      capability, along with EEG activity at rest and in response to noxious stimuli (pain-evoked
      potentials), will be compared between ASD subjects and healthy controls. The best
      pain-related psychophysical and/or neurophysiological measures differentiating between groups
      will be tested for correlations with the ASD clinical characteristics. In order to test the
      contributing role of sensory hyper-responsiveness to pain sensitivity in ASD, the
      aforementioned psychophysical and neurophysiological evaluation will be performed in 4
      homogenous groups: ASD with and without sensory hyper-responsiveness, and controls with and
      without sensory hyper-responsiveness.
