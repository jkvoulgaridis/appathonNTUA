  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to study the effect of anthocyanins on the improvement of glucose and lipid
      metabolism, randomized intervention trials were conducted to compare the effects of
      anthocyanins on the improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism in different dose groups.To
      explore the best dose of anthocyanins for the prevention and treatment of anthocyanin
      metabolic diseases provide an important scientific basis.

    <textblock>
      In order to study the effect of anthocyanins on the improvement of glucose and lipid
      metabolism, randomized controlled trials were conducted to enrolled 300 patients with
      dyslipidemia. The subjects were divided into 0 mg / d, 40 mg / d, 80 mg / d, 320 mg/ d five
      dose groups, intervention for 12 weeks, comparing different doses of anthocyanins on glucose
      and lipid metabolism.To explore the best dose of anthocyanins for the prevention and
      treatment of anthocyanin metabolic diseases provide an important scientific basis.
