  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive mixed method pilot study to determine the feasibility of a tailored
      nurse-delivered telephone intervention designed to impact mucositis symptom severity and
      prevent dehydration in lung and head/neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation,
      therefore reducing overall symptom severity and improving quality of life. Secondary purposes
      for this study are to investigate if the nursing intervention can decrease lung and head/neck
      cancer patients' unscheduled medical visits between chemoradiation treatments.

    <measure>Change in severity of mucositis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mucositis severity will be measured daily by the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ).
A score of 0 equals no mucositis severity and high mucositis severity equals a score of 4 on question 2.</description>

    <measure>Change in overall symptom severity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Lung Cancer / Head &amp; Neck Cancer(MDASI-LC; MDASI-HN) will be used to measure overall severity.
The total MDASI-LC; HN score will be used in the analysis of overall symptom severity. Friedman's test is the test statistic that will be used to measure the effect of the intervention on overall symptom severity per cycle of chemoradiation treatment.</description>

    <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung and Head &amp; Neck versions (FACT-L; FACT-H&amp;N respectively ). The FACT-L &amp; FACT H&amp;N are both a five domain, 36 item self-report instrument scored on a 5 point Likert scale (zero to 4) with a score range of 0-144; the higher the score = higher HRQoL.</description>

    <measure>Influence of Nurse-Delivered Telephone Intervention on Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The adapted Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSES) was developed by combining the subscales of Manage Disease in General Scale and the Symptoms Scale for a combined 10 item scale to measure the concept of perceived self-efficacy. Each item is scored 0 to 8; with the higher combined sum score equating to a higher perceived self-efficacy in the participant.</description>

    <measure>Influence of Nurse-Delivered Telephone Intervention on Symptom Self-Management</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Partners in Health Scale (PIHS) was designed to measure adherence to treatment, knowledge of disease, management of side effects and management of signs and symptoms over time. The 12 item questionnaire scores each question among the domain categories on a 9 point scale from 0-8 and the higher sum score reflects a higher self-management in the participant.</description>

    <description>The Symptom Management Education and Nurse Coaching (SMENC) intervention is a one hour in-person face-to-face education session followed by twice weekly telephone calls conducted all throughout the patient's chemoradiation treatment regimen.
During the telephone call, the patient will report the use of the Drinks Diary.</description>

    <description>The registered nurse (RN) will teach good mouth care and management of sore mouth or throat (mucositis) symptoms to the patient for self-management at home. The RN will then call the patient twice every week to continue educating and coaching the patient about the mucositis self-management. The patient will receive the Symptom Management (SxM) Toolkit which is a written educational guide known as the &quot;Cancer Treatment Symptom Management Education Toolkit&quot; geared to help the patient manage their symptoms of sore mouth and throat at home in order to prevent dehydration.</description>
