  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, we will investigate short and long term outcomes after knee replacement
      surgery and identify preoperative and early postoperative factors associated with long term
      outcome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients follow the same fast-track program for elective knee replacement surgery at the
      Silkeborg Regional Hospital in Denmark, which includes detailed preoperative written
      information, multidisciplinary education course for patients and relatives, optimized
      multimodal pain treatment and early postoperative rehabilitation. Before the admission for
      surgery, patients will be asked to fulfill several questionnaires and baseline information
      regarding work situation, educational level and previous treatments. At two weeks there,
      there is a scheduled follow up by a physical therapist and a nurse at the hospital. At three
      months there is a scheduled follow up by telephone with a physical therapist.

      The study will adhere methodologically to the STROBE guidelines and checklist for prospective
      cohort studies (www.strobe-statement.org).

      Further description is provided elsewhere as eligibility criteria and outcome measures.

      Addition to the description:

      In March 2019 we decided to make a change in the baseline collection of relevant predictors
      for primary outcome. The reason for the change was to be able to answer more relevant
      scientific questions in the cohort study. We replaced &quot;The General Self-efficacy Scale&quot; with
      &quot;Pain Catastrophizing Scale&quot; and excluded &quot;The General Self-efficacy Scale&quot; from the 12 weeks
      follow-up collection of outcome measures.

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported Outcome Measure, that measures how patients experience pain. Pain catastrophizing is characterized by the tendency to magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus and to feel helpless in the presence of pain, as well as by a relative inability to prevent or inhibit pain-related thoughts in anticipation of, during, or following a painful event such as surgery for example. Each of the 13 questions is answered by ticking a box on a 5 point Likert Scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). A total score is yielded (ranging from 0-52 and 0 being the best), along with three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. The PCS is included in the data collection from March 2019 til end of the cohort study, which corresponds to about 950 patient responses (instead of The General Self-efficacy Scale)</description>
