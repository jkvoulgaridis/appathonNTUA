  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if an extract of cooked elderberries will help
      decrease the duration and severity of influenza symptoms in patients with confirmed
      influenza. Involvement in this study requires an initial patient screening at the time of
      their Emergency Department visit in order to confirm eligibility for the study. Once patients
      have been consented and enrolled as a participant, they will be randomized to take by mouth
      either Elderberry Extract or a placebo (a similar appearing and tasting liquid without
      elderberry) for a duration of 5 days. Study information regarding medication adherence, body
      temperature, symptoms, severity of symptoms, and any possible side effects will be collected
      from daily phone surveys conducted by the study coordinator. Participation in the study will
      end after at least 5 days once the patient has not had a temperature above 100Â°F and has had
      no influenza symptoms for at least 24 hours, or after 21 days in the study, whichever occurs
      first.

    <description>Symptoms will be recorded using the scoring system described in a meta-analysis of &quot;all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of oseltamivir treatment in adult influenza&quot; (BMJ 4/9/2014). &quot;The primary outcome will be time to alleviation of all symptoms. Seven influenza symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches and pains, fatigue, headaches, and chills or sweats)&quot; will be graded by severity as &quot;absent&quot; (0), &quot;mild&quot; (1), &quot;moderate&quot; (2), or &quot;severe&quot; (3). Alleviation will be defined to arise when all symptoms scored as absent or mild, and remain so for at least 21.5 hours.&quot;</description>
