  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to investigate the cardiac uptake of 89Zr-GSK2398852 in
      subjects with transthyretin cardiomyopathy amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), and its biodistribution to
      other organs. Low doses of GSK2398852 will be co-administered at levels not high enough for
      therapeutic benefit. This study will be conducted in two parts: Part A and Part B. Subjects
      in Part A will participate in up to two dosing sessions and subjects in Part B will
      participate in one dosing session. Subjects will undergo up to 3 PET scans at varying
      intervals after 89Zr-GSK2398852 administration. The total duration of study will be
      approximately 3 to 4 months for subjects in Part A and approximately 2 months for subjects in
      Part B. Part B of the study will be triggered based on data obtained in Part A and other
      emerging data.

            <description>Participants with either wild type or inherited ATTR-CM were included. In dosing session 1, participants were administered (dependent on renal function) 20 mg/hour or 10 mg/hour GSK2315698 for 48 hours by one intravenous infusion; followed by administration of 70 mg (session 1) GSK2398852 (unlabelled anti-SAP mAb) together with 10 mg of 89Zr-GSK2398852 (up to 37 megabecquerel of radioactive dose) via intravenous infusion on Day 3. Participants also received a subcutaneous injection of GSK2315698 60 mg thrice daily for up to 8 days after administration of unlabelled anti-SAP mAb dose. Up to 3 PET scans were performed after the end of 89Zr-GSK2398852 infusion.</description>

          <title>Part A- Session 1: Peak Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) in Focal Anatomical Regions of the Heart Following 80-200 mg Dose of Anti-SAP mAb</title>
          <description>SUV was measured radioactivity concentration corrected for radioactive decay and normalized for administered amount of radioactivity per body weight. SUV was analyzed for each region of interest such as blood pool left atrium, blood pool left ventricle, blood pool right ventricle, left ventricle wall - high uptake, left ventricle wall - low uptake, mid septum - high uptake and mid septum - low uptake. Peak SUV values derived from PET images has been presented. All treated population consisted of all participants who received at least one Anti-SAP treatment including 89Zr-GSK2398852.</description>
          <population>All treated Population. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</population>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils and Platelets. Baseline was considered as the latest pre-dose assessment prior to first administration of either study drug, i.e. GSK2315698 or anti-SAP mAb (labelled or unlabelled) (Day 1, Pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Part A: Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters: Erythrocytes, Reticulocytes</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: Erythrocytes and Reticulocytes. Baseline was considered as the latest pre-dose assessment prior to first administration of either study drug, i.e. GSK2315698 or anti-SAP mAb (labelled or unlabelled) (Day 1, Pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

In each dosing session, participants were administered (dependent on renal function) 20 mg per hour or 10 mg/hour GSK2315698 for 48 hours by one intravenous infusion; followed by administration of 70 mg (session1) or 490mg (session2) GSK2398852 (unlabelled anti-SAP mAb) together with 10 mg of 89Zr-GSK2398852 (up to 37 megabecquerel of radioactive dose) via two separate intravenous infusion on Day 3. Participants also received a subcutaneous injection of GSK2315698 60 mg thrice daily for up to 8 days after administration of unlabelled anti-SAP mAb dose. Up to 3 PET scans were performed after the end of 89Zr-GSK2398852 infusion. There was a minimum of 4 weeks of duration between dosing sessions of anti-SAP mAb.</description>
