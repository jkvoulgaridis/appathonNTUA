  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe the physiological effects of two different Semi-occluded vocal
      tract (SOVT) exercises in the larynx when they are executed by individuals with constant
      vocal effort and without vocal pathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SOVT is a voice education or rehabilitation method that involves different postures which
      partially occlude or elongate the vocal tract. It causes a change in the vibration pattern of
      the vocal folds. SOVT postures have been postulated to produce changes in contact quotient
      (CQ), measured with electroglottograph (EGG). This study aims to observe the physiological
      effects of two different SOVT exercises in larynx when they are executed by people with
      constant vocal effort and without vocal pathology. In order to do so, EGG will be performed
      before and after 43 volunteers execute two SOVT exercises (tongue trill and resonance tubes).
      The following parameter will be captured: CQ. A t-paired test will be performed to compare
      pre and post-test information. Furthermore, a generalized estimating equation will be fit to
      find the effects of each exercise in the subjects.

      This protocol was modified due to different administrative issues related to the use of the
      stroboscopy (one of the assesment tools previosly considered), so that stroboscopy was
      removed from the protocol.

    <description>43 participants will produce the vowel /a:/ three times as baseline during 5 seconds in habitual, comfortable speaking pitch and loudness. Thereafter, participants will produce series of a semi-occluded vocal tract exercises (resonance tube or lip trill). Afterwards, subjects will produce the vowel /a:/ three times once again. Electroglottographic signals will be captured before and after each exercise. A 15 minutes voice rest will be taken between exercises by all subjects.</description>

    <description>Participants will phonate into a tube (10cm length 4mm inner diameter) during 5 minutes. They will produce series of the vowel /u/ into the tube. They will be asked to maintain the same pitch and loudness as they did in the baseline samples. They will be perceptually controlled by experimenters. When performing the exercise, the participants will be instructed to phonate with ease voice and to sense vibrations in the anterior face and the mouth.</description>
