  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label, parallel-arm,
      blinded-analysis trial, the objective of which is to evaluate the effect of transmuscular
      quadratus lumborum block (TMQLB) in the pain relief and quality of recovery in laparoscopic
      renal surgery compared with thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB).

    <description>VAS is an internationally recognized pain scale with 11 points ranging from 0 to 10 points, with 0 defined as no pain and 10 defined as the worst pain imaginable. The VAS will be registered at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours after the surgery, and the primary outcome will be calculated as the mean VAS scores measured at these time point.</description>

    <description>QoR is a 15-item questionnaire which will score on a scale of 0-10 pertaining to patient's comfort, support system, pain, well-being, and ability to carry out daily activities, where 0 indicates none of the time and 10 indicates all of the time</description>

    <description>The patient is placed in the lateral position. The curved (C1-5) probe of Philip CX50 Ultrasound Scanner is used for scan and located vertical to the iliac crest at the posterior axillary line to find the Shamrock sign. The 22-G needle is then inserted in plane and directed to the QL muscle. After the proper position of the needle tip between the psoas major muscle and the quadratus lumborum muscle is confirmed, 0. 4 ml/kg 0.5% ropivacaine with 1: 200,000 adrenaline is injected into the interfascial plane.
Followed by IPCA in the first 48h after surgery: morphine boluses: 1.5-2 mg, lockout time :10 min, 1h limitation: 6-8 mg morphine.</description>

The 22-G needle is then inserted in plane and directed to the QL muscle. After the proper position of the needle tip between the psoas major muscle and the quadratus lumborum muscle is confirmed, 0. 6 ml/kg 0.5% ropivacaine with 1: 200,000 adrenaline is injected into the interfascial plane.

    <description>The patient is placed in the lateral position, the spinous processes of T10 are identified and marks are made 2cm lateral to the spinous processes. The linear(L12-3) probe of Philips CX50 is placed transversally at the mark to identify the paravertebral space. Then a 22-G needle is inserted in-plane from lateral to medial and advanced until the tip reached the paravertebral space surrounded by the parietal pleura and the superior costotransverse ligament. 0.4 ml/kg 0.5% ropivacaine with 1: 200,000 adrenaline is injected into the paravertebral space of T10.
Followed by IPCA in the first 48h after surgery: morphine boluses: 1.5-2 mg, lockout time :10 min, 1h limitation: 6-8 mg morphine.</description>
