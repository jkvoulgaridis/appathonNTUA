    <time_frame>The pain score will be recorded at weekly visits over four weeks for each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>The pain score will be recorded with a visual analog scale from 0-10. 0 is interpreted as no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <measure>Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The BWAT score will be recorded at weekly visits over fours weeks for each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment tool score will be used to assess the wound's status. The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment tool measures wound status. The wound size score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound depth score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound edge score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound undermining score ranges from 0 to 5. The necrotic tissue type score ranges from 1 to 5. The necrotic tissue amount ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate type score ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate amount score ranges from 1 to 5. The skin color surrounding wound score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue edema score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue induration score score ranges from 1 to 5. The granulation tissue score ranges from 1 to 5. The epithelialization score ranges from 1 to 5. The total score from these sub-scores added together is used as the total BWAT score. For all sub-score values, a value of 0 or 1 is a better outcome. The minimum total score is 9 and the maximum total score is 65.</description>

          -  Must have necrotic tissue at least 25% of wound area

          -  The wound type matches one of the indicated wounds listed on the product labeling:

          -  Leg ulcers

          -  Pressure ulcers

          -  Diabetic foot ulcers

          -  Subject has adequate circulation as demonstrated by biphasic or triphasic Doppler
             waveform, consistent with adequate blood flow, within 3 months prior to study
             enrollment. If monophasic on exam, the non-invasive tests must display Ankle Brachial
             Index over 0.8 and no worse than mild disease on segmental pressures.

          -  Subject is likely to be compliant with instructions for case, such as following
             institutional standard of care directions, offloading, and keeping the wound area
             protected from environmental contaminants

          -  Type I/II diabetic subjects that meet the following criteria:

          -  Random blood glucose is less than 450 mg/dL within 30 days of the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known sensitivity or allergy to honey based products, bee venom, or
             other ingredients in product

          -  The subject is breastfeeding, pregnant, or has intentions of becoming pregnant during
             the course of their study participation

          -  Wound duration ≥ 52 weeks

          -  The subject has a prognosis that indicated unlikely survival past the study period

          -  The subject is currently receiving dialysis

          -  Gangrene is present in the target wound

          -  Patient's wound is infected

          -  The subject's diagnosis indicates third degree burns

          -  The subject has received any treatment prior to study enrollment that may, in the
             opinion of an Investigator, affect the outcome of the study

          -  In the opinion of an Investigator, the subject is otherwise not suitable for study
             participation, such as the subject is likely to be non-compliant with study
             requirements

The wound size score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound depth score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound edge score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound undermining score ranges from 0 to 5. The necrotic tissue type score ranges from 1 to 5. The necrotic tissue amount ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate type score ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate amount score ranges from 1 to 5. The skin color surrounding wound score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue edema score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue induration score score ranges from 1 to 5. The granulation tissue score ranges from 1 to 5. The epithelialization score ranges from 1 to 5. The total score from these sub-scores added together is used as the total BWAT score. For all sub-score values, a value of 0 or 1 is a better outcome. The minimum total score is 9 and the maximum total score is 65.</description>
