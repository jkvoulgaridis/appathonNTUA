  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the high burden of caring for a Veteran with dementia, the investigators propose
      to study the effect of a low-cost, rehabilitative intervention for family caregivers of
      Veterans with dementia. The investigators' novel approach will use mobile media technology
      that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical
      centers. If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach
      to Veteran and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff,
      resource, and cost burdens.

      The proposed project studies the effects of an education and skill-building rehabilitation
      intervention, designed to be low-cost and clinically translatable through mobile media
      devices (i.e., tablets), on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. Intervention effects
      will be examined longitudinally at baseline and 3 months post-intervention.

      Advanced statistical techniques will be used to determine the impact of the intervention on:
      quality of life in caregivers of Veterans with dementia (Aim 1), perceived stress and
      depressive symptoms in caregivers (Aim 2), and socialization and engagement in pleasant
      activities in caregivers (Aim 3).

      If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach to
      Veteran- and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff,
      resource, and cost burdens.

    <measure>Change From Baseline Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) is a 22-item self-report measure of caregiver burden. Several version of the ZBI have been used successfully as outcome measures in interventions for dementia caregivers. Scores for each item range from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always) on questions such as &quot;Do you feel embarrassed by your relative's behavior?.&quot; Total scores are calculated by summing all responses and range from 0-88. A higher score is indicative of a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) is a 20-item, self-report measure of frequency of depressive symptoms over a one week period. The CES-D is frequently used to assess depression in dementia caregivers and has been shown to be sensitive to changes in caregiver depression post intervention. Scores for each item range from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the time), with some items reverse coded. Total scores are calculated by summing all responses and range from 0-60. A higher score is indicative of a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. We use a 14 item version of the PSS with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 56. Lower values indicate lower perceived stress while higher values indicate higher perceived stress.</description>

        <description>The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) is a 22-item self-report measure of caregiver burden. Several version of the ZBI have been used successfully as outcome measures in interventions for dementia caregivers. Scores for each item range from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always) on questions such as &quot;Do you feel embarrassed by your relative's behavior?.&quot; Total scores are calculated by summing all responses and range from 0-88. A higher score is indicative of a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) is a 20-item, self-report measure of frequency of depressive symptoms over a one week period. The CES-D is frequently used to assess depression in dementia caregivers and has been shown to be sensitive to changes in caregiver depression post intervention. Scores for each item range from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the time), with some items reverse coded. Total scores are calculated by summing all responses and range from 0-60. A higher score is indicative of a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at 4 Months</title>
        <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. We use a 14 item version of the PSS with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 56. Lower values indicate lower perceived stress while higher values indicate higher perceived stress.</description>
