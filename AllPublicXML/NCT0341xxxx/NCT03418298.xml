      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a
      internet-based preoperative exercise program in patients with esophageal or gastric cancers.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of this preoperative program on functional
      capacity, anxiety and depression, quality of life and fatigue Methods: This feasibility study
      will be conduct at University Hospital Saint-Luc in Brussels. Twenty patients with esophageal
      or gastric cancers will participate in internet-based program 3 sessions per week. Each
      session will combine aerobic and resistance training. Moreover, inspiratory muscle
      strengthening (IMT) will be performed daily. The researcher will conduct weekly telephone
      calls to educate and motivate subjects. Assessments will be performed at baseline, one day
      before surgery, 1 month and 3 months after surgery. The following parameters will be
      measured: functional capacity, quality of life, fatigue, anxiety and depression.
