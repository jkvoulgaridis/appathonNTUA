      This phase II trial studies how well osimertinib, surgery, and radiation therapy work in
      treating patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.
      Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving osimertinib, surgery, and radiation therapy may work better at treating non-small cell
      lung cancer with EGFR mutations.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether, in patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive or TKI
      resistant (acquired T790M) metastatic EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who do
      not progress after 6-12 weeks of induction osimertinib, local consolidative therapy (LCT;
      radiotherapy +/- surgical resection) followed by osimertinib prolongs progression-free
      survival (PFS) compared with osimertinib alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves time to progression of non-irradiated
      lesions (TTP-NIL) and time to appearance of new metastases (TANM) compared with osimertinib
      alone.

      II. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves the time to progression of target
      versus (vs.) non-target lesions compared with osimertinib alone.

      III. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves progression-free survival compared
      with osimertinib alone in TKI naive EGFR (L8585R/exon 19 deletion) mutant metastatic NSCLC.

      IV. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves progression-free survival compared
      with osimertinib alone in TKI resistant (acquired T790M) EGFR mutant NSCLC.

      V. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves progression-free survival compared with
      osimertinib alone in the subgroup of patients with oligometastatic NSCLC (up to 3
      metastases).

      VI. To assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib with and without LCT. VII. To
      determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves overall survival (OS) compared with
      osimertinib alone.

      VIII. To determine if there is a difference in survival outcomes or toxicity by radiation
      treatment modality (protons vs. photons).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association of baseline genomic, proteomic and gene expression profiles
      (from tumor, germline deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], and cell free [cf]DNA) with clinical
      benefit and in patients treated with osimertinib with or without LCT.

      II. To determine modulation of genomic, proteomic and gene expression tumor profiles by
      induction osimertinib.

      III. To explore osimertinib resistance mechanisms. IV. To determine the immunomodulatory
      effects of osimertinib plus LCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (LCT): Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6-12 weeks.
      Patients then undergo surgery and/or radiation therapy daily for 5 consecutive days every
      week for up to 8 weeks. Patients continue osimertinib during and after radiation therapy.
      Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II (NO LCT): Patients receive osimertinib PO QD. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, then every 6
      months thereafter.

                    -  NOTE: Acceptable methods of contraception include total and true sexual
                       abstinence, hormonal contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug
                       interactions (IUS levonorgestrel intra uterine system [Mirena],

                       surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy,
                       or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no
                       menses without an alternative medical cause)

          -  Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12
             months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements
             must also apply:

                  hormonal treatments. The levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) must also be in the post-menopausal range (as
                  per the institution)

             potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 3 month
             after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth
             control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom
             plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients
             should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication.
             Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months
             after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children
             they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of
             the study medication

               -  Have no progression of disease after 6-12 weeks of osimertinib per RECIST 1.1. To
                  assess for progressive disease patients must have the following imaging:

               -  Have target lesions (lesions that will be treated with LCT if the patient is
                  randomized to that arm). Patients that have a complete response (CR) to
                  front-line osimertinib (e.g. no visible disease to target) will continue to be
                  followed for progression on study but will not be randomized

             compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C
             and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not

                  interval

          -  Patients will be excluded from randomization if they meet any of the following
