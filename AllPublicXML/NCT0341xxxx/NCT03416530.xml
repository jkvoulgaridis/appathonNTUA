    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, five arm, dose escalation, phase I study of oral ONC201 in
      pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and
      recurrent/refractory H3 K27M gliomas. Arm A will define the RP2D for single agent ONC201 in
      pediatric patients with glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M mutation (positive testing in
      CLIA laboratory) and have completed at least one line of prior therapy. This will allow for
      recurrent patients and also patients who have not yet recurred, but have completed radiation
      and will inevitably recur based on prior clinical experience and the literature. Arm B will
      define the RP2D for ONC201 in combination with radiation in pediatric patients with newly
      diagnosed DIPG. Arm C will determine intratumoral drug concentrations and biomarker
      expression in pediatric patients with midline gliomas. Arm D will determine H3 K27M DNA
      levels and drug concentrations in the CSF of pediatric H3 K27M-mutant glioma patients. Arm E
      will determine the RP2D for single agent ONC201 administered as a liquid formulation in
      Ora-Sweet to patients with DIPG and/or H3 K27M glioma. All patients must be 2-12 weeks from
      completion of first-line radiation.

          1. 2 to less than 19 years of age.

          2. Patient body weight must be above the minimum necessary for the patient to receive the
             ONC201 dose indicated for the currently enrolling dose level. The minimum body weight
             ranges from 10-27.5kg depending on the dose level.

          3. Arm A: Patients with glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M mutation (positive
             testing in CLIA laboratory) and have completed at least one line of prior therapy.
             Evidence of progression is not required so that ONC201 may be administered to patients
             in the maintenance setting or to patients with recurrent disease. No more than two
             episodes of recurrence from radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are allowed. Use of
             bevacizumab solely for treatment of radiation necrosis, pseudoprogression, or
             treatment effect will not be considered a recurrence. Post-mortem biopsy is required
             if H3 K27M status of tumor is unknown and archival tumor tissue not available.

             Arm B: Patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), defined
             as tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of the pons, are eligible
             with or without histologic confirmation. Post-mortem biopsy is required if H3 K27M
             status of tumor is unknown and archival tumor tissue not available.

             Arm C: Pediatric patients midline gliomas are eligible with or without histologic
             confirmation and must be eligible for tumor biopsy as deemed by the site Investigator.

             Arm D: Pediatric patients with recurrent glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M
             mutation (positive testing in CLIA laboratory), have completed at least one line of
             prior therapy, must be willing to undergo serial lumbar puncture to obtain
             cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and must be scheduled to undergo sedated MRIs. Local
             anesthesia for spinal tap is also allowed. No more than two prior episodes of
             recurrence from radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are allowed. Use of bevacizumab
             solely for treatment of radiation necrosis, pseudoprogression, or treatment effect
             will not be considered a recurrence. Spinal tap should not be performed if treating
             clinician or lumbar puncture proceduralist has concern of signs of elevated
             intracranial pressure, including recent worsening in headache or somnolence.

             Arm E: Patients with glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M mutation (positive
             testing in CLIA laboratory) or have diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG),
