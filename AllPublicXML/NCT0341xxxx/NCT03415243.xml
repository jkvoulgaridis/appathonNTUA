  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open label, randomized, single dose, parallel groups gamma
      scintigraphic study. A total of 28 healthy male participants will be randomized (14
      participantper treatment arm) in order to have 24 evaluable participants (12 participants per
      treatment arm). Participants will be randomized to receive either a single dose Treatment A
      (Theraflu daytime Severe Cold &amp; Cough powder) or single dose of Treatment B (Theraflu
      ExpressMax Daytime Severe Cold and Cough caplets). This study will consist of screening visit
      (Visit 1), followed by a treatment visit (Visit 2). Visit 2 includes two days: Day -1 and Day
      1. On visit 2 (day -1) of the study, the study participants will be admitted to the unit at
      approximately 7 pm on the evening before study drug administration and will receive a
      standardized meal. Participants will be required to fast (nothing to eat or drink except
      non-carbonated water) from 10 hours prior until 4 hours after study drug administration.
      Water will be permitted until 1 hour prior to investigational product administration, and no
      additional fluids until the lunch meal will be served at approximately 4 hours post dose.
      Participants will then be given a standard lunch at 4 hours post-dose, a standard dinner at
      10 hours post-dose on Day 1. Participants will be discharged from the unit after the last
      scintigraphic imaging is performed, blood sample for laboratory test will be taken as well as
      a brief physical examination. Scintigraphic acquisitions will be taken beginning after dose
      administration until 10 hours post-dose.

The dissolved solution will be allowed to cool to approximately 40 - 50 degree Celsius (°C). After cooling, a small volume (1 to 10 microliters [mcL]) of 99mTc-DTPA (Technetium-99m-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate will be added to the drug solution in to achieve a maximum of 108 curie(mcCi) i.e.4 megabecquerel [MBq] per individual dose at the time of dosing. The container will be capped and maintained at a temperature between 35-45°C at time of dosing and then participants will be instructed to consume the hot drink entirely within 30 seconds.</description>

             present study, and from therapeutic or diagnostic exposure, but excluding background
             radiation, exceeding a target organ (colon) dose of 50 mSv (5 rems) from a single dose
             within the last 30 days or a cumulative dose of 150 mSv (15 rems) in the last 12
             months. No participant whose occupation requires monitoring for radiation exposure
             will be enrolled in the study.

          -  Participants who have been exposed to ionising radiation in excess of 10 mSv (whole
             body effective dose) above background over the previous 3 years period as a result of
             occupational exposure or previous participation in research studies. Clinically
             justified (therapeutic or diagnostic) exposures are not included in this calculation.

          -  Renal disease or impaired renal function at screening as indicated by abnormal levels
             of serum creatinine or urea or the presence of clinically significant abnormal urinary
             constituents (e.g. albuminuria). Minor deviations of laboratory values from the normal
             range are permitted, if judged by the investigator to have no clinical relevance.

          -  History or current evidence of ongoing hepatic disease or impaired hepatic function at
             screening. A candidate will be excluded if more than one of the following lab value
             deviations are found: 1) AST/SGOT (≥ 1.2 ULN), ALT/SGPT (≥ 1.2 ULN), 2) GGT (≥ 1.2
             ULN), ALP (≥ 1.2 ULN), 3) total bilirubin (≥ 1.2 mg/dL) Minor deviations of laboratory
             values from the normal range are permitted, if judged by the investigator to have no
             clinical relevance. Positive results in any of the virology tests for HIV-Ab, HCV-Ab,
             HBsAg and HBc-Ab (Total).

          -  Diagnosis of long QT syndrome or QTc &gt; 450 msec for males at screening.

          -  Participants who were intending to father a child in the 3 months following the study.

          -  Participants who were unwilling to follow contraception requirements

          -  Participant had any non-removable metal objects such as metal plates, screws etc. in
             their chest or abdominal area.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week (1 drink = 5 ounces
             (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor)
             within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Smokers defined as the use of tobacco products (including but not limited to:
             electronic-cigarettes, nicotine gums, nicotine lozenges, etc) during the 6 months
             prior to screening or a positive urine cotinine test at screening.

          -  Participant has consumed (eat or drink) grapefruit or grapefruit-related citrus fruits
             (e.g., Seville oranges, pomelos, pawpaw, dragon fruit, kiwi fruit, mango, passion
             fruit, pomegranate, rambutan, star fruit or products that contain these fruits) 14
             days prior to the first dose of investigational product.

          -  Participants who have previously been enrolled in this study.
