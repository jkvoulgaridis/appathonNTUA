    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving &quot;Therapeutic Success&quot; Defined as a ≥ 0.4 Point of Decrease in the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Between visit 1 (baseline visit at study start) and visit 2 (final visit after end of study, approximately 6 weeks after visit 1).</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic success was defined as ≥0.4 point decrease in the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) score between visit 1 (baseline visit at study start) and visit 2 (final visit at end of study, approximately 6 weeks after visit 1).
The CCQ contained 10 questions about symptoms, functional status and mental status. Each of the 10 CCQ questions was scored by the patient on a 7-point scale (ranging between 0=asymptomatic/no-limitation, to 6=symptomatic/totally limited). The sum of the scores divided by 10 gives the CCQ score. A higher CCQ score is indicative of worse status. A decrease of 0.4 points is considered to be the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for CCQ score.</description>

    <description>Absolute change in Clinical COPD Questionaire (QQC) score between visit 1 (baseline visit at study start) and visit 2 (final visit at end of study, approximately 6 weeks after visit 1).
The CCQ contained 10 questions about symptoms, functional status and mental status. Each of the 10 CCQ questions was scored by the patient on a 7-point scale between 0 and 6. The sum of the scores divided by 10 gives the CCQ score which measured the health and functional status. A higher CCQ score is indicative of worse status.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change in the Functional Status Subdomain of Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ-4) Score Between Visit 1 and Visit 2</measure>

    <description>Absolute change in the functional status subdomain of Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ-4) score between visit 1 (baseline visit at study start) and visit 2 (final visit at end of study, approximately 6 weeks after visit 1).
The CCQ-4 score is a subdomain of the CCQ-score. It contains 4 questions about the functional status of patients. Each questions was scored by the patient on a 7-point scale, (ranging between 0=asymptomatic/no-limitation, to 6=symptomatic/totally limited). The QQC-4 score was calculated by the sum of 4 questions divided by 4. A higher CCQ-4 score was indicative of worse status.</description>

    <description>General condition of the patient, evaluated by Physician´s Global Evaluation (PGE) score at visit 1 and visit 2.
The PGE score uses a eight-point ordinal scale, ranging from poor (1,2) to excellent (7,8).</description>

    <measure>Patients Satisfaction With Spiolto® Respimat® at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>At visit 2 (final visit, at the end of study, approximately 6 weeks after baseline visit).</time_frame>
    <description>The patients satisfaction with Respimat was assessed at end of study (visit 2) by the Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire (PASAPQ) Part 1. PASAPQ Part 1 uses a 7-point ordinal scale, ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied, to rate the satisfaction with inhaler attributes. The patients were requested to describe their satisfaction level answering three questions.</description>

    <measure>Patients Preference for Spiolto® Respimat® at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>At visit 2 (final visit, at the end of study, approximately 6 weeks after baseline visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients preference for Respimat® Inhaler vs. Spiriva HandiHaler (HH) was assessed using the abbreviated Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire (PASAPQ) Part 2 survey. Patients were requested to describe their preference for each inhaler device by answering 2 additional questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Willingness to Continue Treatment With Spiolto® Respimat® at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>At visit 2 (final visit, at the end of study, approximately 6 weeks after baseline visit).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' reported willingness to continue using either of the inhalers was measured with a scale score ranking from 0 to 100. 0 indicates not willing to continue using this inhaler and 100 indicates definitely willing to continue using it.</description>

        1300 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in whom combination
        treatment with long-acting bronchodilators is indicated in accordance with the guidelines
        are to be observed by approx. 100 pulmonologists in the setting of private practice. The
        NIS will take place in Greece and sites in urban as well as rural areas will be included.
        The nationwide distribution of the participating pulmonologists as well as the number of
        patients enrolled are intended to ensure that the data collected are representative.

      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label observational study to measure the effectiveness of 6 weeks treatment of Spiolto® Respimat® in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ)-score was used to evaluate changes in health and functional status.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Participants attended specialist sites which would then ensure that all participants met all inclusion and non of the exclusion criteria. 1 enrolled participant was excluded as he/she did not have at least one documented administration of Spiolto® Respimat®.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving &quot;Therapeutic Success&quot; Defined as a ≥ 0.4 Point of Decrease in the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) Score</title>
        <description>Therapeutic success was defined as ≥0.4 point decrease in the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) score between visit 1 (baseline visit at study start) and visit 2 (final visit at end of study, approximately 6 weeks after visit 1).
The CCQ contained 10 questions about symptoms, functional status and mental status. Each of the 10 CCQ questions was scored by the patient on a 7-point scale (ranging between 0=asymptomatic/no-limitation, to 6=symptomatic/totally limited). The sum of the scores divided by 10 gives the CCQ score. A higher CCQ score is indicative of worse status. A decrease of 0.4 points is considered to be the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for CCQ score.</description>

The CCQ-4 score is a subdomain of the CCQ-score. It contains 4 questions about the functional status of patients. Each questions was scored by the patient on a 7-point scale, (ranging between 0=asymptomatic/no-limitation, to 6=symptomatic/totally limited). The QQC-4 score was calculated by the sum of 4 questions divided by 4. A higher CCQ-4 score was indicative of worse status.</description>

          <description>The patients satisfaction with Respimat was assessed at end of study (visit 2) by the Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire (PASAPQ) Part 1. PASAPQ Part 1 uses a 7-point ordinal scale, ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied, to rate the satisfaction with inhaler attributes. The patients were requested to describe their satisfaction level answering three questions.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS comprised all patients of the Treated Set (TS) with a completed CCQ score at both visit 1 and visit 2. Only 1330 patients completed the PASAPQ Part1+Part2.</population>
