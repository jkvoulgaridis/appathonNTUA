      This study evaluates the antimicrobial properties of HEXI-PREP by Clinell compared to both a
      negative and a positive control product.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HEXI-PREP by Clinell is a sterile single sachet wipe containing chlorhexidine gluconate and
      isopropyl alcohol. Both active ingredients are well-established ingredients commonly used for
      their disinfectant properties.

      This trial is designed to assess the superiority of HEXI-PREP by Clinell Wipe against a
      negative control, and also to demonstrate the relative efficacy of HEXI-PREP by Clinell WIpe
      against a similar commercially available product.

             the screening period, during the 14-day pre-test conditioning period or during the
             test period.

          -  Any known allergies to latex (rubber), alcohols, tape adhesives or to common
             antibacterial agents found in soaps, lotions or ointments, particularly chlorhexidine
             gluconate or chlorine.

          -  Active skin rashes or breaks in the skin at the test site.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Any other medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, should preclude
             participation.
