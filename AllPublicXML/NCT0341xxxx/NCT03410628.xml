    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to gather preliminary information on the safety and
      effectiveness of patient self-administration of a noninvasive neurostimulation of the vagus
      nerve using the GammaCore device for the treatment of pain and allodynia symptoms associated
      with acute migraine in adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, multi-center feasibility study; 25 subjects
      will be enrolled at up to 5 study centers. Subjects considered for participation in this
      study will be those who have a diagnosis and documented history at least 2 episodes of acute
      headache pain and allodynia associated with migraine per month, but no more than 15 headache
      days per month. Subjects may, but are not required to experience prodromal symptoms, such as
      aura, or concomitant photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea with their migraine episodes, so
      long as their headaches meet the IHS-Classification criteria for migraine. Subjects will be
      screened for study eligibility and consented for study participation at presentation to the
      headache clinic. Once consented, subjects will be trained by the Investigator(s) at the study
      center on at-home use of the GammaCore device and on study data collection and other
      requirements.

      Each subject enrolled in this study will treat up to 3 migraine headaches at home over a
      period of up to 6 weeks.

      From the onset of headache pain, the subject will withhold usual migraine medications and
      wait until the pain becomes moderate or severe, or 30 minutes, whichever is sooner. At that
      point, the subject will self-administer a first stimulation treatment, which is 90 seconds in
      duration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is between the ages of 18 and 55 years.

          -  Has been previously diagnosed as suffering from migraine, in accordance with the
             IHS-Classification criteria (2nd) (with or without aura).

          -  Experiences at least 2 migraines per month, but less than 15 headache days per month
             (over the last 3 months).

          -  Has age of onset of migraine less than 50 years old.

          -  Is able to distinguish migraines from other headaches (e.g. tension headache).

          -  Agrees to withhold usual migraine medications until after stimulation treatment with
             the GammaCore device.

          -  Agrees to follow all of the requirements of the study, including follow-up visit
             requirements, and is sufficiently trained with respect to the operation of the
             GammaCore device and the data collection procedures.

          -  Agrees to report use of the GammaCore device, study data, and any adverse device
             effects to the study center within 24 hours of treatment(s), and agrees to schedule an
             office visit 4-10 days after the third and final treatment, or when 6 weeks has
             passed, whichever comes first.

          -  Is able to give written Informed Consent, or his/her legally authorized representative
             is available to give written Informed Consent.
