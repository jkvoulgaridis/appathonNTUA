      This is a non-randomized, Phase 2, 2-stage, open-label, multi-center study of
      GRN-1201/sargramostim + pembrolizumab in subjects with PD-L1+ metastatic NSCLC. All subjects
      will have newly diagnosed metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS ≥ 50%) NSCLC with no epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations. Subjects with
      EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations with progression on FDA-approved therapy for these
      aberrations are eligible

      This is a non-randomized, Phase 2, 2-stage, open-label, multi-center study of
      GRN-1201/sargramostim + pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic PD-L1+ NSCLC.

      All subjects will have newly diagnosed metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS ≥ 50%) NSCLC with no epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations.

      The study will follow a Simon two-stage design with up to 64 total subjects enrolled. All
      subjects will receive GRN-1201 at 3.0 mg in combination with 75 µg sargramostim and 200 mg
      pembrolizumab.

      GRN-1201 is to be administered once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every 3-week dosing for an
      additional 12 doses (16 total doses of GRN-1201). Each dose of GRN-1201 will be given as 1 mL
      divided into 4 separate 0.25 mL intradermal injections on each day of treatment.
      Pembrolizumab is to be given every 3 weeks for up to a total of 35 doses.

      This study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days; a treatment period consisting
      of GRN-1201/sargramostim administered weekly for 4 weeks (4 doses) followed by administration
      every 3 weeks for 12 additional doses . Pembrolizumab is to be given every 3 weeks for up to
      a total of 35 doses.

      A follow up visit will occur approximately 4 weeks after the last administration of treatment
      for the study. In addition, all subjects will be followed for evaluation of disease
      progression and survival

         15. Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of the planned first dose of study
             therapy NOTE: seasonal influenza vaccines for injection which are generally
             inactivated flu vaccines are permitted; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,
