  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide works in treating patients with prostate
      cancer before radical prostatectomy. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.
      Hormone therapy using apalutamide may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of
      androgen the body makes and may make it less likely for patients to receive radiation therapy
      after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether 6 months (24 weeks) of neoadjuvant apalutamide prior to prostatectomy
      for intermediate risk prostate cancer results in a reduction of aggregate pathologic risk
      features that drive post-operative radiotherapy recommendations from 35% to 15%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of 6 months (24 weeks) neoadjuvant apalutamide
      followed by radical prostatectomy for intermediate risk prostate cancer.

      II. To estimate the frequency of clinical complete responses and &quot;near&quot; complete responses
      (currently defined as &lt; 6 mm total tumor volume).

      III. To characterize the molecular features of the treated prostate cancers and link them to
      morphologic characterization.

      IV. To measure the 3-5 year biochemical recurrence rate of treated patients as a baseline to
      inform a larger phase III trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2 weeks of completing apalutamide, patients
      undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months.

    <description>Aggregate pathologic risk features defined as any of the 3 pathologic staging features on a radical prostatectomy specimen that indicate elevated future risk of a patient needing pelvic radiation therapy. It can be any single or combination of the three. The three drivers per AUA/ASTRO guidelines are positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension, and/or seminal vesicle invasion. These will be determined by a single expert genitourinary pathologist. The primary objective is to show a 20% decrease in these aggregate pathologic features.</description>

             death (such as but not limited to, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the
             previous 6 months, or use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening
             ventricular arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension)

          -  History of seizure, seizure disorder, or any condition that may predispose to seizure
