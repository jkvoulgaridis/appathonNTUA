      Background:

      In gene transfer therapy, cells are taken from a person s tumor to isolate mutations. White
      blood cells are then taken from the person's body, changed with a type of virus to attack the
      tumor cells, and returned to the person.

      Objective:

      To see if gene transfer therapy shrinks tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People with certain metastatic cancer for which standard treatments have not worked

      Design:

      Participants will complete screening and stages 1-3 under another protocol. Screening
      includes:

      Undergoing a biopsy or surgery at the NIH to obtain pieces of tumor in order to grow tumor
      cells

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Scans

      Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests

      The study has 7 stages:

        1. Screening tests repeated over 1-2 weeks. Participants will have leukapheresis: Blood is
           removed by a needle in one arm. A machine removes white blood cells. The rest of the
           blood is returned by a needle in the other arm. An IV catheter will be placed in the
           chest.

        2. Care at home over 6-12 weeks.

        3. Stopping therapy for 4-6 weeks while their cells are changed in a lab.

        4. Hospital stay for 1 week to get chemotherapy by IV.

        5. Receiving changed cells by catheter. Then getting a drug over 1-5 days to help the cells
           live longer.

        6. Recover in the hospital for 1 2 weeks. Participants will get drugs and have blood and
           urine tests.

        7. Participants will take an antibiotic and maybe an antiviral for at least 6 months after
           treatment. They will have repeat screening tests at visits every few months for the
           first year, every 6 months for the second year, then as determined.

      Background:

        -  The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate
           complete, durable regressions in 20-25% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Recent
           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated neoantigens
           expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.

        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to patients with a variety of other solid cancers,
           including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have little if
           any therapeutic impact.

        -  Recent studies in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch, (NCI-SB), have shown
           that TIL from non-melanoma solid cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against
           non-shared unique mutated neoantigens expressed in the cancer. The frequency of these
           T-cells is very low (often &lt; 0.1%) and it is thus difficult to isolate and grow mutation
           reactive T-cells to levels required for effective therapy.

        -  In a single patient with chemo-refractory metastatic cholangiocarcinoma we were able to
           grow a relatively pure population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these
           cells mediated a near-complete regression of all metastatic disease now lasting 2.5
           years.

        -  We have developed approaches to identify these rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from
           common non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically
           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express these TCRs with high
           efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene-modified cells can recognize and destroy the
           autologous cancer in vitro.

        -  With these techniques, we have isolated a number of TCRs selectively recognizing shared
           mutated oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, TP53) in the context of several major histocompatibility
           complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II).

        -  This clinical protocol will treat patients with refractory solid cancers using the
           adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transduced with genes encoding TCRs that recognize
           unique mutated neoantigens expressed by the cancer.

      Objectives:

      -Primary objective:

      --Determine the rate of objective response (using RECIST v1.1 criteria) of patients with
      solid cancers who receive pembrolizumab plus autologous PBL (Arm 2) that have been transduced
      with genes encoding T-cell receptors that recognize mutated neoantigens in the autologous
      cancer

      Eligibility:

      -Patients must be/have:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Solid cancer with at least one lesion that can be measured, that falls into one of four
           cohorts: (1) gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers; (2) breast, ovarian, and other
           solid cancers; (3) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and, (4) glioblastoma. Metastatic
           disease is required for cohorts 1-3, but not for cohort 4.

        -  Evaluable solid cancer that has recurred following standard chemotherapy or standard
           systemic therapy

        -  Normal basic laboratory values.

        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency.

      Design:

        -  Patients will have already undergone resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation
           of autologous TIL cultures. This will have been conducted under the NCI-SB cell harvest
           protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive Cell
           Therapy Protocols).

        -  Exomic sequencing, and often RNA-Seq will be performed to identify the mutations
           expressed in the patient s cancer. Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and
           tested for reactivity against mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have
           developed that involve the exposure of autologous antigen-presenting cells to long
           peptides containing the mutation or tandem mini-genes encoding the mutation.

        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutations will be identified and the individual
           T-cell receptors that recognize the mutation will be synthesized and used to create a
           retrovirus for transduction of the TCR into the patient s autologous PBL.

        -  Patients that present with tumors expressing mutated shared oncogenes (KRAS or TP53)
           that also express the appropriate restriction element may be treated with autologous
           PBLs retrovirally -transduced with TCR(s) previously isolated in the Surgery Branch
           targeting the shared mutated antigen. These patients will be administered a cell
           infusion product of TCRs targeting mutated shared oncogenes (KRAS or TP53). Their cell
           infusion product will not include PBL transduced with unique (i.e., non-shared) TCR(s).

        -  Patients will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: (1) gastrointestinal and
           genitourinary cancers; (2) breast, ovarian, and other solid cancers; (3) non-small cell
           lung cancer (NSCLC); and, (4) glioblastoma. Autologous PBL (transduced with either
           TCR(s) targeting mutated shared oncogenes TP53 or KRAS, or, TCR(s) targeting individual
           neoantigens) will then be expanded to large numbers using our standard rapid expansion
           protocol.

        -  Patients enrolled on Arm 1 and Arm 2 will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by the
           infusion of autologous transduced PBL and high-dose aldesleukin. At the discretion of
           the Principal Investigator (PI), patients enrolled in Cohort 3 (NSCLC) may receive
           lowdose aldesleukin

        -  Patients enrolled on Arm 2 will receive pembrolizumab prior to cell administration and
           three additional doses every three weeks following the cell infusion. Patients who have
           experienced major organ toxicity due to previous treatment with pembrolizumab (or
           equivalent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) will be enrolled on Arm 1.

        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after cell infusion
           and periodically thereafter.

        -  It is anticipated that approximately one patient per month may enroll on the trial for
           each of the four histologic cohorts for Arm 2. There will be a limit of 15 patients per
           cohort to enroll on Arm 1 (60 patients for Arm 1), and accrual of up to 4 x 50 = 200
           total evaluable

      patients on Arm 2. It is expected that once full manufacturing capability is reached, that
      the accrual may be completed in approximately 4-5 years. In order to allow for a small number
      of inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set to 270.

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive may have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

             cytotoxic therapies not listed above and two weeks for non-cytotoxic agents (e.g.,
             interferon) including investigative agents.

          -  For Cohort 4: Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose
             of steroids, for at least five days prior to registration.

             six months that were not related to glioma surgery.

        Note: History of prior intratumoral bleeding is not an exclusion criterion; however,
        patients with a history of prior intratumoral bleeding, will need to undergo a non-contrast
        head CT to exclude acute bleeding.

          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease
             and AIDS).

          -  For Arm 2: History of major organ autoimmune disease.

        all other eligibility criteria are met.

        -For Arm 2: Grade 3 or 4 major organ irAEs following treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1,
        including but not limited to myocarditis and pneumonitis.

        Note: Patients with grade 3 or 4 major organ irAEs may be enrolled on Arm 1 if all other
        eligibility criteria are met.

        -Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
