    <description>SYDNEY-associated PTC was defined as any complaint reported on the participant complaint form that triggered an investigation by the device department and was categorized as either device-related, participant-related, or undetermined whether or not associated with an adverse event (AE). Overall category included total of all 3 types of PTCs. The percentage of SYDNEY-associated PTCs was calculated as: Number of PTCs / Number of unsupervised injections*100. The confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Wilson score method.</description>

    <measure>Injection Experience Questionnaire at Initial Supervised Injection: Overall Ease of Use Scores: Parallel-Arm Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were given an injection experience questionnaire to complete after the self-injection they administered using SYDNEY device or current AI device on Day 1, for assessment of user experience and overall ease-of-use. The questionnaire included 9 questions about specific aspects of using the device. Overall ease of use was the 9th question, response of which ranged from 1 (very difficult) to 10 (very easy), with higher score indicated more ease of use.</description>

    <description>The aim of the patient perspective questionnaire (completed by the participant after the last injection) was to generate data to support an understanding of the participant experience and satisfaction associated with use of the large volume SYDNEY to administer the 300 mg dose. The questionnaire consisted of 6 questions about level of satisfaction with various aspects of the SYDNEY; with response to each question ranging from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), with higher scores indicated more satisfaction. An additional question (confidence that Sydney device was used correctly) regarding confidence of use of SYDNEY device in the study was evaluated on a scale of 10; where 1 being not at all confident, to 10 being very confident, higher scores indicated more confidence.</description>

    <description>The I-TAQ© was a well-established and validated questionnaire to measure participant satisfaction with SC auto-injector devices. The I-TAQ© (completed by the participant after the last injection) was self-administered questionnaire administered to participants in order to measure their acceptance of the injection. The overall acceptance is one of the five domain scores. The overall acceptance score ranged from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating low acceptance and 100 indicating high acceptance.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 13 centers in the United States. A total of 92 participants were screened on 29-March-2018 with randomization between 05 April 2018 and 12 April 18 of whom 23 were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to exclusion criteria met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization to treatment arms was done centrally using treatment allocation system (Interactive Response Technology) in a 1:1 ratio (alirocumab from auto-injector device [AI] : alirocumab from new auto-injector device [SYDNEY]). A total of 69 participants were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

Overall ease of use was the 9th question, response of which ranged from 1 (very difficult) to 10 (very easy), with higher score indicated more ease of use.</description>

        <title>Patient Perspective Questionnaire After the Last Injection (at Week 12): Single-Arm Period</title>
        <description>The aim of the patient perspective questionnaire (completed by the participant after the last injection) was to generate data to support an understanding of the participant experience and satisfaction associated with use of the large volume SYDNEY to administer the 300 mg dose. The questionnaire consisted of 6 questions about level of satisfaction with various aspects of the SYDNEY; with response to each question ranging from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), with higher scores indicated more satisfaction. An additional question (confidence that Sydney device was used correctly) regarding confidence of use of SYDNEY device in the study was evaluated on a scale of 10; where 1 being not at all confident, to 10 being very confident, higher scores indicated more confidence.</description>

        <description>Anti-drug (alirocumab) antibodies samples were analyzed using a validated electrochemiluminescence assay. Number of participants with positive ADA during treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) period (time from the first IMP injection to the day before the second IMP injection for participants entered into the single arm period or to 70 days after the first IMP injection, whichever comes first) was determined. Treatment-emergent positive ADA response defined as 1) participants with no ADA positive response at baseline but with any positive response in the post-baseline period or 2) participants with a positive ADA response at baseline and at least a 4- fold increase in titer in the post-baseline period.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on ADA population of the parallel-arm period which included all randomized participants who received at least 1 or part of a dose of IMP during this period with baseline and at least one post-baseline available ADA sample during this period. All participants were analyzed according to the AI device they actually received.</population>

          <description>Anti-drug (alirocumab) antibodies samples were analyzed using a validated electrochemiluminescence assay. Number of participants with positive ADA during treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) period (time from the first IMP injection to the day before the second IMP injection for participants entered into the single arm period or to 70 days after the first IMP injection, whichever comes first) was determined. Treatment-emergent positive ADA response defined as 1) participants with no ADA positive response at baseline but with any positive response in the post-baseline period or 2) participants with a positive ADA response at baseline and at least a 4- fold increase in titer in the post-baseline period.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on ADA population of the parallel-arm period which included all randomized participants who received at least 1 or part of a dose of IMP during this period with baseline and at least one post-baseline available ADA sample during this period. All participants were analyzed according to the AI device they actually received.</population>
