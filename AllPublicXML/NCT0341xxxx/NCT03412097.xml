    <textblock>
      To increase patient safety culture in spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) this study will
      assess the ability to implement an active surveillance reporting system for a chiropractic
      teaching clinic and determining preliminary incidence of adverse events (AE) following SMT
      performed by the chiropractic interns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare systems acknowledge the importance of patient safety including the reduction of
      preventable adverse events (AE). For healthcare providers who perform spinal manipulation
      therapy (SMT), the investigation of AEs remains in its infancy for several reasons including
      finding a reporting system that accurately collects AEs information, varied descriptions of
      AE's severity and occurrence frequency and the variable natural history of musculoskeletal
      conditions treated by SMT. Together, these factors act together to conspire against the
      implementation of systematic changes in SMT application that would result in improved patient
      care and safety.

      In addition, it is vital that patient safety training initiates at the start of a healthcare
      worker's career. This pilot active surveillance study was designed to assess the feasibility
      of collecting data on patients' self-report of symptom changes as well as interns' report at
      a chiropractic teaching clinic.
