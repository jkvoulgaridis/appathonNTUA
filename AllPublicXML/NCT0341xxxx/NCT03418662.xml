      The study aims to compare the results between a standard colonoscopy to a colonoscopy with an
      attachment on the distal end of the colonoscope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled study. Subjects referred for screening or
      surveillance colonoscopy will be prospectively enrolled. This study aims to compare the
      adenoma detection rates between EndoRings colonoscopy (EC) and Standard colonoscopy (SC). It
      is assumed that the proportion of patients with at least one adenoma would be 25% with SC and
      35% with EC.
