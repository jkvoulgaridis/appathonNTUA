  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of PF-06687234 and
      [124I]IB-PF-06687234 (simultaneously given) in subjects with moderate to severe Ulcerative
      Colitis or Crohn's Disease. The study used PET-CT scan imaging to assess the distribution of
      PF-06687234 and [124I]IB-PF-06687234 over 24 and 72 hours in colon (inflamed and
      non-inflamed), plasma, colon, liver, spleen, kidney and small intestine.

  <why_stopped>
    Clinical investigation of PF 06687234 under Protocol B7581003 (PET imaging study) has been
