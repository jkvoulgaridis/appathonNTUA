  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, open label, multicenter interventional study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anti-HER2 antibodies in patients with
      HER2-negative invasive breast cancer who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity determined by
      the Celcuity CELx HER2 Signaling Function (HSF) testing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be required to have a prescreening research core needle biopsy to procure a
      fresh tumor specimen that will be sent to Celcuity for CELx HSF testing, in order to assess
      the status of their HER2 signaling activity (abnormally or normally active).

      Patients who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity will receive weekly paclitaxel plus the
      anti-HER2 therapy regimen of trastuzumab and pertuzumab following completion of initial
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate whether
      patients with HER2-negative breast cancers based on standard American Society of Clinical
      Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) testing criteria, but with abnormal
      HER2-driven signaling pathways determined by the Celcuity HSF assay and receive HER2-targeted
      therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, will have a higher rate of pathological complete
      response in the breast and lymph nodes (pCR breast and lymph nodes) than has been found
      historically in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy alone. Secondary endpoints include pathologic complete response (breast),
      clinical complete response (cCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-1 index, and relationship
      between quantitative CELx score and pCR rate.

      It is expected that approximately 270 patients will need to be prescreened in order to enroll
      54 patients (26 ER-positive/HER2-negative and 28 ER-negative/HER2-negative) who have abnormal
      HER2 signaling activity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        SCREENING PRIOR TO INITIATING CHEMOTHERAPY

        Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1
        The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle
        biopsy.

        The primary breast tumor must be palpable and measure greater than or equal 2.0 cm on
        physical exam.

        The regional lymph nodes can be cN0, cN1, or cN2a.

        Histological grade II or III tumor.

        Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound,
        and/or MRI) within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. If suspicious or abnormal, FNA
        or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy.
        Findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to
        initiating chemotherapy.

          -  Nodal status - negative: Imaging of the axilla is negative; Imaging is suspicious or
             abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is
             negative;

          -  Nodal status - positive: FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or
             histologically suspicious or positive. Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or
             core biopsy was not performed.

        Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have ER and progesterone receptor
        (PgR) analysis assessed by current ASCO/CAP Guidelines. Patients are eligible with either
        hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative tumors.

        Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have been determined to be
        HER2-negative as follows:

          -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or

          -  IHC 2+ and in situ hybridization (ISH) non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to
             chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) less than 2.0, and if reported, average HER2
             gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells; or

          -  ISH non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 less than 2.0, and if reported,
             average HER2 gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells.

        Blood counts performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must meet the
        following criteria:

          -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal 1200/mm3;

          -  platelet count must be greater than or equal 100,000/mm3; and

          -  hemoglobin must be greater than or equal 10 g/dL.

        The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 6 weeks
        prior to initiating chemotherapy must be met:

          -  total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab
             unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to
             Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and

          -  alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and

          -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.

          -  Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the
             alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, the
             AST must be less than or equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less
             than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to
             ULN. Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per
             institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be less than or equal to 1.5 x
             ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

        Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in
        the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to
        initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in
        next criteria are met.

        Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x
        ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT
        scan, or positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed within 6 weeks prior to
        initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

        Serum creatinine performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be less
        than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.

        The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by echocardiogram or multi-gated
        acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 90 days prior to initiating chemotherapy must be
        greater than or equal 55 percent regardless of the facility's lower limit of normal (LLN).

        Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of
        contraception during therapy and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study
