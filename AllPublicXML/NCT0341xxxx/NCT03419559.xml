  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT)
      with autologous TIL therapy (LN-145) in combination with Anti-PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing
      process, as originally developed by the NCI. The cell transfer therapy used in this study
      involves patients receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphocyte depleting preparative
      regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen
      of IL-2.

    The treatment landscape for NSCLC has evolved in the past year. An additional NSCLC arm will be
    added to the IOV-COM-202 study using TIL + pembrolizumab.
