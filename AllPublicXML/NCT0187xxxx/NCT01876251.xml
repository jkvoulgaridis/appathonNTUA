  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to determine the tolerability of the PF-03084014 plus docetaxel
      combination in patients with advanced breast cancer. Preliminary information about the
      efficacy of the combination will also be collected.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated on June 24th, 2015 due to change in strategy of PF-03084014
    development. There were no safety/efficacy concerns behind the decision.

    <description>Any DLT event in Cycle 1: Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than (&gt;)7 days; febrile neutropenia (Grade more than or equal to [&gt;=] 3 and body temperature &gt;=38.5 degrees Celsius); Grade &gt;=3 neutropenic infection; Grade &gt;=3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia without bleeding; Grade &gt;=3 toxicities (except those that had not been maximally treated); Grade 3 prolongation of time from electrocardiogram (ECG) Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole (QT) corrected for heart rate (QTc) which persisted after correction of reversible causes; delay of 2 weeks in receiving next scheduled cycle due to persisting treatment-related toxicities; and failure to deliver at least 80% of planned dose during first cycle due to treatment-related toxicities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months - Expansion Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline till 6 months post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The period from study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact. Assessment of response was made using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With All Causality and Treatment-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Withdrawals Due to TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28-35 days after treatment discontinuation (up to Day 280)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as newly occurring AEs or those worsening after first dose. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Causality assessment was made by the investigator. Grading was per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 3.0: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life-threatening, Grade 5=death related to AE.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 6 weeks from Cycle 2 onwards up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>OR was based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeters [mm]). No new lesions. PR was defined as more than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With All Causality and Treatment-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Withdrawals Due to TEAEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as newly occurring AEs or those worsening after first dose. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Causality assessment was made by the investigator. Grading was per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 3.0: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life-threatening, Grade 5=death related to AE.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With All Causality and Treatment-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Withdrawals Due to TEAEs</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as newly occurring AEs or those worsening after first dose. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Causality assessment was made by the investigator. Grading was per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 3.0: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life-threatening, Grade 5=death related to AE.</description>
          <population>All 29 participants who received study treatment were included in the AE summarization/analysis.</population>

        <description>OR was based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeters [mm]). No new lesions. PR was defined as more than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

          <title>Duration of Response (DR)</title>
          <description>Duration of response (DR) defined as time from start of first documented objective tumor response [Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)] to first documented objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DR = (the end date for DR minus first subsequent confirmed CR or PR plus 1) divided by 7.02. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>
          <population>Only 4 participants had CR or PR, 2 each in the PF-03084014 100 mg BID + docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 and PF-03084014 150 mg BID + docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 groups.</population>
