  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of milademetan to assess its safety and
      tolerability, identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/tentative recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D), and assess its pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PDy) properties in participants
      with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

      Approximately 5 US sites are planned for Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose
      Expansion). The same sites are planned to participate for both parts.

             gonadotropin releasing hormone modulators for prostate cancer, and the use of
             somatostatin analogs for neuroendocrine tumors are permitted if such therapy has not

          -  Had therapeutic radiation therapy or major surgery within 4 weeks before study drug
             treatment or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks before study drug treatment.
