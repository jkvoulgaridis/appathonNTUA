  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Small differences in genes may alter responses to drugs. One gene that has different forms
      is the mu opioid receptor gene. People with one form of this gene are more sensitive to
      alcohol. People with a different form are sometimes more sensitive to pain. Morphine and
      other prescription pain pills produce pain relief by acting at the mu opioid receptor.
      Researchers want to see the effect of morphine on brain reward and subjective effects.
      Morphine is a strong but short-acting pain medication that is sometimes used for anesthesia
      during surgery.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the effect of morphine on brain measures of dopamine release using imaging.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 21 and 55 years of age who have previously taken pain pills prescribed
      to treat pain from a medical or dental procedure.

      Design:

        -  This study has a screening phase and a study phase. The screening phase involves one or
           two visits of 5 to 6 hours. The study phase consists of 4 study visits. Each study visit
           will take about 8 hours.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric history and physical exam.
           They will be asked about drinking and drug-taking history, and any family history of
           alcoholism or drug abuse. Blood, urine, and breath samples will be collected.

        -  During the first study visit, an MRI scan may be performed, questionnaires completed,
           and a blood sample collected for genetic testing.

        -  During study visit 2, participants will test their pain sensitivity by placing one hand
           in cold water. Pupil diameter will be measured after the sensitivity test. After a blood
           sample is taken, participants will receive the morphine or a salt solution. The
           sensitivity test and pupil diameter test will be repeated. Final blood samples will be
           collected. A brief physical exam will also be performed.

        -  During study visits 3 and 4, participants will receive morphine or a salt solution
           during a PET scan. Questionnaires to assess subjective effects will be administered.
           Final blood samples will be collected. A brief physical exam will also be performed.

        -  Participants will stay in the clinic until the effects of the drug have worn off after
           study visits 2, 3, and 4.

        -  About 1 week after the study session, participants will have a follow-up phone call.

      Objectives

      Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) release is a key signal for drug reward, and endogenous opioids are
      thought to exert their effects in part by modulating the activity of this system. A
      functional µ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been
      associated with increased risk for heroin addiction in some studies. This polymorphism has
      been shown to confer differential pain sensitivity and to alter the release of DA following
      an alcohol challenge. The objective of this study is to examine the role of the A118G OPRM1
      polymorphism for responses to a challenge of an opiate (morphine) with regard to
      psycho-physiological variables measured in the laboratory and for brain dopamine release
      measured by [11C]raclopride PET.

      Study Population

      Healthy male participants who have had experience with oral prescription analgesics (e.g.,
      Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet, oxycodone) will be recruited for the study. These volunteers
      will be screened to obtain samples of two groups of subjects: 1) persons homozygous for the
      major 118A allele (118AA genotype); 2) persons carrying one or two copies of the variant 118G
      allele (118AG or 118GG genotype, hereafter called 118GX). We will recruit up to 120
      participants to obtain 40 completers per genotype for the study.

      Design

      We will compare the response of these groups to a challenge with morphine given
      intravenously. Participants will receive a standardized IV challenge of morphine (10.0 mg/70
      kg over 1 minute; morphine concentration 2 mg/ml). Pre and post injection measures will be
      made in two areas: 1) subjective response as measured by standardized questionnaires, and 2)
      measures of physiological response, including pupil response to light, respiratory rate,
      oxygen saturation and a pain rating from putting a hand in cold water and blood chemistries.
      In addition, during this visit, participants will wear the AutoSense mobile physiological
      monitor; parameters measured by AutoSense include respiration rate, heart rate, heart-rate
      variability, skin conductance, and activity level. The injection will be repeated in all
      participants in the PET scanner, once with morphine and once with normal saline. Dopamine
      release will be assessed by determining the difference between the binding potential for
      [11C]raclopride, a positron emitter labeled ligand which binds preferentially to D2 receptors
      during saline administration and its binding potential during morphine administration.

      Outcome measures

      We hypothesize that 118GX subjects will have significantly different subjective response to
      the challenge than 118AA subjects as observed in participants receiving alcohol in a similar
      study (Ramchandani et al. 2011). However, the genotype effect on the response may be opposite
      from the effect of genotype on the alcohol response. We also hypothesize that the PET studies
      with [11C]raclopride will show that 118GX subjects have less dopamine release during morphine
      administration than 118 AA subjects.

             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders,
             or a positive hepatitis or HIV test at screening, disorders that could make
             administration of an opiate more risky (e.g., asthma, COPD, sleep apnea, or other
             breathing disorders; liver or kidney disease; thyroid disorder; trouble swallowing, or
             a blockage in the digestive tract (stomach or intestines); neurologic disorders (e.g.,
             a history of head injury or brain tumor, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, CVA,
             migraine in treatment, etc.); low blood pressure; hypertension; neuromuscular

               1. Current chronic prescription or over the counter medications or use of
                  prescription or OTC medications known to interact with dopamine receptors within
                  2 weeks of the study

               2. Drugs known to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize opiates should not be
                  used for 4 weeks prior to the study. These include chlorzoxazone, isoniazid,
                  metronidazole and disulfiram.

               3. Cough-and-cold preparations that contain anti-histamines or opiate pain medicines
                  will be withheld for at least 72 hours prior to each study session.

               4. Drugs that may interfere with the BOLD MRI signal within 2 weeks of the study.
                  These include, but may not be limited to: muscle relaxants or respiratory,
                  cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications

          6. Morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40 kg/m2)

          7. Previous negative effects of opioid administration

          8. Presence of certain implanted devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some
             artificial joints, metal pins, surgical clips or other implanted metal parts), body
             morphology, or claustrophobia. Justification: Implanted devices may increase the risk
             of MRI scanning and/or adversely affect the quality of the data; body morphology may
             prevent optimal positioning in the scanner and thus affect the quality of the data;
             participants with claustrophobia may find the MRI scan too unpleasant and may exhibit
             excess movement that will adversely affect the quality of the data. Assessment
             tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening questionnaire and
             undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Questions concerning suitability for
             scanning will be referred to the Medical Advisory Investigator. Prospective
             participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and placed in the
             mock scanner during their first visit to assess for possible difficulty tolerating the
             confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.

          9. Conditions restricting participant's ability to lie flat for up to two hours (such as
             coagulopathies, superficial or deep vein thrombosis, or musculoskeletal
             abnormalities). Justification: PET scanning sessions require participants to lie flat
             on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours. Therefore,
             conditions that would make that difficult (e.g., chronic back pain, significant
             scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g., familial hypercoagulability syndrome, history of
             thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination
             by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the mock scanner
             to assess comfort.

         10. Head trauma leading to loss of consciousness for more than 5 min or hospitalization

         11. Exposure to ionizing radiation from research studies that, in combination with the
             study tracer, would result in cumulative exposure of &gt;5 rem within the previous 12
             month period

         12. Self-reported and/or observed signs, symptoms, or diagnosis of Raynaud's or Buerger's
             disease (e.g., pain in hands or feet at times of rest, during/following cold exposure
             or stress, any significant color changes in hands or toes). Additionally, medical
             staff will be present to watch for these symptoms during the actual cold pressor test.

        <title>11C Raclopride Binding Potential in Ventral Pallidum</title>
        <description>Binding potential measured using regions-of-interest analysis of PET data. Parametric Binding Potential (BPND) images were obtained using the Simple Reference Tissue Model 2 (SRTM2) 33, with cerebellum as the reference region. Reduction in raclopride binding is attributed to competition with endogenous dopamine, and has been shown to be proportional to the magnitude of Dopamine (DA) release.</description>

        <title>Subjective Perception of Morphine Effect - Feel Drug</title>
        <description>Area under the curve of the subjective perception-time course - Feel Drug. Subjective responses as measured by the Drug Effects Questionnaire [DEQ]. The DEQ consists of simple, face-valid, visual analog scale (VAS) questions on which people report their subjective states after ingesting a substance. The analog scale of responses ranges from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;, and the numeric scale ranges from 0 to 100. Due to skewness of individual time points; areas under the curve for these ratings across individual time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min) were compared instead. Possible range of values for the AUC are 0 to 5500.</description>
