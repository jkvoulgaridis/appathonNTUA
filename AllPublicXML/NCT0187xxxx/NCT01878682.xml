  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VibraTip® is a pocket-sized, wipe-clean, disposable device that provides a consistent source
      of gentle vibration. It has been specifically designed to overcome the limitations of tuning
      forks for testing the integrity of vibration sense in clinic and by the bedside. The product
      is a hand held device that is used to examine the feet of Diabetic patients who are
      susceptible to peripheral neuropathy that can in turn lead to ulcers. Treatment is expensive
      and can be over a period of time, often not being completely resolved, and can lead to
      amputation. The product will increase awareness of foot care and achieve a reduction in
      incidence of foot ulcers.

      The study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the VibraTip device compared to the Gold Standard,
      the 10g Semmes Weinstein Monofilament (MF) Test, and the accuracy and usability of the
      VibraTip® device, as measured by different community medical practitioners.

      Primary Objective The accuracy of the VibraTip® device, as measured by a comparison with the
      Gold Standard, the 10g Semmes Weinstein Monofilament (MF) Test by a Diabetologist.

      Secondary Objectives The accuracy and usability of the VibraTip® device, as measured by
      different community medical practitioners compared to expert validation by a Diabetologist.

      Prospective, single centre diagnostic evaluation. A single centre in the UK (Tameside
      Hospital NHS Foundation Trust). Patients will be recruited while attending Tameside Hospital
      NHS Foundation Trust Diabetes Clinic for a routine 12 month diabetes check up. Subjects will
      receive a Patient Letter to invite them to take part in the VibraTip study and a Patient
      Information Leaflet about the study enclosed within their Diabetes Clinic appointment. The
      study will aim to invite 180 patients to take part in the study and aims to recruit 100
      subjects into the study within 3 months. Subjects aged 18 to 75 (inclusive) of either sex
      with pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2). The study aims to recruit approximately 50
      (50%) of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (both painful and painless) and 50
      (50%) without diabetic peripheral neuropathy. (we will go for even split if possible)
