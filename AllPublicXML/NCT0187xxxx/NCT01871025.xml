  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effects of early exercise training in hospitalized patients for Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation (COPD). Interventions are randomized. In one
      group, early exercise training (aerobic and strength) during hospitalization for COPD
      exacerbation followed by exercise training at home until 30 days to discharge and in the
      other the intervention is usual care. In both groups, usual respiratory physiotherapy
      techniques during hospitalization and adequate physical activity recommendations have been
      included. The main variable is the increase in moderate or vigorous daily physical activities
      at 30 days after discharge.
