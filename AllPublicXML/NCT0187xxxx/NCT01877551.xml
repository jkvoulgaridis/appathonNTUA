  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more than 2-fold greater in HIV infected
      people than the general population. Protease inhibitor booster antiretroviral therapy
      (PI-ART) which is used by ~50% of HIV infected people in the USA is an established risk
      factor for diabetes. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile salt,
      improves insulin sensitivity in HIV uninfected subjects, although the mechanisms for these
      benefits are unclear. This study will explore the hypothesis that TUDCA will improve insulin
      action in people with HIV who are receiving PI-ART. Further, this project will clarify the
      molecular mechanisms responsible for these improvements potentially benefiting society,
      irrespective of HIV status.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if, and through which mechanisms,
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid improves insulin sensitivity in subjects with protease-inhibitor
      associated insulin resistance.

      The investigators will perform body composition analysis by using a DEXA machine, liver fat
      measurement by using an MRI, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedures in 48 HIV
      infected, insulin-resistant/prediabetic subjects before and after 30 days of treatment with
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid or matching placebo. Biopsies of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle
      will be taken during fasting conditions and during insulin infusion, before and after
      treatment to measure markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and thyroid hormone deiodinase.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measures will be change in glucose clearance during insulin infusion,
      change in markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and change in content of D2 in muscle.

    <description>We will examine the ability of insulin to cause muscle to take up insulin. Each subject will receive intravenous insulin for 6 hours to see how much sugar needs to be given intravenously to keep the blood sugar normal, a measure called glucose uptake. We will compare glucose uptake measured as the amount of 20% dextrose that is needed to keep the blood sugar at ~100mg/dl during insulin infusion before and after 30 days of treatment with drug or placebo.</description>

    <measure>Liver Fat</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment and Post 30 day-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>We will use MRI to measure the relative (%) amount of fat in each subject's liver before and after 30 days of treatment. This will allow us to determine if the drug reduces liver fat. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of fat in the liver at the beginning of the study from the amount of fat in the liver after 30 days of treatment. Subjects who have claustrophobia or are unable to undergo MRI will not have this measure performed. Due to these reasons liver MRS was only performed in 10 patients in the tauroursodeoxycholic acid group and 9 subjects in the placebo group</description>

        <description>We will examine the ability of insulin to cause muscle to take up insulin. Each subject will receive intravenous insulin for 6 hours to see how much sugar needs to be given intravenously to keep the blood sugar normal, a measure called glucose uptake. We will compare glucose uptake measured as the amount of 20% dextrose that is needed to keep the blood sugar at ~100mg/dl during insulin infusion before and after 30 days of treatment with drug or placebo.</description>

        <title>Liver Fat</title>
        <description>We will use MRI to measure the relative (%) amount of fat in each subject's liver before and after 30 days of treatment. This will allow us to determine if the drug reduces liver fat. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of fat in the liver at the beginning of the study from the amount of fat in the liver after 30 days of treatment. Subjects who have claustrophobia or are unable to undergo MRI will not have this measure performed. Due to these reasons liver MRS was only performed in 10 patients in the tauroursodeoxycholic acid group and 9 subjects in the placebo group</description>
