  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      alectinib in participants with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer who failed
      crizotinib treatment. In Phase I, cohorts of participants will receive escalating doses of
      alectinib orally twice daily. In Phase II, patients who failed crizotinib treatment will
      receive the recommended phase II dose.

Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. Refer &quot;Outcome Measure 2&quot; for the definition of CR and PR. The median time to the event was estimated using the methodology of Kaplan-Meier.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control According to RECIST v1.1 by Investigator: Phase II</title>
        <description>Disease control rate assessed according to RECIST v1.1 was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) lasting for at least 12 weeks, after the first dose of alectinib. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study. PD: at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. CR: disappearance of all target and non-TLs and normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures &lt;10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. 95% CI for rate was constructed using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1, at Cycles 2, 4, and 6 between Days 14-21, and every 3 cycles thereafter (assessed up to 194 weeks) (1 cycle = 21 days)</time_frame>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1 by IRC: Phase II</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time between first dose of alectinib and date of first documented disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurred first. Participants who have neither progressed nor died at the time of the last clinical cut-off or who lost to follow-up were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment showing no progression of disease either during the study treatment or during follow-up. Participants with no post-baseline assessments were censored at the date of first dose. Progression of disease is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. The median time to the event was estimated using the methodology of Kaplan-Meier. Brookmeyer-Crowley method was used to calculate 95% CI.</description>

        <description>DOR was defined for responders (CR or PR) as the time from when response was first documented, to first documented disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death (whichever occurred first). Participants who did not progress or did not die after they had a response were censored at date of their last tumor measurement. Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. Refer &quot;Outcome Measure 2&quot; for the definition of CR and PR. The median time to the event was estimated using the methodology of Kaplan-Meier. Brookmeyer-Crowley method was used to calculate 95% CI.</description>

Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale [1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent']). Scores were averaged and transformed to lie between 0-100 scale; for each of the symptom scales, higher score=better level of functioning, lower score indicates lower level of functioning. 'Baseline' category for any parameter below (e.g. Global health status/QoL [quality of life]) represents absolute data at baseline. QoL=quality of life</description>

Questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning, lower score indicates lower level of functioning.
