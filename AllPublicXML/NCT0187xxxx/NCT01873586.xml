      The objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the performance of Integra's
      OsteoStrux Collagen Ceramic Scaffold combined with bone marrow aspirate as an adjunct for

    <measure>Number of Posterolateral Gutters That Have Evidence of Arthrodesis (Fusion) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 Months, as Measured by X-rays.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Posterolateral fusion study in which each patient undergoes posterolateral fusion. During the posterolateral fusion, each spinal level is treated with two grafts, the symptomatic posterolateral gutter is treated with study arm (OsteoStrux) and the contralateral posterolateral gutter is treated with the control arm (local autograft).</description>

    <time_frame>upto 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>NA (Not Applicable): This post-market study was primarily a posterolateral fusion study. Interbody fusion was a secondary endpoint. As interbody fusion was completed per standard of care, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), posterolateral fusion (PLF), or posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with or without the use of an interbody spacer and any graft material could be used per the Investigator discretion. As interbody fusion was indistinguishable per arms, data were not collected due to a limitation in the method of analysis per protocol. Therefore data was not analyzed and outcome is NA.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D Health State Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Questionnaire at All Available Time-points</measure>
    <time_frame>upto 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D-5l has a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels which results in a 1-5 level selected for that dimension. The level when added together describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Score is 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), at All Available Time-points.</measure>
    <time_frame>upto 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by surgeons, clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The questionnaire is self-completed and covers 10 topics about pain intensity, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Scores are from 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Worst Leg Pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at All Available Time-points.</measure>
    <time_frame>upto 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a commonly used outcome measure for research studies. It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;0&quot;/no pain at all&quot; and &quot;100/worst pain imaginable.&quot;
The study in this scale is used for the worst leg pain. A lower score represents a better score.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Maintenance of Lower Extremity Neurological Function at All Available Time-points.</measure>
    <time_frame>upto 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Posterolateral fusion study in which one spinal level is treated with both the study and control arm. The symptomatic posterolateral spinal side is OsteoStrux and the contralateral posterolateral spinal side is local autograft.
NA (Not Applicable): Neurological function data was not able to be analyzed as there was a limitation of the method in the ability to distinguish between posterolateral sides in a neurological function assessment. Neurological function is indistinguishable between the right and left posterolateral sides of the lower extremities using the methods in the protocol. Therefore, this outcomes measure was not applicable.</description>

        <description>NA (Not Applicable): This post-market study was primarily a posterolateral fusion study. Interbody fusion was a secondary endpoint. As interbody fusion was completed per standard of care, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), posterolateral fusion (PLF), or posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with or without the use of an interbody spacer and any graft material could be used per the Investigator discretion. As interbody fusion was indistinguishable per arms, data were not collected due to a limitation in the method of analysis per protocol. Therefore data was not analyzed and outcome is NA.</description>

          <title>Interbody Fusion as Determined by CT Post-surgery at Available Time-points</title>
          <description>NA (Not Applicable): This post-market study was primarily a posterolateral fusion study. Interbody fusion was a secondary endpoint. As interbody fusion was completed per standard of care, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), posterolateral fusion (PLF), or posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with or without the use of an interbody spacer and any graft material could be used per the Investigator discretion. As interbody fusion was not a primary endpoint and was indistinguishable per control and study arms, interbody fusion results were not analyzed.</description>

        <title>EQ-5D Health State Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Questionnaire at All Available Time-points</title>
        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D-5l has a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels which results in a 1-5 level selected for that dimension. The level when added together describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Score is 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

All level results are the same unless specifically indicated, &quot;per side&quot;.</population>

        <title>Medical Outcomes: Worst Leg Pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at All Available Time-points.</title>
        <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a commonly used outcome measure for research studies. It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;0&quot;/no pain at all&quot; and &quot;100/worst pain imaginable.&quot;
The study in this scale is used for the worst leg pain. A lower score represents a better score.</description>

          <title>Medical Outcomes: Worst Leg Pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at All Available Time-points.</title>
          <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a commonly used outcome measure for research studies. It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;0&quot;/no pain at all&quot; and &quot;100/worst pain imaginable.&quot;
The study in this scale is used for the worst leg pain. A lower score represents a better score.</description>

        <description>Posterolateral fusion study in which one spinal level is treated with both the study and control arm. The symptomatic posterolateral spinal side is OsteoStrux and the contralateral posterolateral spinal side is local autograft.
NA (Not Applicable): Neurological function data was not able to be analyzed as there was a limitation of the method in the ability to distinguish between posterolateral sides in a neurological function assessment. Neurological function is indistinguishable between the right and left posterolateral sides of the lower extremities using the methods in the protocol.
