    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus with low
      dose tacrolimus compared to early conversion to CNI-free regimen and MMF/MPA with standard
      dose tacrolimus in de novo renal transplant recipients of ECD/DCD kidneys. Given tacrolimus
      and MMF/MPA is a widely prescribed immunosuppressive regimen in the United States,
      comparisons of tacrolimus and MMF/MPA regimens to investigational therapies and treatment
      regimens are needed. Also, considering the fact that ECD/DCD is a fast growing fraction of
      donors, evaluation of various regimens' effects on rather delicate ECD/DCD kidneys is
      necessary.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus with low
      dose tacrolimus compared to early conversion to CNI-free regimen and MMF/MPA with standard
      dose tacrolimus in de novo renal transplant recipients of ECD/DCD kidneys. Given tacrolimus
      and MMF/MPA is a widely prescribed immunosuppressive regimen in the United States,
      comparisons of tacrolimus and MMF/MPA regimens to investigational therapies and treatment
      regimens are needed. Also, considering the fact that ECD/DCD is a fast growing fraction of
      donors, evaluation of various regimens' effects on rather delicate ECD/DCD kidneys is
      necessary.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus and
      low dose tacrolimus compared to MMF/MPA with standard dose tacrolimus at 24 months
      post-transplant with respect to the composite efficacy failure rates (treated biopsy proven
      acute rejection episodes (BPAR), graft loss, death, loss to follow-up) in de novo renal
      transplant recipients.

      The key secondary objective is to compare renal function of the everolimus treatment arms to
      the MMF/MPA treatment arm at 12 and 24 months post-transplantation. Renal function will be
      measured by the calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), using the MDRD (Modification of
      Diet in Renal Disease) formula (20).

    <description>One of the immunosuppressants currently being evaluated to replace CNIs in patients with CNI nephropathy is the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Sirolimus. Everolimus is a derivative of Sirolimus and belongs to this class of immunosuppressants, therefore, both drugs have similar side effect profile. The half-life of Everolimus is almost half of Sirolimus (Everolimus 30 hours vs Sirolimus 62 hours), which makes its dose adjustment easier although it would require more frequent dosing. In clinical trials, Everolimus has demonstrated its potential role as a safe alternative in minimizing and/or eliminating CNI such as Cyclosporin A and Tacrolimus .</description>

        <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus and low dose tacrolimus compared to MMF/MPA with standard dose tacrolimus at 24 months post-transplant with respect to the composite efficacy failure rates (treated biopsy proven acute rejection episodes (BPAR), graft loss, death, loss to follow-up) in de novo renal transplant recipients.</description>

Everolimus: One of the immunosuppressants currently being evaluated to replace CNIs in patients with CNI nephropathy is the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Sirolimus. Everolimus is a derivative of Sirolimus and belongs to this class of immunosuppressants, therefore, both drugs have similar side effect profile. The half-life of Everolimus is almost half of Sirolimus (Everolimus 30 hours vs Sirolimus 62 hours), which makes its dose adjustment easier although it would require more frequent dosing. In clinical trials, Everolimus has demonstrated its potential role as a safe alternative in minimizing and/or eliminating CNI such as Cyclosporin A and Tacrolimus .

Everolimus: One of the immunosuppressants currently being evaluated to replace CNIs in patients with CNI nephropathy is the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Sirolimus. Everolimus is a derivative of Sirolimus and belongs to this class of immunosuppressants, therefore, both drugs have similar side effect profile. The half-life of Everolimus is almost half of Sirolimus (Everolimus 30 hours vs Sirolimus 62 hours), which makes its dose adjustment easier although it would require more frequent dosing. In clinical trials, Everolimus has demonstrated its potential role as a safe alternative in minimizing and/or eliminating CNI such as Cyclosporin A and Tacrolimus .
