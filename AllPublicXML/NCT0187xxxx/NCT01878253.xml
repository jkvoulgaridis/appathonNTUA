      The purpose of this study is to determine if Sidus stem-free shoulder system is safe and
      effective when used in total shoulder replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy (defined as
      follows) of the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder System in unilateral primary total shoulder
      arthroplasty.

      Safety: Will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of device related adverse
      events or unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) in investigational subjects as well as
      analyzing survivorship using revision or intended revision as an endpoint.

      Efficacy: Will be determined by comparing the overall pain and functional performance,
      survivorship and radiographic success of investigational subjects with those subjects who
      received the control devices.

    <measure>Pain and Function as Measured by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Pain and function as measured by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire. ASES consists of 3 subcomponent scores including pain, instability and activities of daily living. The pain score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. The instability score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no instability and 10 being the worst instability imaginable. The activities of daily living consists of 10 questions with ordinal responses of 0, 1, 2, and 3. 3 involves no limitation and 0 is unable to do. The 3 subcomponents combine to make the overall ASES score which can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst possible score and 100 being the best.</description>

    <description>Pain and function as measured by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire.

    <measure>SF-12 Mental Health and Physical Composite Scores as Measured by the SF-12 Scoring Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Op, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 Mental Health and Physical Composite Scores. SF-12 is a validated health survey that uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well being from the patient's point of view. The SF-12 is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, where a 0 is the worst level of health and 100 is the best level of health. The scores are then normalized with a mean score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, so that scores greater than 50 represent a health level better than average, and scores less than 50 represent a level lower than average.</description>

             the shoulder that showed insufficient glenoid or humeral bone stock to allow for
             implantation of the prosthesis.

          -  Insufficient bone stock exists in the presence of metabolic bone disease (i.e.
             osteoporosis or severe osteopenia), cancer and radiation.

          -  Patient with severe glenoid deficiency.

          -  Prior fracture of the operative shoulder with the presence of malunion or non-union.

          -  Intraoperative findings which indicate insufficient bone stock or local deformities
             which could inhibit prosthesis fixation. Final assessment of bone quality will be
             completed intraoperatively upon resection of the humeral head and prior to insertion
             of the anchor as described in the surgical technique. If there is any doubt regarding
             bone quality affecting the stable fixation of the anchor, the surgeon must use a
             stemmed prosthesis.

        <description>Pain and function as measured by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire. ASES consists of 3 subcomponent scores including pain, instability and activities of daily living. The pain score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. The instability score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no instability and 10 being the worst instability imaginable. The activities of daily living consists of 10 questions with ordinal responses of 0, 1, 2, and 3. 3 involves no limitation and 0 is unable to do. The 3 subcomponents combine to make the overall ASES score which can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst possible score and 100 being the best.</description>

The instability score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no instability and 10 being the worst instability imaginable.

        <title>SF-12 Mental Health and Physical Composite Scores as Measured by the SF-12 Scoring Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>SF-12 Mental Health and Physical Composite Scores. SF-12 is a validated health survey that uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well being from the patient's point of view. The SF-12 is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, where a 0 is the worst level of health and 100 is the best level of health. The scores are then normalized with a mean score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, so that scores greater than 50 represent a health level better than average, and scores less than 50 represent a level lower than average.</description>
