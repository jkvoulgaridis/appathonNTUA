  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussion, a mild traumatic injury common in children and adolescents, is a complex
      pathophysiological process affecting the brain. The lay press is inundated with reports of
      tragic consequences of concussion, and children are not immune.

      Persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS) is defined as the persistence of somatic, cognitive,
      physical, psychological or behavioural changes lasting more than one month following injury.
      PCS significantly impacts children and their family's quality of life through school
      absenteeism, depressed mood and loss of activities.

      Validated, easy-to-use prognosticators do not exist for clinicians to identify children at
      highest risk for PCS. As a result,physicians cannot accurately inform children and parents
      whether they should expect longer symptoms, nor initiate pharmacotherapy or other management
      to reduce the occurrence or severity of PCS.

      The investigators objective is to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for the
      development of PCS in children and adolescents presenting to the emergency department (ED)
      following acute head injury. The investigators have three aims: (1) determine PCS incidence
      at one-month follow-up in children aged 5-17 who sustain a concussion; (2) derive a rule to
      predict PCS from variables present in the history and physical examination; and, (3) assess
      the accuracy, reliability and acceptability of the prediction rule in a subsequent cohort.
      Using a prospective, multicentre study at nine large Canadian pediatric EDs, the
      investigators will recruit the largest prospective epidemiological cohort of children with
      concussions in the literature.

      This work will provide rigorous evidence to determine PCS incidence in children and its
      impact on quality of life. The results will enable clinicians to identify children at highest
      risk for PCS, optimize treatment and provide families with realistic anticipatory guidance.
      This study will also establish a strong and vital evidence base to advance concussion
      research.

    <measure>Count of Children Who Have Persistent Post-concussive Symptoms (PCS) at One-month Follow-up.</measure>

    <description>The primary outcome is the number of of children aged 5 - 17 years who have PCS at one-month follow-up. A PCS case is defined as an increase from pre-concussion baseline of three or more symptoms on the validated PCSI at one-month (consistent with the ICD-10 definition of PCS).</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL™ is a reliable and valid measure of health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and/or chronic health conditions. Parent versions exist for children aged 2 to 18 years (in 4 age groups) and child versions for those aged 5 and over. The inventory covers four domains: physical, emotional, social and school. Items are calculated and transformed into an overall score with a range of 0 to 100 points, with more points indicating better quality of life. This secondary outcome measure will be used to determine the impact of PCS on quality of life on patients and families.</description>

          <description>The primary outcome is the number of of children aged 5 - 17 years who have PCS at one-month follow-up. A PCS case is defined as an increase from pre-concussion baseline of three or more symptoms on the validated PCSI at one-month (consistent with the ICD-10 definition of PCS).</description>

        <title>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Total Score at 4-weeks Post-injury</title>
        <description>The PedsQL™ is a reliable and valid measure of health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and/or chronic health conditions. Parent versions exist for children aged 2 to 18 years (in 4 age groups) and child versions for those aged 5 and over. The inventory covers four domains: physical, emotional, social and school. Items are calculated and transformed into an overall score with a range of 0 to 100 points, with more points indicating better quality of life. This secondary outcome measure will be used to determine the impact of PCS on quality of life on patients and families.</description>

            <description>The primary outcome measure, PPCS, was defined in keeping with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) definition of postconcussion syndrome, which requires persistence beyond 4 weeks of at least 3 symptoms compared with state of being prior to the injury. In the study, an individual symptom was defined as a positive difference between the patient-reported current minus the perceived preinjury symptom rating on PCSI; both were completed 28 days after the injury.</description>
