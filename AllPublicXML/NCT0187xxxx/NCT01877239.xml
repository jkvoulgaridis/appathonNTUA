    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-interventional observational study to evaluate the treatment of
      moderately active RA patients in every day clinical practice in Austria. Patients will be
      observed over 52 weeks. The primary endpoint will be percentage of patients who reach CDAI
      remission after 24 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Remission at Week 24</measure>

    <description>CDAI is a simplified index for assessing the disease activity comprising of the swollen joint counts (SJC), tender/painful joint counts (TJC), participant's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA) and physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA). CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: SJC and TJC (based on 28-joint assessment), PtGA and PGA (assessed on 0-10 cm visual analog scale; higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity). CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI less than equal to (&lt;=) 2.8 indicates disease remission, greater than (&gt;) 2.8 to 10 = low disease activity, greater than (&gt;) 10 to 22 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 = high disease activity. Percentage of participants with CDAI remission (score &lt;=2.8) at Week 24 were reported.</description>

        Patients with moderately active RA that are treated with Etanercept will be studied. All
        patients enrolled should meet the usual prescribing criteria for Etanercept as per the
        Austrian SmPC and should be entered into the study at the investigator's discretion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is eligible to receive Etanercept treatment according to the Austrian
             SmPC.

          2. The decision to treat the patient with Etanercept has been made independently by the
             physician and is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the
             study. The treatment decision was made in advance and is not dependent on the
             protocol.

          3. The patient was informed about the study and gave his/her consent and signed an
             Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) submitted written Informed Consent form on use of
             the data.

          4. The patient has moderately active RA, defined as a disease activity of CDAI &gt;10 and
             ≤22 and/or DAS28 (CRP)&gt;3.2 and ≤ 5.1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication according to the Austrian SmPC, which includes:

             A hypersensitivity to any component of Etanercept, active tuberculosis or any other
             serious infection.

          2. Patient has previously participated in this study.

        <description>CDAI is a simplified index for assessing the disease activity comprising of the SJC, TJC, PtGA and PGA. CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: SJC, TJC (based on 28-joint assessment), PtGA and PGA (assessed on 0-10 cm visual analog scale; higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity). CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI &lt;= 2.8 indicates disease remission, &gt; 2.8 to 10 = low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 = high disease activity. Percentage of participants with different type of CDAI status of disease activity (remission, low disease, moderate and high disease activity) at Week 12 and 52 were reported. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.</description>
