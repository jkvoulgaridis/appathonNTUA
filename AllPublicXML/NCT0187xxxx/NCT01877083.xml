  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, safety and activity study of lenvatinib in subjects with
      KIF5B-RET-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung and other confirmed RET translocations. At
      least 20 subjects with KIF5B-RET and other RET translocations will be treated and will
      receive lenvatinib at a starting dose of 24 mg orally, once per day. The study will consist
      of 3 phases: The Pretreatment Phase, The Treatment Phase and the Extension Phase. The
      Pretreatment Phase will include screening procedures and eligibility assessments. The
      Pretreatment Phase consists of a Screen 1, Screen 2 and Baseline Period. The Treatment Phase
      will begin when the subject has met all eligibility criteria on Day 1 of the first Treatment
      Cycle. The Treatment Phase contains the Treatment and Follow-up Periods. The Extension Phase
      will begin for subjects who received treatment in the study (either in the Treatment Period
      or Follow-up Period) at the time of database cutoff.

    <time_frame>From first dose date until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, participant's choice to stop study treatment (up to approximately 2 years 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on the investigator assessment of radiologic response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. No independent review of tumor assessments was performed. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose date until PD or death (up to approximately 2 years 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the first dose to the date of first documentation of PD, or date of death, whichever occurred first. Tumor response data used to analyze PFS was obtained from the investigator's assessment of the imaging scans using RECIST 1.1. No independent review of tumor assessments were performed. PFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% Cl based on the Greenwood formula. PD was defined as at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

             not known to have mutation in EGFR, KRAS, or ALK.

          3. Subjects may have received up to three prior systemic anticancer treatment regimens
             for adenocarcinoma of the lung (including adjuvant therapies and tyrosine-kinase
             inhibitors [TKI]), unless discussed with the sponsor.

          4. Subjects must have a clinically indicated need for systemic chemotherapy for
             adenocarcinoma of the lung based on the investigator's assessment

          5. Presence of measurable disease meeting the following criteria:

               1. At least one lesion of at least 1.0 cm in the long-axis diameter for a non-lymph
                  node or at least 1.5 cm in the short-axis diameter for a lymph node which is
                  serially measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1
                  (RECIST 1.1) using either computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance

          6. Subjects with known brain metastases who have completed whole brain radiotherapy,
             stereotactic radiosurgery, or complete surgical resection will be eligible if they
             have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic and off of steroids for 28 days.

          7. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L (greater

                  metastases) AND the subject also is known to have bone metastases, the
                  liver-specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the total and used to
                  assess the liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase.

          9. Adequate renal function, defined as calculated creatinine clearance greater than 40
             mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula.

             sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline assessment
             is required if a negative Screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours
             before the first dose of study drug.

         15. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically

             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method
             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral
             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

         17. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the
             study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.
