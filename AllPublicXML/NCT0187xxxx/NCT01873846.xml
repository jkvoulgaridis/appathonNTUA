    <description>Slit lamp findings for each eye, including epithelial edema, epithelial microcysts, corneal staining, limbal and bulbar injections, upper lid tarsal conjunctival abnormalities, corneal neovascularization, and corneal infiltrates, were graded for severity on a scale from 0 (No Finding) to 4 (Severe Finding). Corneal staining grades were computed as the maximum grade over grades taken within each of five different eye locations (central, inferior, nasal, superior, and temporal). Eyes with multiple visits are counted once for the highest grade.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be correctable through spherocylindrical refraction to 32 letters (0.3
             logMAR) or better (distance, high contrast) in each eye

          -  Subjects must have clear central corneas and be free of any anterior segment
             disorders.

          -  Subjects must be adapted lens wearers and wear a lens in each eye and each lens must
             be of the same manufacture and brand.

          -  Subjects must be myopic and require lens correction from -0.25 D to -6.00 D in each
             eye.

          -  Subject must wear their current lenses for a minimum of 12 hours per day at least four
             days per week.

          -  Subjects must spend at least 3 hours each workday using a computer or electronic
             device (ie, smartphones, tablets, eReaders).

          -  Subjects must habitually wear soft contact lens.

          -  Subject must have no active ocular disease or allergic conjunctivitis.

          -  Subject must not be using any topical ocular medications.

          -  Subjects must be bothered (occasionally or frequently) by blurriness or fluctuations
             in vision with their current contact lenses.

          -  Subjects must habitually use a lens care product for cleaning, disinfection, and
             storage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have worn gas permeable (GP) contact lenses within the last 30 days or
             who have worn polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses within the last three months.

          -  Subjects with any systemic disease currently affecting ocular health or which in the
             Investigator's opinion may have an effect on ocular health during the course of the
             study.

          -  Subjects using any systemic or topical medications that will, in the Investigator's
             opinion, affect ocular physiology or lens performance.

          -  Subjects with an active ocular disease or who are using any ocular medication.

          -  Subjects who are not correctable to 32 letters (0.3 logMAR) in each eye with soft
             spherical contact lenses.

          -  Subjects who are presbyopic or currently wear monovision, multifocal, or toric contact
             lenses.

          -  Subjects with an ocular astigmatism of 1.00 D or greater in either eye.

          -  Subjects with anisometropia (spherical equivalent) of 2.00 D or greater in either eye.

          -  Subjects with any Grade 2 or greater finding during the slit lamp examination.

          -  Subjects with corneal infiltrates, of ANY GRADE, are not eligible.

          -  Subjects with any &quot;Present&quot; finding during the slit lamp examination that, in the
             Investigator's judgment, interferes with contact lens wear.

          -  Subjects with any scar or neovascularization within the central 4 mm of the cornea.

          -  Subjects who are aphakic.

          -  Subjects who are amblyopic.

          -  Subjects who have had any corneal surgery (eg, refractive surgery).

          -  Subjects who are allergic to any component in the study care products.

          -  Subjects who are bothered by blurriness or fluctuations in vision due to itchy eyes,
             something on or under the lens, allergies, or cigarette smoke.

        <description>Slit lamp findings for each eye, including epithelial edema, epithelial microcysts, corneal staining, limbal and bulbar injections, upper lid tarsal conjunctival abnormalities, corneal neovascularization, and corneal infiltrates, were graded for severity on a scale from 0 (No Finding) to 4 (Severe Finding). Corneal staining grades were computed as the maximum grade over grades taken within each of five different eye locations (central, inferior, nasal, superior, and temporal). Eyes with multiple visits are counted once for the highest grade.</description>
