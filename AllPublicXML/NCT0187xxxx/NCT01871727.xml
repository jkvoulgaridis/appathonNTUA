  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy of E7777 in participants with recurrent
      or persistent Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) in Stage I - III participants as assessed by
      objective response rate (ORR). A lead-in dose-finding part was used to determine dose level 9
      microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg) E7777 that is being used to test efficacy and safety.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of E7777 in participants with recurrent
      or persistent CTCL. The study consists of an initial Lead-in part (to select recommended dose
      of E7777 for Main part), followed by the Main part (to test efficacy). Lead in part is
      complete and main study is ongoing. Participants will move through three phases while on
      study: Pretreatment Phase, Treatment Phase, and Extension Phase and a Follow-up Period.

             who have been on corticosteroids for a prolonged period of time and where
             discontinuation may lead to rebound flare in disease. The concomitant steroid
             medication is allowed as long as the type of steroid, route of administration, and
             steroid dose remain the same as what the participant had been receiving for a
             prolonged period of time.

             hepatitis C infection

         11. Females who are pregnant (positive urine test) or breastfeeding

         12. Any history of a medical condition or a concomitant medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would compromise the participant's ability to safely
