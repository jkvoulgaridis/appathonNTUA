  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently over 11 million cancer survivors in the U.S. and survival rates are
      increasing. Unfortunately, 10-30% of cancer patients are current smokers at the time of
      diagnosis, and many of these patients have elevated socioeconomic, medical, and psychosocial
      vulnerabilities. Documented risks associated with continued smoking following cancer
      diagnosis include decreased survival time; increased complications from surgery, radiation,
      and chemotherapy; and increased risk of second primary tumors. U.S. Department of Health &amp;
      Human Services Public Health Service evidence-based tobacco treatment guidelines exist but
      have not been integrated into the cancer setting. This is a tremendous missed opportunity to
      address a modifiable risk factor. In recognition of this treatment gap, the National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) sponsored a conference in 2009 to address how to increase the readiness and
      capacity for delivery of tobacco treatment in Cancer Centers. The American Society of
      Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends identification, advice, and counseling of all smokers by
      their second oncology visit as a core quality indicator; however, currently only half of
      patients report being asked about tobacco use.

      Specific Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two
      strategies to promote smoking cessation in suspected or newly diagnosed cancer patients.

      Study Design: A multi-site randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial will enroll
      295 current smokers with suspected or newly diagnosed melanoma, lymphoma, thoracic, breast,
      genitourinary, gastrointestinal, head and neck, or gynecologic cancer. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive Intensive Counseling (IC) or &quot;Standard Care&quot; (SC). Both groups
      will receive an initial motivational counseling session and 3 weekly follow-up counseling
      sessions with a tobacco treatment counselor, conducted in-person or by telephone. The IC arm
      has the option to also receive:

        -  Smoking Cessation Medication: Up to a 12-week supply of FDA approved smoking cessation
           medication (Varenicline, bupropion, or combination NRT) at no cost to the participant.

        -  Extended Counseling: An additional 4 biweekly and 3 monthly proactive counseling
           sessions with a tobacco treatment counselor (total of 11 counseling contacts).

      All participants will complete 1 baseline and 2 follow-up surveys, at 3 and 6 months.
      Self-reported abstinence will be biochemically confirmed at 3 and 6 months.

      Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of two tobacco treatments that are integrated into cancer
      care in producing tobacco abstinence at 6 months.

      Aim 2: To explore: a) mechanisms through which treatment promotes abstinence; b)
      subpopulations in which abstinence is promoted; and c) which aspects of treatment promote
      abstinence.

      Aim 3: To compare the incremental cost effectiveness (cost per quit) of two tobacco
      treatments.

      Exploratory Aim: To identify the percentage and associated characteristics of smokers who 1)
      enroll in tobacco treatment and 2) adhere to tobacco treatment.

Standard Treatment (ST): (1) Initial counseling session: The initial counseling session will last approximately 45 minutes and will be conducted in-person or by phone by a tobacco treatment counselor. The session will be structured in a 5 As format and utilize Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques.
(2) 3 Weekly Follow-up Counseling Sessions: SC Patients will be offered 3 weekly proactive follow-up sessions, concentrated on quitting and staying quit throughout cancer treatment.
(3) Medication advice: The tobacco counselor will advise SC subjects to use smoking cessation medication to assist with their quit. Smoking cessation medication will not be provided by the study free of cost for SC subjects.</description>

Smoking Cessation Medication: Up to a 12-week supply of FDA approved smoking cessation medication [varenicline, bupropion, or combination NRT (patch + lozenge)] at no cost to the participant.
Intensive Counseling (IC): The IC model includes all components of the SC as well as extended counseling support and up to 90 days of free FDA approved smoking cessation medication.
(1) Extended counseling support: Participants in the IC group will be offered the same initial 4 counseling sessions as the SC group as well as 4 additional proactive biweekly sessions and 3 monthly booster sessions.</description>
