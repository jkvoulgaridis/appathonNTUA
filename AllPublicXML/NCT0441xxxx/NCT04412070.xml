  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) in plasma has emerged as a clinically relevant
      predictive and prognostic biomarker in several metastatic solid malignancies, and even now
      represents standard-of-care for prescription of some targeted therapies in non-small cell
      lung cancer (blood-based T790M companion diagnostic test). cfDNA can be detected not only in
      plasma but also in urine, even in patients with non-invasive disease. Recent studies found
      that the detection of genomic alterations in plasma of urothelial bladder carcinoma patients
      was relatively uninformative in the localized setting. However, urine cfDNA has been shown to
      provide a promising resource for robust whole-genome tumor profiling in clinically localized
      Muscle invasive Bladder cancer (MIBC) and Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). Genomic
      alterations using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel have been recently
      documented in a series of treatment-naïve high-risk NMIBC.

      The investigator's aim is to determine whether liquid biopsies can be used as a new
      diagnostic assay to guide immunotherapeutic approaches in patients with high-risk NMIBC. The
      ultimate goal is to develop a &quot;testing decision tree&quot; to segment patients for informing on
      therapeutic decision and customizing treatment.

        The study population concerns :

          -  Group 1 : patients with high-risk NMIBC treated by BCG therapy

          -  Group 2 : patients with MIBC treated by radical cystectomy. This group will be
             considered as a positive control.

        During their conventional follow-up, a urine collection will be performed to each patient
        for testing of cell-free DNA. Genomic analysis of the primary tumor will be carried out on
        the tumor samples resetced during the initial diagnosis.
