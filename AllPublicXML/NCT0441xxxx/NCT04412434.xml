      Clinical deterioration is observing in up to forty percent of patients with acute ischemic
      stroke (AIS) due to large vessels occlusion. Until now, there is no automated monitoring
      system for early detection of neurological deterioration in such patients. As a first step to
      develop such system investigators suggest this study aiming to evaluate patterns of brain
      electrical activity registered by EEG in patients with AIS attributed to the MCA or ICA
      territory correlated with location and extension of ischemic lesions as determined by
      non-contrast CT (NCT).

      Rationale. Despite the exciting developments in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
      in last years, the problem of neurological deterioration in patients with AIS remains
      unresolved and poorly understandable. This is especially correct about patients with AIS
      resulted from large vessel occlusion (LVO), mainly internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle
      cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Such deterioration is observing in up to forty percent of
      patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO. On the other side, according to the
      literature about 40 % of LVO strokes resulted from atrial fibrillation. Until now, there is
      no automated monitoring system for early detection of neurological deterioration in AIS
      patients. Such monitoring system may save millions of lives of stroke victims all over the
      world. As a first step to develop such system based on change of brain electrical activity
      registered by electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with AIS investigators suggest this
      study.

      Overall goal. The aim of the suggested research is to evaluate patterns of brain electrical
      activity registered by EEG in patients with AIS attributed to the MCA or ICA territory in
      correlation with location and extension of ischemic lesions as determined by non-contrast CT
      (NCT). Based on these data, the attempt to find algorithms, describing such correlation will
      be done.

      Target population. The prospective study will include at least 200 AIS patients with acute
      stroke resulted from MCA or ICA occlusion.

      Methods. Non contrast CT and EEG will be done at the same day. Neurologist will evaluate
      neurological status at the day of EEG and CT performing and clinical score by National
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) will be obtained. EEG will be performed continuously
      for at least 30 minutes with 19-channel EEG machine.

      Assessment. After gathering clinical, EEG and NCT data mathematical and computerized analysis
      (including Artificial Intelligence methods) will be applied aiming to find algorithms
      describing relationship between size and location of AIS and change in brain electrical
      activity registered by EEG in AIS patients.

    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a painless and harmless method to record the bioelectric activity of the brain. Clinically, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time, as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp This method can be helpful in the diagnosis of many various brain diseases and pathological conditions.
For the examination, electrodes are placed on the head, using a special harmless gel, similar to gel, used in ultrasonographic studies.</description>
