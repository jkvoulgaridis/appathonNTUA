  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of Hemanext Inc. is to improve the safety and efficacy of transfusion
      therapy through novel storage methods potentially improving their quality across the storage
      cycle. Based on our review of the pertinent literature, there is substantial evidence
      suggesting that prolonged exposure to oxygen during storage results in oxidative damage to
      the red blood cells (RBC) over the course of storage leading to decreased therapeutic
      potential. Therefore, removal of oxygen from red blood cell products prior to storage has
      potential to preserve the cells in a more physiologically relevant state and improve the
      clinical outcomes of patients that receive blood transfusions in a variety of therapeutic
      realms1.

      Currently, Hemanext Inc. has focused on the design and development of a dual compartment bag
      system designated as the Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System (Hemanext). After standard
      processing of donated whole blood units into leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-RBCs) in
      AS-3 additive solution, the LR-RBCs would then be placed in the oxygen reduction bag (ORB)
      processing bag which allows for the rapid diffusion of oxygen out of the blood, through a
      sterile, oxygen-permeable membrane, and into iron-based oxygen sorbents. After processing,
      the blood is transferred again from the ORB into the Hemanext Storage Bag (HSB) which will
      preserve the hypoxic state of the LR-RBC product for the duration of cold storage.

      The COVID-19 crisis has placed unprecedented pressure on the US blood supply security. The
      pandemic has caused blood supplies to fall precipitously, placing all transfusion recipients
      at acute risk. Hemanext has developed a technology over 12 years with support from 6 NIH
      grants and contracts that can substantially mitigate the damage done to the blood supply by
      this COVID-19 crisis and strengthen the ability of the US blood supply to withstand the
      effects of future crises. Limited shelf life is a key component in exacerbating the current
      blood supply crisis. Successful completion of this project will allow earliest possible
      availability (within 9-12 months) of the high quality Hemanext RBC with significantly
      extended shelf life. Even without shelf life extension, the higher quality Hemanext RBC
      showed a reduction of &gt;50% of blood volume required for resuscitation from hemorrhage in a
      pre-clinical rodent model. Further enhancement of the quality of Hemanext RBC is expected to
      improve still further the efficacy of Hemanext blood and further to reduce the transfusion
      volume needed to achieve treatment objectives. In addition, extending the shelf life of the
      Hemanext RBC will provide greater inventory flexibility to avoid the devastating impact of
      major blood shortages due to reduced donor activity during threats to blood security such a
      COVID-19 pandemics and other crises.
