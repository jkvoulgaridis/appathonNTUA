  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is aimed to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for
      Ergoferon in the treatment of influenza/acute viral URI in adult and pediatric outpatients,
      including cases with delayed treatment initiation (after 48 or 72 h of the onset of illness),
      and in allergy patients. Routine clinical practice in the management of outpatients with
      acute viral URI is to be studied in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
      Mongolia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan: the demographic characteristics of patients, duration
      and time points of treatment with the use of Ergoferon, its safety, and the frequency of
      additional medication.

      Scope of the study: 519 general practitioners; 8411 patients. Physical examinations and tests
      are performed according to local outpatient clinical practice, and to local and international
      medical care standards.

      Data to be collected and analyzed after the completion of treatment:

        -  demographics (age, gender, and city/town of residence)

        -  severity of illness (mild, moderate, or severe)

        -  comorbidities (chronic ENT conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
           chronic cardiovascular disease, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, atopic dermatitis/eczema,
           asthma, or other)

        -  the time of resolution of infection symptoms (absence of fever - a body temperature
           below 37.0°С), systemic symptoms (chills, headaches, myalgias, weakness, and loss of
           appetite), nasal symptoms (nasal congestion/ discharge), laryngeal symptoms (a sore
           throat, or other), and other symptoms

        -  illness time points: onset of illness, first visit to the doctor's office, and start of
           treatment.

        -  symptomatic therapy (drug name, date prescribed, and date discontinued)

        -  therapy for bacterial complications (date the antimicrobial drug is prescribed, drug
           name, diagnosis, hospitalization or no hospitalization required, date of
           hospitalization)

        -  adverse events (description of the event, causality (related/ not related to Ergoferon),
           severity, date of the onset, and actions taken)

        -  efficacy assessment of the Ergoferon treatment (high efficacy: recovery / satisfactory:
           improvement/ insufficient: no effect) - observational study model: cohort, a cohort
           study is an observation of outcomes in a group of individuals linked by shared
           characteristics (an acute viral URI and use of Ergoferon).
