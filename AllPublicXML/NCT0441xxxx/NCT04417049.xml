  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing theoretical and clinical evidence has suggested that pentoxifylline may have an
      effect in improving depressive symptoms. Herein, we aim to evaluate the effect of
      pentoxifylline in patients with bipolar depression over an 8-week trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence has demonstrated that inflammation and alterations in cerebral blood flow
      (CBF) contribute to the pathophysiology of bipolar depression (BD). Pentoxifylline is a
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor that improves CBF and has potent anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant effects. We therefore hypothesize that pentoxifylline may have antidepressant
      effects in BD. We will conduct an 8-week, open-label, single-armed, feasibility study
      assessing clinical and neurobiological effects of adjunctive pentoxifylline in the acute
      treatment of BD. Feasibility will be determined by evaluating recruitment/retention rates,
      target engagement (e.g., changes in biomarkers with pentoxifylline treatment) and preliminary
      efficacy testing with 6 participants. Evaluating pentoxifylline's effects may further our
      understanding of BD pathophysiology and help identify novel treatment targets.

    <measure>Change in depression severity using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale measuring depression severity. It consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 (normal) to 6 (severe), for a total possible score of 60. A higher score is indicative of greater depressive severity Response rates are defined as ≥ 50% decrease and Remission ≤ 10 actual score.</description>

    <measure>Change in cerebral blood flow using ASL MRI imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete an MRI sequence called arterial spin labelling (ASL) at baseline and week 8 to look at changes in cerebral blood flow before and after treatment. ASL does not use any contrast or radiation.</description>

    <measure>Change in inflammatory markers using blood serum and plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be collected in order to evaluate changes in inflammatory biomarkers associated with depressive disorders (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6).</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective measures of depression using 16-item Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete a brief self-reported scale that measures subjective symptoms of depression. In total there are 16 items, each scored from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating worse depressive severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in subjective measures of cognition using the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression-5 item (PDQ-5-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-5 is a brief patient-rated scale to assess subjective cognitive dysfunction in people with depression. The PDQ originally is a 20-item questionnaire that generates a total score and 4 subscale scores in 4 cognitive domains: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The 5-item version (PDQ-D-5) is derived from the 20-item version and provides a validated measure of perceived cognitive deficits in depressive disorders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in psychomotor speed, concentration and memory using the Digit Symbols Substitution Task (DSST)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DSST is used to evaluate psychomotor speed and concentration. It consists of multiple digits with unique symbols associated with each digit. Patients are asked to substitute each digit with the correct symbol in 90 seconds. Each correct symbol is counted to calculate the total score</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attention and concentration using the Trails Making Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) is a cognitive test designed to assess attention and concentration through visuomotor tracking, executive function, and cognitive flexibility. It consists of two parts, A and B. In part A, a line is drawn between consecutive numbers. In part B a line is drawn alternating between numbers and letters. Score is calculated through total time to completion of each part, with higher times indicating impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in verbal fluency using the FAS test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in verbal fluency (i.e., semantic and animal naming) will be measured by using the Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Scores will be assessed through the total number of words stated in a given letter or category in a time period of one minute. Number of repetitions and intrusions will also be measured.</description>
