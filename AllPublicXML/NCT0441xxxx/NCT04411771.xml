  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of primary care is to offer all patients individualized and
      context-sensitive healthcare with high access and continuity. One of the reasons primary care
      struggles with this goal is that many patients suffer from mental health problems, while
      there is a lack of psychosocial resources as well as clear pathways for these patients.

      Primary care behavioural health (PCBH, in Swedish IBH) is an innovative way of organizing
      primary care, where psychosocial resources have more and shorter visits, strive for same-day
      access, and have an active consulting role in the primary care team. To help patients with
      achieving relevant behavior changes, so called Brief Interventions are used. However, these
      interventions have not been systematically evaluated in the same way that CBT has, and there
      is a risk that patients that would have benefitted from structured CBT are undertreated.

      This study is a pilot study preparing for a large multicenter study that will be conducted
      starting in late 2020. The investigators want to find out if an addition of an extended
      evaluation and possibility of treatment with guided CBT self-help can increase the treatment
      effects of PCBH on patient functioning and symptoms, compared to standard PCBH with a
      contextual assessment and brief interventions. In the process, the investigators are also
      conducting one of the first RCT on brief interventions. As this is a pilot study, the
      feasibility of implementing the study protocol in regular healthcare is also tested in order
      to collect high-quality data while creating minimal disturbance in the centers' ordinary
      routines.

      PCBH has the potential to increase the quality of care for patients with mental health
      problems. This study is the first to step towards answering the question if the effects of
      brief intervention are large enough to merit large-scale implementation, and if an add-on of
      other brief and easily implemented treatments can increase them.

      This study is a pilot study preparing for a large multicenter study that will be conducted
      starting in late 2020. The investigators want to find out if an addition of an extended
      evaluation and possibility of treatment with guided CBT self-help can increase the treatment
      effects of PCBH on patient functioning and symptoms, compared to standard PCBH with a
      contextual assessment and brief interventions. In the process, the investigators are also

      feasibility of implementing the study protocol in regular healthcare is also tested in order
      to collect high-quality data while creating minimal disturbance in the centers' ordinary
      routines.

      Our main research questions are:

        1. Does an extended version of PCBH, including an additional assessment and the option of
           guided self-help CBT when indicated by a patient's problem profile, lead to superior
           patient outcomes compared to standard PCBH where a brief, contextual assessment followed
           by Brief Interventions is the only option? If not, can standard PCBH be shown to be
           non-inferior?

        2. Does the addition of guided self-help CBT have a negative effect on availability, reach,
           and cost-effectiveness compared to standard PCBH? If not, can guided self-help CBT be
           shown to be non-inferior to standard PCBH concerning these outcomes?

      The project is a joint effort by Karolinska Institutet, Linnaeus University, and Capio
      Närsjukvård and will be conducted as a single-blind (patients) randomized trial within
      regular healthcare at two primary care centres with a total of approximately 75 patients.
      Time-points for measures are screening at the initial visit and follow-ups 4, 8 and 52 weeks
      later. Primary outcome will be the 12-item version of the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule
      2.0 (WHODAS-12). This is a condition-independent measure of everyday functioning that has
      been found to be relevant to mental health.

      PCBH has the potential to increase the quality of care for patients with mental health
      problems. This study is the first to step towards answering the question if the effects of
      brief intervention are large enough to merit large-scale implementation, and if an add-on of
      other brief and easily implemented treatments can increase them. Our study will also answer
      whether the effects can be increased by adding previously empirically supported self-help,
      while still being cost-effective and maintain high availability of services. The goal is to
      create a more solid empirical base that can guide decision makers when they balance treatment
      effects, availability, and costs in determining which organizational models and interventions
      that are best used in primary care.

      If the results are positive, this project functions as a concrete start to a large-scale
      implementation of this new method, since it is firmly placed within regular primary care and
      uses highly implementable interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients are randomised between an extended assessment and a screening assessment. Patients in the screening assessment arm can only be treated with brief interventions whereas patients in the extended assessment arm are offered guided self-help if deemed appropriate and otherwise gets brief interventions.
Patients are thus randomized to two arms, however we have included four arms in order to be able to describe the primary and secondary analysis. The primary is performed on all patients treated with shCBT in the arm where an extended assessment is made, compared to patients in the screening assessment arm that is found suitable for shCBT (base on screening data), but treated with brief interventions.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>'Brief Interventions' (BI) is a generic term for a multitude of tools and interventions used in patient visits within PCBH. BI start immediately at the initial consultation, which ends with a personally tailored and evidence-informed plan adjusted to the patient's context. As such, there is no separation between assessment and intervention. The interventions within BI often have their foundation in CBT, ACT or MI. The common theme is that they are principle-based rather than manual-based and focus on behavioral change in relation to a problem that is perceived both possible to affect and relevant to the patient, rather than focusing on a specific diagnosis or condition. Follow-up appointments are scheduled flexibly depending on the patient's perceived need. Usually a BI treatment consists of 1-4 appointments with several weeks apart and ends when the patient feels that they are moving in the right direction.</description>

The therapist support consists of 3-6 contacts throughout the 6-12 weeks long intervention period as decided by the clinician and patient together, as long as at least one and not more than three are physical visits at the center and the rest via phone, video conferencing, or secure internet messages. Clinicians delivering shCBT will need four days of reading and two days of training to be able to make initial assessments and problem profiling and use the self-help books.</description>

             according to screening methods and/or clinical assessments made by health care
             personnel at the PCC, will be included. This broad criteria reflects the naturalistic
             setting where decisions of clinicians, rather than highly standardized criteria, are
             the basis for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not speak Swedish well enough to fill out questionnaires.

          -  Is in need of emergency type care, like with suicidal ideation or behaviours, ongoing
             psychosis or mania.
