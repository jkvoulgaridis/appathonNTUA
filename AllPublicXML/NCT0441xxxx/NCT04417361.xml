  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular migraine (VM) has been recognized a distinct subtype of migraine that causes
      dizziness as the predominant symptom. Criteria for diagnosis have been adopted by the Barany
      Society. Previous epidemiological research from the investigators has shown that VM affects
      2.7% of the adult population of the United States. Yet, despite its high prevalence, there is
      very little data upon which to guide treatment decisions. A Cochrane review in 2015 concluded
      that there were no placebo controlled trials in VM, and none have been done since then. The
      investigators recently developed and validated a patient reported outcome tool for VM called
      VM-PATHI (VM- Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory). Anecdotal evidence suggests
      that CGRP antagonists, such as Galcanezumab, may be effective in reducing or eliminating
      symptoms in VM. Therefore, the investigators propose a pilot study of changes in VM-PATHI
      scores, comparing active treatment (Galcanezumab) to placebo arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular migraine (VM) is a distinct subtype of migraine that causes episodic
      vertigo/dizziness, sometimes with headache, and sometimes without. However, unlike
      traditional migraines, patients generally seek out care because of dizziness, and not because
      of headache. Therefore, these patients are cared for by a variety of providers who treat
      dizziness, including otolaryngologists and neurologists. Lifetime prevalence of VM in the
      general population is estimated to be 2.7%, and at least 10% of patients in a tertiary care
      vestibular clinic have VM. Furthermore, VM has been shown to decrease quality of life in
      multiple domains, including overall health, mental health, and emotional health. Since
      testing and imaging are usually normal, diagnosis can only be made on clinical grounds.
      Recently, consensus criteria for diagnosis was published by the Barany Society and the
      International Classification of Headache Disorders.

      Galcanezumab is a calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) antagonist that has been approved by
      the FDA for treatment of episodic and chronic migraine. Its effects with regards to VM have
      not been formally studied. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that aberrant
      trigeminovascular inflammation may be integral to the pathophysiology of VM, similar to
      migraine in general.

      This pilot study will be a single center, randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial
      comparing galcanezumab to placebo for treatment of VM. Screening data will be reviewed to
      determine subject eligibility. Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Participants in the galcanezumab arm will
      receive 240 mg via subcutaneous injection with a pre-loaded syringe at month 1, followed by
      120 mg at month 2, and 120 mg at month 3. Those in the placebo arms will receive subcutaneous
      injections at the same time intervals of placebo. Randomization will occur through the
      hospital research pharmacy. Allocation concealment will be ensured; study participants will
      be given an envelope from a folder of sequentially ordered identical envelopes that will
      contain study instructions and the allocated drug. The master file linking study ID with
      allocation will be created by a third party and kept secret until after data analysis is
      complete. This will ensure that both providers and participants are adequately blinded.
      Blocking will be used in increments of 10 subjects to ensure equitable distribution of
      subjects into the two treatment arms. In addition, stratification by sex and definite versus
      probable vestibular migraine status will be used to ensure equal allocation. Total duration
      of subject participation will be five months. Total duration of the study is expected to be 2
      years.

      Data collection will be performed by the clinical research coordinator during each study
      visit. This data will be entered into the REDCap database by the research coordinator. VM-
      Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory (VM-PATHI), dizziness handicap inventory
      (DHI), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form (PROMIS SF) v1.1- Global
      Health, and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) will be administered electronically via REDCap to
      the subject during the study visit.

      There will be no stopping rules for this trial, given the short duration of the study. Each
      adverse effect and serious adverse effect will be reviewed by the data safety monitoring
      team, and subjects may be unblinded and/or the study will be stopped early for serious safety
      concerns.

    <masking_description>The following study procedures will be in place to ensure double-blind administration of study treatments. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled and this will reside with our pharmacist, who will not be blinded. All members of the clinical team and biostatistician will be blinded. Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical to maintain the blind. Each participant will be given an identical study packet, containing their assigned drug and study information. The study blind will be broken on completion of the clinical study and after the study database has been locked. Investigators will be made aware of their participants' treatment designations only after all the data has been collected and analyzed. During the study, the blind may be broken only in emergencies when knowledge of the participant's treatment group is necessary for further clinical management.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Change between baseline (month 0) and after treatment (month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a recently developed and validated outcome measure for vestibular migraine from the investigators. It has been shown to be highly reliable and valid, and responsive to treatment changes. At this point, it is the only disease specific outcome measure for vestibular migraine. Scores are between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating higher levels of disease related suffering.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a daily text message to rate their dizziness from 0 (no dizziness), 1 (mild dizziness), 2 (moderate dizziness), and 3 (severe dizziness). A score of 2 or higher will count as a definitive dizzy day.</description>

    <time_frame>Change between baseline (month 0) to after treatment (month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Response rates will be measured by the percentage of participants in each arm experiencing a 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0% reduction in definitive dizzy days.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dizziness Handicap Inventory Score from Baseline to Month 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline (month 0) to after treatment (month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>This is the most widely used measure of dizziness severity, and consists of 25 questions. Questions ask about problems related to dizziness, and are scored as no (0 points), sometimes (2 points), or always (4 points). Total score is between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating more disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form (PROMIS SF) v1.2- Global Health Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline (month 0) to after treatment (month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>There are 10 questions on this quality of life measure, each with a score of 1-5. Higher scores correspond to a greater extent of the concept measured (e.g., more fatigue). Two summed scores are generated, one for global mental health (question #3, 6, 7, 8) and one for global physical health (question #2, 4, 5, 10). The remaining 2 questions are analyzed separately.
Summed scores for physical health and mental health are converted into T-score values using the &quot;HealthMeasures Scoring Service&quot; available online. T-scores for physical health and mental health can be grouped into 5 categories based on the responses to question #1: &quot;In general, would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?&quot; The cut points for each category is determined by calculating the midpoint between 2 adjacent means. For example, if the mean mental health T-score for &quot;Excellent&quot; is 61 and the mean T-score for &quot;Very Good&quot; is 51, then the cut point for these categories would be 56.</description>
