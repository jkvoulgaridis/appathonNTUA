  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial will investigate the safety and feasibility of applying the Tumor
      Electric Fields Treatment System to subjects with recurrent glioblastoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have previously completed radiotherapy and at least two cycles of chemotherapy
      with imaging or pathological evidence of tumor recurrence will receive Tumor Electric Fields
      Treatment System. The main objective is to evaluate the safety of applying the Tumor Electric
      Fields Treatment System to subjects with recurrent GBM.
