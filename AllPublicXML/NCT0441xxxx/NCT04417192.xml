      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative olaparib monotherapy and preoperative
      olaparib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy in patients with untreated stage III, IV
      high-grade serous or Grade 3 endometrioid ovarian cancer with HRD positivity. The first
      cohort (Olaparib monotherapy : 10 cases) will be evaluated for the presence or absence of
      immune cell activation, and the tumor reduction effect will be evaluated in the second cohort
      (Olaparib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy : 20 cases).
