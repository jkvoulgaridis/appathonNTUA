  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dyspnea is a common symptom in patients with many respiratory diseases particularly
      chronic obstructive airway diseases, but also cardiovascular pathologies, obesity, or also in
      the deconditioned healthy subjects.

      Called &quot;volatolom&quot; corresponds to the set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contained in
      exhaled air.

      The analysis of volatolom can be done either by the methods based on mass spectrometry which
      allows the identification of each VOC in the exhaled air or by the use of electronic noses
      which are more simple to use, less specific and produce a quantitive signal change based on
      pattern recognition algorithms providing a global profile of the VOC without identifying
      them.

      The aim of the study is to determine whether the analysis of VOCs in exhaled air would
      identify biomarkers related to the intensity and type of experimental dyspnea.
