    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to retrospectively collect the data on patients who underwent
      pelvic organ prolapse treatment using a non-ablative Er:YAG laser with SMOOTH mode and to
      conduct an objective evaluation of safety and efficacy of Er:YAG laser treatment. In a group
      of patients that have concomitant stress urinary incontinence symptoms, the effectiveness of
      the treatments on these symptoms will be evaluated as well.

      Pelvic organ prolapse is a condition that affects many women and is detrimental to their
      everyday functioning, sexual function and quality of life. Prevalence rates of pelvic organ
      prolapse, if assessed by reporting symptoms are in the range of 3-6%, but this percentage
      rises up to 50% when women are diagnosed by vaginal examination1,2. The aetiology of pelvic
      organ prolapse is complex - it includes several risk factors such as vaginal childbirth,
      advancing age and high body mass index. Some studies have also shown a genetic or hereditary
      component to the disorder, showing that women had an increased risk of developing pelvic
      organ prolapse if their mothers or sisters were suffering from the condition3,4.

      Available pelvic organ prolapse treatments are conservative - aimed at prevention or symptom
      management; or surgical, which aim to repair and strengthen the tissues that support the
      prolapse. Most often prescribed conservative treatment option is the use of vaginal
      pessaries, which are inserted into the vagina to provide support to the prolapsed tissue.
      Although this approach can help with easing symptoms, it has been connected with low rates of
      long-term patient compliance5.

      Surgical approaches for pelvic organ prolapse rely on tissue reconstruction either by a
      native tissue suture application, or by tissue repairs augmented with permanent synthetic
      mesh or a biological graft 6 , either via transvaginal or abdominal route.

      It has been estimated that a life-time risk for having prolapse surgery is up to 19% 7. These
      surgeries represent a significant financial burden on the health system -the annual direct
      cost for prolapse surgery in the USA was more than 1 billion USD8 . In recent years, surgical
      management of pelvic organ prolapse has been under increased scrutiny due to frequent
      complications and adverse events following tissue repair using synthetic polypropylene meshes
      9. Limitations or complete bans on surgical repair using synthetic meshes followed in many
      countries 10. As a result, patients are now more reluctant than ever to have surgery for
      their prolapse.

      For the reasons stated above, there is an urgent need for new non-surgical therapies for
      pelvic organ prolapse. One of the more promising approaches in recent years has been the
      introduction of vaginal erbium laser treatment for pelvic organ prolapse 11,12. Vaginal
      erbium laser with SMOOTH™ mode utilises thermal pulsing to elevate the temperature of upper
      mucosal layers and strengthen the vaginal wall connective tissue supporting the prolapse, as
      well as the whole vaginal canal12,13. It has been shown to improve the tissue quality and to
      alleviate the symptoms of various disorders that arise from pelvic floor dysfunction,
      including stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse11,12, 13,14,15,16,17,18.

      Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence frequently coexist - majority of
      patients diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence also have a degree of pelvic organ
      prolapse and vice-versa19. Similarly to prolapse, SUI therapies can be either conservative,
      mainly including some form of pelvic floor muscle therapy, or surgical, in most cases
      consisting of midurethral synthetic sling insertion. Although conservative approaches have
      been shown effective, they suffer from low patient compliance - Schiøtz et al have shown that
      10 years after initiating conservative therapy, 85% of patients discontinued treatment 20.

      We have been using the vaginal erbium laser in our practice since 2013 with very good
      outcomes in women with pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. The primary aim
      of the present retrospective study is to analyse the patient data from our clinical practice
      to objectively assess the effectiveness of vaginal erbium laser with SMOOTH mode for the
      treatment of patients with pelvic organ prolapse and co-existing stress urinary incontinence,
      if present.
