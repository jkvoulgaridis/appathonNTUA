  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the project are to develop and test a Spanish language, mobile app for
      smoking cessation called Impacto.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 38 Spanish-speaking, Latinx smokers with high anxiety sensitivity (AS) will be
      recruited for this project. Eight (8) participants will complete user interviews in Spanish
      and thirty (30) participants will participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for
      smoking cessation. Participants will be randomized to receive either the Impacto mobile app
      or a generic, Spanish language, smoking cessation, mobile app control (Dejar de Fumar
      Asistente).

    <description>Dejar de Fumar Asistente (English version called: Quit Tracker: Stop Smoking) is a popular, free third party mobile application aimed at helping smokers quit smoking. This is the mobile app that will serve as the control condition in evaluating the efficacy of Impacto. This mobile app is well established as a smoking cessation app for Spanish-speaking, Latinx smokers. The app includes smoking cessation components but does not have a specific emphasis on anxiety sensitivity.</description>
