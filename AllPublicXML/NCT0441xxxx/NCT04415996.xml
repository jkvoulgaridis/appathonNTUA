    <textblock>
      In this double-blinded study, the objective is to determine the effects of bilateral High
      Velocity Low Amplitude (HVLA) technique on L3/L4 joint in baropodometric pressures in 60
      healthy young adults.

      The postural control it´s a fundamental aspect to understand the human´s capacity to perform
      activities. These balance is controlled by several mechanisms such as the proprioceptive
      system of muscles and articulation joints.

      It is known that the High Velocity Low Amplitude (HVLA) technique shows biomechanical and
      neurophysiologic effects.

      By saying that, it is importance to understand the effects of the lumbar manipulation on
      body´s weight distribution. Therefore, there is going to be measure several variables such as
      center of pressure oscillation , plantar pressure distribution and plantar contact area using
      a pressure platform.

    <description>To obtain the center of pressure displacement measurements, it will be used Emed / CL program. This outcome will be measured either in sagittal plane in anteroposterior direction (x-axis) and in frontal plane in medial-lateral direction (y-axis) The participant will be standing in Emed pressure platform in upright position,with relaxed mouth, upper limbs along the body and feet shoulder-width apart, looking to an object standing 1 meter in front of participant´s eyes during 60 seconds. The Emed/ CL program will determine the This procedure will be repeated 3 times. The participant will rest sited on chair during 30 seconds between each measurements evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of plantar pressure mean</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Plantar pressure mean is measure by Emed / CL program. It´s the average of all pressure values for each measurement, divided by the number of measurements for each sensor. The pressure unit used is Kilopascals (kPa).
The participant will be standing in Emed pressure platform in upright position,with relaxed mouth, upper limbs along the body and feet shoulder-width apart, looking to an object standing 1 meter in front of participant´s eyes during 60 seconds. This procedure will be repeated 3 times. The participant will rest sited on chair during 30 seconds between each measurements evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of plantar contact area</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Plantar contact area corresponds to the measurement of the contact region of the foot with the platform sensors. It is determined by the sum of the area of all sensors activated within a given region.The plantar contact area unit is cm2 (square centimeters) The participant will be standing in Emed pressure platform in upright position,with relaxed mouth, upper limbs along the body and feet shoulder-width apart, looking to an object standing 1 meter in front of participant´s eyes during 60 seconds. This procedure will be repeated 3 times. The participant will rest sited on chair during 30 seconds between each measurements evaluation.</description>

    <description>In each participant, blind assessors will perform pre-intervention measurements of dislocation of center of pressure (CoP), plantar pressure mean and plantar contact area in a baropodometric pressure platform.
Next, the investigator will perform the HVLA technique in L3/L4 joint articulation.
Then, the same measurements before described will be repeated, by the assessors 1 minute after the intervention.</description>

    <description>The participant will be lateral decubitus and the investigator will locate the third lumbar vertebra. Then with one hand the investigator will contact the interspinous space underlying L3 and with the other hand he will take the top leg into flexion until the investigator feels tension in L3/L4 joint. Then he puls the tables´s arm until felling tension in the region to be manipulated. Afterwards the investigator will globally rotate the participant in the horizontal plane and will approach to the L3/L4 joint. With one arm the investigator will contact the deltopectoral groove and with the other one will contact the external iliac fossa. Finally, the investigator will compress and rotate the pelvis and will apply an impulse in a rapid rotation, without losing the parameters with a &quot;body drop&quot; allowed by the flexion of the knees and the contraction of the large pectorals.</description>
