    <textblock>
      The Canadian Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma Study 1 is a randomized clinical trial that aims to
      compare two initial treatment options - Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) and
      Phacoemulsification (PHACO) - in newly diagnosed patients with pseudoexfoliation and need to
      lower the intraocular pressure. Patients with pseudoexfoliation and a recent decision to
      lower the intraocular pressure, who also have early asymptomatic lens opacification will be
      recruited and randomized to receive either SLT or PHACO. Patients will be followed for 2
      years according to a target IOP protocol based on the Canadian Ophthalmological Society
      Glaucoma guidelines. Patients who do not achieve the target IOP with the initial
      randomization procedure will receive IOP lowering medications. The main outcome of interest
      will be the proportion of subjects who need IOP lowering medications after 2 years. Secondary
      outcomes include IOP reduction, time to need medications, patient reported outcomes in terms
      of visual function, and occurrence of adverse effects. To obtain longer follow-up information
      beyond two years, a chart review will be done 5 and 10 years after randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, detected at slit-lamp examination by exfoliative material
             on anterior capsule, pupil, or anterior chamber angle

          2. Clinical decision to lower the IOP, as assessed by the investigator who is treating
             the subject, based on the presence of PXG or with IOP elevated enough to warrant
             treatment, even without clear evidence of optic nerve damage or visual field defect

          3. Presence of asymptomatic early cataract

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 50 years old

          2. Anterior chamber angle closure at gonioscopy, defined as pigmented trabeculum visible
             in less than 180ยบ

          3. Previous IOP lowering procedure such as trabeculoplasty, trabeculectomy, or minimally
             invasive glaucoma surgery

          4. Previous use of IOP lowering medication for more than 6 months

          5. Presence of ocular or systemic pathology or medication that could significantly
             influence the IOP, such as: uveitis, neovascular or traumatic glaucoma, corneal
             pathology influencing tonometry, use of oral steroids

          6. IOP at baseline visit higher than 36 mmHg

          7. Visual field damage at baseline visit with mean deviation worse than -15 dB

          8. Not able or willing to provide voluntary, informed consent to participate in the study
