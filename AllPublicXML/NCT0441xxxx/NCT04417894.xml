    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of dupilumab on skin lesions in
      patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the efficacy of dupilumab on various other domains (pruritus, pain, sleep
           loss, health related QoL, work life impairment, mental health) in patients with atopic
           hand and foot dermatitis

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupilumab administered to patients with
           atopic hand and foot dermatitis

        -  To evaluate systemic exposure and immunogenicity of dupilumab in patients with atopic
           hand and foot dermatitis

        -  To assess the effect of dupilumab on circulating markers of type 2 inflammation in
           atopic hand and foot dermatitis
