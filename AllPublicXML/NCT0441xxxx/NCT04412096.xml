  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness. The inability to predict a patient's IOP response to
      medications is a critical barrier for the clinician to consistently provide highly effective
      IOP-based treatments. Current trial-and-error approaches to glaucoma management are
      inefficient and have not addressed this barrier as there are no predictive factors for drug
      response. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes by identifying biomarkers and
      environmental factors that profile a patient at risk for glaucoma by age-of-onset, rate of
      disease progression, &quot;poor response&quot; to treatment, and large IOP fluctuation. Our purpose of
      this research project is to address this critical barrier by focusing on physiological
      factors that predict IOP response to drugs.

      This proposal responded to PA-18-351 &quot;Human Subjects Mechanistic and Minimal Risk Studies&quot;
      and qualifies as a clinical trial. The central hypothesis is that variations in IOP response
      to glaucoma drugs and IOP fluctuation can be predicted by the aqueous humor dynamic (AHD)
      factors that regulate IOP. This hypothesis will be tested in up to 200 participants with
      ocular hypertension (OHT) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG). This hypothesis will be tested in two
      aims: Aim 1, Test the hypothesis that AHD factors predict the IOP drug response; Aim 2, Test
      the hypothesis that aqueous flow and outflow facility predict IOP fluctuation.

      The objective is to determine which AHD factors predict a participant's IOP drug response and
      IOP fluctuation. The scientific rationale is that AHD parameters (aqueous flow, outflow
      facility, episcleral venous pressure, and uveoscleral flow) determine drug response and IOP
      fluctuation.

      The primary endpoint is IOP response to glaucoma drugs. Exploratory outcome measures include
      IOP fluctuation and the AHD measures.

      The study population includes participants who have either OHT or OAG. The inclusion and
      exclusion criteria described in 5.3, Study Population. The goal is to recruit 150-200
      participants over 4 years.

      All drugs and instruments used in this study have been FDA approved.

      Three sites will enroll participants: Mayo Clinic, The Ohio State University, and University
      of Nebraska Medical Center. All sites have experience and expertise with AHD studies in
      humans. These study team members have productive collaborations during AHD studies in
      controls during the prior NIH funding period. There are no sites outside of the United
      States.

      The experimental design is a prospective, open-label, clinical trial with randomized cross
      over treatment using the topical glaucoma medications, timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005%.
      Timolol 0.5% is a beta-blocker and will be dosed as one drop two times a day. Latanoprost
      0.005% is a prostaglandin analogue and will be dosed as one drop daily in the evening. The
      treatment order will depend on randomization.

      AHD measurements are performed at baseline without glaucoma medications. The AHD measurements
      include IOP, aqueous humor flow, outflow facility, and episcleral venous pressure.
      Uveoscleral outflow is calculated. Some participants who are already taking glaucoma
      medications will be washed out in order to assess baseline AHD measurements. An IOP safety
      check will be scheduled for those who are washed out of their glaucoma Rx. After baseline AHD
      measurements, the AHD measurements are repeated after each of the 7-day drug interventions to
      determine the effect of the drug treatment on AHD variables.

      There are six study visits, Visits 1 - 6, that include clinical testing, surveys, and AHD
      procedures (see 1.2 Schema). Participants will be trained to use the Icare® HOME tonometer to
      measure IOP outside of clinic to assess IOP fluctuation.

      The study design is a prospective, open-label, randomized order of 7-days treatments with
      timolol 0.5% (1 drop two times daily) followed by a washout period and then with latanoprost
      0.005% (1 drop daily in the evening) or vice versa. These are referred to as Tx 1 and Tx 2.
      IOP safety checks during washout are included for those already taking glaucoma Rx upon
      entering the study. IOP response will be determined to each of these medications. AHD factors
      will be determined for both study treatments using tonometry, fluorophotometry, tonography,
      and episcleral venomanometry. IOP fluctuation will be assessed using the FDA-approved Icare®
      HOME tonometer. All test procedures and drugs are FDA approved. There are no experimental
      tests or agents.

      Sample sizes and power calculations provide rigor to test the hypothesis.

      A REDCap database is populated from data on case report forms (CRF), surveys, and the Icare®
      HOME tonometer. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics of central tendencies and
      dispersion, and regression methods in order to understand the individual data in the
      distribution of the cohort.

    <intervention_model_description>The overall study design is a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial with randomized order of 7-day treatments with timolol followed by a washout period and then with latanoprost or vice versa. Participants will undergo two 7-day treatments, with timolol 0.5% (1 drop two times daily) and latanoprost 0.005% (1 drop daily in the evening). The order of timolol and latanoprost will be randomized. The IOP, AHD parameters and IOP fluctuation will be compared in an individual under three conditions: (i) baseline, and after a randomized order of 7-day treatment of (ii) timolol 0.5% 1 drop two times daily and (iii) latanoprost 0.005% 1 drop in the evening separated by a 6-week washout period. The overall time commitment to complete these procedures is three to four months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Eye pressure is a steady state quantitative trait that is measured in mm Hg. Eye pressure is determined by the following physiological factors (units of measure): eye fluid or aqueous humor production (microliters/minute), aqueous humor outflow (microliters/minute), outflow resistance (microliters/minute/mm Hg) and venous pressure (mm Hg) of the eye. All of these physiological factors will be determined under baseline condition and under glaucoma drug treatment.</description>
