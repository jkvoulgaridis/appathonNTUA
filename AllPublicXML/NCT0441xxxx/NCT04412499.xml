  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a frequent disorder in children
      and adolescents. The diagnosis is clinical with the input of several informants (child,
      family, teachers, …). ADHD is a risk factor for academic difficulties, school dropout, social
      isolation, injury, oppositional behaviour. In school-age children and adolescents having
      moderate to high or persistent impairment despite psycho-educational support and
      environmental modification, the first-line treatment is methylphenidate. Group or individual
      cognitive behavioural therapy for parents and/or children and adolescents is recommended for
      co-occurring disorders and persistent impairment. In France, the initiation of
      methylphenidate requires an annual hospital prescription by a paediatrician or psychiatrist,
      and a regular medical supervision (weight, heart rate, blood pressure, …). At least once a
      year, the indication of methyphenidate needs to be re-evaluated and confirmed at the
      hospital. In case of lack of efficiency and/or poor tolerance, therapeutic alternatives
      including non-psychostimulants should be considered.

      A randomized controlled trial evaluated the dose of methylphenidate received over a period of
      13 months. It was observed that the &quot;combined treatment&quot; group (methylphenidate +
      psychosocial treatments) received a lower average dose of methylphenidate than the
      &quot;methylphenidate alone&quot; group. These results are difficult to extrapolate to the general
      population, due to the study protocol (regular monitoring of ADHD symptoms with the aim of
      total remission).

      For a global consideration of children's needs, it is important to better understand the
      interactions between these two therapeutic approaches.

      To participate in the study, parents will have to complete an online questionnaire. This
      questionnaire contains anamnestic data collection, questionnaires to assess ADHD symptoms and
      parenting practices.
