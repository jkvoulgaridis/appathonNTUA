  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of mHealth tools on antiretroviral (ART)
      adherence and persistence among HIV-infected individuals with co-occurring cocaine use
      disorders (CUDs).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct qualitative assessments using focus groups of people living with HIV (PLH) who use
      cocaine and healthcare providers that will assess the acceptability, feasibility,
      facilitators and barriers of implementing mHealth interventions; and will aid in developing
      the final design and content of both automated and clinician feedback in preparation for
      designing a pilot feasibility study.

      To conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility RCT among PLH with co-occurring CUDs that will examine
      the impact of mHealth tools (cellular-enabled smart pill boxes and cell phones) and feedback
      (no feedback vs. automated feedback vs. automated + clinician feedback) on primary (ART
      adherence and persistence) and secondary outcomes (HIV viral suppression, cocaine use,
      retention in HIV care).
