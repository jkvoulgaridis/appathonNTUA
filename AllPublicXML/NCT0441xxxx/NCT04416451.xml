    <description>Patients will be treated with an Induction phase of rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks. Patients will undergo restaging imaging after the last of 4 weekly rituximab doses and before beginning venetoclax. Based on post-rituximab restaging studies, patients will be risk-stratified for risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) and treated in the appropriate setting with TLS prophylaxis per institutional TLS guide lines starting at week 5. Oral venetoclax will follow a ramp-up dosing schedule and will be taken daily after 4 weeks of rituximab therapy. Following the 4-week ramped-up phase of venetoclax, patients will begin their target dose of venetoclax and continue for a maximum of 24 months. In addition, patients will receive rituximab 375 mg/m2 starting on day 1 of the maintenance phase and repeated once every 3 months for 12 months. Venetoclax may be continued after this period if patient has not achieved a complete remission</description>

    <description>Induction:Rituximab will be administered per institutional guidelines once per week for 4 weeks at a dose of 375 mg/m^2. Maintenance: In addition, patients will receive rituximab 375 mg/m2 starting on day 1 of the maintenance phase and repeated once every 3 months for 12 months (for a total of 4 infusions). On days when venetoclax and rituximab will both be administered, patients will take venetoclax prior to administration of rituximab.</description>

    <description>Induction: Starting one week after the last induction dose of rituximab (approximately week 5), venetoclax will be administered orally at a flat dose of 100 mg daily and escalating each week to a target dose of 800 mg daily on the following schedule:
Week 1: 100 mg
Week 2: 200 mg
Week 3: 400 mg
Week 4: 800 mg Maintenance: Following the 4-week induction phase ramp-up of venetoclax, patients will begin their target dose of 800 mg venetoclax daily and continue this dose during the 24- month maintenance treatment phase. On days when venetoclax and rituximab will both be administered, patients will take venetoclax prior to administration of rituximab.</description>

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             development and unknown effects of venetoclax on embryonic development. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with venetoclax, breastfeeding should be discontinued.

             clarithromycin) within 7 days prior to the first dose of venetoclax.

          -  Received moderate or strong CYP3A inducers (such as rifampin, carbamazepine,
