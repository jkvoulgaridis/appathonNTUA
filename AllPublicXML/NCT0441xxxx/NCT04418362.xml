      A mixed methods proof of concept study to ascertain the effectiveness of a home-based
      self-administered neurofeedback intervention to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of
      chronic pain.

    <textblock>
      In order to address the growing problem of chronic pain management in the UK, a proof of
      concept/feasibility open label study has been devised to test a home-based self-administered
      non-pharmacological treatment utilising neurofeedback training with a headset and
      tablet-based software application.

      This study will include individuals suffering from various types of chronic pain, measuring
      changes in pain intensity alongside associated symptoms (depression, anxiety, sleep, and
      quality of life) by utilising a purpose-built software application and headset that is easy
      to use and structurally robust.

      Twenty participants will take part in pre-intervention quantitative assessments measuring the
      primary and secondary symptoms of chronic pain. This will be followed by one-to-one remote
      training where they will be provided with detailed instructions on how to self-administer the
      neurofeedback training in the comfort of their own homes. They will then take part in 4-6
      training sessions per week over an 8-week period.

      Post- intervention quantitative assessments will be conducted alongside a qualitative
      analysis of the experience of doing neurofeedback training for chronic pain. Participant
      feedback on how the protocol, equipment and research could be improved will also be recorded
      to inform further research.

      Participants will also take part in online follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after
      the intervention. Any adjustments to pain medication will also be recorded over this period.
      It is anticipated this study will provide initial evidence of the safety, efficacy,
      reliability and validity of a low-cost non-pharmacological solution to the physical,
      psychological and social difficulties experienced by individuals with chronic pain, with a
      view to a larger subsequent multisite trial.
