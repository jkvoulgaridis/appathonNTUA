    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-period, cross-over Phase 2 study, comparing PK, and assessing
      safety and tolerability and efficacy of peripheral and central intravenous administration of
      melflufen in patients with RRMM. It is an international study, enrolling patients in US and
      Europe. The study will enroll patients following at least 2 lines of prior therapy.
