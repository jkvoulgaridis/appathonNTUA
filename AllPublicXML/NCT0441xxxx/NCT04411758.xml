  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of alcoholic propolis extract on inflammation in participants with
      CKD.

      Specific objectives

      To assess before and after the intervention period:

        -  The expression of transcription factors (Nrf2 and NF-kB), antioxidant enzymes (NQO1,
           HO-1), NLRP3 receptor, PPAR-γ, as well as the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,
           TNF-α, PCR , IL-1B, IL 18) and VCAM and E-selectin adhesion molecules;

        -  The levels of protein expression of inflammatory markers and antioxidant enzymes;

        -  The profile of the intestinal microbiota of stool samples from the research
           participants;

        -  Plasma levels of substances reactive to thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and oxidized LDL as
           a marker of oxidative stress;

        -  Routine and anthropometric laboratory variables, indicative of the metabolic profile of
           the research participants;

        -  Assess blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, recovery heart rate and chair lift test to
           assess the functional capacity of the research participants;

        -  Assess atherogenic risk;

        -  Food intake and nutritional status; Compare data between the intervention and control
           groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has chronic systemic inflammation as an important component of
      multifactorial origin, a factor related to both the progression and outcomes of CKD, being
      involved in all causes of mortality in these patients, such as cardiovascular disease. In
      this context, some nutritional strategies have been proposed as an adjuvant therapeutic
      alternative to modulate inflammation, starting from the consolidated knowledge of the role of
      nutrients and bioactive compounds on the expression of genes related to inflammation and
      oxidative stress, factors that feed on each other. In view of this scenario, propolis, a
      substance made up of a combination of several chemical components with broad potential
      biological activity, appears as a promising alternative to modulate inflammation in patients
      with CKD. However, clinical evidence to assess the effects of propolis in patients with CKD
      is scarce, and there are no studies that have investigated its effects on gene expression and
      markers related to inflammation in these patients. Thus, the present project proposes a
      longitudinal study of the clinical trial type that aims to evaluate the effects of propolis
      alcoholic extract on transcription factors and inflammatory markers in patients with CKD.

The control group will not receive any intervention in those first two months, and then the groups will be crossed and will receive the same amount of propolis as the first group.</intervention_model_description>
