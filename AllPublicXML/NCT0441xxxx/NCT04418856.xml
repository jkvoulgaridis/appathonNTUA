  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe fatigue, depression, sleep problems and cognitive impairment are the most commonly
      reported side effects of cancer treatment. These aversive side effects are hypothesized to be
      related to the disruption of circadian rhythms associated with cancer and its treatment.
      Exposure to Bright White Light (BWL) has been found to synchronize the circadian activity
      rhythms but research with cancer patients has been scarce. Therefore, the proposed randomized
      control trial (RCT) will test if systematic light exposure (sLE) will minimize overall levels
      of cancer-related fatigue (CRF), depression, sleep problems and cognitive impairment among
      breast cancer patients undergoing breast cancer treatment (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy). SLE
      incorporates the delivery of harmless UV-protected BWL or Dim White Light (DWL - standard
      comparison in light studies) delivered to patients by using special glasses for 30 minutes
      each morning, during their treatment. The proposed study, including a delineated comparison
      condition, will investigate the effects of BWL on CRF, sleep, depression, cognition,
      circadian rhythms, and inflammation markers among patients undergoing breast cancer
      treatment. The proposed RCT could have major public health relevance as it will determine if
      an easy-to-deliver, inexpensive, and low patient burden intervention reduces common side
      effects (e.g., CRF, depression, cognitive impairment) of cancer treatment (i.e., surgery,
      chemotherapy).

      Aim 1 - Assess whether Bright White Light (BWL) compared with Dim White Light (DWL) among
      breast cancer patients undergoing breast cancer treatment will minimize overall levels of
      CRF, depression, sleep problems, and cognitive impairment during and after breast cancer
      treatment.

      Aim 2 - Determine whether the BWL intervention affects cortisol rhythms, circadian activity
      rhythms, melatonin rhythms, and inflammation markers that have been identified as
      correlates/causes of cancer-related side effects (e.g., CRF, depression, sleep problems).

      Aim 3 - Exploratory: Explore whether the effects of BWL compared to DWL on the cancer-related
      side effects (e.g., CRF, cognitive impairment) are mediated by the beneficial effects of the
      BWL in synchronizing circadian rhythms.

      Aim 4 - Exploratory: Explore potential moderators of the intervention including seasonality,
      chronobiology, personality, and social factors.

The second subtask consists of naming colored pads and in the third subtask the participants say the font color in which the color names are written in, which do not necessarily match. Stroop has been found to be stable across the one- and two week period with a test-retest coefficient of 0.83 for the Word task, 0.74 for the Color task and 0.67 for the Color Word task.</description>

    <description>The Word Fluency test measures executive functioning and semantic abilities of the participants. This test is the Icelandic equivalent of the standard F-A-S test, employing the letters H and S since they are the most frequent letters in Icelandic. The initial part of the test consists of phonemic fluency tasks where the participants say as many words beginning with the letter H as fast as they possibly can in one minute, followed by the letter S. The latter part of the test measures semantic fluency where the participants are instructed to do the same but with animal names. The test has shown good internal consistency (α=.83) and test-retest reliability of .74.</description>

    <measure>Urinary Melatonin</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Production of pineal melatonin can be inferred from urinary 6 sulfatoxymelatonin (major metabolite of melatonin in urine). Urinary aMT6s (ng/mg Creatinine) will be measured by a competitive ELISA kit. Total excretion of aMT6s is calculated by multiplying the assayed concentration by the volume of urine voided. The aMT6s profiles will be analyzed using cosinor analysis, which is based on the least square approximation of the time series using a cosine function with a period of 24 h. The following parameters will be calculated: 1) acrophase time: time of the peak aMT6s concentration; 2) mesor: mean aMT6s value for all the samples included in the cosinor analysis and 3) amplitude: difference between the mesor and the peak aMT6s level.</description>
