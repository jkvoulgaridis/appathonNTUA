  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing thoracotomy in thoracic surgery are prone to have complications of
      delayed recovery from general anesthesia and perioperative instable hemodynamics due to the
      relatively invasive procedures and patient's underlying morbidity. Therefore, intraoperative
      monitoring and corresponding management are of great importance to prevent relevant
      complications in thoracic surgery. This study aims to investigate the clinical benefits of
      two intraoperative monitoring techniques in patients undergoing thoracotomy surgery,
      including depth of anesthesia and minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring. First,
      M-Entropy system will be used to measure the depth of anesthesia and be evaluated regarding
      the effect of spectral entropy guidance on postoperative recovery. Second, we will apply
      ProAQT device in guiding goal-directed hemodynamic therapy and assess its impact on
      occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications and recovery. In this study, we will
      conduct a factorial parallel randomized controlled trial and use the method of stratified
      randomization to evaluate both two monitoring technologies in the same patient group. The
      results of this study will provide important evidence and clinical implication for precision
      anesthesia and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol in thoracic surgery.

    <description>This includes atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumonia, empyema, pulmonary embolism, re-operation, and respiratory failure. The diagnosis of atelectasis and pleural effusion will be made based on routinely performed chest radiographs on postoperative days 1 and 3. Pneumonia will be diagnosed if a patient presents with fever, leukocytosis and new infiltrates on chest radiography. Pleural empyema and pulmonary embolism will be confirmed by spiral computed tomography scan. Respiratory failure is defined as described in the protocol.</description>
