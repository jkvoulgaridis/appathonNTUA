    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a multilevel human papillomavirus (HPV) self-testing intervention
      works in increasing cervical cancer screening among women in Appalachia. Most cases of
      cervical cancer occur among unscreened and underscreened women. A multilevel HPV self-testing
      intervention may help to improve cervical cancer screening rates.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing cervical cancer screening.

      II. Assess the fidelity, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      III. Determine satisfaction with the intervention at the patient- and provider-levels.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: During year 2, participants receive the HPV self-testing intervention consisting of
      mailed HPV self-test devices. Participants also receive an information about cervical cancer.
      Participants who do not return their self-test within a few weeks receive telephone-based
      patient navigation. Participants then complete a satisfaction survey and have their medical
      record reviewed. During years 3-5, this intervention is repeated among women who remain
      unscreened/underscreened.

      GROUP II: During year 2, participants receive usual care consisting of a reminder letter to
      get a clinic-based cervical cancer screening test and information about cervical cancer.
      During years 3-5, participants receive the HPV self-testing intervention described for Group
      I.

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The patient-level effectiveness will be whether or not women get &quot;screened&quot; during the project. Will examine the proportion of women from year 2 screened, and use an intent-to-treat approach. To compare treatment groups (Group 1 versus Group 2), will use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to account for the correlation between women from the same clinic. Will examine the proportion of HPV self-test returners who returned their self-test following receipt of patient navigation (PN). Will use GLMMs with a logit link to examine potential differences in the proportion of women screened across project years within each treatment group (i.e., comparing years 2, 3, 4, and 5 for Group 1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Equitableness of HPV intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To assess if the intervention is equitable, will examine patient characteristics. Will use GLMMs with a logit link to examine if patient characteristics are associated with women being categorized as &quot;screened&quot;. Participant characteristics will primarily be demographic characteristics (e.g., age).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of HPV intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will descriptively examine data from the patient satisfaction survey to see if women report any issues about using their HPV self-test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity of HPV intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will develop an electronic tracking system to track all mailings (e.g., self-test distribution) and other data collection activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustainability of HPV intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will examine the screening rates during the Sustainability phase(s) for both Groups 1 and 2 to determine sustainability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness of HPV intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted from a payer perspective.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with HPV self-testing and PN</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-level satisfaction data will come from the patient satisfaction surveys sent to women. Will examine satisfaction with both the HPV self-test device (appearance, usability, return process, etc.) and its instructions (appearance, readability, etc.).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with provider education sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Provider-level satisfaction data will come from the post-test surveys from provider education sessions. All satisfaction items will use 5-point Likert response scales.</description>
