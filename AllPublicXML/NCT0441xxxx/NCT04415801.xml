  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated removal and re-placement of healing and prosthetic abutments result in frequent
      injuries to the soft tissues. The purpose was to evaluate the effect of repeated removal and
      re-placement of laser microgrooved and smooth/machined healing and prosthetic abutments
      during restorative stages, and 1 year after functional loading, on proinflammatory cytokine
      levels around dental implants.

      Twenty-four patients each received 2 one-stage implants in a split mouth design on the same
      jaw. In each patient one healing and prosthetic abutments with a laser microgrooved surface
      (LMS group) and one healing and prosthetic abutments with smooth/machined surface (S/MS
      group) were used. Four months following implant placement [Baseline (BSL)], the healing
      abutments were disconnnected and reconnected three times to carry out the impression
      procedures and metal framework try-in. Four weeks later (T0), definitive prosthetic abutments
      were installated with screw retained crowns. Samples for immunological analyses were taken
      from the sulcus around each implant at BSL, T0, and 1 year after functional loading (T1).
      Peri-implant crevicular fluid samples were analyzed for interleukin-1beta (IL-1β),
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels using the ELISA kit.
