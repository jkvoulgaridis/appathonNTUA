      This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of retreatment with CTL019/CTL119 in
      patients with late relapse of B-cell lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and efficacy of retreatment
      with CTL019/CTL119 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells in patients who have late
      relapse of diffuse large B-cell or follicular lymphoma after achieving complete remission
      from prior CTL019/CTL119 treatment. Patients eligible for this protocol will have been
      treated initially with CTL019/CTL119 under UPCC13413/NCT02030834, have experienced a durable
      complete response (defined as ≥ 6 months duration), and have a residual manufactured
      CTL019/CTL119 product available. This protocol will serve subjects with no available
      potentially curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation) who have a limited prognosis (months to &lt; 2 year expected survival) with
      available therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma or Follicular lymphoma, previously identified as CD19+

          2. Previously treated on UPCC13413/ NCT02030834 with CTL019/CTL119, with historical
             manufactured product available at Penn for reinfusion

          3. Previous complete response to CAR T-cells with a duration ≥ 6 months (defined as 168
             days)

          4. No available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic HSCT) with
             limited prognosis (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) with currently available
             therapies.

          5. Age ≥18 years

             Malignant Lymphoma&quot; (Cheson et al., J. Clin. Onc., 2007)88. Patients in complete
             remission with no evidence of disease are not eligible.

         10. Performance status (ECOG) 0 or 1.

         13. Provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled active infection.

          2. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          3. Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as
             outlined.

          4. Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association
             Classification (see Appendix 1).

          5. HIV infection.

          6. Patients with active CNS involvement by malignancy. Patients with prior CNS disease
             that has been effectively treated will be eligible providing treatment was &gt;4 weeks
             before enrollment

          7. Patients with a known history or prior diagnosis of optic neuritis or other
             immunologic or inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system.
