      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic
      transplantation of hAESCs for Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      The study plans to recruit 3 Parkinson's disease participants. Using stereotactic technology,
      hAESCs are accurately transplanted into the lateral ventricle. Therapeutic effect and safety
      of hAESCs on PD will be evaluated. hAESCs are derived from placental amnion donated after
      cesarean section in healthy women. hAESCs is developed from the epiblast as early as 8 days
      after fertilization, recent reports indicate that hAESCs have some neural stem cell
      characteristics, can differentiate into dopaminergic neurons and secrete dopamine and various
      neurotrophic factors, which could be seen as one of the best potential stem cell source for
      treating Parkinson's disease.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least one of the following serious criteria: • fatal • life threatening • requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • congenital anomaly/birth defect • other significant medical hazard. Whether an adverse event was treatment-related (TRAE) or not was determined by investigator.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 7, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month.</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS is used for evaluating the impairment and disability associated with Parkinson Disease (PD). It consists of four sections: (1) Mentation, behavior, and mood; (2) Activities of daily living (ADLs); (3) Motor; and (4) Complications.
The UPDRS scores range from 0 to 199, with higher scores indicating greater disability. The total score is contained from the addition of scores of each section.</description>

    <time_frame>day 0, day 7, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Hoehn and Yahr scale is used to provide a general estimate of clinical function of PD patients, combining functional deficits (disability) and objective signs (impairment). The Hoehn and Yahr scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher dysfunction of PD patients.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 7, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month.</time_frame>
    <description>(PDQ-39) provides the evidence of the quality of life of a PD patient. The higher the score, the lower the quality of life of PD patients.</description>

    <time_frame>day 0, day 7, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month.</time_frame>
    <description>The Schwab and England scale develop a scale that describes the capacity of daily living shown by a PD patient. It measures the following three areas: dependence, abilities, and awareness. The Schwab and England scores range from 0% to 100%, with higher scores indicating greater healthy status.</description>
