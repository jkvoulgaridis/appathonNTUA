  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open trial, unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients that failed at least second-line
      treatment and overexpressed EGFR were enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental
      group and control group at a 1: 1 ratio.,who received Larotinib and the chemotherapy regimen
      chosen by the investigator (Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection or Tegafur Gimeracil Oteracil
      Potassium Capsule),respecitively.The median survival time of the control group is expected to
      be 5.5 months, and the median survival time of the experimental group can be extended to 8.0
      months, at an overall significance level of α = 0.05 (both sides), and assuming the duration
      at 14 months and 8 months of follow-up, at least 314 OS events must be collected to achieve
      91% confidence.Under the assumption that the annual shedding rate is 5%, it is calculated
      that this test needs to enroll 416 subjects,208 patients in each group.

      Random stratification factors includes the number of previous treatment lines (2 vs ≥ 3); the
      number of organ transfers (≤ 1 vs ≥ 2); ECOG score (0 vs 1).

      Subjects are administered until disease progression assessed by the RECIST V1.1 standard
      (unless the investigator evaluates that the subject continues to have clinical benefit from
      continuing treatment, the subject may be allowed to continue treatment), and begins to
      receive new anti-tumor treatment, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or
      other conditions that meet the criteria for terminating trial treatment / withdrawal from the
      trial.

      The research phase of this study is divided into pre-screening period (~ D-28), screening
      period (D-28 ~ D-1), treatment period, treatment end visit (± 7 days after the last dose),
      safety follow-up ( Until 28 ± 7 days after the last dose) and survival follow-up.

      The experimental group and the control group were administered until the disease progression
      assessed by the RECIST V1.1 standard (unless The investigator evaluates that the subject
      continues to have clinical benefits, and the subject can be allowed to continue receiving
      treatment), start new anti-tumor therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw informed consent,
      ect.

      The research phase of this study is divided into pre-screening period (~ D-28), screening
      period (D-28 ~ D-1), treatment period, treatment end visit (± 7 days after the last dose),
      safety follow-up ( Until 28 ± 7 days after the last dose) and survival follow-up.

      Subjects who have finished the screening examination and evaluation after the screening
      period enter the treatment period, and evaluate the efficacy every 6 weeks (± 3 days).
      Subjects who have finished the treatment need to continue to undergo safety follow-up to 28
      days after the last dose (± 7 days); For subjects who have finished the trial treatment due
      to toxic reactions or other reasons (such as clinical deterioration), and have not observed
      the progression, they still need to carry out imaging evaluation according to the original
      frequency (once every 6 weeks) until the occurrence of tumor progression judged by RECIST
      V1.1 standard, start of new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of
      follow-up, death, or end of study, whichever occurs first; all subjects receive survival
      follow-up until death,lost of ,the follow-up or the study ended (whichever occurred first).

      PK studies: Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are conducted only in centers with appropriate
      conditions. Only some subjects in the experiemtal group are required to undergo a PK study.
      PK research blood collection is divided into intensive PK blood collection and sparse PK
      blood collection. Participate in intensive PK blood collection (8-12 cases), and participate
      in sparse PK blood collection (150 cases). Subjects participating in intensive PK blood
      collection do not participate in sparse PK blood collection.

      Biomarker research: Try to conduct biomarker research on tumor tissue samples for all
      subjects. Detection of tumor tissue samples: The tumor tissue samples collected before
      enrollment were subjected to EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection to
      explore the correlation between the EGFR amplification status and the efficacy of the test
      drug; subjects in the lerlotinib group at the end of treatment At that time, you can
      voluntarily choose whether to perform biopsy to detect EGFRIHC and FISH, and explore the
      relationship between its efficacy and changes in EGFR overexpression and amplification status
      before and after treatment.
