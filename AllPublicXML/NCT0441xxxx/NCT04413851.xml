  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational, feasibility study, to evaluate long term passive data
      collection, data quality, and user experience of HealthMode Agitation (Apps) to collect
      motion, location, physiological, and audio data; and eCOA and EMA responses with mobile
      devices (iPhone, Apple Watch).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and improve HealthMode Apps data collection and
      usability in subjects experiencing agitation in the context of dementia.

          -  Subjects with a recent history of agitation in the past 6 months to a point that
             impairs social activities, requires staffing or medical intervention (kick, bite,
             flailing, etc.), impairs ability for functional activities of daily living, as
             disclosed by a caregiver or documented in the medical record.

          -  Subjects resident in a group home, nursing home, or assisted living are eligible to
             participate.

          -  Subjects who can read, understand and provide written informed consent or who have a
             Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR)

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to carry a smartphone and wear an activity tracker
             on their wrist or hand, alone or with the help of a caregiver.

          -  Subjects who, either alone or with a caregiver, are able to operate a smartphone and
             wrist or hand-worn activity tracker, alone or with the help of a caregiver.

          -  Subjects who are in good general health prior to study participation as determined by
             a detailed medical history, and in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Subjects, who are able to ambulate without an assistive device, or with a single point
             cane.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to carry a smartphone and wear an activity
             tracker on their wrist or hand.

          -  Subjects with serious or unstable medical illnesses. These include current hepatic
             (moderate-severe hepatic impairment), renal, gastroenterological, respiratory,
             cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure),
             endocrinologic, neurologic or hematologic disease.
