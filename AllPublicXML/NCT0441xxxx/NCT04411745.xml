      This is a prospective observational study on normal singleton pregnant women who have no sign
      of labor at 40 weeks of gestation or pregnant women who admitted to hospital for any sign of
      labor at term, aiming to identify labor-associated markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms that instigate human parturition have not been completely understood, though
      hypotheses such as 'functional progesterone withdrawal' and inflammatory signaling have been
      proposed. Researchers including our group have previously identified panels of genes which
      were differentially expressed between placentas obtained after spontaneous birth and those
      after elective cesarean delivery. However, such findings obtained after birth could only
      reflects the late changes in parturition. Similar findings in other gestational tissues, such
      as fetal membranes, amniotic fluids, myometrial biopsies are available, but these sample
      types cannot be readily collected until delivery.

      Thus, we propose to explore biomarkers in maternal blood with a view to developing any useful
      analytes for predicting labor.

        Healthy women who are carrying a healthy singleton pregnancy, but have not yet gone to

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy women who are carrying a healthy singleton pregnancy, but have not yet gone to
        labor at 40 weeks of gestation or who are at term and admitted to hospital for any sign of
        labor are invited to join the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any obstetric contraindications for undergoing labor or vaginal delivery (e.g.
             placenta previa, cephalo-pelvic disproportion, macrosomia, previous classical cesarean
             section or uterine tear, etc).

          -  Any maternal or fetal complications that require immediate or early delivery (e.g.
             pre-eclampsia, abruption placenta, fetal distress, rupture of membranes, in utero
             death, etc).

          -  Any maternal or fetal complications that make vaginal birth an unfavorable choice
             (e.g. fetal growth restriction, fetal compromise or distress, etc).

          -  Any conditions that are known to affect the onset of labor (e.g. anencephaly).
