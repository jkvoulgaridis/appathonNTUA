  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with mental disorders often suffer from self-stigmatization. Self-stigma is associated
      with several negative outcomes such as low quality of life, lower rates of help-seeking as
      well as poorer treatment adherence. However, a lot of questionnaires only focus on specific
      mental disorders. There is no valid measurement which can be used for all kinds of mental
      disorders.

      Furthermore, much less is known about self-stigma in people with organic diseases. Only
      little attention has been given to those who may experience self-stigma because of their
      physical condition. A main reason for this may be the lack of a valid measurement of
      self-stigma among people with physical health issues.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop and validate a self-report scale which is
      capable to do both - measuring self-stigma among people with all mental disorders and among
      people with physical health issues.

      Items are derived from the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and the Behaviors from Intergroup
      Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) Map. Psychometric evaluation includes testing the reliability
      (intern consistency, test-retest reliability) and validity (exploratory and confirmatory
      factor analysis, construct validity incl. convergent and discriminant validity,
      criterion-related validity).

      Participants take part in an online survey. They answer general questions about their mental
      and physical health condition and complete measurements of quality of life, mental health,
      depression, public stigma, expected stigma, self-stigma, intention to seek help and actual
      help seeking (behavior).

    <measure>Development of the Universal Self-Stigma Scale (USSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire is based on the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske et al., 2002) and BIAS-Map (Cuddy et al., 2007) and includes three components: stereotype (warmth, competence [lower scores indicate higher self-stigma]), prejudice (emotions, e.g. contempt, pity, anger, shame [higher scores indicate higher self-stigma]), discrimination (active/passive self-harm [higher scores indicate higher self-stigma]). Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale.
Item selection via qualitative and statistical methods, e.g. item difficulty index, item discrimination index, exploratory factor analysis (EFA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Universal Self-Stigma Scale (USSS): Validity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Validation process includes confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the statistical model fit with goodness of fit indices. Convergent validity is tested with another measurement for self-stigma (ISMI) using Pearson correlations [higher correlations indicate better convergent validity]. Discriminant validity is tested with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and public stigma [lower correlations indicate better discriminant validity], criterion validity with actual help seeking behavior and health related quality of life (12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, SF-12) using Pearson correlations as well [higher correlations indicate better criterion validity].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to Seek Help</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questionaire (e.g. Yu et al., 2015) to describe the intention to seek help because of severe psychological or mental health problems as well as physical health problems (e.g. &quot;If you had severe mental health problems, would you seek help from professional sources for them?&quot;, scores from 1 [definitely yes] to 4 [definitely no]; lower scores indicate higher intentions to seek help). Reasons for not seeking help because of psychological health problems (e.g. &quot;I want to solve problems by myself.&quot;) are assessed by binary items (yes, no).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actual Help Seeking Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>8 Items to assess actual help seeking behavior. It is asked if participants have ever sought services from any professional and if they have been in therapy or received medical treatment because of psychological or physical health problems. As well as if they are using any of these services currently. Items are binary (yes, no).</description>

    <description>Self-report inventory used to screen for mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, alcohol, eating, somatoform disorders), including severity scores for depressive symptoms (0-29), anxiety symptoms (0-21) and somatic symptoms (0-30), where higher scores indicate more serve symptoms</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of depressed mood; higher total scores indicate more servere symptoms; total score (0-63); cut-offs for interpretation 0-13 (minimal depression), 14-19 (mild depression), 20-28 (moderate depression), 29-63 (severe depression)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Public Stigma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring public stigma including stereotype (cognition - warmth, competence), prejudice (emotions - pity, envy, contempt, admiration) and discrimination (behavior - active/passive harm) with 19 items based on Stereotype Content Model (Fiske et al., 2002) and BIAS Map (Cuddy et al., 2007) toward people with mental or physical health problems.
(e.g. &quot;How often do you think people in general tend to feel the following emotions toward people with a mental disorder? [pity, contempt, envy, admiration]&quot;)</description>
