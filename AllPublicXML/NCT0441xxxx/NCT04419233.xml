    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of nusinersen sodium injection
      in the postmarketing setting in China.The secondary objectives are to collect data on the
      efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of nusinersen sodium injection in the post-marketing
      setting in China.

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 up to End of Treatment (2 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieved World Health Organization (WHO) Motor Milestone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 63 and Every 4 Months Up to End of Treatment (2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), a component to assess gross motor development and is usually assessed in terms of age of achievement of motor milestones. Six distinct gross motor milestones criteria are as follows: sitting without support, hands-and-knees crawling, standing with assistance, walking with assistance, standing alone, and walking alone.</description>

    <measure>Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) Section 2 Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 63 and Every 4 Months Up to End of Treatment (2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Section 2 of the HINE is used to assess motor milestones of the participants. It is composed of 8 motor milestone categories: voluntary grasp, ability to kick in supine position, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking.</description>

             protected health information in accordance with national and local subject privacy
             regulations.

          -  The decision to newly prescribe nusinersen sodium injection according to the local
             marketing authorization, including documentation of 5q SMA diagnosis, has been made by
             the Investigator and agreed to by the participant (or legally authorized
