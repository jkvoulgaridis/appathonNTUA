  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether intensive monitoring and preemptive intervention has an positive clinical effect on
      arterio-venous fistula (AVF) maintenance is a new issue in hemodialysis (HD) patient
      management. This study aims to explore the clinical value of intensive monitoring and
      preemptive intervention on AVF, so to decide the best follow-up items and frequency.

    <description>In this group patients receive intensive monitoring and preemptive intervention. AVF surveillance refers to using non-invasive devices to check for the haemodynamic consequences of stenosis by measuring Qa every month. Clinical assessment refers to monitoring for any presence of stenosis by (i) physical examination, by means of visual inspection and presence of abnormal thrill, bruit or pulse and (ii) checking for signs of access dysfunction during dialysis: difficult cannulation, increase in dynamic arterial or venous pressure, inability to achieve the prescribed dialysis blood pump flow (Qb), prolonged bleeding after needle removal, access recirculation or a drop in Kt/V. Preemptive intervention is performed as long as problems are recognized, including health education and timely surgery.</description>
