  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn if a new type of haploidentical transplantation using
      TCR alpha beta and CD19 depleted stem cell graft from the donor is safe and effective to
      treat the patient's underlying condition. This study will use stem cells obtained via
      peripheral blood or bone marrow from parent or other half-matched family member donor. These
      will be processed through a special device called CliniMACS, which is considered
      investigational.

    <description>The incidence of engraftment at day 100 will be described based on donor chimerism in the whole blood and or fractions sorted for T-cell and myeloid subsets. The donor chimerism will be scored as autologous reconstitution (&lt; 5% donor), mixed chimerism (5-49%=low mixed, 50-95%=high mixed), &gt; 95%=full donor chimerism.</description>
