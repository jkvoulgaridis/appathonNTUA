      The purpose on this study was to determine whether the test product, Haloperidol Tablets, 2
      mg (Cycle Pharmaceuticals Ltd), and the reference product, Haloperidol Tablets, USP, 2 mg
      (Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.) are bioequivalent.

      The specific aim was to conduct a single dose, open-label, randomized, two period crossover
      pivotal study to determine the bioequivalence of two formulations containing haloperidol 2 mg
      in healthy males and females under fasting conditions

      A total of 32 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) were entered into
      the study. Volunteers were determined to be free of significant medical conditions as
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers were
      randomly allocated to a treatment sequence, before administration of investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) under fasting conditions.

      A wash-out period of at least 14 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of
      the analyte) between consecutive administrations of the investigational medicinal product
      (IP) was maintained.

      Blood samples were collected at at pre-dose (0 hours), at 30 minutes, at 1 hour, 1 hour 30
      minutes, 2 hours, 2 hours 30 minutes, 3 hours, 3 hours 30 minutes, 4 hours, 4 hours 30
      minutes, 5 hours, 5 hours 30 minutes, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, 30
      hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 168 hours and 192 hours
      post-dose (total: 26 samples per treatment period).
