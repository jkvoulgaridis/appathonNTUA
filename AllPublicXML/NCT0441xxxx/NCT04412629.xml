  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High grade neuroendocrine neoplasm patients are treated with platinum doublets such as
      carboplatin and etoposide mimicking the current guidelines for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
      Unfortunately, recurrences are common and most patients with metastatic disease succumb to it
      within a year. There is no extensive literature or consensus on second- or third-line options
      (which include FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, capecitabine and temozolomide, taxanes or immunotherapy) and
      there is urgent need for better regimens.

        progressed on first line therapy, excluding small cell lung cancer (SCLC). High grade
        includes any neuroendocrine neoplasm with a Ki-67 of &gt;=20% or with mitotic count of more
        than 20 mitoses per high power field or any poorly differentiated neoplasm or any neoplasm
        lacking these that is deemed high grade by pathology consensus, based on other markers
        (necrosis or IHC demonstrating p53 or RB mutation). This includes:

          -  High grade well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms

                       childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior
                       chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression, or other
                       reasons.

                       within the 12 months prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with
                       effective ART according to DHHS treatment guidelines is recommended.
                       Recommend exclusion of specific ART agents based on predicted drug-drug
                       interactions (i.e. for sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, concurrent strong CYP3A4
                       inhibitors (ritonavir and cobicistat) or inducers (efavirenz) should be
                       contraindicated).
