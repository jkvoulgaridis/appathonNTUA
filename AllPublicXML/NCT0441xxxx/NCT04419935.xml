  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant therapy in patients affected by NSCLC is indicated in surgically treated cases of N2
      disease, while the actual guidelines reported the possibility of a case-by-case decision in
      case of N1 involvement.

      On the other hand, the actual categorization of patients based on the hilar or mediastinal
      involvement (N1 or N2) risks to be too ineffective and straightforward for prognosis
      prediction and an indication of adjuvant treatments. This issue was underlined in the 8th TNM
      proposal for the N sub-classification, with a final proposal of different subgroups based on
      the number of involved stations. However, the IASLC committee noted that this proposal
      presented some limits due overlapping or not statistical significance among some survival
      curves, so the proposal was not adopted in the staging system. Moreover, the committee stated
      that the lack of information regarding some data such as the number of the resected or the
      metastatic nodes might affect the results and limited other proposals.

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the prognostic role of the kind of lymphadenectomy, the number of the
           resected and/or metastatic lymph nodes in surgically treated N positive patients in
           terms of survival.

        -  To evaluate the indication and the role of adjuvant treatments in these patients.

        -  To identify patients with increased risk of early recurrence or poor survival based on
           the lymph node involvement characteristics In particular, data will be collect in a
           prospective database including clinical and pathological data, kind of lymphadenectomy,
           number of resected nodes, number of metastatic nodes, kind and schedule of adjuvant
           therapy and follow-up status
