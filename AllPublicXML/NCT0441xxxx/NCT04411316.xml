  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a complication that can develop after deep vein thrombosis
      (DVT) of the lower extremities. PTS can occur at various times after the initial episode, but
      usually manifests within two years of initial DVT onset. Early and more complete thrombus
      clearance is believed by many to relieve venous outflow obstruction, preserve valvular
      function and reduce venous hypertension. Two previously published randomized controlled
      trials, the CAVENT trial and the ATTRACT trial, were larger and designed to investigate the
      efficacy of CDT. However, both of these trials included patients with iliofemoral as well as
      femoro-popliteal deep vein thrombosis. Our study will be limited to patients with iliofemoral
      deep vein thrombosis to assess whether Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis
      (PCDT) therapy utilizing AngioJet and tPA can safely and effectively reduce post thrombotic
      syndrome after 24 months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Iliofemoral DVT are theoretically at the highest risk for development of PRS
      given involvement of the major drainage pathway of both superficial femoral and deep femoral
      veins. This would not only affect the primary venous drainage, but would also compromise the
      ability to develop efficient collateral pathways. This creates higher chances of developing
      post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The proposed trial would utilize Angiojet thrombectomy
      followed by catheter directed thrombolysis and Anticoagulation compared to Anticoagulation
      alone. To assess whether Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) therapy
      utilizing AngioJet and tPA for the treatment of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis can safely
      and effectively reduce post thrombotic syndrome after 24 months.
