  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial will use the inactivated rabies virus vaccine to assess immune function in
      patients who previously underwent B cell targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell
      immunotherapy (CARTx). A cohort of healthy volunteers will also be enrolled as a comparator
      group. CARTx is a new treatment for patients with B-cell malignancies (cancer of the
      B-cells), and the long-term effects of CARTx on immune function are not yet well understood.
      Learning more about vaccine responsiveness in patients who previously underwent CARTx may
      help doctors better understand immune function. The findings will guide evidence-based
      strategies for infection prevention to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of
      high-risk individuals.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive the inactivated rabies vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and 6-10 weeks
      later. Patients also undergo a blood collection prior to each vaccine, and at approximately
      1, 2, and 4 weeks after each vaccination. A final blood collection occurs 6 months after the
      first immunization.
