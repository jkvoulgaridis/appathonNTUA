  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an single arm, open-label, phase II trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of using
      the combination of Camrelizumab with apatinib as second-line therapy for advanced PDAC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PD-1 antibody Camrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and the heavy chain is
      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the light chain is immunoglobulin κ (IgK). Camrelizumab
      specifically binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand (PD-L1),
      allowing T cells to recover against tumor immune responses.

      Response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response，disease
      control rate, drugs related side effects were recorded and analyzed, to assess the
      combination treatment could or couldn't benefit the patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
