  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These studies look to conduct efficient pilot testing of a novel intervention strategy for
      chronic psychotic disorders - Pharmacologic Augmentation of Cognitive Therapy (PACT) - via an
      experimental medicine approach. Antipsychotics are the major therapeutic tool for chronic
      psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, but do not significantly alter their course or
      real-life impact. Specific cognitive therapies achieve modest symptom reduction and improved
      function and cognition in psychosis patients, including &quot;bottom-up&quot; sensory-based targeted
      cognitive training (TCT). While benefits of TCT are evident at the group level, almost half
      of all patients demonstrate little or no cognitive gains after 30-40 hours (h) of TCT. For
      patients and clinicians, the costs and logistical complexities associated with these time-
      and resource-intensive interventions can be prohibitive. We propose and will test a novel
      &quot;augmentation strategy&quot; for using medications to specifically enhance the benefits of TCT in
      schizophrenia.

    <description>Suppressing active psychosis with antipsychotics benefits cognitive interventions for schizophrenia, but it is possible that drugs with pro-cognitive effects will specifically, and perhaps synergistically, augment the clinical benefits of cognitive therapies. A &quot;proof of concept&quot; for this approach is found in the use of the pro-extinction drugs to selectively enhance the impact of cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders. In this &quot;proof of concept&quot;, a learning-based therapy is paired with a medication that enhances a brain mechanism (extinction) that is both 1) critical to that form of learning, and 2) known to be deficient in some anxiety disorders.</description>
