    <measure>Change in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score on day 10 from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The aim is to assess the effects of Xueshuantong lyophilized powder versus placebo on reducing the neurological impairment when initiated within 72 hours of symptom onset in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. It is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <measure>The proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale grade ≤1 on day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Rankin Scale, a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. 0 - No symptoms.1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.6 - Dead. The mRS grade between 3 to 6 points are considered to be poor functional outcome.</description>
