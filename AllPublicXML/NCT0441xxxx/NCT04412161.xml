    <textblock>
      Retrospective data on 50 prospectively-collected HCC patients with beyond-Milan criteria with
      &gt;6cm tumors were analyzed. 5-year OS of 76.2% was found in patients with both AFP &lt;200 ng/ml
      and GGT &lt;104 IU/mL with tumors less than 10 cm diameter. Thus, GGT values add to AFP in
      patient prognosis.

      Background:A retrospective analysis was performed of prospectively-collected transplant data
      on outcomes of patients with large size HCCs,to examine possible prognostically-useful
      factors.Methods:A total of 50 patients having tumors greater than 6cm maximum diameter were
      identified. Their survival and full clinical characteristics were examined, with respect to
      serum AFP and GGT levels.Results:Using ROC analysis, cutoff values of AFP 200 ng/ml and GGT
      104 IU/ml were identified and used in this study. Significantly longer overall-survival and
      disease-free-survival were found for patients who had lower values of either parameter,
      compared with higher values.Even greater differences in survival were found when the 2
      parameters were combined, with best survival (5-year OS of 76,2% versus 0%, p=0.002).The most
      consistent clinical correlates for these longer survivals were degree of tumor
      differentiation and absence of microscopic portal venous invasion.Two tumor size bands were
      identified,to search for the limits of this approach with larger tumors, namely 6-10 and
      &gt;10cm.Combination parameters in 6-10cm band reflected 5-year OS of 76,2% vs. 0%,in patients
      with low AFP plus low GGT vs. other groups.Beyond 10cm,no patients had low AFP plus low
      GGT.Conclusions:AFP and GGT,both singly and together, represent a simple prognostic
      identifier for patients with large size HCCs being treated by liver transplantation.
