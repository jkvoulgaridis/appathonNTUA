  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that ruxolitinib 1.5% cream is an effective therapy for HS patients through
      inhibition of inflammatory activity.

      We aim to:

        -  Demonstrate the clinical efficacy of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in decreasing the clinical
           disease activity after 16 weeks of treatment.

        -  Investigate the impact of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream on skin inflammation through
           translational analyses of skin biopsy samples.

      The primary efficacy measure is the proportion of participants that achieve HiSCR at Week 16
      with topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream as compared to Week 0. The HiSCR is defined as at least a
      50% reduction in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count (AN count) for all study
      body sites with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count
      relative to Baseline. The primary efficacy analysis will be carried out on all participants
      who complete 16 weeks of treatment.

      The research study consists of an 8 week screening with 16 weeks open-label portion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects age 12 years or older

          2. Hidradenitis suppurativa, and should be Hurley Stage I or II, defined as papules,
             nodules, and/or abscess formation, single or multiple, with or without sinus tracts;

          3. Subjects must have a diagnosis of HS for at least 3 months (90 days) prior to
             Baseline;

          4. Active HS lesions must be present in at least one distinct anatomic area;

          5. Subject must have at least 3 total inflammatory lesions at the Baseline visit;

          6. Subjects who had surgery in the treatment area, should be at least 3 months status
             post the procedure (this applies to deroofing/marsupialization or excision, not
             incision &amp; drainage)

          7. Subject has a negative TB screening assessment (including a PPD test and/or
             Quantiferon-TB Gold test equivalent) OR for patients with treated latent TB or
             negative chest x-ray (CXR posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral view within prior 90
             days) at Screening with documentation of treated latent tuberculosis (90 days of
             treatment).

          8. Medications can be continued if they have been at a stable dose for the requisite
             duration and the dose is not increased during the study period:

               -  Biologic medication (such as TNF, IL-12/23 or IL-17 inhibitors): Up to 30% of
                  enrolled participants will be allowed to remain on a concurrent biologic at
                  stable dosage if treated with a stable dose and frequency for 6 months or longer;

               -  Oral antibiotic must be a stable dose and frequency for 28 days or longer;

               -  Hormone-based therapy (birth control pills or spironolactone) must be a stable
                  dose and frequency for 4 months or longer;

               -  Oral retinoids must be on a stable dose and frequency for 90 days or longer;

               -  Other topical therapy must be discontinued 14 days prior to the Baseline visit.

               -  Child bearing potential: In addition, you must be willing to use a method of
                  contraception during the study period and for 4 weeks after the last dose of
                  study drug. (Note: Periodic abstinence calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable as abstinence.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infection(s) unrelated to HS requiring treatment with:

               -  intravenous (IV) anti-infectives (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals) within 30
                  days prior to Baseline or;

               -  oral anti-infectives (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals) within 14 days prior
                  to Baseline, except as required as part of an anti-TB regimen;

          2. Subject previously treated with a biologic medication but stopped due to lack of
             effect/sufficient effect as deemed by the investigator.

          3. Any other active skin disease or condition (e.g., bacterial, fungal or viral
             infection) that may interfere with assessment of HS;

          4. Pregnant (or considering becoming pregnant) or lactating females Note: Non child
             bearing potential is defined as surgically sterile with a hysterectomy and/or
             bilateral oophorectomy OR postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea at least 12 months
             before screening, confirmed by FSH levels at screening).

          5. Clinically significant abnormal screening laboratory results as evaluated by the
             Investigator.

          6. Subject does not have reliable internet access for weekly electronic surveys;

             candidate for the study.

          8. Excluded prohibited concomitant medication and procedures include: JAK inhibitors
             (systemic or topical (eg, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib,
