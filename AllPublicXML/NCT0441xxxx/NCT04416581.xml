    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of P-CAB (tegoprazan 50 mg once daily) as compared
           with PPI (rabeprazole 20 mg once daily) for protection of gastrointestinal (GI) events
           in high-bleeding risk (HBR) patients with cardiovascular disease receiving antiplatelet
           and oral anticoagulant therapy.

        -  The primary hypothesis is that P-CAB (study drug arm: tegoprazan 50 mg once daily) is
           non-inferior to PPI (comparator arm: rabeprazole 20 mg once daily) with respect to the
           rate of the primary composite endpoint of GI events at 12 months.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose P-CAB (tegoprazan 25 mg once daily) as
           compared with standard-dose P-CAB (tegoprazan 50 mg once daily) and standard-dose PPI
           (rabeprazole 20 mg) as exploratory nature.
