    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop adolescents' social-emotional abilities to foster
      their personal and social responsibility, as well as their well-being, by means of a
      school-based intervention that addresses students, teachers and parents who participate in a
      social-emotional program using a technological platform. The program consists of activities
      based on solid theoretical frameworks on emotional intelligence, development of
      responsibility and meaningful learning.

      EmoTIC is an emotional education program focused on the development of social-emotional
      competences through an application that can be used in mobile devices and tablets. It is
      designed so that teachers can easily carry it out in their classrooms. The duration of the
      program is 8 weeks and consists of application-guided activities that are put into practice
      in class, and includes other exercises that are meant to be carried out at home. The program
      is based on a space adventure, and provides reinforcement through score points and more time
      for the additional games. The activities that are designed to be carried out during school
      hours are named &quot;missions&quot;, and the exercises the students will do at home are called
      &quot;trainings&quot;. Both are essential to adequately conduct the intervention.
