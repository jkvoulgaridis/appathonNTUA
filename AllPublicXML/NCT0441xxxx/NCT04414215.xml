    <textblock>
      The current study examines the efficacy of a cognitive training intervention for improving
      emotion regulation in psychotic disorders. it is hypothesized that the cognitive training
      program will enhance prefrontal activation, leading to enhanced emotion regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychotic disorders are serious and debilitating mental illnesses that incur substantial
      suffering for patients and present major challenges to our health care system. Difficulties
      with emotion regulation (i.e., the ability to control the emotion response using strategies)
      significantly predict the development and maintenance of psychotic symptoms and poor
      community-based functional outcomes. Recent neuroimaging research indicates that
      hypofrontality may underlie these deficits. Unfortunately, there is no accepted technique for
      remediating these emotion regulation abnormalities in psychotic disorders. Recent advances
      from the field of cognitive neuroscience provide hope for a resolution to this critical unmet
      need in psychotic disorder therapeutics, demonstrating that brief computerized cognitive
      training interventions are capable of improving emotion regulation ability by targeting
      neural activation in the prefrontal cortex. The goal of the proposed project is to determine
      whether an emotional working memory cognitive training program is effective for remediating
      emotion regulation abnormalities and associated clinical outcomes in people with psychotic
      disorders. Outpatients with psychotic disorders will be randomly assigned to either an
      emotional working memory training (n = 35) or placebo (P: n = 35) cognitive training control
      intervention delivered via an app on a smart phone for 30 days. The primary aim is to
      determine whether the emotional working memory intervention successfully engages the target
      mechanism and enhances prefrontal activation on a non-trained emotion regulation transfer
      task beyond a pre-specified effect size criterion. Results will also be used to determine the
      treatment duration (15 vs. 30 days) that most effectively and efficiently improves the
      target.
