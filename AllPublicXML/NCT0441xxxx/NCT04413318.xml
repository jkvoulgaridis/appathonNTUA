  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the expert recommendation about rigorous monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure using a
      continuous or intermittent technique, cuff underinflation and overinflation are common
      increasing the risk of microinhalation and tracheal ischemia. All these complications are
      associated with high morbidity and mortality in ICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will compare the duration of the period of under-inflation
      and over-inflation between electronic (VBM©) and pneumatic (Nosten©) devices (continuous
      monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure), in critically intubated children. This study aims to
      determine the effectiveness of the electronic device in the continuous monitoring of tracheal
      cuff pressure.
