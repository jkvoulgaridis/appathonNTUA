  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the intervention proposed in the present study is to assess the effect of a
      cognitive stimulation (CS) intervention program in an individual and long-term format, for
      non-institutionalized elderly people with neurocognitive disorders and in a situation of
      social vulnerability. Specifically, to test the effectiveness of CS on the global cognitive
      state, on mood state, on quality of life and on functional state. The program will be
      composed by 50 sessions, including three of assessment sessions (pre, intra and
      post-intervention). Each session will have a duration of 45 minutes with a weekly frequency.
      Control group participants will maintain their treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to World Health Organization, between 2000 and 2050, the proportion of the planet's
      inhabitants over 60 years of age will double, from 11% to 22%. Specifically, this age group
      will increase from 605 million to 2000 million worldwide by the middle of the century.

      As for Portugal, according to data from the National Statistics Institute, the resident
      population was composed by 21.5% of elderly people. This percentage was higher than the
      European Union average of 28 countries (EU28), which does not reach 20%, with Portugal being
      the fourth country with the highest percentage of elderly people.

      Aging implies an increased risk for the development of biological, socioeconomic and
      psychosocial vulnerabilities, derived from biological decline and from an increase in
      pathologies associated with aging itself. In view of the current Covid-19 pandemic, the risk
      of vulnerability is heightened.

      There are several chronic diseases that affect the elderly. Regarding mental disorders, the
      most frequent as age, are neurocognitive disorders. The diagnostic criteria for this
      pathology emphasize cognitive changes, and as such, it is clinically based on cognitive and
      memory decline.

      There is evidence that in the early stages of neurocognitive disorders, people are able to
      learn and improve their cognitive function through interventions, such as cognitive
      stimulation. There are three types of cognitive intervention: cognitive stimulation,
      cognitive rehabilitation and cognitive training. Cognitive rehabilitation is an individual
      approach to cognitive impairment and improves daily functioning. Cognitive training is
      designed for the patient to perform a set of tasks in order to improve or maintain cognitive
      function through guided practice. Cognitive stimulation is an intervention where the
      cognitive domains are not used isolated, but rather integrated. Cognitive stimulation can be
      structured in an individual or group format. Individual cognitive stimulation includes
      activities designed to stimulate cognition, conducted only with the therapist and the
      patient.

      In a Portuguese study, with participants in the same geographic area, who applied individual
      cognitive stimulation therapy to patients with mild neurocognitive disorder, over a year, a
      significant improvement was found in the intervention group in terms of cognitive performance
      and a reduction of depressive symptoms, with a moderate to large effect size, suggesting that
      cognitive stimulation therapy is effective in an individual format.

      According to this evidence, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
      recommended cognitive stimulation as a non-pharmacological therapy for people with mild to
      moderate neurocognitive disorder.

      In a systematic review about cognitive stimulation, studies showed a strong evidence that
      cognitive stimulation has a positive impact on cognitive performance, depression, activities
      of daily living and behavior in people with neurocognitive disorders.

      Considering the previous information, the aim of this project is to apply cognitive
      stimulation in an individual format to improve cognitive status and performance, quality of
      life and functionality, and reduce depressive symptoms in non-institutionalized elderly
      people in a vulnerable social context with a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder.

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It's an instrument that assesses the independence level of the elderly people regarding IADL's. A score is assigned according to the person's ability to perform a given task. A set of three, four or five options is suggested for each question, which is scored from 1 to 3, 1 to 4 or 1 to 5 points. The highest score corresponds to a greater degree of dependency. If a task does not apply because the person did not perform it in the pre-morbid period, the score for that task is not included in the total score, that is, the maximum possible score includes only the maximum scores of the tasks that the person performed. The score ranges from 8 to 30 points (a score of 8 points means that th person is independent; between 9 and 20 points means a moderate dependency; greater than 20 points means severe dependency).</description>

CS sessions will be conducted in an individual intervention format. The intervention sessions will include several activities based on different non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., reminiscence therapy, reality orientation therapy, cognitive training) whose effectiveness in older adults with neurocognitive disorders has been scientifically proven. All individual CS sessions will be conducted by one therapist (clinical psychologist) with more than five years of experience in CS.</description>
