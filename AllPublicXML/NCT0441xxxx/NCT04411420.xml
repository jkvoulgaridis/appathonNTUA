  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose and objective of this pragmatic trial is to examine the effectiveness of two
      different quality improvement care pathways for low back pain (LBP); a sequenced, integrated
      care pathway (ICP) and 2) a coordinated, care management pathway (CCP). We will test the
      central hypothesis that the ICP will reduce pain interference with normal activities and
      improve physical function, as measured by Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
      System (PROMIS) Short Form scores when compared to the CCP.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a 4-year cluster randomized pragmatic trial comparing the effectiveness of a sequenced, multi-modal integrated care pathway for lower back pain (LBP) to a care management by pain navigator program for LBP. The study target population is veterans seeking services for lower back pain in participating VA clinics.
We plan to enroll 16 VA clinics randomized in a 1:1 Ratio using a covariate constrained randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>Study data sets will be shared a timely manner with privacy and confidentiality protections to facilitate further research, reuse of data, and replication. Publications from this research will be made available to the public through the National Library of Medicine PubMed Central website. To enable broad resource sharing, the study statistician will create de-identified, publication-specific datasets including all variables presented in the publication. The PIs hold responsibility for ensuring that the individuals cannot be re-identified. No data or code that could lead to re-identification of individuals will be released. The analytical datasets and statistical code used will be retained in accordance with VA record retention policy. Study manuals and clinical tools will be shared with the NIH PMC3 Collaboratory and VA health care system facilities. If successful outcomes justify broader dissemination, we will seek to do so by placing relevant materials into the public domain.</ipd_description>
