      The participant will be trained to self administer the drug and will be supplied with a
      PENTHROX commercial inhaler kit .The study nurse will train the participant and supervise its
      use during the procedure.Immediately following the procedure the participant will be asked to
      fill out two brief questionnaires. The study nurse will assess the participant for adverse
      event and will follow-up with a phone call 24 hours later.

      Many patients with chronic urological conditions require multiple and sometimes painful
      urological procedures. Ideally these procedures may be done in the cystoscopy suite without a
      general anesthetic. Low dose methoxyflurane, (MEOF)is a inhaled, self-administered non-opioid
      analgesic and has been approved by Health Canada's for the short-term relief of moderate to
      severe acute pain, associated with trauma or international medical procedures, in conscious
      adult patients. The brand name is PENTHROX.

      This study is a single centre, pilot study to assess the feasibility of using a
      self-administrated, MEOF for pain relief during minor out-patient urological procedures.
      Eligible participants will receive a one time dose of the the study medication during a
      planned, outpatient urological procedure done under cystoscopy in the Cystoscopy clinic
