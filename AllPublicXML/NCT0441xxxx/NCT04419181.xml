    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to find out if de-escalation of chemotherapy
      before surgery followed by a selective escalation of adjuvant targeted therapies are
      efficacious and tolerable in early-stage HER2 positive breast cancer.

      Assess the feasibility of four cycles of neoadjuvant Docetaxel Carboplatin Trastuzumab and
      Pertuzumab (TCHP) in women with early-stage (local/locally advanced) HER2+ breast cancer with
      a selective escalation of targeted HER2 directed therapy in the high risk group in the
      adjuvant setting. Participants with any residual disease after four cycles of TCHP will
      receive Trastuzumab Emtansine (TDM1) plus Pertuzumab while those with complete pathological
      response will receive Trastuzumab in the adjuvant settings.

    <description>The study will be considered feasible if the researchers observe the invasive disease free survival (IDFS) estimate at one year to be 90% or more among those who achieved a pCR, or if the researchers observe the IDFS estimate at one year to be 85% or more among those who had residual disease.</description>

    <description>Evaluate toxicity associated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemo and/or HER2 directed therapies. Percentage of grade 1 to grade 5 toxicities will be assessed during the neo-adjuvant TCHP therapy for all participants. Percentage of grade 1 to grade 5 toxicities will be assessed with adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for the cohort with pathological complete response, and with optional adjuvant TCHP therapy and adjuvant TDM1 + pertuzumab therapy for the residual disease cohort. Toxicity data will be obtained based on the clinical assessment of the participants by the investigators and based on laboratory data.</description>
