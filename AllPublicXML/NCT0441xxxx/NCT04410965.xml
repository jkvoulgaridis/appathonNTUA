      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the relationship between ABCG2 mutation (rs2231142) and teriflunomide exposure,
      during 6-month treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg

      Secondary Objective:

      Characterize the safety (AEs, such as ALT enhancement, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea, etc.)
      during 6-month treatment with teriflunomide
