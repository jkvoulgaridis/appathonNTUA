  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for primary lung cancer (PLC) is very limited. In France, patients diagnosed
      for PLC in 2010 and followed in Respiratory Medicine or Oncology department of a General
      Hospital Centre had a 5-year survival rate of 12.7% (vs 10% in 2000).

      Over the last ten years, substantial improvements have been made both in terms of diagnostic
      (immunohistochemistry and molecular biology) and therapeutic. New treatments have been
      marketed and are now available in clinic.

      New therapeutical strategies have been launched and have proved their efficacy in clinical
      studies or meta-analyses, generally increasing the survival rate of patients by a few months.
      However, little information still exists on the use and effectiveness of these molecules in
      clinical practice.

      The CPHG proposes to complete the information collected during KPB-2020-CPHG study by the
      ESCAP-2020-CPHG study that is a follow-up of therapeutical strategies over the first 3 years
      of treatment. This study should improve knowledge of the PLC treatment management in General
      Hospital Centres.
