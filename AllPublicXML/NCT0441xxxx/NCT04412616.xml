  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of ZZ06 in participants with all Adult Patients with Advanced
      EGFR-positive Solid Tumor Malignancies who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor
      therapies. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , to
      characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      anti-tumor activity of ZZ06 as a single agent in adult participants with advanced solid
      tumors.

      The study will start with an accelerated-titration dose escalation scheme, enrolling 1
      patient per cohort for the first 2 cohorts with expansion to 3 patients in the event of Grade
      â‰¥ 2 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or dose limiting toxicity (DLT) possibly,
      probably, or definitely related to the study drug. After the first 2 cohorts, the study will
      then proceed to a 3+3 design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and expansion to 6
      patients in the event of a DLT.
