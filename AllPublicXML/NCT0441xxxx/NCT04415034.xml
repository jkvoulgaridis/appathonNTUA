  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediculosis capitis is a parasitic infestation that can cause scalp pruritus and quality of
      life disturbances. There are two objective measurement for pruritus, visual analog scale
      (VAS) and 5-D itch scale, which can assess the severity of the scalp pruritus and the latter
      can also asses the quality of life affected by pruritus. Even though VAS can not be used to
      evaluate the impact of pruritus on quality of life, it is very easy to use while 5-D itch
      scale is complex and not child-friendly.

      The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between two different pruritus scales
      and to establish validity of pruritus VAS scale in evaluating quality of life in children
      with pediculosis capitis. We compare two pruritus scale on students with pediculosis of two
      boarding school in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia.

      This study used cross sectional design study.

      Subjects with eligible criteria were included and informed consent from the parents or legal
      guardian were obtained.

      The diagnosis of pediculosis capitis was made based on the findings of eggs, larva, or an
      adult parasite on the scalp or in the hair of the students. All subjects were asked for both
      VAS and 5-D itch scale.The VAS is categorized into five groups based on the point, as
      follows: 0 for no pruritus, &lt;3 for mild pruritus, ≥ 3 - &lt;7 for moderate pruritus, ≥ 7 - &lt;9
      for severe pruritus, and ≥ 9 for very severe pruritus. The 5-D itch scale consists of five
      parameters: duration, degree, direction, disability (sleep, leisure/social activities,
      housework/errands, work/school), and distribution of the pruritus with points ranging from
      one to five.

      Data were recorded for statistical analysis, a chi-square test was used to determine the
      relationship between two categorical variables. The correlation coefficient between the VAS
      and 5-D itch scale was calculated using Spearman's rank correlation
