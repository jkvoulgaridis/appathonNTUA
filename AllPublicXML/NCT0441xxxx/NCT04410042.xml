  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind control trial evaluating the use Tranexamic acid (TXA) to
      decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements in pediatric and young adult cancer patients
      undergoing a limb salvage procedure that frequently requires perioperative or post-operative
      transfusions of blood products.

      Primary Objective

        -  To evaluate the difference in intra-or post-operatively transfused blood volume (mL/kg)
           for patients undergoing limb salvage procedures of the distal femur or proximal tibia
           who are randomized to receive perioperative tranexamic acid (TXA) versus placebo.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate changes in platelets and in hemoglobin from pre-op to post-op level for
           patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.

        -  To evaluate differences in post-operative daily surgical drain output for patients
           randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.

        -  To evaluate changes in estimated blood loss (EBL) for patients randomized to receive
           perioperative TXA versus placebo.

        -  To evaluate the association between the intra-or post-operatively transfused blood
           volume and estimated blood loss (EBL) for patients randomized to receive perioperative
           TXA and placebo, respectively.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To evaluate differences in functional outcomes post-operatively for patients randomized
           to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.

        -  To explore if significant correlations are observed between parameters reported with
           rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEMÂ®) and EBL and transfusion requirements in pediatric
           and young adult patients undergoing limb salvage procedure who are randomized to
           perioperative TXA versus placebo.

        -  To evaluate differences in the prevalence and management of wound complications such as
           superficial or periprosthetic infections, wound dehiscence, contact dermatitis, post-
           operative hematomas, or any other clinically significant wound complication between
           patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants undergoing limb salvage procedures will be randomized to receive either
      tranexamic acid (TXA) or placebo peri-operatively.

      The initial dose of tranexamic acid/placebo will be given at the initiation of surgical
      preparation. The second dose will be given 6 hours after the first dose (either
      intraoperatively or post-operatively). All doses will be given intravenously. Doses will be
      double blinded and randomized for each surgical procedure.
