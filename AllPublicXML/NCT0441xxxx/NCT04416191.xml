    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study enrolling healthy individuals aged 18-35 and 60-85 to
      understand the recovery of muscle health following a period of inactivity. The enrollment
      goal is 45 participants. The study will occur over the course of 1-2 months where
      participants will undergo testing before and after a 2-week limb immobilization period.

      Visit 1 (Pre-testing)- After signing a consent form, participants will undergo a blood
      screening and an oral glucose tolerance test. After the visit, participants will be provided
      with a step activity monitor to track their level of activity. A dietary assessment will also
      be determined.

      Visit 2- At a later time, the participant will return to the research center for a biopsy,
      blood draw, body composition scan, MRI and muscle strength testing.

      2-week leg immobilization period- After visit 2 , the participant will return home and
      undergo a 14-day leg immobilization period using the equipment and instructions provided at
      visit 2.

      Visit 3- During the limb immobilization period, participant will return to the research
      center for a single blood draw.

      Visit 4- At the end of the 2-week limb immobilization period, the participant will return to
      the research center to undergo another biopsy, blood draw, body composition scan, MRI and
      muscle strength testing.

      Visit 5- 2 days after the 2-week limb immobilization period, the participant will return for
      a biopsy and blood draw.

      Visit 6- 7 days after the 2-week limb immobilization period, the participant will be asked to
      return for a final biopsy, blood draw, body composition scan, MRI and muscle strength
      testing.
