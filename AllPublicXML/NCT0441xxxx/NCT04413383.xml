  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year thousands of dermatologic surgery procedures are performed at the University of
      Missouri Department of Dermatology, including Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS), Excisions, and
      biopsies. Surgery is known to cause anxiety for patients and with these procedures performed
      under local anesthetic on awake patients', the sights, sounds, and smells experienced during
      the procedure can lead to an increase in their anxiety or affect their overall perception of
      the experience. From performing and assisting with dermatologic surgery the noise associated
      with the use of the traditional curved Iris scissors provokes an increase in patient
      awareness to the procedure resulting in increased anxiety, triggering of the vasovagal
      response, and expressions of annoyance by the patient. However, the modified curved Iris
      scissors make almost no noise. The Investigators hypothesize that if patients were given the
      comparative experience of both types of curved Iris scissors during dermatologic surgery,
      then they will choose the modified curved Iris scissors because the lack of noise will be
      perceived as more pleasant experience. Our objective is to perform a prospective, single
      blinded, randomized controlled trial to determine how the noise of traditional curved Iris
      scissors vs the silent Wuennenberg modified curved Iris scissors affects patients during
      dermatologic surgery.
