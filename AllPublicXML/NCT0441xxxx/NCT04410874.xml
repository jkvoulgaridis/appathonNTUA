      This study examines the safety and efficacy of using the Imvamune smallpox vaccine in the
      treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main ways cancer is able to develop is by hiding or evading our immune system
      which usually detects and kills potential tumor cells. Once cancer has developed the ability
      to evade the immune system it can continue to grow and become a tumor. One potential strategy
      currently being researched, called immunotherapy, uses viruses to stimulate an immune
      response which attacks the tumor.

      Imvamune is a live, non-replicating virus used in Canada to vaccinate adults and children
      against smallpox. It is safe to use in immunosuppressed patients because the virus is unable
      to replicate and spread past the first infected cell. This makes the Imvamune vaccine a
      viable candidate for immunotherapy in immunosuppressed patients who are at a much higher (up
      to 60x) risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed, BCC and/or SCC tumors located on the
             chest, back, thigh, or arm/forearm.

          -  Presence of clinically documented disease. Skin tumor should measure at least 10 mm in
             size and should be no larger than 5 cm in any axes. There should be no clinical
             suspicion of metastasis (i.e. no lymphadenopaties and no systemic symptoms).

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Subjects must have a documented ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Subjects could be treatment naive or could have had previous surgery or radiation

          -  Subjects may have had prior radiation therapy. A minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) must
             have elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of registration (14 days for
             a single palliative fraction of radiation to a non-target lesion). Subjects must have
             recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior to registration (unless
             grade 1, irreversible and considered not clinically significant).

          -  Previous surgery is permitted. A minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) must have elapsed
             between any major surgery and date of registration (7 days for minor surgery),
             provided that wound healing has occurred
