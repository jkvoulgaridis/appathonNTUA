    <textblock>
      This study is an interventional, prospective randomized study comparing the dexamethasone
      implant to intravitreal aflibercept. Subjects will have an initial single injection of
      aflibercept and will be randomized if diabetic macular edema persists. Each subject will be
      evaluated for 6 months following randomization. Thus, the study duration will be 12 months
      plus the recruitment period.

      Subjects will be evaluated every month for safety, efficacy as measured by SDOCT and best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
      Study (E-ETDRS) protocol. In addition, ultra-widefield angiography will be performed at
      run-in visit, baseline, month 3, and month 6.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent.

          2. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Foveal-involving retinal edema secondary to DME based on investigator review of
             SD-OCT.

          4. Central subfield thickness on SDOCT of greater than or equal to 325 microns on
             Spectralis or 300 microns on Cirrus.

          5. E-ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity of 20/400 or better in the study eye.

          6. Willing, committed, and able to return for ALL clinic visits and complete all study
             related procedures.

          7. Able to read, (or, if unable to read due to visual impairment, be read to verbatim by
             the person administering the informed consent or a family member) understand and
             willing to sign the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior or concomitant therapy with another investigational agent to treat DME in
             the study eye.

          2. Prior panretinal photocoagulation in the study eye.

          3. Prior intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye.

          4. Prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation in the study eye.

          5. Prior history of intravitreal steroid therapy in the study eye.

          6. Any history of severe allergy to fluorescein sodium (e.g., anaphylaxis, difficulty
             breathing) or other reason that the patient is unable to undergo fluorescein
             angiography (e.g., inability to get vascular access, unable to tolerate procedure). If
             allergy is mild and investigator believes can be pretreated with diphenhydramine to
             avoid allergic response, this is not an exclusion to enrollment.

          7. Uncontrolled glaucoma at baseline evaluation (defined as intraocular pressure ≥25 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication) in the study eye and/or cup-to-disc
             ratio greater or equal to 0.8.

          8. Active intraocular inflammation in either eye.

          9. Active ocular or periocular infection in either eye.

         10. Torn or ruptured posterior lens capsule in study eye. Laser capsulotomy is not a
             contraindication.

         11. Prior systemic anti-VEGF therapy, investigational or FDA-approved, is only allowed up
             to 3 months prior to first dose, and will not be allowed during the study.

         12. Significant vitreous hemorrhage obscuring view to the macula or the retinal periphery
             as determined by the investigator on clinical exam and ultra-widefield angiography, in
             study eye.

         13. Presence of other causes of macular edema, including pathologic myopia (spherical
             equivalent of -8 diopters or more negative, or axial length of 25 mm or more), ocular
             histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, choroidal
             neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration or multifocal choroiditis in the
             study eye. Epiretinal membranes are allowed.

         14. Presence of macula-threatening traction retinal detachment in the study eye.

         15. Prior vitrectomy in the study eye.

         16. History of retinal detachment or treatment or surgery for retinal detachment in the
             study eye.

         17. Any history of macular hole of stage 2 and above in the study eye.

             except lid surgery, which may not have taken place within 1 month of day 1, as long as
             it's unlikely to interfere with the injection.

         19. Prior trabeculectomy or other filtration surgery in the study eye.

         20. Any ocular or periocular infection within the last 2 weeks prior to Screening in
             either eye.

         21. Any history of uveitis in either eye.

         22. Active scleritis or episcleritis in either eye.

         23. Presence or history of scleromalacia in either eye.

         24. Aphakia in the study eye.

         25. Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.

         26. History of corneal transplant or corneal dystrophy in the study eye.

         27. Significant media opacities, including cataract, in the study eye which might
             interfere with visual acuity, assessment of safety, or fundus photography.

         28. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g. cataract) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, could require either medical or surgical intervention
             during the study period.

         29. Any concurrent ocular condition in the study eye which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could either increase the risk to the subject beyond what is to be
             expected from standard procedures of intraocular injection, or which otherwise may
             interfere with the injection procedure or with evaluation of efficacy or safety.

         30. Participation as a subject in any clinical study within the 12 weeks prior to Day 1.

         31. Any systemic therapy with an investigational agent in the past 3 months prior to Day
             1.

         32. Any history of allergy to povidone iodine.

         33. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

         34. Women of childbearing potential* who are unwilling to practice adequate contraception
             during the study (adequate contraceptive measures include stable use of oral
             contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for 2 or more
             menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device [IUD]; bilateral tubal
             ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm
             plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly) *Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of child bearing potential.
             Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation.
