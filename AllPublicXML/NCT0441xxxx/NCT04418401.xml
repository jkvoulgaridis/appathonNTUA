  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, with more than
      700,000 new cases in the world every year. China has the highest incidence and death rate of
      HCC in the world, accounting for 55% of the world's annual incidence and 45% of the world's
      annual deaths. At present, surgical resection is still one of the most effective treatments
      for HCC. However, the recurrence rate of tumor after hepatectomy is still very high, and the
      recurrence rate of 5 years is 60~70%. Especially in patients with high-risk recurrence
      factors, without intervention, the cumulative recurrence rate in the first year was about
      50%, about 60% in the second year, about 70% in the third year, and about 80% in the fifth
      year. Tumor recurrence is an important bottleneck that hinders the long-term survival of
      patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective adjuvant therapy to reduce the
      postoperative recurrence rate of patients with HCC, especially high-risk patients. However,
      there is still a lack of standard protocols for postoperative adjuvant therapy for HCC. Here
      investigators intend to explore the safety and efficacy of Donafinib Combined With Anti-PD-1
      Antibody as postoperative adjuvant therapy for HCC patients with high risks of recurrence.

      This is a single center, open, single arm, and exploratory study. Thirty HCC patients with
      high risk recurrence factors after radical surgery will be enrolled. Adjuvant treatment of
      Donafenib combined with anti-PD-1 antibody will be given for 6 months. The primary endpoint
      is the cumulative percentage of patients without recurrence in the first year. The
      recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), tumor recurrence time (TTR), ECOG
      physical condition (ECOG PS) score, the changes of FACT-Hep based quality of life score,
      changes of AFP, and adverse events will be recorded and analyzed, to evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of this combination treatment.
