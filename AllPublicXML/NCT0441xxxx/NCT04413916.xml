  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate physiological and
      pathological processes by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression mainly via
      translational inhibition of target messenger RNAs. Recently, many miRNAs were found to be
      involved in pathological processes that occur following kidney transplantation, like
      allograft rejection, de novo disease or disease recurrence after kidney transplantation. As
      most of the miRNAs involved in kidney diseases are extracted by urine, the diagnostic
      accuracy of such molecules as biomarkers is questionable.

      The aim of this study is to analyze expression of selected miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-126,
      miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, miR-223) and evaluate whether their regulation is associated with
      kidney graft function and disease processes after kidney transplantation (KTx).

      MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, endogenous non-coding RNAs involved in the modulation of gene
      expression mainly by inhibition of messenger RNAs translation. Recent studies have indicated
      association of miRNAs with pathological processes following kidney transplantation.

      The aim of the study is to determine whether selected miRNAs are related to specific disease
      process or only reflect kidney graft function.

      The study enrolled 100 Caucasian KTRs, who presented with stable renal function (as indicated
      by stable serum creatinine (Cr) for 3 months and whose kidney graft function was thereafter
      estimated with various methods, including: cystatin C concentration, three different CKD EPI
      equations and measured with chromium-51 ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid clearance.

      Expression of 6 selected miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-126, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223)
      was determined by qPCR using miRNA-103a, miR-191, and miR-423 as reference genes.

        The study included 100 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with at least 3 months of stable
        kidney graft function established with estimated GFR (eGFR) according to CKD Epidemiology
        Collaboration equations, serum creatinine concentration (CKD-EPI Cr), serum cystatin C
        concentration (CKD-EPI CysC) and measured GFR with 51Cr-EDTA clearance.

        Evaluation of kidney graft function was subject to previous, already completed, and
        published study (Borštnar Š, et al. Clin Nephrol. 2019;92(6):287‐292.
        doi:10.5414/CN109882). Serum samples from patients participating in this study (taken at
        the moment of 51Cr-EDTA clearance measurement) were further analyzed in the contemporary
        study.
