  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urge faecal incontinence (FI) and passive FI are the two subgroups of FI described by the
      International Continence Society. Urge FI is described as &quot;the inability to defer defecation
      once the urge is perceived for long enough to reach a toilet&quot; and passive FI as &quot;the
      involuntary leakage of faeces without forewarning&quot;. If several validated questionnaires are
      available for FI, all of these questionnaires were developed to assess FI severity. In
      literature, there is only a small number of studies that investigated clinical and
      paraclinical characteristics of the different phenotype of FI. Moreover, there is an
      heterogenicity in the definitions used for both urge and passive FI among these studies.
      Lastly, patients with mixed FI were commonly excluded from these studies. It can be
      established that there is a lack of validate tools to distinguish patients between subgroups
      of FI.

      The aim of the present study was to develop and to validate a new tool in order to
      investigate and classify patients among the different subgroups of FI (active, passive and
      mixed) defined by Rome IV criteria.

      A monocentric prospective study was conducted in the Neuro-urology Department of a University
      Hospital. All consecutive patients presenting in the Department with FI between December 2019
      and June 2020 were screened for inclusion in the present study. Criteria of inclusion were an
      age older than 18 years old and symptoms of FI according to Rome IV criteria. Exclusion
      criteria were anorectal fistula, active inflammatory bowel disease, anorectal malignant tumor
      not treated, rectal or hemorrhoidal prolapses and specific inability regarding the
      questionnaire (i.e. cognitive disorders, inability to read and to understand questions).

      Phase 1: review of literature and qualitative interviews: To determine the dimensions of the
      different subgroups of faecal incontinence, a literature review was performed using Pubmed
      without date limitation until February 2020. The key words used were &quot;active faecal
      incontinence&quot;, &quot;active fecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;passive faecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;passive fecal
      incontinence&quot;, &quot;urge faecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;urge fecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;questionnaire&quot;,
      &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;score&quot; and &quot;tool&quot;. In parallel to this literature review, semi-structured
      interviews were performed on 20 patients from December 2019 to February 2020. During this
      phase, a panel expert of 9 neuro-urologists and gastroenterologists was composed. At the term
      of all interviews, dimensions that were both the most used by patients and the most
      discriminative among subgroups of FI were included in the questionnaire. Redaction of
      questions was then performed by the panel expert.

      Phase 2: feasibility study: The feasibility study was conducted from February to April 2020
      on 30 patients. Each patient was asked to rate each version of the 2 questions with a
      four-point Likert scale (A: very good, B: good, C: difficult, D: very difficult) regarding
      acceptance and comprehension of the questions.

      Phase 3: validation study: To investigate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, a
      validation study was performed from April to June 2020 on 100 consecutive patients. In order
      to evaluate the FITAS' test reproducibility, patients were asked to answer a second time the
      questionnaire by mail with a second evaluation from 7 days to 10 days after the first one.
      The &quot;intra-class correlation coefficient&quot; (ICC) was used to determine if these evaluations
      could lead to similar results for each question. An ICC &gt; 0.70 was necessary to define
      reproducibility.
