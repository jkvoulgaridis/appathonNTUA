      The blood sample collection materials for the HostDx Sepsis test (PAXgene Blood RNA tubes)
      will be collected. EDTA tubes for plasma measurements of procalcitonin and IL-6 will be
      collected. Collection tubes for serum samples to measure viral antibodies and/or viral titers
      (indicative of reactivation of viral infection) will also be collected. These will be stored
      locally and processed at a later time point dependent on needs, i.e. suspicion of viral
      reactivation.
