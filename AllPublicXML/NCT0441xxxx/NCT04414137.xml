  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daptomycin is an antibiotic from the family of cyclic lipopeptides, bactericide,
      concentration-dependent. Its spectrum concerns Gram-positive bacteria.

      Since the authorization of daptomycin in 2006, cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and pulmonary
      eosinophilia associated with its use have been reported in Europe and worldwide.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the mechanism of occurrence of this AE with dapto;
      Prolonged exposure and accumulation at the alveolar level could potentially have a role.
      Better understanding the mechanisms of appearance of this AE would provide predictive
      elements making it possible to limit the occurrence of this AE in the future

      Daptomycin is an antibiotic from the family of cyclic lipopeptides, bactericide,
      concentration-dependent. Its spectrum concerns Gram-positive bacteria.

      The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of daptomycin 6 mg / kg / day
      in the second-line treatment of IOA on staphylococcal but also enterococcal prostheses, as an
      alternative to vancomycin and linezolid.

      In case of renal failure, daptomycin is often considered as a good therapeutic alternative to
      glycopeptides.

      Since the authorization of daptomycin in 2006, cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and pulmonary
      eosinophilia associated with its use have been reported in Europe and worldwide. Although a
      large proportion of cases have been reported in patients receiving daptomycin in unapproved
      indications, the use of daptomycin in authorized indications has also been associated with
      this risk.

      The dosage of daptomycin makes it possible to evaluate its effectiveness and prevent the
      occurrence of a overdose, provider of side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the mechanism of occurrence of this AE with dapto;
      Prolonged exposure and accumulation at the alveolar level could potentially have a role.
      Better understanding the mechanisms of appearance of this AE would provide predictive
      elements making it possible to limit the occurrence of this AE in the future
