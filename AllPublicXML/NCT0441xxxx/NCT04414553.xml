    <textblock>
      To address childhood overweight disparities among Latino children in immigrant families a
      pragmatic effectiveness trial of a community-based obesity treatment program, Community
      Active and Healthy Families (AHF), among 5-12 year old overweight and obese Latino children
      in immigrant families using a wait-list control randomized design will be conducted.

      The hypothesis is that children randomized to Community-AHF will demonstrate a reduction in
      child body mass index (primary outcome) and improved diet physical activity behaviors
      (secondary outcomes) at intervention completion compared with wait-list controls.

      To address childhood overweight disparities among Latino children in immigrant families a
      pragmatic effectiveness trial of a community-based obesity treatment program, Community
      Active and Healthy Families (AHF), among 5-12 year old overweight and obese Latino children
      in immigrant families using a wait-list control randomized design will be conducted.

      The hypothesis is that children randomized to Community-AHF will demonstrate a reduction in
      child body mass index (primary outcome) and improved diet physical activity behaviors
      (secondary outcomes) at intervention completion compared with wait-list controls. The trial
      will evaluate whether Community-AHF is effective at decreasing BMI among overweight or obese
      Latino children. Overweight (BMIz score&gt;85th%ile) and obese (BMIz score&gt;95th%ile) 5-12
      year-old patients referred by their primary care pediatrician will be enrolled in the trial.
      The primary outcome will be change in BMI from baseline to 10 months.Other measures include
      diet and physical activity for children and parents, hypothesized mediators of the
      intervention, and important sociodemographic characteristics. The trial will aim to have â‰¥
      120 participants in each arm at the conclusion, 10 months after baseline. To accomplish this,
      300 participants will be randomized for optimal statistical power. The sample size for was
      calculated to detect 0.7 kg/m2 lower mean BMI in the Community-AHF versus the waitlist
      control at 10 months after randomization.

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Community Active and Healthy Families</intervention_name>
    <description>Community-AHF will consist of eight, semimonthly 2-hour group appointments for 16 weeks followed by a visit with the pediatrician 2 months later and a final group session 4 months after that. Community-AHF sessions will target two areas: 1) Practical information regarding importance of healthy behaviors, and 2) Problem-solving skills to overcome barriers to improving diet and increasing physical activity and other related healthy behaviors. Each session covers specific objectives, includes a number of complementary activities and provides participants with take-home materials to facilitate behavior change.
Community-AHF will be delivered by a nurse and a Community Health Worker (CHW) trained by a consultant nutritionist and study investigators. The CHW will contact families between group sessions to discuss challenges and successes regarding lifestyle changes.</description>
