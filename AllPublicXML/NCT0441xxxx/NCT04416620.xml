  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of anxiety disorder and
      depression amongst Syrian and Jordanian women who are suffering from PCOS in Damascus and
      Amman.

      The secondary aim was to assess the effectiveness of a PCOS pharmaceutical care service on
      selected patient's biochemical parameters, QOL, anxiety, and depression scale. The third aim
      is to identify the factors associated with QOL, anxiety and depression scores' change across
      the study.

      Null Hypothesis (research hypothesis):

      The intervention of PCOS pharmaceutical care service will lead to no significant differences
      in patient's depression, anxiety, QOL, and some biochemical parameters in comparison to
      females who will not receive this intervention in both Syria and Jordan.

      Alternative Hypothesis (research hypothesis):

      The intervention of PCOS pharmaceutical care service will have a significant impact on
      patient's depression, anxiety, QOL, and some biochemical parameters in comparison to patients
      who will not receive this intervention in both Syria and Jordan.

      The information provided in the PCOS pharmaceutical care service was delivered in the format
      of oral plus written information (most important facts to remember and take-home messages
      regarding lifestyle modifications). The information provided included the importance of
      exercise and motivational messages to exercise more at home or in the gym. Participants were
      informed of previous study results which showed that 8-12 weeks of exercise can ameliorate
      cardiovascular risk factors and improve mental health.

      The second part of the educational service was about the importance of decreasing the stress
      levels. The participants were informed that markers of oxidative stress were found to be out
      of range in PCOS women and that it was proven beneficial to do breathing exercises to reduce
      stress. It was clarified that the breathing exercise does not only relieve stress but also
      may help to gain better sleep and relieve anxiety symptoms. Participants were informed to
      perform a simple breathing exercise on daily basis (twice a day, morning and night) where
      they inhale through the nose for the account of four, and then exhale through the nose for
      the count of four, with the possibility to increase the counting to 6 then to 8.

      The third part of the educational service aimed at improving participants' diets. They were
      informed to follow specific diet recommendations as follows:

      to consume the majority of their daily calories prior to 12 pm (shown to improve insulin and
      glucose levels and decrease testosterone levels), to focus on food with low glycemic load
      e.g. chicken, meat, eggs and avocado (shown to decrease insulin levels).

      to increase their vitamin C and calcium intake e.g. kiwi, orange and lemons (shown to improve
      body mass index and menstrual abnormalities, along with other PCOS-related symptoms).

      to include adequate magnesium intake in their diet e.g. legume, spinach, broccoli, banana and
      pineapple (shown to lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke).

      to increase chromium intake, found in onions, garlic, grapefruit and tomatoes (shown to help
      regulate insulin and glucose levels).

      to increase their consumption of omega-3, found in food such as tuna, salmon, fish, and
      walnuts (shown to help in decreasing androgen levels and testosterone).

      In addition, participants were informed to avoid or to minimize certain types of food,
      explaining to them how it may negatively affect their PCOS condition. Such food types
      included caffeine beverages (as it may increase the estrogen level and affect fertility).

      hydrogenated oils including margarine, corn oil, and coffee creamers (as it decreases the HDL
      (the good cholesterol), and increases the LDL (the bad cholesterol).

      white sugary foods like cookies, cakes, and candies (as it can increase glucose levels).

      dairy products (since it can cause allergic reactions and digestion problems, in addition to
      raising the testosterone levels).

      Processed food (because it has a negative effect on insulin level). PCOS treatment was also
      discussed (orally only) with the participants (Fourth part of the service). Females were
      advised on the importance of using their correct treatment, for example using the pill for
      hormonal balance. They were informed of the importance of adhering to their prescribed
      medications, accepting that it was a long term treatment plan, and to consult with their
      specialist if their treatment was not effective, or in the case of medication side effects.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in the active group received the usual care delivered at the community pharmacies at both countries plus the pharmaceutical care service designed by the research group and provided by the clinical pharmacist, an experienced female with extensive knowledge on PCOS. The intervention was delivered via oral advice and recommendations, and written material, with a special focus on diet and exercise. Participants in the control group received the usual care only and did not receive the pharmaceutical care service.
Following the intervention, both groups were followed up for four months and re-interviewed at the community pharmacy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Quality of Life assessment using the polycystic ovary syndrome health-related QOL questionnaire (PCOSQ).
It has a 30 questions about symptoms related to menstruation and mood. It can identify seven factors affecting the QOL in PCOS women including: emotional disturbance, hirsutism, weight concerns, infertility, menstrual symptoms, menstrual predictability and acne. The QOL was analyzed individually as a continuous scale out of seven to assess the QOL in patients (the higher the score is, the better the QOL is). After that, each question of the 30 questions included in the PCOSQ questionnaire was analyzed, and the mean score within each question was obtained and compared between baseline and follow-up. After that, each domain included in the QOL questionnaire was analyzed individually. Mean score of each domain was obtained and compared between baseline and follow-u to assess the impact of lifestyle modifications on that domain.</description>

    <description>Participants in the active group received the 'pharmacist standard counseling' plus the 'pharmaceutical care service' designed by the research group. Both services were delivered by one female clinical pharmacist who has a Master's degree in pharmaceutical sciences, 5-year work experience in community pharmacies, and comprehensive knowledge of PCOS. The time it took to deliver the counseling and education to each participant in the active group was formally assessed. This time assessment excluded data collection and questionnaire filling time (which was planned to take around 15 min).
Participants in the active group received the usual care delivered at the community pharmacies plus the pharmaceutical care service designed by the research group and provided by the clinical pharmacist. The intervention was delivered via oral advice and recommendations, and written material, with a special focus on diet and exercise.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group received the usual care only which is the 'pharmacist standard counseling' involved dispensing the prescribed medication (delivered by the pharmacist in charge), counseling on how to take the dispensed medications, and a brief reply to questions if asked by the participants. The 'pharmacist standard counseling' followed what was normally delivered to females with PCOS by pharmacists working at community pharmacies in both countries. This 'pharmacist standard counseling' was established based on what was observed and reported by the project research team after viewing the usual pharmacists' interaction with females with PCOS for two weeks in each country before the start of the study.
Participants in the control group were informed that the educational intervention (the pharmaceutical care service) will be delivered to them after the end of the study (for ethical reasons).</description>
