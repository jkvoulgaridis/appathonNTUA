  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in our region and is the 9th most common cancer in
      Hong Kong. Traditionally diagnosis has been through a nasoendoscopic examination of the
      nasopharynx with white light followed by a biopsy of suspicious lesions for a confirmatory
      diagnosis. However, given the geometry of the anatomy of the nasopharynx, with its inherent
      crevices and varying amounts of lymphoid tissues, lesions are not always easily identified
      leading to potential missed lesions. The non-specific aspect of white light also leads to
      excessive biopsies that are not without risk and of some discomfort to patients. Recent
      advances in liquid biopsies have also allowed for the detection of earlier and smaller
      lesions that are not always easily identified on nasoendoscopy but rather are seen on
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)1 .

      An alternative imaging technique is the use of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) to view the
      vasculature of the mucosa to identify suspicious lesions for pre-malignancy and malignancy
      that has been popularized in the gastrointestinal tract. In NPC, NBI with the flexible
      nasoendoscopes has been used in the diagnosis of NPC with varying success2-5 . Our own
      group's research has found that in NPC NBI has limitations arising from a lack of consensus
      on vascular findings on NBI that constitute malignancy, lack of magnification and long focal
      length of current nasoendoscopes5-8 . Flexible endoscopy using conventional
      esophago-gastroscopy endoscope (OGD) with NBI and magnification power up to 80x overcome the
      limitations of current nasoendoscopes, however their size precludes the passing of these
      endoscopes through the nasal cavity.

      Here in this pilot study we will seek to use an OGD with NBI passed transorally and
      retroflexed into the nasopharynx to view the nasopharynx with increased magnification and
      clarity to evaluate the feasibility of this study in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.

      Study questions:

        1. Is it feasible to use an OGD with magnifying NBI for the diagnosis of NPC?

        2. Are there features detected on NBI OGD that are diagnostic of NPC?

        3. Do histological features correspond with NBI findings?

      This is a case-control pilot study. We will recruit 40 patients. 20 patients with newly
      diagnosed primary NPC will be recruited to the test group. 20 patients undergoing an OGD for
      lesions not involving disease of the head and neck region will be recruited to the control
      group.

      NBI OGD and flexible nasoendoscopy will be performed to examine patients' nasopharyngeal
      region.

      NBI OGD: Endoscopic procedures would be performed by our investigators with expertise on
      performing upper endoscopy. Endoscopes with magnification and NBI function would be used
      (GF-H290Z, Olympus Medical Corporations, Tokyo, Japan). A soft black hood would be attached
      to the tip of the endoscope for better focal length adjustment.

      Upon insertion through a mouthpiece, the scope will then be retroflexed into the nasopharynx
      and the lateral walls into the Fossa of Rosenmuller and the posterior nasopharyngeal wall
      will be systematically examined with white light and NBI. Target suspicious areas would be
      examined by use of magnification with the power up to 80X.

      Flexible nasoendoscopy: The nasoendoscope is introduced into the nose, the nasal cavity and
      nasopharyngnx. It has a camera and a light at the end and allows our doctor to check for any
      abnormal looking areas. Upon identification of suspicious lesion. Biopsies of sites with
      different NBI findings will be taken to correlate the NBI findings with histological
      features.
