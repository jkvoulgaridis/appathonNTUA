  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry needling (DN) is a treatment technique used for treating musculoskeletal pain conditions.
      DN has shown to be effective on pain and function in patients with mechanical neck pain.
      Potential effects of DN can be related to several mechanisms, including physical, cognitive
      and emotional factors. This study will evaluate the role of the patient expectances related
      to the evolution (progress) of the condition, in this case, mechanical neck pain, in the
      effects of real or sham dry needling in sensitivity outcomes such as pain intensity or
      pressure pain sensitivity. Expectation of each patient in both groups will be considered
      positive, neutral or negative based on the outcomes of the Patient Shoulder Expectancies
      (PSOE) questionnaire which was adapted to the cervical spine.

    <description>Sham dry needling with be conducted with a sham needle device. This needle has a blunt tip and retractable handle that created the illusion of a needle penetrating the skin. When this needle touches the skin, a pricking sensation will be created. However, when pressure will be increased, the shaft of the needle disappears into the handle creating a sensation on the patient</description>
