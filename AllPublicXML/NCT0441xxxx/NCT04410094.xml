  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of strong cytochrome
      P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor itraconazole and strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin on the single dose
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of lazertinib in healthy adult participants.

    <time_frame>Predose up to 120 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-120h) is defined as area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 120 hours postdose.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohort 1 and 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to Time of Last Quantifiable Timepoint (AUC [0-last]) of Lazertinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 120 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-last) is defined as area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of last quantifiable timepoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohort 1 and 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to Infinity (AUC [0-inf]) of Lazertinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 120 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-inf) is defined as area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, calculated as the sum of AUC(0-last)+C(last)/ lambda(z), where C(last) is the last observed measurable (non-below limit of quantification) concentration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohort 1 and 2: Percentage of Area Under the Plasma Concentration from time Zero to Infinite time obtained by Extrapolation (%AUC [0-inf],ex) of Lazertinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 120 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>%AUC (0-inf),ex is defined as percentage of area under the plasma concentration from time zero to infinite time obtained by extrapolation, calculated as (AUC [0-infinity] minus AUC [0-last]/AUC [0-infinity])*100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohort 1 and Cohort 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 65 days (Cohort 1) and up to 70 days (Cohort 2)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a investigational or non investigational medicinal product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.</description>
