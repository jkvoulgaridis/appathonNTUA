  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Obstructive Sleep Apnea is characterized by obstruction of the upper airway during sleep
      (for at least 10 sec), with repeated breathing pauses, accompanied by oxygen desaturation in
      the blood and by sleep interruption with repeated arousals.

      The investigators hypothesized that good sleep hygiene, the execution of respiratory
      rehabilitation exercises, with specific myofascial exercises on the muscles that are
      compromised in the Obstructive Sleep Apnea, can improve the patient's clinical outcome and
      quality of life.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of respiratory rehabilitation with
      myo-functional exercises in mild obstructive sleep.

      Patients: Eligible patients aged between 40 and 80 years old, with BMI &lt; 30 and with a recent
      diagnosis of mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea evaluated with home night cardio-respiratory
      monitoring.

      The investigators will exclude patients with one or more of the following conditions:
      subjects who regularly use hypnoinductive drugs, with craniofacial malformations, who have
      suffered recent facial trauma, suffering from hypothyroidism, suffering from neuromuscular
      diseases, with recent strokes, severe obstructive nasal disease, systemic infectious diseases
      and neoplastic diseases.

      Home night cardio-respiratory monitoring: all patients will be evaluated according to
      international guidelines (AAMS American Academy Sleep Medicine) with an instrument equipped
      with sensors for detection oral/nasal flow, snoring, chest/abdomen movements, pulse oximetry
      and heart rate.

      Questionnaire: The investigators will employ questionnaires validated in Italy: Snoring
      frequency (derived from the Berlin questionnaire); subjective daytime sleepiness (Epworth
      questionnaire); quality of sleep (Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire).

      Patients will be randomized into two groups randomly with a 1: 1 ratio: group 1 (treated
      group) or group 2 (control group) for a total of 20 patients per group (according to the
      sample size calculation reported in the protocol).

      The treatment group will be subjected to an integrated rehabilitation protocol, composed of
      Respiratory rehabilitation exercises with diaphragmatic breathing, thoracic mobilization
      exercises and manual pompage techniques, followed by manual trigger point therapy techniques,
      (that were identified by palpation following the guidelines provided by Travell and Simons
      trigger point manual), the accessory inspiratory muscles like pectoralis minor muscle,
      scapula elevator muscle, Sternocleidomastoid muscle. The integrated rehabilitation protocol
      will be 45 minutes, 3 weekly sessions for 4 weeks, for a total of 12 consecutive sessions.
      Also, at every patient will be taught oropharyngeal exercises to perform at home twice a day
      (the duration of 15 minutes each session) involving in particular exercises for soft palate,
      tongue, facial and genio-glosso muscle.

      Both in the treated group and the control group will be given a booklet with the rules for
      proper sleep hygiene because sleep is influenced by our lifestyle and various environmental
      factors can affect the quality of night sleep.

    <description>AHI is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep questionnaires, Berlin Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>it consists of 3 categories related to the risk of sleep apnea (1-severity of snoring, 2- excessive daytime sleepiness, 3-history of obesity or high blood pressure). Depending on the answers and therefore the reported symptoms, it allows a subdivision in high risk or low risk of having apneas;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep questionnaires, Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>it is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness with a short questionnaire; the answers range from normal (0) to intense (3) in eight different situations; a total score greater than 10 is considered excessive daytime sleepiness</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep questionnaires, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. Evaluate seven sleep items on a scale of 0 to 3, 0 indicating no difficulty and 3 indicating severe difficulty. The results are expressed in an overall score (between 0 and 21). Values above 5 are consistent with poor sleep quality.</description>
