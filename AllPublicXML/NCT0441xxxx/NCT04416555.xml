  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled design, the investigators goal is to estimate the effect of VR
      on postoperative analgesia and opioid consumption.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, the investigators propose to test the primary hypothesis that the use of
      AppliedVR software in Pico G2 4K headsets decreases acute postoperative pain scores (with a 1
      point difference considered clinically important) compared to sham treatment on a 0-10 scale
      15 minutes after each use in the first 48 hours after surgery or hospital discharge,
      whichever comes first.

    <description>Pain Outcomes Questionnaire Short Form, which evaluates five domains (pain, mobility, activities of daily living, vitality, negative affect and fear). The Pain Outcomes Questionnaire Short Form is scored from 0 to 190 and higher scores are related with worst pain outcomes.</description>
