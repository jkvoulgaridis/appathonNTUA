  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with anxiety symptoms was found to be associated with greater risk of dementia.
      Interventions targeting signs as early as in the pre-symptomatic phase could be most
      effective in early prevention of dementia. On reviewing the identified non-pharmacological
      interventions, integrated attention training program (IATP) is proposed to target older
      adults with anxiety symptoms in Hong Kong.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with anxiety disorders or symptoms are not in the consideration of management
      for dementia prevention. However, the condition is found to be associated with profound
      negative subsequent decline on both functioning and cognition. While epidemiological studies
      reported high prevalence in older population, its symptoms are often overlooked in the
      presence of other age-related diseases in the community as well as among the health
      professionals. It is expected that cognitive and functional disabilities secondary to this
      condition will pose a significant burden to the existing healthcare system. Therefore,
      targeting anxious older adults for early intervention may help to cut healthcare costs and to
      ensure proactive dementia prevention in the long run. The current proposed intervention
      intends to attenuate the trajectory of cognitive decline at a very early stage and enhance
      existing cognitive function to delay the onset of dementia.

      This study aims to explore whether the use of integrated attention training program (IATP)
      could improve cognitive performance and functioning in older adults with anxiety symptoms. In
      particulars, we aim

        1. To examine the cognitive effect of 4 week integrated attention training program (I) and
           health education (C) in older adults with anxiety symptoms.

        2. To examine the 4 week integrated attention training program (I) and health education (C)
           in alleviating mood symptoms in older adults with anxiety symptoms.

        3. To examine the acceptability and adherence of the proposed intervention.

    <measure>Attention network test (ANT)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>ANT will measure the changes in attention from baseline to endpoint between the intervention and control groups. Performance was based on (i) accuracy refers to the degree of correctness and also to quality control, which means that if the participant's accuracy fell below 70%, the case would be considered unqualified. (2) reaction time refers to the processing speed. Median values of RT will be used as raw scores to avoid the influence of outliers. The indices will be served to compare the effect of IATP and health education.</description>

    <measure>Subjective memory complaints (SMC)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>SMC will be measured by Memory Inventory for the Chinese (MIC-27). It is locally validated among older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia. Participants with a positive answer to any of the 27 questions will be categorized as having SCC at baseline. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher marks indicating poor self-efficacy in memory. There is no cut-off for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>CDR is a semi-structured clinical interview for the severity of cognitive impairment rated along six dimensions of cognition and function, including memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home, hobbies and personal cares. Scores in each dimension are combined to form a global rating ranging from 0 (not demented), 0.5 (questionable), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) to 3 (severe dementia). It has been demonstrated that CDR sum of boxes is sensitive to capture early functional changes in the preclinical phase of AD (CDR 0.5)</description>

    <measure>Digit and visual spans</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Digit span is a test of attention and verbal working memory. Participants are asked to repeat back a series of digits immediately after presentation, in ascending order starting from 3 and up to 8 digits (i.e., forward), and in reverse order beginning from 2 to 8 digits (i.e., backward). Both trials of each span length are administered until failure on both trials of a span length is obtained.
Visual span is a test of attention and visual working memory. It measures the ability to reproduce the spatial pattern of tapping sequences on an array of blocks beginning with 2 and going up to 8 blocks plus the ability to reverse the spatial block tapping sequence from 2 up to 7 blocks. Similar to digit span test, both trails of a span length are given until the length reached at which both are failed.
Changes in digit and visual spans from baseline to endpoint between groups will be served to compare the effect of IATP and health education on executive function</description>

    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Category verbal fluency test (CVFT) is test of semantic fluency and executive function. Participants were asked to generate as many exemplars as possible for each of the three semantic categories, namely animals, fruits, and vegetables, in 60 seconds. Their responses were recorded in serial order. Analysis of scoring is based on the total number of words that the participant is able to produce across all three categories. Also, the number of repetitions and intrusions were recorde. Changes in category verbal fluency test from baseline to endpoint between the intervention and control groups were served to compare the effect of IATP and health education on verbal memory.</description>

    <measure>Trail making tests</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Chinese trail making test (A and B) is a test providing information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning. There are two parts to the Chinese trail test: A, in which the subject needs to connect the Arabic numbers in sequential order, and B, in which the subject alternates between Arabic and Chinese numbers to suit the literacy of local older population. The completion time (in second) and the numbers of errors made during the test are recorded.
Changes in trail making test from baseline to endpoint between the intervention and control groups will be served to compare the effect of IATP and health education on executive function and processing speed.</description>

    <measure>The Chinese Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CNPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: 4th week, T3:12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CNPI) would be used to assess changes in 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms. The frequency of each symptom is rated on a scale of 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently). The severity of each symptom is also rated on a scale of 1 to 3. The total score for each domain is calculated by multiplying the frequency by the severity. A total score is calculated by adding all the domain scores together. Higher score indicating more neuropsychiatric disturbances, In the current proposal, CNPI would evaluate potential mood and behavioral changes.</description>
