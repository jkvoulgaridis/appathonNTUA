  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphomas are the most common haemopathic malignancy. The 3 most common types are diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). In these
      three subtypes, the treatment strategy is most often curative. The therapeutic strategy is
      guided by PET (positron emission tomography), which optimises the risk-benefit balance
      between the efficacy and toxicity of the treatment and makes it possible to limit the
      intensity of treatment for good responders and to intensify the treatment of poor responders
      with a worse prognosis. PET therefore plays a central role in the pre-therapeutic evaluation
      of the disease and in the assessment of response to treatment. However, other complementary
      approaches could improve characterization prior to initiating lymphoma t-treatment and
      individual patient management during treatment and beyond. In DLBCL, it has been shown that
      the risk of relapse of good and bad responders is decreased by combining the PET response
      with a reduction in the amount of tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, i.e. the genetic program of
      lymphoma cells that circulates freely in the blood. This evaluation of ctDNA has been made
      possible by the development of innovative techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing
      (NGS). In lymphomas, several approaches have been developed, the most sensitive and promising
      being CAPP-Seq (CAncer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing) developed at Stanford
      University.

      It is therefore useful to study the description of ctDNA in the 3 types of lymphomas and to
      analyse the progression profiles under treatment by trying to establish the major potential
      usefulness of these techniques: modifying treatment in case of poor response based on ctDNA
      +/- and PET, detecting relapses earlier than at present in patients without any other sign of
      relapse (clinical, blood or PET).

      The project presented here aims to build a collection of plasma samples taken before
      treatment, during treatment and during the first 2 years of follow-up in patients with one of
      the 3 most frequent types of lymphoma and undergoing curative treatment. The hypothesis is
      that sequential evaluation of ctDNA could improve the individualized management of future
      patients based on the results generated by the analyses of patients in this cohort.
