  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implants placed immediately after tooth extraction usually present challenges in obtaining
      soft tissue coverage with high risk of bacterial invasion, wound dehiscence and subsequently
      adverse effect on the success rate of the implant due to lack of primary soft tissue closure
      over the implant.

      Different surgical methods have been described to achieve primary soft tissue closure in
      maxillary fresh socket, each having its advantages and disadvantages, based on that, buccal
      pad of fat can solve this soft tissue coverage problem with minimal complications and high
      success rate of the placed implants.The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of
      buccal pad of fat tissue with immediate implant placement in the posterior maxillary area.

      Ten patients will be selected randomly from the outpatient clinic, Alexandria University
      seeking for an immediate implant placement. The sample will be selected to match the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. It will be operated upon in the Oral and Maxillofacial
      Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. One stage surgery will include tooth
      extraction, placement of an immediate implant, bone grafting material and autologous soft
      tissue graft from the buccal pad of fat. Patients will be assessed clinically and
      radiographically to evaluate bone and soft tissue measurements.
