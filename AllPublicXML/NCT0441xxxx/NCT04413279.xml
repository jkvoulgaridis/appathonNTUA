  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the benefit of treatment with a physician administered intracanalicular
      dexamethasone insert in evaporative dry eye disease (DED) patients with meibomian gland
      disfunction (MGD) and underlying inflammation undergoing LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, non-randomized, investigator-sponsored clinical
      study seeks to investigate the benefit of managing patients with DED secondary to MGD with a
      sustained release intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4 mg) insert in addition to LipiFlow
      Thermal Pulsation compared to LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation alone. In addition, this study will
      evaluate the ease of Dextenza insertion and the patient preference for therapy.

      After screening a given patient for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and gaining informed
      consent, each eye will undergo LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation on the same day. The most
      symptomatic eye will be selected to receive DEXTENZAÂ® insertion on the day of the procedure
      (study eye), while the other eye will be assigned to a receive a sham punctum dilation
      (control eye). If there is no obvious symptomatic difference, the right eye will receive the
      intracanalicular insert. Per patient, the study period will last for approximately 12 weeks
      after the LipiFlow procedure, consisting of one screening visit, one treatment v4isit and 3
      post-procedure follow-up visits (week 1, week 4 and week 12). At week 1, week 4 and week 12,
      primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed alongside standard-of-care procedures.
      Adjusting for enrollment period, the study will last a total of approximately 4 months.
