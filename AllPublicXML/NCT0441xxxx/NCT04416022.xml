  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who fulfil the inclusion criteria and who are planned for labour induction will be
      recruited. Bishop score, cervical length, and the presence of cervical glandular area (CGA)
      will be documented for every patient up to 12 hours prior to the induction process, and
      patient information and maternal and neonatal outcome will be documented following the
      delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient consent to participate in the study will be retrieved following the medical decision
      of labor induction and the mode of induction and following the patient consent to the
      induction.

      Bishop score, cervical length, and the presence of cervical glandular area (CGA) will be
      documented for every patient up to 12 hours prior to the induction process.

      The method of induction, data regarding patient demographics, the progress of labor, and the
      maternal and neonatal outcome will be documented following the delivery.
