  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is an experimental study with between groups factor (controls, chronic pain,
      addicted individuals) and repeated measures factor of pain/stress (pain vs no pain) along
      with a longitudinal component to assess stress, pain and addictive behaviors in daily life.

      This proposal aims to systematically examine the physiologic, neuroendocrine and behavioral
      stress and pain responses to an adapted Cold Pressor Test and also assess specific cognitive
      and executive function tests in community volunteers with a history of stress and trauma,
      social users of alcohol, cannabis and individuals with alcohol use disorder, cannabis use
      disorder, opioid use disorder, cocaine use disorder and chronic pain.

    <measure>Pain assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed by asking participants, &quot;Right now, how much pain do you feel?&quot; asked using the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 as outlined in the Laboratory Pain Ratings assessment</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug craving</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Drug craving will be assessed by asking participants, &quot;Right now, how much do you want to use your preferred drug?&quot; This item will be presented in all assessments throughout the study period. Participants will be asked, &quot;How much drug did you use in drinks/grams,&quot; that day in the evening prompt and in the previous day in the evening prompt.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood and anxiety assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures positive and negative mood and anxiety measures during the initial 28-day period. Participants respond to a 20-item test using a 5-point scale ranging from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5) on the EMA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Food consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Food consumption will be assessed via the evening survey during the initial 28-day period. Participants will respond with the top three types of food that they ate (e.g., &quot;vegetables/salad&quot;, &quot;sweet food/dessert&quot;, &quot;white meat (e.g., fish/chicken)&quot;) and to what extent did they continue eating after feeling full (1=Not at all, 100=Very much).</description>
