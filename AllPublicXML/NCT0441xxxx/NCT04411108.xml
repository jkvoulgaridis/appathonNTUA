  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will compare exercise execution between two groups of patients: (1)
      individuals who undergo instruction session by a PT and then perform exercises with a written
      handout at home and (2) individuals who use the mHealth motion coach at home. Participants
      will perform the same 4 exercises. Both groups will be instructed to exercise at home,
      supported either by the handouts or the Motion Coach technology and then return after 1 week
      for assessment.

      For the assessment, standardized videos will be used to capture pose during exercise
      execution. Group 1 will perform the exercises with the written handout; group 2 will perform
      the exercises with the motion coach. Rating will be performed by a panel of PT professionals
      on the overall assessment of each exercises and on the three segments mentioned below that
      are exercise specific. The first group with PT instruction and written handout portion will
      be compared to the second group with the motion coach.
