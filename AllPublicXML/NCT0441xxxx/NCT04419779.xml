  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Revita™ system is being investigated to assess the efficacy of DMR versus Sham on
      improvement in Glycemic, Hepatic and Cardiovascular endpoints for patients with Type 2
      Diabetes who are inadequately controlled with insulin therapy. The purpose of this study is
      to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the Fractyl DMR Procedure using the Revita™ System
      compared to a sham. Subjects randomized to the DMR procedure will be followed per protocol
      till 48 weeks post treatment. Subjects in the Sham treatment arm will be offered cross over
      to receive the DMR treatment at 48 weeks and will be followed per protocol for 24 weeks post
      treatment.

    <description>The Fractyl DMR Procedure utilizes the Revita™ Catheter to perform hyrdothermal ablation of the duodenum. The catheter is delivered trans-orally over a guide-wire to first inject saline to lift the sub-musocal space, followed by an ablation of the duodenal mucosa. Subjects who receive the DMR treatment are followed for 48 weeks post treatment.</description>

    <description>The Sham procedure consists of placing the Revita™ Catheter as described above into the duodenum for a minimum of 30 minutes and then removing it from the patient. Subjects who receive the Sham procedure are followed for 48 weeks post treatment and are offered cross over to undergo the DMR procedure at 48 weeks and are followed for further 24 weeks post treatment. Sham subjects who choose not to cross over are discontinued from the study.</description>
