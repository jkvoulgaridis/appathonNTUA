  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of is critical to improve the overall survival of lung cancer. Due to the
      widely application of computed tomography, numerous lung pulmonary nodules have been
      identified and there is an urgent need to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary
      nodules.

      Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be derived from many different metabolic
      pathways, as well as many types of cells. On the other hand, cancer cells have different
      metabolism pattern. Thus, detecting VOCs in exhaled breath using highly sensitive mass
      spectrometry would be a promising approach for lung cancer detection.

    <textblock>
      Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be derived from many different metabolic
      pathways, as well as many types of cells. VOCs can be transported to the alveoli through the
      blood circulation and expelled by exhalation. Changes in VOCs production, clearance, and
      changes in lung air-blood exchange functions can lead to changes in VOCs concentrations in
      the exhaled breath. VOCs have the advantages of being completely non-invasive and easy to
      collect. They are considered by researchers as the perfect marker for disease diagnosis. At
      present, many clinical studies have found that VOCs in exhaled breath are closely related to
      disease. Specific VOCs characteristics have been identified in many tumors, especially lung
      cancer.

      In this study, large-sample studies will be used to characterize the characteristics of
      exhaled VOCs in lung cancer and healthy people. A lung cancer diagnosis model based on
      exhaled VOCs will be initially established and the validity of the model will be verified.
