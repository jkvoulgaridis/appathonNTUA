  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients with malignant hemopathy is based on comprehensive management. In
      this context and faced with the various difficulties encountered by cancer patients, the
      question of spirituality and its experience is central. Spirituality refers to the person's
      attachment to what inspires and gives him foundation, as well as the beliefs, values, and
      existential experiences associated with it, whether these are religious in nature or not.
      Although the concept has been identified as a resource in the literature and widely treated
      in an end-of-life context, assessing the needs of patients with hematological cancer and
      their loved ones in terms of spirituality from the initiation of treatment does not has not
      been developed
