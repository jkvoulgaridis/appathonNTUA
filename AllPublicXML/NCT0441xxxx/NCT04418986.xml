  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, cataract surgery is regarded as refractive surgery, mainly aiming emmetropia, and this
      makes eliminating corneal astigmatism is critical. Corneal astigmatism of more than 1 diopter
      has been reported in up to 45% of the cataract surgery candidates.

      It is possible to reduce pre-existing corneal astigmatism by creating a clear corneal
      incision at the steep meridian of the cornea, however; creating a small incision can correct
      the only astigmatism up to 1 Diopter, and sometimes this method may not be easy to perform
      due to the location of steep meridian like the difficulty while creating a superonasal or
      inferonasal incision at the left eye. This approach is usually sufficient for correcting
      astigmatism less than 1 D in most eyes. An opposite side clear corneal incision (OCCI) could
      enhance the flattening effect on the cornea.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized, parallel two-arm interventional study, the patients were divided into a 1:1 ratio, the study included eyes with visually significant cataract and preoperative corneal regular astigmatism between 0.75 and 2 Diopters undergoing phacoemulsification surgery. They were divided into two groups: controls underwent phacoemulsification with on-axis incision (CCI Group), and patients underwent phacoemulsification with opposite clear corneal incisions (OCCI Group).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Coaxial small incision cataract surgery was performed for all cases using a 2.8 mm keratome placed at steep meridian and 1-mm paracentesis was made 90 degrees apart with a 20-gauge microvitrectomy blade. Surgery was performed with a 30-degree, 0.9-caliper phacoemulsification tip (microtip) with a divide and conquer technique.
In the OCCI group, a single penetrating incision was created with 2.8 mm keratome in the clear cornea, 1.5 mm anterior to limbal blood vessels, centered over the steep meridian and opposite the phacoemulsification incision.</description>
