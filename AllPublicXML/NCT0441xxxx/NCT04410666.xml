    <textblock>
      Given that the participation of oral microorganisms in the development of the most prevalent
      pathologies of the oral cavity is unquestionable, efforts have been made to create agents
      that allow controlling these bacteria. The objective of this work was to analyze the
      antibacterial effect of green tea infusion used as a mouthwash on saliva and bacterial
      plaque. The green tea infusion was prepared at 13% at approximately 90 ° C, being the same
      applied to 14 participants from the 1st to the 5th grade (experimental group); and to other
      14 participants the placebo was applied (control group). The antibacterial effect was
      determined by counting the colony forming units (CFU) in the cultures of samples of bacterial
      plaque and saliva, taken before the application of the infusion and immediately after.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral diseases, including dental caries, is one of the most prevalent in the population. It is
      multifactorial and originates from the formation of the bacterial plaque and its
      non-elimination by physical and chemical hygiene methods.

      The use of chemical agents to aid in the control of Bacterial Plaque has been the subject of
      study in many investigations. Today there is a variety of elements that can be use to carry
      out proper oral hygiene, such as toothbrushes, toothpastes, dental floss and mouthwash, all
      of them in a wide variety.

      Often the lack of accessibility to these means problems in the hygiene in the population,
      either due to the lack of knowledge or the cost of obtaining them.

      Therefore, the objective of analyzing the antibacterial effect of the infusion of green tea
      (camellia sinensis) used as a mouthwash on saliva and bacterial plaque was presented. The
      proposed research topic is relevant, since if green tea (camellia sinensis) is found to
      produce positive effects on bacterial plaque, it would serve to prevent its formation, thus
      helping to improve dental hygiene with an easy acquisition product and lower cost compared to
      other mouthwashes offered in the market, constituting a natural mouthwash.
