    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined according to the French society of
      otorhinolaryngology as chronic non-mechanical damage to the nasal structures, excluding
      infectious damage to the sinus structures. The duration of the chronic impairment must be at
      least 12 consecutive weeks. It causes many symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal blockage and
      anosmia. It is a poorly understood pathology that affects a large part of the population. Its
      prevalence has increased significantly over the past 30 years. It affects about 11% of the
      population in Europe. It has become one of ten high-cost medical conditions for employers.
      Initially, it was accepted that CRS was due to chronic nasal infection. It is very
      debilitating for patients leading to a major consultation with practitioners (general
      practitioners and ENT specialists). Many treatments are used such as nose washes, nasal or
      oral corticosteroids, antibiotic therapy or even surgical management is possible. Thèses
      treatments allow an improvement in the symptomatology but no treatment allows a stable result
      over time, making long-term treatments essential.

      Today, it is recognized that CRS has a multifactorial etiology including inflammatory
      processes, hyperresponsiveness of the nasal mucosa and abnormalities in immune phenomena. The
      endonasal microbiota plays a role in these processes. Germs like Staphylococcus aureus and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as pathogens in CRS in the first studies with
      bacterial cultures. Thanks to the 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing technique, recent studies have
      demonstrated a modification in the diversity and abundance of the microbiota in patients with
      CRS compared to healthy subjects, notably with a modification of the germs of the firmicutes
      group. .

      Few studies have studied the modification of the microbiota with the treatment of CRS today.
      However, local treatments based on nosewashing with physiological saline associated with
      local corticosteroids and endoscopic treatments lead to an improvement in the symptomatology
      for patients suffering from CRS. This study will describe the modification of endonasal
      microbiota in différent conditions, such medical and surgical treatments, that usually
      improve patients symptomatology.
