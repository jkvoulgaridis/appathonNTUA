  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of intensive care unit (ICU)-based palliative care is highly variable,
      particularly for the 2 million older adults admitted annually to ICUs. To address these care
      delivery barriers among older ICU patients, a mobile app platform called PCplanner
      (Palliative Care planner) was developed. PCplanner automates the identification of high-risk
      patients (e.g., dementia, declining health status, poor functioning) by directly capturing
      data from electronic health record (EHR) systems, cultivates family engagement with
      supportive information and a digital system for self-report of actual needs, and facilitates
      the delivery of care to those with a high burden of need by coordinating collaboration
      between ICU teams and palliative care specialists.

      240 patients, 240 family caregivers, and 215 physicians and nurses from academic and
      community settings will be enrolled in a RCT designed to test the efficacy of
      PCplanner-augmented collaborative palliative care vs usual care. Family caregiver and
      clinician experiences will be explored using mixed methods to understand intervention
      mechanisms as well as implementation barriers within diverse case contexts. The key
      hypothesis is that compared to usual care, PCplanner will reduce family caregivers' unmet
      needs and psychological distress, increase the frequency of goal concordant treatment among
      older adult patients, and reduce hospital length of stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of intensive care unit (ICU)-based palliative care is highly variable,
      particularly for the 2 million older adults admitted annually to ICUs. However, improving
      care quality on a broad scale with the efficient delivery of patient-centered, need-targeted
      palliative care is challenging because of logistical and technological barriers. To address
      these care delivery barriers among older ICU patients, a mobile app platform called PCplanner
      (Palliative Care planner) was developed. PCplanner automates the identification of high-risk
      patients (e.g., dementia, declining health status, poor functioning) by directly capturing
      data from electronic health record (EHR) systems, cultivates family engagement with
      supportive information and a digital system for self-report of actual needs, and facilitates
      the delivery of care to those with a high burden of need by coordinating collaboration
      between ICU teams and palliative care specialists. In pilot comparison to a standard
      palliative care control, the intervention reduced unmet needs, psychological distress, and
      length of stay and increased goal concordant care, communication, and hospice utilization.

      While these data are compelling, an efficacy evaluation of PCplanner is needed. Therefore,
      240 patients, 240 family caregivers, and 215 physicians and nurses will be enrolled from
      academic and community settings in a project with 2 key aims: (1) Test the efficacy of
      PCplanner-augmented collaborative palliative care vs usual care in a randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) with 3-month follow up, and (2) Explore family caregiver and clinician
      experiences using mixed methods to understand intervention mechanisms as well as
      implementation barriers within diverse case contexts. The key hypothesis is that compared to
      usual care, PCplanner will reduce family caregivers' unmet needs and psychological distress,
      increase the frequency of goal concordant treatment among older adult patients, and reduce
      hospital length of stay.
