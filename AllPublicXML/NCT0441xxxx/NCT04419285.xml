  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis Pigmentosa is characterized by a progressive disappearance of photoreceptors,
      responsible for a progressive and severe loss of vision.

      People Retinitis Pigmentosa therefore encounter a large number of difficulties in daily life,
      specifically for:

        -  Visual research

        -  Visuo-motor coordination in tasks requiring fine motor control

        -  Visuo-motor coordination in mobility tasks

      This study aims to assess the difficulties in the daily life of subjects with Retinitis
      Pigmentosa at a very advanced stage unsing, quaify of life questionnaires, simplified
      locomotion tasks in real situation and a posture task.

      They are proposing a new test adapted and carried out in real situations, in binocular and
      monocular vision, making it possible to finely assess locomotion especially for &quot;very low
      vision&quot; patients.

      This test will also ultimately make it possible to better evaluate the effectivements, that
      is to say to observe and quantify objectively by a score the performance progression obtained
      for locomotion tasks related to the visual recovery generated by the treatment.

      This is monocentric study and the total duration of the study is 48 months. The duration of
      participation for each research subject is 3 months and maximum 4 visits. This is research
      involving the human type of non-invasive interventional research, with minimal risks and
      constraints.

      This exploratory study will be conducted on a group of patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa at
      a very advanced stage.

      There will be an inclusion visit including a visual assessment and an ophthalmological
      consultation. Two experimental visits with tests carried out in a real environment including
      a locomotion and a posture tasks. An end-of-study visit within a maximum of 1 month following
      the second experimental visit.

    <description>The locomotion task which takes place in a Streetlab platform. The subject must follow a line on the ground, straight or composed of turns. For the other tests, the number of turns and the distance to be covered are identical, but the shapes of the courses are systematically different.
The posturology task SOT (Sensory Organization Test) takes place in a StreetLab platform with uniform walls without decorations so as to remove any localization element.
The subject is instructed to stand with his hands on his hips as steadily as possible. This test includes 4 experimental conditions for disturbing sensory inputs. the duration of acquisition is 30 seconds, during which the subject must hold a standing position as tatic as possible, without speaking, els hands positioned on the hips while looking straight ahead. Four experimental conditions are tested: Eyes open on a hard floor, eyes closed on a hard floor, eyes open on a foam tray, eyes closed on a foam tray.</description>
