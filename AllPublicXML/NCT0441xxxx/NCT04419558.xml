    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30 mg/kg intravenous (IV)
      infusions of pamrevlumab administered every 3 weeks as compared to placebo in subjects with
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF) over a 52 week period.

      Subjects who were previously treated with approved IPF therapies (i.e., nintedanib or
      pirfenidone; unless neither treatment is available in the host country) may be eligible for
      screening, provided that the subject is not currently receiving treatment with an approved
      IPF therapy.

      NOTE: No subject should discontinue an approved IPF therapy for the purpose of enrolling in
      this study.

      Approximately 340 eligible subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to Arm A or Arm B,
      respectively:

      Arm A: pamrevlumab, 30 mg/kg IV, Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter Arm B: Matching placebo
      IV, Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter

      Randomization will be stratified by GAP stage (I, II, III) derived from GAP scores obtained
      at screening.

      Screening period: Up to 6 weeks

      Treatment period: 48 weeks

      Follow-up period/final assessment: 4 weeks (Week 52 [+7 Days])

      The intent of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of pamrevlumab as
      monotherapy in subjects with IPF who were previously treated with an approved therapy but who
      discontinued that therapy (possible reasons for discontinuation of approved therapy could
      include, but are not limited to, intolerance or disease progression), unless neither
      treatment is available in the host country.

      During the treatment period, co-administration of an approved IPF therapy (i.e., pirfenidone
      or nintedanib) is acceptable if clinically indicated in the Investigator's opinion, after
      assessment of potential risks/benefits of such combination with blinded study treatment.
      However, since subjects either tried and stopped treatment with an approved IPF therapy, or
      have no such treatment available, it is not expected that many subjects will resume treatment
      with an approved IPF therapy during this study.

      Subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason should be encouraged to remain in the
      study and be followed for all study visits and assessments.

      Subjects who complete the study will be eligible for an open-label extension with
      pamrevlumab.

    <description>The LCQ is a self-reporting quality of life measure of chronic cough. It consists of 19 items with a 7 point likert response scale (range from 1 to 7). Each item is developed to assess symptoms during cough and impact of cough on three main domains: physical, psychological and social. Scores are calculated as a mean of each domain and the total score is calculated by adding every domain score.</description>
