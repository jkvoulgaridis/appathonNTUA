  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and longer-term
      sustainability of a differentiated care delivery model for improving HIV treatment outcomes.
      The central hypothesis is that the integration of community-based HIV and NCD care with group
      microfinance will improve retention in care and rates of viral suppression (VS) among people
      living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya via two mechanisms: improved household economic status and
      easier access to care.

      The specific aims are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the extent to which integrated community-based HIV care with group
           microfinance affects retention in care and VS among n=900 PLHIV in rural western Kenya
           using a cluster randomized intervention design of n=40 existing (fully HIV+)
           microfinance groups to receive either: (A) integrated community-based HIV and NCD care
           or (B) standard care. Data from the two trial arms will be augmented with a matched
           contemporaneous control group of n=300 patients receiving standard care and not involved
           in microfinance (group C), comparing outcomes in groups A, B and C. The hypothesize is
           that A &gt; B &gt; C in terms of viral suppression and retention in care.

        2. To identify specific mechanisms through which microfinance and integrated
           community-based care impact VS. Using a mixed methods approach, the study will
           characterize the mechanisms of effect on patient outcomes. Investigators will conduct
           quantitative mediation analysis to examine two main mediating pathways (household
           economic conditions and easier access to care), as well as exploratory mechanisms (food
           security, social support, HIV- related stigma). Investigators will also use qualitative
           methods and multi-stakeholder panels to contextualize implementation of the
           intervention.

        3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of microfinance and integrated community-based care
           delivery to maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention
           strategy. The working hypothesis is that the differentiated model will be cost-effective
           in terms of cost per HIV suppressed person-time, cost per patient retained in care, and
           cost per disability-adjusted life year saved.

      The main expected outcomes will be rigorous evidence of effectiveness, mechanisms and
      cost-effectiveness of a differentiated model for achieving the last key step in the HIV care
      continuum. These results are expected to have an important positive impact in terms of
      improved, high-quality services that address known individual and structural barriers to care
      and promote long-term sustainability of care for PLHIV in rural settings with high HIV
      prevalence.

    <intervention_model_description>Aim 1: Cluster randomized trial where 40 existing microfinance (MF) groups with n=900 members are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either integrated community-based care (ICB) (Study Arm A) or standard care (Study Arm B). The ICB intervention will be delivered during regular MF group meetings monthly during trial months 1-6 and quarterly during months 7-18. The intervention will include (1) clinical teams visits with vital signs screening, consultations, medication distribution (ART and other chronic/acute medications), POC laboratory testing (creatinine, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, viral load); (2) peer support; (3) referrals to facilities as needed. Members of MF groups randomized to Study Arm B will continue to receive care at an AMPATH facility. Study Arm C will include n=300 participants who receive standard care at an AMPATH facility and are not involved in MF. Aim 2: Mediation analyses with n=50 trial participants. Aim 3: Cost-effectiveness analyses with n=5 budget staff.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention will include the following components: (1) integrated care visits by clinical team occurring monthly during months 1-6 of the trial, and then quarterly for the remaining months (7-18), which include vital signs screening, consultation with a clinical officer, medication distribution (ART and other chronic and acute medications), and point- of-care (POC) laboratory testing (creatinine, blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C, and viral load as it becomes available); (2) peer support for promoting ART adherence during every monthly MF meeting; (3) referrals to facilities for emergency or acute care needs that are not feasible to address in the community. Integrated care refers to delivery of primary, HIV and NCD-related care, incorporating a focus on both chronic and acute needs.</description>

    <description>Group microfinance uses a client-driven model that involves community savings groups where members mobilize and manage their own savings, provide interest-bearing loans to group members, offer a limited form of financial insurance, and contribute to a social fund that is used for income-generating activities and in cases of emergency or welfare issues of group members.
For this study, group microfinance will refer to existing, active AMPATH Group Integrated Savings for Empowerment (GISE) microfinance groups with a majority of group members who are AMPATH HIV patients and have disclosed their HIV status. Groups will be considered active if the group was formed at least 6 months prior to study baseline, is consistently meeting as scheduled, and is actively engaging in saving and loaning.</description>
