  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling evidences indicate that lipid-lowering therapy can reduce the high-risk plaque
      feathers and improve the coronary flow reserve. This study is going to investigate the change
      of lesion-specific hemodynamic significance as determined by ML(Machine Learning)-based
      CT-FFR (Computed Tomography-Fractional Flow Reserve)after Evolocumab treatment.

    <description>After one year's treatment of Elovocumab Injection, the patients will undergo follow-up CCTA again. We will measure the proximal and distal CT-FFR for each lesion.At the same time ,we will calculated the change in CT-FFR value across the lesion(ΔCT-FFR=CT-FFRproximal-CT-FFRdistal).To compare the parameters above,we shall identify whether the treatment of Elovocumab Injection improves the lesion-specific CT-FFR.</description>

    <time_frame>June 2020 to December 2021</time_frame>
    <description>After one year's treatment of Elovocumab Injection, the patients will undergo follow-up CCTA again. We will measure the minimal lumen diameter for each lesion. Minimal lumen diameter will be manually measured with a digital caliper at the narrowest level of the lesion using the crosssectional images accroding to the CCTA findings. The results of the minimal lumen diameter at baseline will be compared with results obtained during follow‑up to examine the effects of Elovocumab Injection therapy.</description>

    <description>After one year's treatment of Elovocumab Injection, the patients will undergo follow-up CCTA again. We will measure TPV for each lesion. Total plaque volume will be automatically measured using the dedicated plaque analysis software. The results of TPV at baseline will be compared with results obtained during follow‑up to examine the effects of Elovocumab Injection therapy.</description>

    <description>200 selected patients will be recruited, who have diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis disease(stenotic extent from 50% to 69% on major epicardial arteries) by coronary computed tomography angiography(CCTA). Every two weeks, these patients will be treated with Elococumab Injection (1ml:140mg),ih.This therapy will last for one year.</description>
