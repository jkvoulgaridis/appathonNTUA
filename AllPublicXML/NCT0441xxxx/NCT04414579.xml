      The purpose of this investigator-initiated trial is to compare the efficacy in terms of time
      to recovery from hyperglycemia as measured by time to arrest of hyperglycemic excursion
      (&quot;glucose plateau point&quot;, primary endpoint) and return to premeal glucose target if feasible
      (secondary endpoint) between Fiasp and conventional insulin aspart when used as a correction
      bolus. These endpoints will be determined by CGM (Dexcom) from data exported from the Dexcom
      Clarity program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 DM using CSII require bolus insulin for two purposes: first, to cover
      carbohydrate intake to control postprandial glucose, and second, to correct episodes of
      hyperglycemia. The latter function is referred to as a &quot;correction dose&quot; or &quot;correction
      bolus&quot;. Insulin pumps have bolus calculators which calculate correction doses based on the
      patient's individualized BG target and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF). Rapid-acting insulin
      analogues delivered by pump typically require 2 to 4 hours to fully correct an acute
      hyperglycemic episode, and sometimes multiple correction doses are needed to normalize the
      blood glucose level. This can be frustrating for patients, particularly when a correction
      bolus is necessary in addition to a meal bolus; frequently, patients must wait for the
      correction bolus to take effect and delay eating until the blood glucose has begun to
      normalize to avoid severe postprandial hyperglycemia. There is consequently an unmet need in
      insulin delivery, and in particular in CSII, for an insulin which can correct a hyperglycemic
      episode more rapidly than is currently possible with rapid-acting insulin analogues.

      Faster insulin aspart (Fiasp) is a novel formulation of insulin aspart with an accelerated
      time-action profile which results in twice the exposure to insulin and 74% greater insulin
      action within the first 30 minutes after injection compared to conventional insulin aspart
      (1). This results in twice-as-fast onset of appearance in the bloodstream (4 vs. 9 min
      compared to conventional insulin aspart) (1) which has been demonstrated to reduce
      postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 1 DM using CSII (2, 3). Theoretically, this
      faster insulin action would be useful in correction dosing during acute episodes of
      hyperglycemia to normalize the blood glucose level more rapidly than is currently possible
      with conventional insulin aspart (NovoLog).

      Many patients with type 1 DM using CSII now also use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for
      making insulin dosing decisions. Currently the FDA has approved 2 CGM systems for
      nonadjunctive use in bolus insulin dose calculations. Only one of these systems, the Dexcom,
      reads continuously to the patient and has alarms to warn of impending episodes of hyper- or
      hypoglycemia, and this is the system used most commonly by patients with type 1 DM using
      open-loop CSII. Patients now incorporate the Dexcom trend arrow, which depicts the rate and
      direction of glucose change, into the correction dose calculation, and recommendations on how
      to incorporate CGM information into correction dose calculations have recently been updated
      based on an expert consensus report (4). However, these guidelines were created for use with
      rapid acting insulin analogues. How they might need to be modified for use with Fiasp (the
      first and only ultra-rapid insulin analogue) is not known.

      The purpose of this investigator-initiated trial is to compare the efficacy in terms of time
      to recovery from hyperglycemia as measured by time to arrest of hyperglycemic excursion
      (&quot;glucose plateau point&quot;, primary endpoint) and return to premeal glucose target if feasible
      (secondary endpoint) between Fiasp and conventional insulin aspart when used as a correction
      bolus. These endpoints will be determined by CGM (Dexcom) from data exported from the Dexcom
      Clarity program.

      Study hypothesis:

      Compared to conventional insulin aspart, Fiasp will correct hyperglycemia (defined as arrest
      of rise of blood glucose, following correction bolus, ie, GPP ) faster than conventional
      insulin aspart in subjects with type 1 DM using CSII.

    <masking_description>This is an open-label crossover trial. Subjects will be randomized to treatment sequence (Fiasp then NovoLog or NovoLog then Fiasp), each for a 12-week treatment period, by CSII. Randomization sequence will be determined by computerized randomization program. All patients will receive both treatments unless they drop out. Dropouts are unlikely since the participants are all regular continuing patients of the site's clinical practice.</masking_description>

    <description>In the aspart group, the subject will only take aspart through the their pump. This study population will have an established expertise in diabetes self-management with previous knowledge of insulin pump therapy and Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). Allowing the subjects to use their insulin pumps for bolus insulin delivery, as they are accustomed, will minimize the chances of skipping meal boluses and correction doses. Aspart is put into their pump and delivered to their body through a small tube placed under your skin. In this NovoLog®-only treatment group, the subject will take aspart with each meal while your pump also gives you a slow, continuous dose of aspart for basal insulin. This treatment group is very similar (or even identical) to the treatment the subject was receiving prior to starting the study.</description>
