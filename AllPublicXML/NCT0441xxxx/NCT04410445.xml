      The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab
      versus nivolumab in patients with completely resected Stage IIIA/B/C/D, or Stage IV cutaneous
      melanoma who are at high risk for recurrence.

      The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, as measured by recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), of bempegaldesleukin plus
      nivolumab versus nivolumab in patients with completely resected Stage IIIA (lymph node [LN]
      metastasis &gt; 1 mm), Stage IIIB/C/D, or Stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]
      8th edition) cutaneous melanoma with no evidence of disease (NED) who are at high risk for
      recurrence.

          -  Male or female patients, age 12 years or older at the time of signing the informed
             consent form (age 18 years or older where local regulations or institutional policies
             do not allow for patients &lt; 18 years of age to participate).

          -  Histologically confirmed Stage IIIA (LN metastasis &gt; 1 mm), IIIB/C/D, or IV
             (M1a/b/c/d) cutaneous melanoma by AJCC (8th edition) at study entry that has been
             completely surgically resected within 12 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Tumor tissue from biopsy or resected disease must be provided to central laboratory
             for PD-L1 status analysis. Must have PD-L1 expression classification for
             stratification purposes.

          -  Disease-free status documented by a complete physical examination and imaging studies
             within 28 days prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with Type I diabetes mellitus,
             hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger are permitted to enroll.

          -  Conditions requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of
             randomization. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses &gt; 10
             mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune
             disease.

          -  Prior therapy for melanoma except surgery for the melanoma lesion(s) and/or adjuvant
             radiation therapy for central nervous system lesions.

          -  Prior therapy with interferon, talimogene laherparepvec (Imylgic®), interleukin-2
             (IL-2) directed therapy, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antibody (including ipilimumab or any
             other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint
             pathways).

          -  Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers
             that have been apparently cured.
