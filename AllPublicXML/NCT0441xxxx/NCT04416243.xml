  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence to support the efficacy of moderate intensity continuous (MIC)
      exercise benefitting clinically-relevant outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      However, persons with MS who have walking impairments (pwMS-wd) are severely deconditioned
      and may achieve superior benefits by engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT),
      especially while utilizing adaptive equipment, such as with recumbent arm/leg stepping
      (RSTEP). Of the published studies on HIIT in MS, HIIT yielded significant improvements in
      cardiorespiratory fitness in all but one study. In those studies that directly compared HIIT
      to MIC exercise, the data indicated a potential superiority of HIIT as compared to MIC in
      improving physiological conditioning in a time efficient manner. However, this evidence is
      specific to those with MS with mild to moderate disability engaging in cycle/arm ergometry
      and an investigation of HIIT in pwMS-wd is needed as the feasibility and potential benefits
      of engaging in HIIT in pwMS-wd is relatively unknown.

      The primary aim of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of a 12-week, RSTEP HIIT
      program in pwMS-wd. The secondary aim is to examine changes in aerobic fitness, physical
      activity, ambulation, upper arm function, cognition, fatigue, and depressive symptoms as
      clinically-relevant efficacy outcomes following the 12-week, RSTEP HIIT intervention. It is
      hypothesized that the intervention will be feasible and lead to positive changes in aerobic
      fitness, physical activity, ambulation, upper arm function, cognition, fatigue, and
      depressive symptoms. This work is informed by recently published data, which indicate that a
      single bout of RSTEP HIIT taxes the cardiorespiratory system significantly more than MIC
      exercise, yet without untoward effects on walking, gait, cognition, mood, or enjoyment. These
      data suggest that RSTEP HIIT may be an acceptable, safe, and tolerable stimulus for chronic
      exercise training.

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>Recumbent Stepping, High-Intensity Interval Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention will involve 12 weeks of supervised, progressive (i.e., intensity increases after midpoint testing based on reassessment of aerobic fitness) HIIT sessions two to three times per week. HIIT exercise sessions will be manualized and led by exercise leaders. Secondary outcomes testing will occur at baseline (week 0), midpoint (following week 6 of training), and post-intervention (following week 12 of training).
The individual HIIT sessions will involve 10 cycles of 60s intervals at the wattage associated with 90% VO2peak followed by 60s of active recovery intervals at 15 watts, totaling 20 min in length. All exercise sessions will begin and end with a 5-minute warm-up and cool-down, respectively. Required power output for each interval of the exercise session will be individualized and completely automated. VO2peak from baseline and midpoint testing will be used to determine exercise intensity for weeks 1-6 and weeks 7-12, respectively.</description>
