  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complexity of psoriasis is partially affected by dietary effects, and some diets have
      shown to be beneficial in psoriasis. Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve many of
      these disturbances, even inflammatory parameters such as TNF and CRP. Individuals with
      psoriasis have been reported to have impaired intestinal integrity and it has been suggested
      that gut health affects skin health, pointing towards a gut-skin axis. Understanding how
      dietary lifestyles can affect epithelial lineages such as the skin and gut, will greatly
      improve our understanding on the development of psoriasis. Modified intermittent fasting
      (MIF) of 2 non-consecutive days has shown to have positive metabolic effects, yet its effect
      on gut and skin remains underexplored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the role of gut health, more specifically the intestinal barrier, in individuals
      with psoriasis and the effects of fasting on both organs in a prospective cohort cross-over
      study. The investigators will test whether MIF can improve (i) skin lesions (clinical and
      molecular level), (ii) intestinal integrity markers such as zonulin, IFABP and sCD14, and
      (iii) the timing of these improvements. As such, it can be determined whether fasting
      benefits psoriasis and gut health. MIF will consist of a limited calorie uptake of 500 kcal
      for 2 days a week. The remaining days of the week are as usual. Gut and skin health will be
      tested at the molecular level during 12 weeks with another crossover of 12 weeks (alternating
      between MIF and usual diet).
