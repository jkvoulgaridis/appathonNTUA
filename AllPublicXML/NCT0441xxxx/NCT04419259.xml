    <textblock>
      An exploratory open-label study of rosacea patients to study the efficacy and tolerability of
      erenumab in the prophylactic treatment of persistent redness and flushing attributed to
      rosacea. Approximately 30 subjects will be included in the study and receive erenumab 140 mg
      for three months. The study will begin June 2020 and is expected to last nine months.
