  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is prevalent in older adults and poses a risk factor for the development
      of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effect of non-exercise
      physical activity using a standing desk on clinical variables in older adults with type 2
      diabetes.

    <description>We proposed a dynamic standing approach (working while standing accompanied by small periodic stepping movements) as a more tolerable and thereby more applicative lifestyle modification. To evaluate this form on healthy subjects, three different conditions were applied: 3 hours of sitting, static standing and dynamic standing. Both standing conditions were done with height-adjustable table which was developed at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)</description>
