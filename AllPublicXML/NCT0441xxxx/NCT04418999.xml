  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug delivery platforms are an innovative exciting advancement in ophthalmology. They allow
      patients to eliminate topical medications which are generally associated with lack of
      compliance, difficulty of use and requiring help from family members. These delivery systems
      can be applied easily in office, and patients do not have to worry about drop insertion in
      their post-operative regimen.

      The results of this research project should help to answer the following question: Does the
      use of a physician administered intracanalicular dexamethasone insert improve the signs and
      symptoms of ocular allergy and dry eye disease in KC patients compared to the use of topical
      loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.38%?
