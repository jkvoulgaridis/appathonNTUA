  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adverse effects of rheumatologic diseases, especially Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), on
      sexual functions are known. The causes of sexual dysfunction in rheumatologic diseases are
      due to factors such as pain, weakness, fatigue, stiffness, functional disability, anxiety,
      depression, hormonal deficiency, drug use, decreased libido and poor body image. Depending on
      these factors, sexual intercourse and frequency of sexual intercourse may decrease. Sexual
      dysfunction may be seen in AS due to physical and emotional problems caused by the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many studies in the literature that determine sexual satisfaction and sexual
      dysfunction in individuals with AS and compare individuals with AS to healthy individuals .
      In the light of these studies, the investigators thought that the sexual function of partner
      of individuals with AS may also be affected negatively. In the literature, no previous study
      examines the sexual function of partner of individuals with AS. Therefore, the aim was to
      determine the sexual function of partner of individuals with AS and to compare with healthly
      adults of the same sex.

The lowest score is two (2) and the highest score is thirty-six (36). A higher score means better function. Rosen et al.
