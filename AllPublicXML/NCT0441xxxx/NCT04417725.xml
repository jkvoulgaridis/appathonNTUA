  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to describe the burden of disease among three different
      cohorts of patients: (1) patients diagnosed with CKD, (2) those with T2DM; and (3) those with
      T2DM and comorbid CKD.

    <measure>Comorbidity and complication profiles and rates</measure>
    <time_frame>2010 to 2019 fiscal years</time_frame>
    <description>For all three cohorts, comorbidities and complications of interest include:
Diabetic: hypoglycemia, lower limb amputations, diabetic ketoacidosis
Renal: acute kidney injury, acute renal failure, anemia, urogenital tract infections, albuminuria, hematuria, fast estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, CKD progression, continuous renal replacement therapy, dialysis initiation
Cardiovascular: CV events (atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure (specific and broad), peripheral artery disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)), CV hospitalization, CV mortality
Other: fractures and all-cause mortality
Any event: Composite outcome to capture any of the above
For the CKD cohort, results will also be stratified by T2DM status. Comorbidity/complication rates between the T2DM and T2DM/CKD comorbid populations will be compared.</description>

    <description>Logistic regression model to assess association of variables of interest (age, sex, health region, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as conditions in outcome 2), ACR, HbA1c, medication use.

    <measure>Healthcare resource use (HCRU) and associated costs for CKD patients</measure>
    <time_frame>2010 to 2019 fiscal years</time_frame>
    <description>HCRU include: inpatient hospitalizations, hospital length of stay, emergency department visits, general practitioner and specialist visits.
Costs include: hospital costs, emergency department costs, physician costs, medication costs.
This will be performed for all patients with CKD and stratified by T2DM status.</description>

        Patients with CKD will be defined using a published algorithm based on ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CA
        diagnostic codes and eGFR/albuminuria laboratory test values.

        Patients with T2DM will be defined using a published algorithm based on ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CA
        diagnostic codes.

        Patients with comorbid T2DM/CKD will be identified among patients identified with prevalent
        T2DM. CKD comorbidity will be defined as identified CKD within the two years prior or any
        time after the T2DM index date.
