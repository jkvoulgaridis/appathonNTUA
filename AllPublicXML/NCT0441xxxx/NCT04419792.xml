  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and
      significantly impacts quality of life. People with narcolepsy demonstrate many potential
      barriers to being physically active, such as sleepiness and social isolation. Very little is
      known about how physical performance variables may be affected and influence disease
      experience in people with narcolepsy. This study aims to profile the physical fitness and
      physical functioning variables of adults with narcolepsy and to explore the relationship
      between physical variables, quality of life, symptom severity and disease experience in this
      cohort.

      This study aims to profile the physical functioning variables of people with narcolepsy
      attending an outpatient clinic at St. James's Hospital. This will be accomplished by
      ascertaining the cardiopulmonary fitness, physical activity, and muscle strength and
      endurance of this population.

      Secondary objectives of this study will be to explore the relationship between physical
      performance indices and sleep quality, functional ability and quality of life in this
      population.

        The following eligibility criteria: Aged 18 to 65 years, diagnosis of type 1 or type 2
        narcolepsy based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders third edition
        criteria for at least six months, eligibility screened by their treating clinician, and
        able to understand English and follow simple instruction to enable completion of
        assessments. Additionally, participants will be required to provide signed and informed
        consent to participate in the study, and for processing of their data to be eligible for
        participation. Individuals with sleep disorders other than narcolepsy, contraindications to
        moderate-intensity exercise, confirmed pregnancy or significant psychiatric illness or
        cognitive impairment will be excluded from participating in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 or type 2 based on the International
             Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) criteria for at least 6
             months - diagnosis for at least 6 months will ensure that initial fluctuations due to
             likely starting on new drug regimen are relatively stable.

          2. Eligibility screened and agreement of the participant's treating clinician in
             Narcolepsy out-patient clinic of St. James's Hospital that he/she can participate - to
             ensure that as per General Data Protection Regulation guidelines that the treating
             clinician eligibility screens rather than the physiotherapy study researcher.

          3. Patients aged ≥18 to &lt;65 years at the time of obtaining informed consent - as patients
             &gt;18 years will not been seen in this centre, and patients &gt;65 years may have
             age-related changes in cardiovascular fitness and physical activity which may be
             difficult to separate from those pertaining to narcolepsy diagnosis.

          4. Able to understand English - as questionnaires will necessitate a sufficient level of
             English for completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with sleep disorders other than narcolepsy (e.g., moderate to severe sleep
             apnea syndrome, moderate to severe periodic limb movement disorder) - so results are
             not diluted by including conditions other than narcolepsy.

          2. Any medical contraindication to exercise of moderate intensity and short duration
             including but not limited to cardiovascular or respiratory conditions, morbid obesity,
             and severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities - as these conditions would
             preclude ability to conduct physical test battery.

          3. Confirmed pregnancy - people with an advanced pregnancy may score differently on
             physical functioning/performance tests, people with a confirmed pregnancy will be
             excluded from study participation to limit bias.

          4. Dementia or significant cognitive impairment or psychiatric illness that would
             preclude ability to participate in study.
