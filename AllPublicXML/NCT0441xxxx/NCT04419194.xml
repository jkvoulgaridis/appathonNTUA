  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the risks of daily hospital admissions for pulmonary embolism associated with
      short term exposure to climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, air pressure, sunshine
      duration, relative humidity, wind speed, and ambient fine particulate matter [aerodynamic
      diameter ≤2.5 μm; PM2.5]) in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital admissions for pulmonary embolism were identified based on the primary diagnosis.
      The central adjudication committee at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Beijing, China)
      reviewed all medical and death records and determined the final diagnosis. Two adjudication
      committee members verified events independently, and discrepancies were resolved by
      discussion involving additional committee members.For each admission, we extracted data on
      the date of admission, sex, age, and location of the patient from hospital information
      system.

      All the data of daily meteorological variables for the same period, including temperature
      variables (°C) (the min, max and mean temperature), relative humidity (%), air pressure
      (hPa), precipitation (mm), wind speed (m/s) and sunshine duration (h), were collected from
      the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System
      (http://www.escience.gov.cn/metdata/page/index.html). The data on PM2.5 levels in each city
      was collected from the National Air Pollution Monitoring System.

      An overdispersed generalised additive model was used to estimate associations between
      climatic factors and pulmonary embolism admissions. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM)
      was employed to examine their lagged effects.
