  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective single arm open label intervention study over 16 weeks using the
      DHFS and a telemedicine platform with persons living with HIV who are not virologically
      suppressed, admitted to UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center and initiating or restarting
      anti-retroviral therapy (ARVs). This proof of concept study will investigate the feasibility
      of using the DHFS in hospitalized individuals living with HIV to support ARV adherence. The
      Study intervention has an initiation phase of 2 weeks, a persistence phase of 14 weeks and a
      follow-up phase out to 48 weeks. Once study consent is obtained, the participant will receive
      a focused case navigation, psychiatric and substance abuse evaluation and will initiate
      digitized ARVs, either in hospital or at the AVRC within 14 days of hospital discharge, in
      collaboration with their providers. The study intervention will be considered to start from
      the point at which the DHFS is started. The study team will ensure the participants continue
      to utilize the DHFS both in hospital and after discharge. Following the 16 week intervention
      the study team will continue to follow participants to evaluate retention in care and viral
      suppression up to 48 weeks in collaboration with the outpatient care providers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV seropositive status, as documented by positive licensed HIV antibody testing and a
             detectable viral load &gt; 1000 copies/ml.

          2. Persons admitted to UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center with an HIV associated diagnosis and
             to receive HIV care through UCSD Owen Clinic, FHCSD HIV Clinic or San Ysidro Health
             HIV Clinic post hospital discharge.

          3. Persons initiating or continuing treatment for HIV infection by their HIV provider,
             that includes either:

               1. Dolutegravir/Tenofovir alafenamide/Emtricitabine: IS-DTG/TAF/FTC (Tivicay® and
                  Descovy®)

          4. Eligible for antiretroviral medications and in possession of prescriptions for above
             noted study eligible regimens.

          5. Laboratory values obtained by screening laboratories within 30 days of entry:

             sterilization (e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingotomy) must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to study entry.
