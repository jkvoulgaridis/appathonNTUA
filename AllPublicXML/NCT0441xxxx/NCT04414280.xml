  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since February 2019 the first hybrid closed-loop insulin pump, the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G
      system, has been offered to people with type 1 diabetes in Belgium. Despite previous studies,
      the impact of this insulin pump on glycemic control and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) is
      still unclear. Therefore, this study will evaluate the impact of the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G
      system on glycemic control and PROMs in people living with type 1 diabetes under real-life
      conditions. In a multicenter real-world observational study, 350 people with type 1 diabetes
      who are treated with the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G system in one of 17 Belgian centers, will
      be followed for a period of 12 months. The primary endpoint is the evolution of time spent in
      range (defined as a sensor glucose value between 70 and 180 mg/dL) from before start to 12
      months after start of the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G system.

      Since not much is known about the impact of hybrid closed-loop on partners of adults living
      with type 1 diabetes, an optional substudy (INRANGE-PARTNER) will be performed investigating
      the quality of life in partners of type 1 diabetes patients using the Medtronic MiniMedTM
      670G system. More specifically, the substudy will compare the quality of life of partners of
      type 1 diabetes patients both before and after implementation of the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G
      system.

    <description>Patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 18 years or older, who start with the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G system (as part of routine clinical practice) in one of the 17 participating centers and who signed informed consent are eligible to participate. The decision about which patient to start, is left to the clinical judgement of the treating health care professional.</description>

    <description>The Medtronic MinimedTM 670G system is a form of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery. The Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G system automatically adjusts basal insulin every five minutes based on CGM readings to reach a glucose target of 120 mg/dL, the SmartGuardTM Auto Mode. Patients still need to enter their carbohydrate intake and administer meal-time and correction boluses. Before Auto Mode is introduced, the Medtronic MiniMedTM 670G system has to be worn in Manual Mode. In contrast to Auto Mode, Manual Mode features an insulin stop up to 30 minutes before or when reaching preset low limits (suspend before/on low) and an automatic insulin restart when blood sugar levels recover. During Manual Mode the pump 'becomes familiar with' the daily insulin need of the patient. This information will be used when in Auto Mode.</description>
