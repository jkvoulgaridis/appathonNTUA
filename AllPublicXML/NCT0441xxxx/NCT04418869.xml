  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is an important part of diabetes management in adolescents with
      type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increased physical activity has several beneficial effects such as
      improved lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and quality of life. In addition, a reduced HbA1c
      is often seen in association to increased physical activity. However, the effect on glycemic
      control and the acute glycemic response seems to differs between different types of exercise.
      This issue is poorly studied in adolescents with T1D and the mechanism behind this is not
      fully understood.

      The primary aim of this study was to compare the acute effects on glycemia of resistance and
      two aerobic continuous and intermittent exercise bouts in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
      Secondarily, the investigators want to compare the different exercise according to hormonal
      changes and expression of mRNA in muscle.

      At a baseline visit the participants was tested for maximal oxygen consumption (pVO2peak) and
      maximal strength (1-RM). The study participants then performed three exercise bouts and one
      control session (resting), each on 45 minutes, in a randomized order. Measurement was
      performed during and after the exercise.
