    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged ≥40 years when signing the informed consent.

          2. Diagnosis:

               1. IPF based on 2018 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Guideline as confirmed by the investigator
                  based on chest High Resolution Computed Tomography Scan (HRCT) scan taken within
                  12 months of Visit 1 and if available surgical lung biopsy.

                  and

               2. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or probable UIP HRCT pattern consistent with
                  the clinical diagnosis of IPF, as confirmed by central review prior to Visit 2*

                    -  if indeterminate HRCT finding IPF may be confirmed locally by (historical)
                       biopsy

          3. Stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. Patients have to be either :

               -  not on therapy with nintedanib or pirfenidone for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit
                  1 (combination of nintedanib plus pirfenidone not allowed), or

               -  on stable* therapy with nintedanib or pirfenidone for at least 8 weeks prior to
                  Visit 1 and planning to stay stable on this background therapy after
                  randomisation.

             [*stable therapy is defined as the individually and general tolerated regimen of
             either pirfenidone or nintedanib]

          4. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ≥45% of predicted normal at Visit 1

          5. Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected for haemoglobin
             [Hb] [Visit 1]) ≥ 25% to &lt; 80% of predicted normal at Visit 1.

          6. Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Relevant airways obstruction (pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one
             second (FEV1)/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &lt; 0.7) at Visit 1.

          2. In the opinion of the Investigator, other clinically significant pulmonary
             abnormalities.

          3. Acute IPF exacerbation within 4 months prior to screening and/or during the screening
             period (investigator-determined).

          4. Lower respiratory tract infection requiring antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to Visit
             1 and/or during the screening period.

          5. Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed within 3
             months prior to Visit 1 or planned during the course of the trial. (Being on a
             transplant list is allowed).

          6. Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years
             prior to Visit 1, except appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             &quot;under surveillance&quot; prostate cancer or in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix.

          7. Evidence of active infection (chronic or acute) based on clinical exam or laboratory
             findings at Visit 1 or at Visit 2.

          8. Any suicidal behaviour in the past 2 years (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt,
             aborted attempt, or preparatory acts or behavior).

        Further exclusion criteria apply.
