  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently develop considerable
      deterioration in exercise capacity in association with weakness and deconditioning of the
      respiratory muscles, which can be corrected with specific therapies. While pulmonary
      rehabilitation is a central component in the rather complex manangement of COPD, there is
      currently a lack of centers able to provide appropriate rehabilitation services in the Czech
      Republic. The main objective of this study will be to fully evaluate the utility of the Test
      of Incremental Respiratory Endurance (TIRE) as an at-home inspiratory muscle training method
      in subjects with COPD, while comparing the effectiveness of this novel training approach to
      the outcomes of more traditional ispiratory muscle training protocols.

      This prospective, randomized controlled trial will include 2 treatment groups and 1 sham
      intervention group in a 1:1:1 ratio. All participants will undergo a certain type of IMT
      regardless of group assignment, which will be perfomed via two different devices. The trial
      will comprise of an 8-week at-home training period with remote supervision followed by 4
      months of unsupervised, independent inspiratory muscle training. Study outcomes will include
      measures of inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, pulmonary function, COPD-specific
      symptomatology, functional exercise capacity, surrogate markers of mortality risk, mental
      health status and health-related quality of life of participants. While investigators
      acknowledge the value of standard inspiratory muscle training protocols which use Threshold
      devices, investigators believe that the TIRE training has the potential to provide additional
      clinical benefits since it is able to modulate all aspects of muscular performance, including
      strength, endurance and work capacity. Investigators hypothesize that, as a home-based
      stand-alone rehabilitative therapy, TIRE will be superior to standard IMT in improving
      COPD-related measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following three distinct
      home-based IMT protocols: (1) TIRE, (2) Standard, and (3) Sham (i.e. Low Resistance). All
      subjects will undergo 8 weeks of daily unsupervised IMT using either a PrO2® device (Design
      Net, Smithfield, USA) or Threshold device at home. All training modalities require the
      subjects to be seated and wearing a nose clip while performing the required breaths. Subjects
      will be instructed on respective training procedures and complete first training session in
      the presence of a research team member upon enrollment. Regardless of training method,
      participants will be instructed to fill in diary cards at the end of each training session,
      in which participants document how many breaths were able to perform. This information will
      be later used for compliance assessment. Participants will be also provided with user guides
      developed by investigators research team with detailed instructions regarding equipment
      set-up, training protocol and contact information. In addition, subjects will receive weekly
      phone calls from week 0 to week 8 to encourage compliance and adherence to the study
      protocol, to address any subject questions or concerns, and to collect information regarding
      participants current symptomatology.

    <description>Training will consist of six levels (A-F) with six inspirations at each level for up to 36 breaths per session. TIRE data will be stored in the tablet and automatically synced to account on cloud-based online platform for subsequent interrogation and data retrieval. Before every training session, subjects will be required to complete one maximal and sustained inspiratory effort from which the training is based on for that day.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Threshold - IMT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects assigned to the Standard training regimen will receive a commonly used Threshold inspiratory muscle trainer. This device features a one-way spring-loaded valve at one end and a mouthpiece on the other through which subjects will be required to breathe in hard enough to overcome the resistance provided by the spring-loaded valve, allowing correct inspiration to happen. In other words, air flow is blocked until subjects generate sufficient inspiratory pressure to exceed the device pre-set pressure in cmH2O. The resistance will be set using the device's adjustable pressure setting which is fixed at 50% of the subject's MIP at the time of enrollment. The resistance will be readjusted as needed at week 4 to still reflect 50% of their inspiratory muscle strength at that time. Subjects will be coached to perform up to 36 breaths daily using the device. They will be also instructed to complete the training session within a 30-minute period.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Sham (Low Resistance) training regimen will use the same methods described above for the Standard IMT, except for the amount of resistance applied within the device. Subjects will receive a Threshold which has been set to its minimal resistance, which is 9 cmH2O. Again, subjects will be instructed to perform up to 36 breaths daily using the device within a 30-minute period.</description>
