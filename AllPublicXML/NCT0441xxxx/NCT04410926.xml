    <textblock>
      flexible flatfoot is a common foot misalignment in children. various treatment procedures are
      used to correct or to avoid future complain among adults and pediatric population.

      Ethics Statement This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of
      Physical Therapy, Cairo University, Egypt (no. P.T.REC/012/0016370) and strictly adhered to
      the criteria proclaimed in the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki code of ethics.
      Children's par¬ticipation was commissioned by asking their legal guardian to sign a consent
      form prior to data collection.

      Study design A prospective double-masked randomized controlled trial was carried out from
      September 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 at the Out-patient Physical Therapy Clinic of Faculty
      of Physical Therapy, Cairo University.

      Sample size estimation Sample size calculation was performed prior to the study using G*POWER
      statistical software (version 3.1.9.2; Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany) [F tests-
      MANOVA. Estimates of means of SAI were calculated from a preliminary study included 10
      children who were assigned to the two treatment groups (5 children for each). Repeated
      measures, within-between interaction, α=0.05, β=0.2, Pillai V = 0.1, and large effect size]
      and revealed that the appropriate sample size for this study was not less than 65 children.
      ¬then, 70 children were recruited to account for the possible dropout rates.

      Randomization Sixty-seven volunteer children who were recruited from governmental schools at
      Cairo and Giza Provinces. The online Graph Pad software was used to allocate study
      participants to either intervention group (corrective exercise and NMES) control group
      (corrective exercise and placebo NMES). All children/legal and examiners were unaware of
      group allocation.

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention:
Corrective exercises The experimental and control groups performed a designed strengthening exercises included short-foot exercise, toes-spread-out exercise, toes-extension exercise and toe-curls for 60 minutes. Each exercise was performed for 30 repetitions holding each repetition for 5 seconds (about three minutes).
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation The experimental group received NMES aiming to reinforce the planter intrinsic foot muscles. The surface electrodes were placed over the abductor halluces based on the evidence that it has the largest cross-sectional area of the intrinsic foot muscles</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The footprint is one of the easy, cost effective, noninvasive and objective measures for assessing the SAI. A value of SAI &gt;1.15 indicates flatfeet.</description>

    <measure>Navicular height</measure>
    <time_frame>period of the treatment was 6 successive months</time_frame>
    <description>The navicular height was measured by the navicular drop test first described by Brody21 to evaluate the amount of foot pronation. Measurements of 6-9 mm are considered to be within the normal range. It represents the vertical extension between the most prominent point of the navicular and the supporting surface.</description>

    <description>Radiographic indexes were carried out through bilateral radiographs encompassing horizontal (antero-posterior) and sagittal (lateral) views obtained with the child in a relaxed bipedal weight-bearing erect standing.</description>

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation
The experimental group received NMES aiming to reinforce the planter intrinsic foot muscles. High-voltage pulsed current was set at frequency of 85 Hz with 5 seconds contraction time and 12 seconds rest time while the ramp-up and ramp-down time were 0.3 and 0.7 respectively. The current intensity was adjusted based on the individual tolerance without reporting pain or discomfort while standing on both feet. The stimulation time lasted each session for 30 minutes.</description>
