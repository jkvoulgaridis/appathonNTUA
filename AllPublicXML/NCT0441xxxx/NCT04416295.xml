  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether a digital support and communication platform for COPD patients after 6
      months provides:

        1. Decreased breathlessness on the basis of modified medical research council dyspnea scale
           [mMRC]

        2. Improved health status and symptom relief based on COPD assessment scale [CAT]

        3. Improved quality of life based on EQ-5D

        4. Reduction in the number of incidents, hospital nights, the number of hospitalizations,
           outpatient contacts or the number of deaths related to COPD

        5. A change in the classification of COPD severity based on GOLD A-D

    <description>LifePod consists of a Web-based E-Health platform with two interfaces, one medical for healthcare professionals and one patient interface. LifePod is accessed via a smartphone, tablets and computers via a web application where patients enter symptom parameters and vital parameters such as breathing and mucus status, weight, activity, medication or other disease-specific values. Several different validated questionnaires are sent regularly to the patient to obtain information about the patient's mood and activity. The platform contains a chat function between healthcare professionals and patients. A unique health profile is created in which the patient self-reports their health. The patient receives direct feedback in their web application if they are within the interval given for the individual. The medical interfaces are designed so that patients are automatically placed in a priority order where the person outside the given range is given top priority.</description>
