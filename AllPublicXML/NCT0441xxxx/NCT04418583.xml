  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital abnormality of the thoracic wall and occurs in
      1 in 400 newborns. The gold standard treatment is the Nuss bar Procedure. However, in very
      severe cases, pectus exacavatum involves little or no space between the heart and sternum.
      Because of the limited space, the Nuss procedure is more difficult to perform and there is an
      increased risk of complications such as injuries to the heart or large vessels. However, this
      increased risk can again be reduced by using the Crane technique. This technique increases
      the substernal space by sternal 'hoisting' via an external steel wire. Despite the fact that
      this technique is commonly used, it is not known what its quantitative effect is on the
      substernal space during the Nuss bar procedure. The subsequent aim of this study is to
      quantify the effect of the Crane technique during minimally invasive repair of pectus
      excavatum through three-dimensional scans acquired before and after application of the Crane
      technique.
