  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human (FIH), multi-center, dose escalating study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity of AD-214 when
      administered to healthy volunteers (HVs) and to patients with Interstitial Lung Disease
      (ILD). The study in HVs will be single ascending dose (SAD), randomized, double blind, and
      placebo-controlled (Part A). The study in ILD patients will be open-label, SAD (Part B), and
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) (Part C).
