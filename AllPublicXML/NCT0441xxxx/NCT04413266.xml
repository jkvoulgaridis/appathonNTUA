  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess whether supplementation with curcumin could modulate
      the intestinal microbiota, reducing levels of inflammatory markers of oxidative stress,
      uremic toxins and inflammasome, in patients with chronic kidney disease in peritoneal
      dialysis.

      Curcumin is a chemical compound of the curcuminoids class found in the root of Curcuma
      (Curcuma longa), and due to its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, has been
      suggested as a nutritional strategy to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation present in
      several chronic diseases. Although it is a promising therapy, there are no studies evaluating
      the effects of curcumin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in peritoneal dialysis
      (PD). The aim of this study is evaluated the effect of curcumin supplementation on
      inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in patients with CKD in PD. Methods: This is a
      longitudinal randomized clinical double-blind crossover study, with a washout period and
      placebo-controlled, where patients will be randomized into two groups: Turmeric and Placebo.
      After the 12-week supplementation period, a washout (12 weeks) will be performed for
      subsequent crossover of the patients. Mononuclear cells will be extracted from whole blood
      and the expression of mRNA from transcription factors (Nrf2 and NF-kB), antioxidant enzymes
      (NQO1, HO-1), as well as NLRP3 inflammasome will be analyzed by real-time PCR and protein
      expression by western blotting. Inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-α, PCR, IL-1β, IL-18)
      will be assessed by ELISA, also, plasma levels of TBARS, routine laboratory parameters, as
      well as food intake and nutritional status.
