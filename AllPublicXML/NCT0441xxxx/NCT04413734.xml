      This study is designed to observe and evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the
      anti-programmed-death-1 antibody (anti-PD-1) Triprilumab in combination with chemotherapy of
      Gemcitabine PLUS Cisplatin in patients who were advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with
      no chance for primary surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, also known as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, is derived
      from intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells, the second most common primary liver malignant
      tumor in china. but most (60% -70%) patients is diagnosed at the advanced stage . Gemcitabine
      plus cisplatin is the standard first-line advanced treatment recommended in international and
      domestic guidelines, but the treatment effect remains to be improved.

      The clinical benefits of immune therapies for HCC are emerging. Early clinical data already
      show the safety of immune checkpoint inhibition. This study is to analyze the safety and
      efficacy of immunotherapy Triprilumab Injection combined with Gemcitabine Injection plus
      Cisplatin Injection in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      Patients who were aged 18 to 80 years with a histological or cytological diagnosis of
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma，locally advanced or multiple liver metastases, including
      postoperative occurrence, will be enrolled in this trial.
