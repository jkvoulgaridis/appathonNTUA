  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD modifies respiratory mechanic leading to a present ventilatory inefficiency that leads
      to worsening in dyspnea and reducing the physical activity levels (PAL). Besides, these
      changes increase exacerbation risks and accelerate lung function decline. Therefore, the
      hypothesis of this study is that the elastic tape (ET) used under the thorax can increases
      chest cavity stability and ventilatory capacity reducing dyspnea and changes the pattern of
      physical inactivity. Thus, the aims was evaluate ET effects on dyspnea and PAL in moderate to
      severe COPD.

      This prospective, blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) will includes
      non-obese (BMI&gt;30kg/m2) males with moderate to severe COPD under optimized medication. The
      participants will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either Elastic Tape Group
      (ETG) or Control Group (CG). Both groups will be evaluated in 4 meetings (1st: baseline
      measurements and randomization; 2nd: intervention 1; 3rd: intervention 2; 4th: revaluation),
      however only ETG group will be submitted to the ET. The intervention will last 2 consecutive
      weeks and the patients will need to return (3rd meet) to replace the tapes. Before and after
      the intervention, dyspnea, physical activity, psychosocial symptoms, health related quality
      of life, health status, and barriers to physical activity will be assessed. Data about
      diagnosis, medications, comorbidities and spirometric values will be collected from the
      medical records. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Two-way ANOVA
      with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc of Bonferroni or Kruskal-Wallis test follow
      by pos hoc of Dunn will be used to compare inter and intra-groups differences, according to
      data normality. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline dyspnea at 2 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea will be evaluated by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) and the Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC). The BDI contain 3 components that evoke dyspnea in activities of daily living, in symptomatic individuals. BDI have 3 domains divided in 3 categories (Functional Impairment, Magnitude of Task and Magnitude of Effort). Each of these categories are rated in five grades (0= very severe; 4= no impairment). The BDI total score range from 0 to 12, with lower score indicating worse of severity. TDI measures changes in dyspnea severity from BDI and its items were rated by seven grades ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). The TDI total score ranging -9 to +9, and the lower the score indicate more deterioration in severity of dyspnea. A change of 1 to more units are regarded as a minimally important difference. The mMRC stratifies severity of dyspnea from none to almost complete incapacity (0-4).</description>

    <measure>Change in physical activity levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline physical activity levels at 2 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be objectively quantified using a movement sensor (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) for 7 consecutive days on the hip using an elastic belt. Sedentary behaviour will be quantify by the time spent sedentary (&lt; 100 counts/min).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in psychosocial symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline psychosocial symptoms at 2 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of anxiety and depression symptoms will be assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs), which consists of 14 items divided into 2 subscales (7 for anxiety and 7 for depression). Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a maximum score of 21 points for each subscale. A score greater than 9 in each subscale suggests a diagnosis of either anxiety and/or depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in health-related quality of life at 2 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ consists 20 items rated on 7-point modified likert scale (1= maximum commitment; 7= no commitment) divided into 4 domains: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery. Higher CRQ scores indicate a better quality of life, and treatments resulting in a 0.5-point increase in scores following an intervention are considered to be clinically effective.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health status</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in health status at 2 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The health status will be assessed by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The CAT is a questionnaire for people with COPD consisting in 8 items rated on 0 at 5, with a maximum score of 40 points. A greater score suggests a worse health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in barriers to physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in barriers to physical activity at 2 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The barriers to physical activity will be evaluated by a questionnaire developed for people with COPD. The questionnaire consists in 21 items rated on 0 at 3 (0= never; 3= always) divided into 7 domains: lack of time, social influence, lack of energy, lack of will, fear of injury, lack of skill and lack of structure. The score per domain varies from 0 to 9, with maximum score of 63. A higher scores indicate a greater barrier, and scores greater than 5 are considered significant.</description>

    <description>The patient's trunk will be passively extended before the application. The ET will be placed in the thoracoabdominal region to reduce thoracoabdominal asynchrony and to improve the volume distribution between the thoracic and abdominal compartments. The placement will bey the origins and insertions of the following muscle groups: rectus abdominis, internal oblique, and intercostal. The individuals will receive the ET after baseline evaluations and will remain with them for 1 week, when they will return to replace the ET, totalizing 2 weeks of intervention.</description>
