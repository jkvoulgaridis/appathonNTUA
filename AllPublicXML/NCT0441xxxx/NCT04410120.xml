  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of asthma attacks on
      the lives of patients who experience them. This will help us to describe the true extent of
      the impact of asthma attacks on factors of importance to patients which have not previously
      been well described, including the psychological, social, financial and emotional burden of
      asthma attacks.

      Additionally, it is hoped that detailed questioning regarding features of asthma attacks from
      a patient perspective will improve our understanding of patient recognition of attacks,
      consistency of certain features of attacks and patient views regarding preventative
      strategies for attacks. Patient experiences of asthma attacks are poorly described in
      previous research. Hence this work is expected to provide useful insights into these
      experiences which will contribute to improvements in detecting, treating and preventing
      asthma attacks.

      The study will consist of a one-off interview lasting about 45 minutes with patients who have
      recently had asthma attacks. We plan to recruit patients for the study from an outpatient
      clinic for those who have had a recent attack or from a register of patients who have
      volunteered for future asthma research studies. The interviews will take place in person at
      the Respiratory Research Unit at the Nottingham City Hospital or over the telephone depending
      on patient preference.
