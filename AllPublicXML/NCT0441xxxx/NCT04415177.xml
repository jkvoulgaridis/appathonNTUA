    <textblock>
      A randomized, 2-arm parallel-group clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a
      self-administered Virtual Reality (VR) program for the treatment of chronic lower back pain.
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of skills-based VR on changes in
      patient-reported pain and pain interference over the course of an 8-week intervention. A
      secondary objective is to assess the impact of skill-based VR on changes in patient-reported
      satisfaction over the course of an 8-week intervention. A tertiary objective is to assess the
      impact of skills-based VR on changes in patient-reported opioid use, physical function,
      behavioral skills development, and health outcomes immediately following the intervention
      relative to a pre-intervention baseline. An exploratory objective is to assess the impact of
      skills-based VR on changes in patient-reported pain levels, opioid use, physical function,
      behavioral skills development, health outcomes, and satisfaction for a 24-week period
      post-intervention.

    <time_frame>The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from study baseline to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>DoD/VA Pain scale measures pain intensity, and inference around activity, sleep, mood, and stress, each on an 11-point scale. The max score is 50 and the minimum is 0. The higher the score the worse the outcome. This will be assessed twice weekly during the 8-week intervention intervention period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>6-item PROMIS sleep disturbance measure assesses the level of sleep disturbance on a 5-point scale. The max score is 30 and the minimum is 6. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>2-item PSEQ (PSEQ-2) assesses pain self-efficacy on a 7-point scale. The max score is 12 and the minimum is 0. The higher the score the better the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>4-item Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-4) assesses frequency of pain-related thoughts and feelings on a 5-point scale. The max score is 16 and the minimum is 0. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>8-item Chronic Pain Acceptance (CPAQ-8) questionnaire assesses acceptance or psychological flexibility associated with chronic pain on a 7-point scale. The max score is 56 and the minimum is 8. The higher the score the better the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Skills Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Custom survey assesses the development of skills to manage pain outside of the VR headset. This is only included in the EaseVRx condition. There are 4 knowledge questions. These are on a 1-5 scale from do not agree to completely agree. The skills questions are on a 0 to 10 scale with 0 being not at all confident and 10 being very confident.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Health Utilization Outcomes Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire on the frequency of steroid injections, lower back surgery, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and unplanned physician visits over various time periods. The first part of each of these questions asks if they have had the service and then the second part asks for the frequency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VR Use Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 56</time_frame>
