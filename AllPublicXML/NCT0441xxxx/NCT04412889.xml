    <textblock>
      The study is an early, open, single-centered trial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerance of BCMA/CD19 dual-target CAR-T cell immunotherapy in relapsed or
      refractory MM. The study will include 18 subjects to receive BCMA/CD19 dual-target CAR-T cell
      immunotherapy.
