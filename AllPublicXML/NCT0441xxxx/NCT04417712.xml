      The purpose of the study is to collect real world data on patient outcomes and evaluate the
      procedural success and performance of the Lifetech KONAR-MF™ VSD Occluder for patients with
      ventricular septal defect (VSD).

      This is a non-randomized prospective post-marketing clinical follow-up study (PMCFS) in order
      to evaluate the feasibility and safety of Lifetech KONAR-MF™ VSD Occluder device used for
      patients with ventricular septal defect. The implantation should be performed in accordance
      to the instructions for use (IFU).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have a clinically relevant ventricular septum defect (VSD) by
             echocardiography and/or X-ray examination according to current clinical standard and
             centre-specific protocols; The patient should be older than 6 months of age and the
             bodyweight heavier than 8kg; Defect diameter (by 2D echocardiography): Size of the VSD
             is larger than or equal to 2mm and less than 10mm; Upper margin of VSD to aortic valve
             distance &gt;2 mm for models 6-4, 8-6, 10-8, 12-10, 14-12 and &gt;2.5mm for models 5-3, 7-5,
             9-7, in case of PmVSD; Only left to right shunt of the ventricular shunt.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication mentioned in the corresponding IFU*; The patient does present
             with an aortic valve prolapsing into the VSD; Currently participating in other
             investigational drugs- or device studies; The patient who is pregnant, planning to
             become pregnant, or breastfeeding; Patients don't give informed written consent for
             the procedure; Patient with other cardiac anomalies by surgery therapy.
