  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2 x 2 cross-over dietary intervention trial designed to investigate the effects of low
      glycemic index (LGI) versus high glycemic index (HGI) diet on hepatic fat accumulation and
      gut microbiota composition in participants with NAFLD.

      Participants will be allocated randomly to a 2-week either high GI (HGI) or low GI (LGI) diet
      followed by a 4-week wash-out period and then the LGI or HGI diet, opposite to the first
      2-weeks (N= 16).
