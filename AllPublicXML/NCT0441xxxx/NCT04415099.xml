  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the changes in the measurable parameters of the
      dynamic and static position of the foot, caused by the tibialis posterior muscle which is
      activated by the fatigue protocol. The study includes 30 healthy patients whose
      socio-demographic and descriptive characteristics are held. The changes in the dynamic and
      static position of foot were measured by pedobarography whereas the level of fatigue was
      measured by Borg Fatigue Scale.

      measured by Borg Fatigue Scale. The variables were investigated using Shapiro-Wilk's test to
      determine the normality. The student's t-test for paired samples were used to analyse, means
      (X), standard deviations (SD), 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), mean difference and Cohen's
      d-effect size were calculated. The significance level was set at .05. The effect size was
      considered 'small' if d= .20; 'medium' if .d=.5; 'large' if d= .8.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Plantar Pressures of the foot</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The plantar pressure profiles were divided into 10 anatomical regions by using software support. These regions corresponded to followings : hallux (toe1), toes 2-5, first to fifth metatarsals (Meta1, Meta2, Meta3, Meta4, and Meta5), mid foot (MF), medial heel (MH), and lateral heel (LH). Peak pressure (PP, Newton-N) was analysed for all regions separately.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact area of the foot</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of the contact area (CA%) of forefoot (FF), midfoot (MF) and hindfoot (HF) was recorded. The right foot of each subjects was chosen to be analysed to maintain independence of data. In line with this, all tests' first and third trials were exculeded from statistical analysis, because of avoiding acclimatization and boredom or tiredness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot axis angle</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Foot axis angle (FAA) was recorded in unit of degree (o). The right foot of each subjects was chosen to be analysed to maintain independence of data. In line with this, all tests' first and third trials were exculeded from statistical analysis, because of avoiding acclimatization and boredom or tiredness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subtalar angle</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Minimum and maximum value of the subtalar angle (STA) was recorded in unit of degree (o). The right foot of each subjects was chosen to be analysed to maintain independence of data. In line with this, all tests' first and third trials were exculeded from statistical analysis, because of avoiding acclimatization and boredom or tiredness.</description>
