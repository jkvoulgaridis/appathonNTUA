    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week randomized-controlled clinical trial. It will be planned to conduct
      in a total of 120 male and female subjects from the Department of Psychiatry at Kaohsiung
      Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Eligible subjects will be psychiatric patients, aged between
      20-65 years old, who have psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia and fulfill the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. The intervention with aerobic walking programs will be initiated
      after randomization for patients who continue their usual treatment. Subjects will be
      enrolled for 12 weeks aerobic walking treatment and randomly assigned to (1)
      treatment-as-usual, (2) treatment-as-usual plus aerobic walking. We will measure the
      treatment response to clarify the effect of aerobic walking in patients with schizophrenia.
      This study is being performed to investigate the possibly beneficial effects of aerobic
      walking on cognitive function and energy metabolites in schizophrenia.

      participants join the walking programs. We will measure the treatment response to investigate
      the effect of aerobic walking in patients with schizophrenia. This study is being performed
      to investigate the possibly beneficial effects of aerobic walking on cognitive function in
      schizophrenia.
