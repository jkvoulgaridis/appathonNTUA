  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the modified Qing-Ying
      Decoction (mQYD) for the treatment of subacute and chronic atopic dermatitis (AD) in children
      when compared to the placebo control through examining the clinical symptoms, quality of
      life, gut microbiome, and Chinese medicine body constitution.

      This is a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Eligible
      subjects will be randomly allocated to receive oral mQYD granules or it's placebo granules.
      Subjects will have 12-week of treatment, and then a 4-week follow-up.

      The subjects will come for a screening visit at week 0 (baseline), then at week 6, week 12,
      and week 16 for Chinese medicine practitioner (CMP) investigators assessments. Eczema Area
      and Severity Index (EASI), Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI),
      Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Chinese Medicine body constitution types will be
      assessed and filled up at different timepoints. They will receive oral herbal mQYD or placebo
      granules for 12 weeks and then be followed up 4 weeks after the treatment. Registered CMPs
      will provide consultation under Chinese medicine theory. Study medication compliance and
      adverse events will also be assessed at each visit. Besides, they need to record the food
      taken in a diary before the day for taking faecal specimen for gut microbiome analysis.
