  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a shared decision-making conference and
      three-week prehabilitation program on the outcome &quot;care dependency&quot; one year after surgery.
      The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated in this N = 1400 patient,
      national multicenter, assessor-blinded, randomized, pragmatic, controlled, parallel-group,
      clinical trial.

      The objective of PRÄP-GO is to establish and employ a suitable preoperative case-care
      management system to improve the short and long-term outcome of elderly surgical patients
      with signs of a frailty syndrome, improving postoperative quality of life and reducing care
      dependency by a three-week individualized prehabilitation program.

    <description>Assessment results in a degree of care dependency from personal help according to the German dependency assessment (= &quot;Neues Begutachtungs-Assessment&quot; (NBA)) (Wingenfeld et al., 2008). The results of the assessments ranges between 0 and 100 points, which are transformed into a 0-5 ordinal scale. Higher points in the assessments indicate higher demand of care dependency. Accordingly, higher numbers on the ordinal scale indicate a higher level of care dependency as defined in the German statutory care insurance program.</description>
