    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, single-centre prospective study to evaluate the
      feasibility, efficacy and safety of a once daily fixed dose combination regimen, Biktarvy, as
      a rapid treatment strategy in newly HIV diagnosed patients that come for the first time to
      the Hospital Clínic HIV Unit Patients with confirmed HIV-1 diagnosis who wish to start ARV
      treatment immediately will receive bictegravir 50 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg + tenofovir
      alafenamide 25 mg within the first week since the HIV-1 confirmation during 48 weeks.
