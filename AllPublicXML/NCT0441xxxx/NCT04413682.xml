  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurodegenerative autoimmune disease. People with MS
      (PwMS) have low quality of life (QoL) and activities of daily living (ADL). Exercise is a
      safe and effective rehabilitation tool for PwMS. A structured and personalized exercise
      program can improve physical fitness, functional capacity, quality of life and modifiable
      disorders in PwMS. On the other hand, Telerehabilitation is an alternative rehabilitation
      method in PwMS. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of exercise
      programs and telerehabilitation on ADL and QoL in PwMS, and compare the effects of supervised
      exercise and home-based exercise programs for the PwMS.

      Participants are randomly assigned to the structured supervised exercise or structured
      home-based groups. Interventions in Group 1 (n=15) includes one session per day, 3 days a
      week over a 12-weeks structured exercise program under the supervision of a physical
      therapist. Group 2 (n=15) includes a 12-week structured home-based exercise program checked
      and controlled through telerehabilitation three times a week. All measurements pre-post
      intervention.

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FIM is a tool used for evaluation of primary ADL of people with disability. FIM items include self care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition subgroups. Grading is based on 7 points. 7: complete independence, 6: modified independence, 5, 4 and 3: modified dependence, 2 and 1: complete dependence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile, First section (NHP-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NHP is a tool used for measuring and definition of QoL regarding the health status in general. NHP-I contains 38 yes/no statements, focusing on different aspects of the general health problems, including six dimensions of subjective health defined as physical abilities, pain, sleep, energy, emotional reaction, energy level and social isolation. Questions are evaluated according to the patients' yes/no responses and are scored between 0 and 100. High scores indicate high level health status in the specified item. Total scores are summed in all fields.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life scale (QoLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QoLS is a standardized interview consisting of 41 questions clustered in four subscales: functional and economic scale, social and recreational scale, affect and life in general scale, and medical problems scale. Each question in the scale is evaluated over 5 points. (1 is negative at all times and 5 is the best response).</description>
