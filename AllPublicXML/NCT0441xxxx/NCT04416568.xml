  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab and ipilimumab) given
      together as a possible treatment for INI1-negative tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of
      an investigational drug or drug combination to learn whether the drug or drug combination
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is
      being studied.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Nivolumab (OPDIVO)

        -  Ipilimumab (YERYOY)

      This trial is studying whether nivolumab and ipilimumab work to treat INI1-negative cancers.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved combination nivolumab and
      ipilimumab for the specific diseases in this study but it has been approved for other
      diseases. Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been tested in children to find out a safe dose of
      this combination.

             pneumonitis

             months, or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy are exceptions. Intermittent use of bronchodilators or
             local steroid injections are not excluded. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Autoimmune
             diagnoses not listed must be approved by the Principal Investigator.

          -  Patients who have received prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible.

          -  Pregnancy or Breast-Feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on
             this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as there is yet no
             available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities. Pregnancy tests
             must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 or anti-CTLA4
             agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell
             receptor (e.g. OX-40, CD137)

             of study treatment.
