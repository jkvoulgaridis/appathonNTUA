  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1055a in
      participants with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for
      which no standard treatment is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation, first-in-human study will assess
      the safety and tolerability of DS-1055a, determine the maximum tolerated dose of DS-1055a,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of DS-1055a, incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against
      DS-1055a, and the effect of DS-1055a on tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte profile.
