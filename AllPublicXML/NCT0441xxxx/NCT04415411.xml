      Watson's Theory of Human Caring to the relatives of palliative care patients on caregivers'
      spiritual well-being and hope. This research was conducted with 60 patient relatives
      (intervention group: 30, control group: 30) taking care of their patient in palliative care
      unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, millions of patients as well as millions of patients are primarily involved in
      the palliative care process. It is emphasized that from the very start of palliative care
      process until grievance stage, patient relatives require a myriad of physical, psychological,
      social and spiritual needs. It has been widely reported that among relatives of palliative
      care patients, there is a high incidence of mental distress, depression, anxiety, sleep
      disturbance, fear and despair. The maintain of hope and spiritual well-being are important in
      dealing with this difficult process. Accordingly, nursing care is important, which supports
      the hope and spiritual well-being of patients' relatives. Nursing care that supports hope and
      focuses on spiritual dimensions is important in Watson's Human Care Theory.
