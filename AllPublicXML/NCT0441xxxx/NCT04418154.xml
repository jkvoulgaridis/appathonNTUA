    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety for dose-dense epirubicin hydrochloride
      with cyclophosphamide followed by nanoparticlealbumin-bound paclitaxel with PD-1 in
      neoadjuvant therapy for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and to explore the
      predictive value of biological markers for the treatment.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open single arm study, which would undergo optimal two stage designs. 60
      patients who are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer would have dose-dense
      epirubicin hydrochloride with cyclophosphamide followed by nanoparticlealbumin-bound
      paclitaxel with PD-1 regimen for neoadjuvant therapy if they meet the eligibility criteria.
      The regimen is as follows: epirubicin hydrochloride (90mg/m2, d1) plus cyclophosphamide
      (600mg/m2, d1) every 14 days as one cycle for 4 cycles, followed by nanoparticlealbumin-bound
      paclitaxel (125mg/m2, d1) per week for 3 weeks as one cycle for 4 cycles, and Toripalimab
      (240mg, d1) every 3 weeks as one cycle for 4 cycles. pathological complete response would be
      the primary endpoint. The change of biological markers and safety of the regimen would also
      be evaluated.
