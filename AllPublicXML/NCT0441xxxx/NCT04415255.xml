  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax and the need for
      intervention with extrapleural autologous blood injection (EPABI) along with intraparenchymal
      autologous blood patch injection (IABPI) or IABPI-alone in CT-guided percutaneous lung
      biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of pneumothorax is postulated to be due to the air leakage through the puncture
      hole when the needle is removed after the biopsy. However, pneumothorax may occur during the
      needle insertion as the visceral pleura is punctured or during the biopsy procedure before
      needle removal. Prevent such leakage, the investigators planned to inject autologous blood
      into the extrapleural space to prevent pneumothorax during needle entry. The extrapleural
      autologous blood injection (EPABI) is expected to form a space-occupying hematoma pressing on
      visceral pleura as a sealant. The investigators planned to test the EPABI method in a
      prospective single-center randomized controlled study design.

    <description>If the patient was assigned to EPABI plus IABPI, while the extrapleural space was reached, ~ 15 ml of autologous blood was injected at the extrapleural space through the coaxial needle. Then the central stylet was reinserted and the coaxial needle was advanced into the lung parenchyma with a single puncture. The needle was stopped inside the proximal part of the target and the center needle was removed. A 20-G/16 cm fully-automated biopsy needle was introduced through the 19-G/13.8 cm coaxial needle and specimens were identically obtained. After specimens were collected, the biopsy needle was removed, and immediately the remaining autologous blood (~5 ml) was slowly injected through the coaxial needle as it was withdrawn through the parenchyma thus sealing the needle tract.</description>
