  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of social media intervention on the use of
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the greater New
      Haven area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three specific aims of this study. In the first specific aim, two focus group
      discussions (FGDs) of YMSM will be conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      social media intervention. In the second specific aim of the study, a quasi-pre-post
      experimental study will be conducted to examine the effect of social media intervention on
      PrEP uptake (primary outcome) and PrEP use intention, HIV testing, PrEP knowledge,
      self-efficacy and social support (secondary outcome). In the third specific aim of the study,
      the most important topics around PrEP will be assessed on the Facebook page of the
      intervention group by conducting a content analysis.
