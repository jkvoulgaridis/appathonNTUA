    <textblock>
      This is the first study to test SHR-1802 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to
      see if SHR-1802 is safe and tolerable for patients with locally advanced/unresectable or
      metastatic malignancies that are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard
      therapy is available.
