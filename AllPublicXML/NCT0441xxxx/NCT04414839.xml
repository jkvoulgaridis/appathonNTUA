      Abstract Background: A number of patients referring to the emergency departments (EDs) due to
      airway obstruction or decreased level of consciousness require the establishment of a
      definite airway using intubation. On the other hand, performing Nasogastric tube (NGT)
      insertion is very challenging in anesthetized and intubated patients. And, a conclusive
      method has not yet been presented in this regard. Hence, the current study aimed at comparing
      Digital Intubation (two-finger) and Video Laryngoscopy methods during NGT insertion.

      Materials and Methods: The present clinical trial was performed on 76 intubated patients that
      were randomly divided into two groups. Groups A and B underwent Video Laryngoscopy and
      Digital Intubation (two-finger) methods, respectively. Then, the success rate, the number of
      attempts to insert NGT, duration of insertion, hemodynamic parameters, and patients'
      satisfaction level were recorded and examined in this study.

    <description>In the NGT Digital Intubation group (group B), the second and third fingers were placed in the posterior pharynx and depressed the tongue downwards. The NGT was passed through the nose into the posterior pharynx with the fingers in the pharynx to reach the esophagus. The thumb was placed under the jaw and pushed it forward to pave the way for tube insertion.</description>

    <description>In the NGT Video Laryngoscopy group (group A), first, the GlideScope blade was inserted under direct visualization via color monitor through the patient's mouth by employing jaw-thrust maneuver to preserve the cervical spine and by raising the tongue to obtain better visualization of the larynx space. Then, NGT was inserted through the selected nostril, advanced through the esophagus under direct vision to meet the measured length, and fixed after confirmation.</description>
