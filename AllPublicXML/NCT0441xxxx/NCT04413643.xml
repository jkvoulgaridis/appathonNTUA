    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the impact of providing patients admitted with acute
      exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) with non-invasive ventilation (NIV)home devices prior to
      discharge on hospital readmission rates and other secondary outcomes.

      Aim 1 To test whether continuation of NIV at home after being initiated during
      hospitalization for AECOPD improves subsequent admission-free survival in patients with
      chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to COPD

      Hypothesis 1: The use of targeted NIV during hospitalization with continuation upon discharge
      to home will improve one-year all-cause mortality as compared to published mortality in the
      current literature.

      Hypothesis 2: The use of targeted NIV during hospitalization with continuation upon discharge
      to home will reduce readmission rates for AECOPD within-institution historical data.

      Aim 2 To evaluate the feasibility of a larger multisite randomized controlled trial in
      veterans using inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in this pilot.

      Outcomes

      Primary: Event-free survival (re-hospitalization for AECOPD, time to readmission for AECOPD,
      and all-cause mortality)

      Secondary:

        1. Unplanned readmission rates (all complications)

        2. Time to readmissions for admissions other than AECOPD.

        3. Arterial blood gas/Venous blood gas (ABG/VBG): PaO2, PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate at
           Baseline, 6 and 12 months

        4. Pulmonary function (handheld spirometer or in-laboratory based on specific institution
           resources) at Baseline, 6, and 12 months 5.6 minute walk test at Baseline, 6,and 12
           months

      6.Health related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by the St. Georges respiratory
      questionnaires (SGRQ) at Baseline, 1,3,6,9 and 12 months 7.Adherence to NIV at Week 1-2,
      Months 1,3,6,9 and 12 8.Sleep assessed by type 3 portable monitors 9.Sleep assessed by
      questionnaires: Insomnia severity index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Short Form (FOSQ-10) at Baseline,
      1,3,6,9 and 12 months 11.Utilization of healthcare services (number of visits to outpatient
      clinics and emergency services, number of inpatient admissions)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide, with the economic and social burden of disease anticipated to increase annually.
      Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with significant in-hospital mortality
      (6-8%), high readmission rates (60-80%), and even more dramatic 1-year mortality (23-49%).

      The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been extensively evaluated in both patients
      with stable disease in the home setting and in AECOPD during hospitalization. It is widely
      accepted that NIV used during AECOPD in the inpatient setting reduces rates of endotracheal
      intubation, as well as length of ICU and hospital stay. Long-term use of NIV, particularly at
      higher pressures, in the home setting in COPD patients with evidence of chronic compensated
      respiratory acidosis (PaCO2 &gt;45mmHg) decreases elevated PaCo2 and serum bicarbonate levels,
      improves pulmonary function, and improves quality of life. Little is known about whether
      patients initiated on NIV during an AECOPD and subsequently transitioned to long-term home
      NIV on discharge demonstrate reduced AECOPD rates, readmission rates, or differences in
      morbidity and mortality. The few existing randomized trials aimed at this patient population
      suffer from criticisms of lack of power, varying degrees of patient symptoms, conflicting
      results, and inconsistent approaches in NIV strategies. Nonetheless, this is an important
      population to address, as AECOPD frequently leads to accelerated loss of lung function
      (pre-AECOPD function not recovered), decreased quality of life (QOL), more frequent
      exacerbations, and higher overall mortality. If NIV can minimize the loss of lung function
      during the transition period following AECOPD, QOL, physical activity tolerance, readmission
      rates and overall mortality may improve.

      Economic analyses of the use of NIV in patients with AECOPD transitioning from the inpatient
      to home setting are also sparse, but of high value as healthcare transitions toward bundled
      payments and penalties for readmissions. This pilot study seeks to better inform the
      literature on the role of NIV initiated during inpatient AECOPD and continued long-term
      following discharge home in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to
      COPD. The investigators hypothesize that the use of NIV during acute inpatient treatment of
      AECOPD followed by continuation of NIV therapy long-term at home will improve admission free
      survival, improve quality of life, reduce 1-year exacerbation rates, and reduce 30d
      readmissions.

      This is a prospective 1-year interventional pilot study that will occur at 4 Veterans Affairs
      (VA) hospitals (Sacramento, Durham, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco).

      The total enrollment goal across all sites is 50. Total study period expected includes an
      enrollment period of approximately 10-12 months and follow-up period of 12 months for a total
      study duration of approximately 2 years.

    <description>Subjects will be introduced to NIV and educated on sleep disordered breathing. NIV will be initiated during hospitalization following resolution of acute respiratory failure. NIV settings will be based on inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP, EPAP), rates, and tidal volumes tolerated during the acute phase of treatment. Initial settings will be set with goals of tolerance and acceptance of therapy. Minimum pressure difference between IPAP and EPAP settings will be 5cmH20. Volume assured pressure support mode with a target tidal volume (Vt) of 8ml/kg ideal body weight will be used. Final device settings and patient parameters will be documented after 10 minutes of acclimation to the device. Data from the device will be reviewed the following day. Tolerance, mask comfort, and acceptance of therapy will be assessed. Changes to settings, mask interface, or other comfort features will be performed at this initial reassessment period.</description>

             Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) done within 3 years preceding admission are acceptable
             to document an obstructive ventilatory defect and decrease diffusion capacity
             consistent with emphysema and COPD. If no PFTs are available, bedside spirometry will
             be performed to confirm COPD.

          4. Chronic compensated respiratory acidosis based on PaCO2 &gt;52 adjusted for pH 7.40, on
             pre-admission laboratory values or after resolution of acute respiratory failure.

          1. Moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;15/h.
             Sleep testing done within the prior 3 years with no increase in body mass index (BMI)
             &gt;2kg/m2 or major change in cardiopulmonary conditions (new reduced ejection heart
             failure [HFrEF], atrial fibrillation [AFib], opioid use with morphine dose equivalent
             (MDDE) &gt;120mg, or cardiothoracic surgery for lung resection or coronary artery bypass

             environment.

          6. Use of NIV at home within past three months

          7. Failure to tolerate NIV during initial hospitalization
