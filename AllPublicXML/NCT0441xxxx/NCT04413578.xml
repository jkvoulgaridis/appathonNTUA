  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the impact of continuous glucose monitoring versus standard of care (e.g. a
      finger-prick protocol using a glucometer) on clinical outcomes, healthcare utilization, and
      cost in patients with type I or II diabetes treated within the Reimagine Primary Care
      clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients who consent will be
      randomized to one of two groups: (1) the intervention group who will be given a Dexcom G6 for
      CGM, or (2) the control group who will follow their current standard finger-prick protocol
      via a provided Contour Next ONE glucometer. The CGM group must download the Dexcom G6 and
      Clarity mobile apps for data capture, whereas the standard of care group will use the Contour
      Next mobile app for their respective readings.

      The Dexcom G6 captures real-time, dynamic glucose data every five minutes. Devices used in
      this study are FDA approved and commercially available.

    <description>• Intervention group: CGM using a Dexcom G6 to measure glycosylated hemoglobin levels every five minutes. Patients will be asked to download the Dexcom G6 and Clarity applications (to have access to their real-time data) and be given a link to complete an exit survey in REDCap near the end of their study participation. Data will be sent via Bluetooth and then exported by the Intermountain research team into a Tableau (or similar) dashboard for data analysis/comparison</description>

    <description>• Control group: A standard finger-prick protocol that will require patients to continue with their daily fingerprick regimen established by their physician. This group will be given a Contour Next One meter to ensure that each patient is receiving the same level of accuracy by the same device. A review by Ekhlaspour et al of 17 glucose meters demonstrated wide variability, with only two devices achieving the 2013 ISO standard (with the most accurate being the Contour Next). Patients in the control group will be asked to download the Contour Next application which will send data via Bluetooth similar to above. Data will be aggregated, and protected health information removed prior to analysis (by Intermountain Healthcare and Savvysherpa). At the end of the study, patients will be asked to complete a short survey in REDCap about their willingness to participate in future studies.</description>
