  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent works in interventional radiology have shown interesting results in the treatment of
      musculoskeletal inflammatory sites by arterial embolization. Supra-selective arterial
      embolization has been successfully developed by Dr. Okuno (Japan) to manage moderate to
      severe knee osteoarthritis. Also, inflammation of the surgical site mediated via geniculate
      arteries is a major cause for persistent chronic post-operative gonalgia.

      Hypothesis: Selective arterial embolization of persistent geniculate arteries could reduce
      chronic post-operative gonalgia after TKA with minimally invasive approach.

      Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of selective arterial embolization of persistent
      geniculate arteries to reduce chronic post-operative gonalgia after TKA.

      Material and methods: This study is a single-center, prospective, feasibility study. Patients
      will be recruited after rheumatology consultation for chronic post-operative gonalgia, more
      than 6 months after TKA for moderate to severe gonarthrosis. Eligible patients are adults
      with moderate to severe chronic post-operative gonalgia (Visual Analysis Scale (VAS) &gt; 50mm)
      and degraded life quality (assessed by SF36 score), despite at least 3 months of optimal
      medical treatment. Non-inclusion criteria are mainly other rheumatologic or orthopedic severe
      diseases, severe surgical complications. Under local anesthesia, with homolateral antegrade
      femoral access, patient will undergo selective arterial embolization of persistent and
      aberrant peri-prosthetic arteries using HydroPearl® 200µm Mircospheres. Follow-up
      consultations will be scheduled at D1, M1, M3, M6 and M12. For a significance level of α=0.05
      and power of 80% we require a cohort of 24 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patient (male or female) aged 18-85

          -  Suffering from moderate to severe chronic pain (EVA &gt; 50mm) more than 6 months after
             total prosthetic knee replacement surgery for severe gonarthrosis with impact on
             quality of life.

             months must be respected for each side, between the intervention and the inclusion for
             homolateral pain.

          -  Patient willing to participate in the study and with signed informed consent.

          -  Patient willing to undergo post-operative monitoring for one year.
