  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a comparative effectiveness trial among adult patients with
      sickle cell disease (SCD) who report chronic pain (N = 350), randomized to receive either
      mobile phone-delivered computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT; n = 175) or digital
      education (m-Education; n = 175). Both intervention groups will receive weekly (more frequent
      if requested or needed) follow-up with a health coach for at least 3 months to reinforce
      learned materials. Both groups will also use their mobile device to track daily pain, mood,
      and medication used for two-week periods at baseline and each of the follow-up points (3, 6
      and 12 months). Participants will also be given access to a study-associated online support
      group page where members can discuss with other patients, issues participants faced and what
      skills were or could be used to address them. Participants will continue all routine care
      including opioid pain management and novel therapies.

      The study interventions are both Internet-delivered, evidence-based tools that have been
      tailored specifically for the target population through a user-centered approach that has
      engaged stakeholders at each stage of the process.

        1. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain. The cCBT program will teach
           users how to recognize negative thoughts and emotions, use cognitive skills and
           problem-solving, and apply coping behaviors such as distraction, activity scheduling,
           and relaxation. The cCBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition and learning through
           practice; this intervention is consistent with the tailored behavioral services patients
           would receive individually or as a group when working with a psychologist or behavioral
           pain specialist.

        2. Mobile-delivered pain and sickle cell disease education (m-Education). The m-Education
           program will teach users about chronic pain, healthy lifestyle tips (e.g., nutrition and
           exercise), and facts about SCD. This program is consistent with the education patients
           and families would receive with a patient educator.
