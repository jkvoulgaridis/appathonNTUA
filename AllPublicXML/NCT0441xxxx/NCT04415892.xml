      Evaluating the increase in dermal blood flow upon topical application of cinnamaldehyde and
      capsaicin on the fingers in healthy, male volunteers. In addition, the inter-period and
      inter-hand reproducibility of the increase in dermal blood flow will be assessed.

          3. Subject has a body mass index between 18-30 kg/m².

          4. Subject is judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination and vital signs.

          5. Subject understands the procedures and agrees to participate in the study by giving
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has eczema, scleroderma, psoriasis, dermatitis, or keloids, tumors, ulcers,
             burns, flaps or grafts on their fingers or any other abnormality of the skin which, in
             the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the study assessments.

          2. Subject has excessive hair growth on the fingers.

          3. Subject cannot avoid excessive tanning (any exposure to sunlight or a tanning bed
             which would cause a sunburn reaction) throughout the study.

          4. Subject has a history of significant severe (drug) allergies.

          5. Subject uses any prescription or non-prescription drugs on a regular basis which, in
             the investigator's opinion, might confound the results of the study.

          6. Subject currently uses lotions, oils, depilatory preparations, makeup, or other
             topical treatments on the fingers on a regular basis which cannot be discontinued for
             the duration of the study.

          7. Subject is unable to refrain from drinking alcohol 24 hours prior to each study visit,
             is currently a regular user of any illicit drugs, or has a history of drug (including
             alcohol) abuse.

          8. Subject is unable to refrain from drinking caffeinated beverages (e.g. coffee, tea,
             cola, …) 24 hours prior to each study visit. Subject is unable to limit their intake
             of caffeinated beverages to ≤4 cups a day throughout the study.

          9. Subject has any of the following vital sign measurements at screening after at least
             10 minutes of supine rest: Heart Rate &lt;40 or &gt;100 beats/min, Diastolic Blood Pressure
             &lt;50 or &gt;90 mmHg, Systolic Blood Pressure &lt;90 or &gt;140 mmHg.

         10. Subject is currently participating or has been involved in testing an investigational
             drug in another clinical study within the last 4 weeks.

         11. Subject is in a situation or has a condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with safe and optimal participation in the study.

         12. Subject has a history of any illness or disorder which, in the investigator's opinion,
             might confound the results of the study.
