  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis-related myofascial pain in hemodialysis (HD) patients is an important issue that is
      associated with many other psychosomatic problems. Effective interventions are required to
      alleviate pain problems in this group. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been tried as a
      potential therapeutic method to improve pain. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect
      of a CHM formula intervention on pain intensity, daily function, and quality of life, and
      safety among HD patients in dialysis center within a southern Taiwan context.
