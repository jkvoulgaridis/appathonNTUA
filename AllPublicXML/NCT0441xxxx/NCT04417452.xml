  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the proposed project are to assess the long-term effects of
      prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes or diabetes on the maturation and health of the
      offspring. In addition, the long-term changes on the health of the affected mothers will be
      investigated, taking into account the metabolic adjustment during index pregnancy. The
      expected results will help to establish possible prevention strategies to fight the epidemic
      of non-communicable diseases for the offspring and the mothers.

    <description>The control collective is composed of mother-child pairs who were cared for at the same time as the study collective at the University Hospital Jena. This collective is status post singleton pregnancy and term birth. The patients can decide to fill in an online questionnaire.
