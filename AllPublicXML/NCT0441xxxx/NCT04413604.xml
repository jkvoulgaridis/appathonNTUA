      This study evaluates changes in Vitamin D, Zinc, and Iron status of children consuming 2
      servings / day of the investigational (test) young children's milk (YCM) for 16 weeks
      compared to children of the same age who consume their habitual pattern of beverage intake
      for the same duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child has consumed micronutrient supplements or micronutrient fortified foods or
             beverages in amounts greater than the thresholds below:

               1. Micronutrient supplements (except for vitamin A): zero in the past 4 weeks

               2. Micronutrient-fortified foods or beverages: zero servings in the past 2 weeks

          -  Chronic infectious illness, helminthiasis, or other acute disease/disorder potentially
             affecting feeding or growth (mild infectious illness, such as acute viral
             rhinopharyngitis, is acceptable).

          -  Any congenital malformation (e.g., gastrointestinal tract atresia) or surgery sequelae
             (e.g. short bowel syndrome) potentially affecting feeding, growth, or nutrient
             absorption.

          -  Child exhibits any clinical signs of potential micronutrient deficiencies (e.g.,
             hemoglobin &lt; 100 g/L based on screening assessment, rickets based on physical exam).

             Child Growth Standards median at enrollment.

          -  Child has participated in another clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Child of any investigational site staff member or Nestle employee directly involved in
             the conduct of the trial.

          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition that, in the judgement of the investigator,
