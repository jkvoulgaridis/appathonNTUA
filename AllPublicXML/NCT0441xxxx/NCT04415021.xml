    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to effectively investigate the relaxation of the diaphragm and
      iliopsoas muscle with myofascial technique in patients with chronic low back pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common health problem that can be seen as a symptom and symptom of many
      diseases in the clinic.

      Myofascial release technique is thought to be effective in patients with chronic low back
      pain. Therefore, when the literature is examined, it has been observed that the myofascial
      release technique has studies on pain, range of motion, functionality, muscle stiffness and
      shortness.

      This study will be performed on patients with a total of 42 low back pain. The cases will be
      divided into 2 groups of 21 people by simple random sampling.

      Group 1 (control) will be used with sham diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle myofascial release
      technique and traditional physiotherapy method.

      The second group (experiment) will apply the diaphragm and the myofascial release technique
      of the iliopsoas muscle and the traditional physiotherapy method.

      Patients will be treated for 4 weeks. Traditional physiotherapy method will be applied a
      total of 20 sessions 5 days a week. A total of 12 sessions will be performed, with the
      myofascial release technique of the diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle applied 3 days a week.

      The study focuses on the analysis of the following variables:

      Pain : Numerical Pain Scale

      Joint Range of Motion: Goniometer

      Flexibility: Tape Measure

      Pulmonary Function Test: Spirometer

      Anxiety and Depression: Beck Depression inventory

      Kinesiophobia: Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale

      Disability: Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire

      The results of these pre-intervention and post-intervention variables will be compared
      between the two groups .

    <measure>Change from baseline in range of motin on goniometer at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The goniometer is an instrument which measures the available range of motion at a joint. If a patient or client is suffering from decreased range of motion in a particular joint, the therapist can use a goniometer to assess what the range of motion is at the initial assessment, and then make sure the intervention is working by using the goniometer in subsequent sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in flexibility on tape measure at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tape Measure. This test is used to assess the degree of flexibility of the lumbal region.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pulmonary function test on the spirometer at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometer. A spirometer is the main piece of equipment used for basic Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs). Lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema can be ruled out from the tests. In addition, a spirometer is often used for finding the cause of shortness of breath, assessing the effect of contaminants on lung function, the effect of medication, and evaluating progress for disease treatment</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain on the Numeric Rating Scale at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale. This scale is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. It is based solely on the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and can be used for adults and children 10 years old or older.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in kinesiophobia on the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia .This scale is used to assess the patients' fear of pain or re-injury due to movement. It consists of 17 items and assesses various factors of fear/avoidance and injury/re-injury in several activities. Total score of the scale varies between 17 and 68 and higher scores represent higher levels of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in disability on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. This questionnaire is a self-administered disability measure in which greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers on a 24-point scale. The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire has been shown to yield reliable measurements, which are valid for inferring the level of disability, and to be sensitive to change over time for groups of patients with low back pain.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in anxiety and depression on the Beck Depression Inventory at 4 weeks .</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
