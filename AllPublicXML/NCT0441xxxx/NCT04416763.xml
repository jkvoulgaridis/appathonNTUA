  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallbladder polyps are often detected incidentally by ultrasonography. The most of
      gallbladder polyps are non-neoplastic such as cholesterol polyps and do not need further
      treatments. However, neoplastic polyps, which need additional treatments to prevent
      malignancy, show the same appearance on ultrasound. Clinically, the differential diagnosis
      between cholesterol polyps and adenomatous polyps is very important for patient follow-up and
      treatment. However, differential diagnosis between these two conditions is difficult using
      conventional trans-abdominal ultrasound.

      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is less affected and disturbed by subcutaneous fat or
      intraabdominal air, so a clearer image of pancreatobiliary system can be obtained. In
      addition, EUS elastography is recently introduced, which can evaluate the stiffness of a
      target lesion and compare it with surrounding tissues (strain ratio). Several studies have
      been published that EUS elastography can help in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic
      solid lesions.

      Although studies have been conducted to confirm the usefulness of elastography through
      transabdominal ultrasound of the gallbladder polyps, no prospective studies have been
      conducted to evaluate the usefulness of EUS elastography for gallbladder polyp. Therefore,
      with this prospective study, we would like to evaluate the diagnostic value of EUS
      elastography for differential diagnosis of gallbladder polyps.
