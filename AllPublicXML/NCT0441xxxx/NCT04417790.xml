  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased extravascular lung water (EVLW) may increase mortality and morbidity in
      cardiopulmonary pathology. Many factors can cause increased extravascular lung water and
      pulmonary edema after cardiac surgery. This includes left ventricular failure, acute mitral
      regurgitation; systemic inflammatory response post-cardiopulmonary bypass, left to right
      shunts, transfusion associated acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS)
      and sepsis.

      The clinical assessment of lung water ranges from auscultation to radiological methods to
      invasive measurements like dye dilution or thermodilution studies.

      Lung ultrasonography is the newest modality for noninvasive assessment of extravascular lung
      water. Lung ultrasound has been validated against auscultation, chest X-rays, CT chest as
      well as the bedside gold standard, transpulmonary thermodilution in adults.

      Critically ill children are more susceptible to complications and worsened outcomes from
      increased EVLW.

      Lung ultrasound correlates with clinical and radiological endpoints, but has not been
      validated against invasive objective measures like transpulmonary thermodilution.

      Evaluation of transpulmonary thermodilution setups in the pediatric population has shown
      different normal values and cutoffs compared to adults, possibly due to differential rates
      growth and development.

      It is aimed to investigate the correlation of Lung ultrasound based indices of extravascular
      lung water to invasive measures, assess optimum cutoffs to appropriate clinical endpoints and
      evaluate their sensitivity and specificity.
