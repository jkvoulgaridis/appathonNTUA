  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether there are any differences in the
      cognitive abilities and/or behavioral response of normal healthy volunteers across different
      titration rates of perampanel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design across different titration rates of
      perampanel in healthy volunteers. The study consists of 8 visits, 4 of which will occur at
      the participant's home, over a 7-week period. One hundred and three (103) normal healthy
      subjects will be treated with perampanel (PER) at one of four different titration rates: (1)
      2mg/day PER for one week followed by 4mg/day PER for five weeks, (2) 2mg/day PER for two
      weeks followed by 4mg/day PER for four weeks, (3) 4mg/day PER for six weeks, or (4) placebo
      (0mg/day PER) for six weeks. Cognitive and behavioral function testing along with safety
      testing will be conducted at screening, pretreatment baseline, the end of each week during
      the titration and maintenance period.

    <description>Z score of cognitive tests (selected performance measures from the computerized cognitive test battery) and questionnaires (AEP, POMS, QOLIE-cognitive questions) at the end of each week of drug treatment for each titration arm, controlling for baseline measures collected prior to treatment. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate poorer performance compared to the mean and positive numbers represent higher performance compared to the mean.</description>
