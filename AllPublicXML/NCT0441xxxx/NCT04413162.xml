  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare shoulder range of motion assessment using the Kinect motion tracking
      system vs goniometer in patients with adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) undergoing
      ultrasound-guided capsular distention procedures (standard of care).

      The investigators hypothesize that, for shoulder adhesive capsulitis, the Kinect Motion
      Analysis 2.0 system will provide reliable results in a shorter and more efficient amount of
      time in comparison to traditional goniometer methods.

      The study will be a single-center, investigator-initiated protocol to assess the reliability
      of the Kinect Motion Analysis 2.0 Motion Tracking System for Range Of Motion (ROM) assessment
      in patients with Shoulder Adhesive Capsulitis undergoing ultrasound guided capsular
      distention procedures (standard of care for adhesive capsulitis). Secondarily, the study will
      describe the relationship between range of motion of the shoulder girdle in the four
      quadrants of normalized reachable workspace by the Kinect 2.0, PROMIS person-reported outcome
      scores for pain, pain interference and function (general mobility and upper extremity
      function), and VAS pain scores.

      Study participants are anticipated to remain in the study for 12 weeks: an initial visit
      followed by 6- and 12-week follow up visits. Given the nature of scheduling appointments in
      medical clinics, 12 weeks is an approximation; the actual duration may occasionally be 1-2
      weeks longer if needed to successfully complete the follow-up visit.
