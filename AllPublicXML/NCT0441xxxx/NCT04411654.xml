    <textblock>
      Study PRV-GD2-101 is an open-label, Phase 1/2, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of single-dose PR001 in infants diagnosed with Type 2 Gaucher disease (GD2). For
      each patient, the study will be approximately 5 years in duration. During the first 12 months
      after dosing, patients will be evaluated for the effects of PR001 on safety, tolerability,
      immunogenicity, biomarkers, and efficacy. Patients will be followed up for an additional 4
      years to monitor safety and changes on selected biomarkers and clinical outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Bi-allelic GBA1 mutations consistent with a diagnosis of GD2 confirmed by the central
             laboratory.

          -  Neurological signs and/or symptoms consistent with diagnosis of GD2

          -  Parent/legal guardian has the ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study
             and provide written informed consent and authorization to use protected health
             information in accordance with national and local privacy regulations.

          -  Patient has a reliable informant (i.e., parent/legal guardian) willing and able to
             participate in the study as a source of information on the patient's health status and
             cognitive and functional abilities (including providing input into the rating scales).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of a significant CNS disease other than GD2 that may be a cause for the
             patient's GD symptoms or may confound study objectives.

          -  Achieved independent gait.

          -  Severe peripheral symptoms of GD which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would pose
             an unacceptable risk to the patient or interfere with the patient's ability to comply
             with study procedures or interfere with the conduct of the study.

          -  Concomitant disease, condition, or treatment which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would pose an unacceptable risk to the patient or interfere with the
             patient's ability to comply with study procedures or interfere with the conduct of the
             study.

          -  Use of any GD treatment-related substrate reduction therapy.

          -  Any type of prior gene or cell therapy.

          -  Use of blood thinners. Antiplatelet therapies are acceptable if the patient is
             medically able to temporarily stop them from 7 days prior to dosing and through at
             least 48 hours after the intracisternal injection and lumbar puncture.

          -  Use of systemic immunosuppressant or steroid therapy (topical preparations for
             dermatological conditions are allowed).

          -  Participation in another investigational drug or device study within the past 6
             months.

          -  Brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and MRA (magnetic resonance angiography)
             showing clinically significant abnormality considered to prevent intracisternal
             injection.

          -  Clinically significant laboratory test result abnormalities assessed at screening.

          -  Contraindications or intolerance to radiographic visualization methods (e.g. MRI, MRA,
             CT), and intolerance to contrast agents used for MRI or CT scans.

          -  Contraindications to general anesthesia.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
