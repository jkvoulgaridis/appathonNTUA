    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large study that would
      assess the safety of carbohydrate drinks (i.e. juice) prior to elective colorectal surgery in
      patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Traditionally, prior to surgeries involving a general anesthetic, patients have been told not
      to eat or drink anything after midnight due to the risk of aspiration. More recent research
      have shown that it is safe to have clear fluids up to 2 hours before an operation and this is
      reflected in the current anesthesia clinical guidelines. Moreover, it has been shown that
      subjecting patients to a state of starvation causes stress on the body that may lead to
      complications such as poor wound healing, infections, and delayed return to bowel function. A
      sugar drink before surgery has been shown to be beneficial and can lead to decreased
      complication rates and decreased length of stay after surgery.

      However, it is currently not known if it is safe for patients with type 2 diabetes to have a
      sugar drink before their surgery since they have trouble processing sugars and a subset of
      patients with diabetes are at increased risk of aspiration due to delayed stomach emptying.

      This feasibility study is designed to answer the question of whether a large scale trial can
      be conducted examining the benefits of a pre-operative sugar drink in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
