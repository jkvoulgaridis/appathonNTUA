  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mobilizing programme MobFood - mobilizing scientific knoweledge and technology to answer
      the current nutrition market challenges - is formed by a consortium of 47 collaborative
      entities, between the industry and ENESIIs (Entidades Não Empresariais do Sistema de
      Investigação e Inovação) and is financed by Structural European Funds of Investment.

      The project is currently investigating and undertaking collaborative scientific and
      technological strategies based on R&amp;D and innovation, in order to boost and promote a more
      competitive national food industry, capable of overcoming the current challenges, including
      those of the Millennial Generation. This group is particularly conscious of the impact of
      food behaviour and food choices on health but extremely vulnerable to dietary imbalance.
      Strategies to improve Millenials' nutrition while providing conscious food products are
      needed.

      This study is a randomised, cross-over controlled trial designed to test the metabolic
      effect, particularly in terms of appetite control and glycaemic response of a breakfast kit
      (nutritionally balanced and innovative), recently developed as part of the collaborative
      project MobFood_PPS4.
