          3. As per local prescribing information and in view of positive benefit-risk assessment,
             patient prescribed Durvalumab treatment as per independent clinical judgment of
             treating physician for either

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study

          2. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of study drug, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or
             systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of
             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid. Systemic steroid administration required
             to manage toxicities arising from radiation therapy delivered as part of the
             chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced NSCLC is allowed.

          3. Prior exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody including durvalumab.

          4. For NSCLC cohort only:

               1. Mixed small cell and non-small cell lung cancer histology

               2. Any unresolved toxicity CTCAE &gt;Grade 2 from the prior chemoradiation therapy.

               3. Patients with â‰¥Grade 2 pneumonitis from prior chemoradiation therapy

          5. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years, inflammatory
             bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), primary immunodeficiency,
             organ transplant that requires therapeutic immunosuppression, hypersensitivity to
             study drug or any excipient, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, tuberculosis.

             NOTE: Patients with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded.

          6. Female patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control

          7. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of the study drug or interpretation of patient safety or study results.
