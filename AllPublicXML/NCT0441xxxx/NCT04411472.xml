      Clinical phase 3 study to investigate the effect of recAP on 28 day mortality in patients
      admitted to the ICU with acute kidney injury that is caused by sepsis. 1400 patients will be
      included in the study that is conducted in approx. 100 ICU's in Europe and North America
      There are two arms in the study, one with active treatment and one with an inactive compound
      (placebo). Treatment is by 1 hour intravenous infusion, for three days. Patients are followed
      up for 28 days to see if there is an improvement on mortality, and followed for 90 and 180
      days for mortality and other outcomes e.g. long-term kidney function and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and a major cause of death. Patients
      with SA-AKI have a high mortality and morbidity and are at risk of developing chronic kidney
      disease. AP is a homodimeric endogenous enzyme present in many cells and organs, e.g.,
      intestines, placenta, liver, bone, kidney, and granulocytes. It exerts detoxifying effects
      through dephosphorylation of endotoxins; pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules
      (PAMPS e.g., lipopolysaccharide and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS
      e.g., adenosine tri- and di-phosphate). In animal models of sepsis and AKI, administration of
      AP attenuates the inflammatory response, improves renal function and/or reduces mortality.

      AM-Pharma B.V. is developing AP as a novel, recombinant chimeric human AP medicinal product,
      called recAP, to be used as an intravenous infusion for the treatment of SA-AKI. In the Phase
      2 trial STOP-AKI, a survival benefit was observed in the two highest dose groups, 0.8 mg/kg
      and 1.6 mg/kg groups, compared to the placebo group. There were no safety or tolerability
      concerns for any of the doses tested (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg). The 1.6 mg/kg recAP dose was
      selected for this Phase 3 trial based on the significant survival benefit observed. PK/PD
      simulations also confirmed this dose to have the most pronounced treatment effect.

      The primary objective of this Phase 3 trial is to confirm the mortality benefit seen in
      STOP-AKI by demonstrating a reduction in 28 day all cause mortality in patients with SA-AKI
      treated with 1.6 mg/kg recAP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years or older.

          2. In the ICU or intermediate care unit for clinical reasons.

          3. Have sepsis requiring vasopressor (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine,
             phenylephrine, vasopressin, or angiotensin II) therapy, i.e.:

               1. suspected or proven bacterial or viral infection. and

               2. on vasopressor therapy (≥0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent) for
                  sepsis-induced hypotension for at least one hour despite adequate fluid
                  resuscitation according to clinical judgement. Following the initial one hour on
                  at least 0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent, any dose of vasopressor
                  counts as vasopressor therapy.

             The combination of a) and b) automatically ensures that patients fulfill the Sepsis 3
             criteria as 0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine corresponds to a score of +4 on the
             Cardiovascular sub-score of the SOFA score.

          4. Have AKI according to at least one of the below KDIGO criteria, a to d:

               1. An absolute increase in serum or plasma creatinine (CR) by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5
                  µmol/L) within 48 hours.

                  or

               2. A relative increase in CR to ≥1.5 times the pre-AKI reference CR value which is
                  known or presumed to have occurred within prior 7 days.

                  or

               3. A decrease in urinary output to &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hour for a minimum of 6 hours
                  following adequate fluid resuscitation.

                  or

               4. If the patient does not have a known history of CKD and there is no pre-AKI
                  reference CR value available from the past 12 months available from the past 12
                  months: a CR value greater or equal to the levels presented in Table 1, with the
                  increase in CR presumed to have occurred within prior 7 days.

          5. Provision of signed and dated ICF in accordance with local regulations.

                    -  For patients with known CKD, the most recent eGFR prior to index
                       hospitalization needs to be documented as ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2.

                    -  For patients with known CKD but no known eGFR prior to hospitalization,
                       presentation eGFR between 25-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 can also be used to rule out
                       'severe' CKD.

               2. At all other sites:

             'Moderate' and 'severe' CKD defined as a pre-AKI reference eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

               -  For patients with known CKD, the most recent eGFR prior to index hospitalization
                  needs to be documented as ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

               -  For patients with known CKD but no known eGFR prior to hospitalization,
                  presentation eGFR between 45-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 can also be used to rule out

          7. Severe burns requiring ICU treatment.

          8. Severely immunosuppressed, e.g. due to:

               -  hematopoietic cell transplantation within past 6 months prior to Screening or
                  acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease

             months) IV drug abuse or known to be homeless.

         10. Limitations to use of mechanical ventilation (MV), RRT or vasopressors and inotropes
             (NOTE: limitation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) only is not an exclusion

             Co-enrollment or concurrent participation in observational, non-interventional trials
             using no protocolized treatments or procedures are always allowed. Co-enrollment or
             concurrent participation in trials using protocolized treatments or procedures, e.g.
             blood draws, requires pre-approval by the TSC).

         13. Current or planned extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

         14. On RRT &gt;24 hours before start of trial drug.

             recent available CR sample at time of screening (NOTE: will often be the sample used
             to diagnose AKI). eGFR should be calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease
             Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula.

         18. Not feasible to start trial drug within:

               1. 48 hours from AKI diagnosis, when AKI diagnosis precedes start of vasopressor
