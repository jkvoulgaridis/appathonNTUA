    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effectiveness and feasibility of enhanced reactive case detection
      (RACD) targeting high-risk villages and forest workers for reducing Plasmodium falciparum and
      Plasmodium vivax transmission in southern Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. The authors
      hypothesize that enhanced community-based RACD will be more effective than standard of care
      case management and RACD at reducing P. falciparum and P. vivax confirmed case incidence and
      parasite prevalence over an 18-month period in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), the risk of malaria infection is often due not to
      village-based transmission but rather to occupational and behavioral risk factors leading to
      exposure in forest settings. Additionally, a substantial portion of infections are
      asymptomatic and/or submicroscopic, limiting the scope of current diagnostics and
      surveillance approaches. The proposed research will evaluate the effectiveness of reactive
      case detection (RACD) using highly-sensitive rapid diagnostic tests (HS-RDTs), targeting both
      village and forest working populations, compared to control for reducing the health center
      catchment-level incidence and prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax within two provinces
      in Lao People's Democratic Republic.

      To test this hypothesis, this study will employ a cluster randomized controlled trial design
      with two comparison arms: (1) Control: standard of care - passive case management provided
      through community-based Village Malaria Workers (VMWs) and existing health facilities;
      includes village-based RACD with conventional rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) conducted by
      district surveillance teams and (2) enhanced community-based RACD: RACD conducted by
      community-based VMWs using both HS-RDTs and conventional RDTs within villages and among
      forest workers.

      The primary outcome measures to assess effectiveness include P. falciparum and P. vivax
      confirmed case incidence over the study period; PCR-based P. falciparum and P. vivax
      prevalence at end line; and HS-RDT test positivity rate in village and forest worker RACD.
      Secondary outcomes measures will examine the operational feasibility, safety, and
      acceptability of VMW-led reactive approaches and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
      testing, referral to district or provincial-level facilities, safety and treatment adherence
      for P. vivax cases.

    <description>Index cases will be screened by the VMW at their households at the time of case investigation to determine if they have traveled or worked in a forest or forest-fringe area within the past 30 days. If eligible, the case will trigger two reactive recruitment strategies to screen and treat others who recently traveled or worked with the case in a forest or forest-fringe location:
Peer-referral RACD (PR-RACD): In this strategy, the case will identify specific co-travelers or co-workers resident in their village who had spent the night with the case at a forest or forest-fringe area and spent the night there in the past 30 days.
Venue-based RACD (VB-RACD): In this strategy, co-workers will be recruited directly from (accessible) forest or forest-fringe work sites where the index case worked and spent at least one night in the past 30 days.</description>

    <description>All individuals who test positive by either HS-RDT or Standard RDT will be told of their results and treated on site per national guidelines:
Individuals with P. falciparum infection will be treated with an age-appropriate course of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and a single low dose of primaquine (SLD-PQ). Weight-based dosing is described in Tables 2 and 3 below.
At all study sites in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, patients with a P. vivax infection identified by RDT (both febrile and asymptomatic) will be given a unique coded and signed informational letter directing them to the nearest district hospital (or other testing facility) for G6PD deficiency testing and possible radical cure administration depending on results. At the health facility, G6PD normal individuals will be treated with AL and a 14-day course of PQ, whereas G6PD deficient individuals will receive AL alone as per the national guidelines and referred to a hospital for further primaquine management decisions.</description>
