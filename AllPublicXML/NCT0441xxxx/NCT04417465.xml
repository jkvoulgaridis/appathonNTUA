  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective ABBV-CLS-579 is when used alone or
      in combination with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in treating solid
      cancers.

      ABBV-CLS-579 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of solid tumors.
      The study has two arms - Monotherapy and Combination Therapy. In the monotherapy arm,
      participants will receive ABBV-CLS-579 alone, in increasing doses. In the combination therapy
      arm, escalating doses of ABBV-CLS-579 will be given in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.
      Adult participants with a diagnosis of some solid tumors for which no effective standard
      therapy exists, or has failed will be enrolled.

      Participants will receive oral ABBV-CLS-579 capsule alone or in combination with intravenous
      (IV) PD-1 inhibitor. Participants will receive study drug treatment until disease progresses
      or discontinued.

      There may be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood
      tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.

             excluded if had prior pneumonitis, prior Grade 3 or higher immune mediated toxicity,
             hypersensitivity to administered drug or drug related toxicity requiring
             discontinuation.

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in past 2-years (exceptions for
             endocrinopathies, vitiligo or atopic conditions)
