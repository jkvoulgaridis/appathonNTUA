    <description>The regimen will be a single oral dose administered daily on a continuous schedule, taken with or without food. The standard dose is 60 mg per day, which can be reduced to 40 or 20 mg according to the latest version of the Summary of Product Characteristics-SPC available. The treating oncologist will evaluate the opportunity to prudentially start treatment at 40 mg/daily in patients screening positively at G8 screening tool, and then escalate to 60 mg/daily only in case of absence of toxicity ³grade 2 at subsequent cycles. Temporary suspensions of treatment are allowed according to the local practice and will be registered if ³ 7 days.</description>
