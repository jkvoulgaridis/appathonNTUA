  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large lower abdominal incisions are still used in many types of common gynecologic surgeries.
      Patients may experience pain and restrictions to ambulation because of this, which can make
      healing after surgery harder and more complicated. Abdominal binders, through their added
      abdominal support, may provide a low cost intervention to help people heal. The study team
      aims to investigate the effects of abdominal binders on walking in the post- gynecologic
      surgery period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparotomy is a commonly utilized modality for abdominal entry in benign gynecologic surgery
      despite preference for minimally invasive techniques when surgically feasible. As with other
      major abdominal surgeries, patients may experience pain and restrictions to ambulation
      related to the abdominal incision that complicate the postoperative period. Abdominal
      binders, through their added abdominal support, may provide a low cost, noninvasive
      intervention to enhance this vital recovery period. Though the use of abdominal binders have
      been studied extensively in the postcesarean section patient, no report to date exists
      assessing the effects on abdominal binders in the postoperative course of benign gynecologic
      surgeries. The study team aims to investigate the effects of abdominal binders on ambulation
      in the postoperative period after laparotomy for benign gynecologic surgery. The primary
      outcome is quantitative ambulation via electronic step counter. Secondary outcomes include
      time to ambulation, quantitative narcotic utilization, visual analogue pain scale, subjective
      overall wellbeing. With 85% power the study team attempts to calculate a 1200 step difference
      in means between abdominal binder and control groups using 67 patients per study arm.
