  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disease characterized by
      lymphocytic infiltration of all exocrine glands, especially tear and salivary glands, and is
      more common in women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexual functions are affected by symptoms such as pain, fatigue, stiffness, and hormonal
      imbalance in rheumatological disorders. Vaginal dryness and dyspepsia negatively affect
      participation in sexual activity. The aim of the study is to examine the pelvic floor
      problems of women with SS with a self-report, to compare them with healthy individuals, and
      finally to examine the relationship between pelvic floor problems and sexual dysfunction.

    <description>Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory has a total of 20 questions and 3 scales (Urinary Distress Inventory, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory). Each short-form scale demonstrates significant correlation with their long-form scales</description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ): The questionnaire has 7 questions and each question has 3 separate responses. The response to each item of satisfaction, impact and worry was rated from 3 (quite a bit) to 0 (not at all) for the PFIQ-7. The mean value for all the answered items within the corresponding scale (possible value 0-3) was estimated, then multiplied by (100/3) to obtain the scale score, range 0-100.</description>

        94 women with Sjögren syndrome with an average age of 48.15 ± 8.73 years were included in
        the study. 94 women diagnosed as SS according to 2016 ACR-EULAR Classification Criteria for
        primary Sjögren's syndrome were included in the study by Rheumatology Clinic of Hospital.
        Ethical approval of the study was obtained from the Interventional Clinical Research Ethics
        Committee. All women were informed verbally and informed consent forms were signed.
