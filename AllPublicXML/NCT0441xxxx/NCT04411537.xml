  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the addition of immunotherapy of PD-1 antibody in neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). A
      total of 50 MSS LARC patients will receive 2 cycles of PD-1 antibody, followed by
      capecitabine plus irinotecan radiosensitized neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and another 3
      cycles of PD-1 antibody, finally received the total mesorectal excision (TME) and 6 cycles of
      adjuvant chemotherapy of XELOX. The tumor response grade, adverse effects and long-term
      prognosis will be analyzed.
