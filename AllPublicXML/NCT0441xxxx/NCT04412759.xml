    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare two wound dressing products for partial thickness
      burns in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study, all patients that had given written informed consent
      underwent screening. If eligible study participants were randomized to be treated wih either
      the standard dressing of care; pigskin or a microbial cellulose. Dressing were applied within
      72 hours after burn injury. Evaluation was done in an open manner due to the specific
      characteristics of the dressings. Study particpants were followed weekly until complete wound
      closure and after that evaluated at 6 and 12 months after injruy for burn scar outcome.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to complete healing of the burn</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at each visit (1-3 times per week) from admission until complete healing, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healing time was calculated from the date of injury to the date when the wound bed was assessed as completely (100 %) re-epithelialized, with no need for further dressing changes other than protection against shearing according to the treating physician.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Burn wound infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at each visit (1-3 times per week) from admission until complete healing, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Wound infections were diagnosed (by the burn surgeon) if they fulfilled at least two of the following criteria:
(based on the American Burn Association definition of burn wound infection)
Clinical signs such as localised pain and swelling, spreading erythema, and heat at the affected site.
Positive bacterial culture growth of the surface wound swab.
Signs of systemic infection indicated by a rise in CRP concentration (reference range &lt; 10 mg/L for capillary sampling) together with increased body temperature where other sources of infection have been excluded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Burn wound pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at each visit (1-3 times per week) from admission until complete healing, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to estimate the burn wound pain at rest, during activity, and during dressing changes using a numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 indicated no pain and 10 the worst pain ever imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of hospital stay (LOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From admission until discharge, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients hospitalized for their burns were monitored by the study nurse and the day of discharge was noted in the CRF. Any readmission after initial discharge was also noted and included in the total length of stay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Burn scar outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at six and 12 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>Burn scar outcome was evaluated using the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). The scale includes two separate subscales, The Observer Sscale, used by an experienced burn occupational therapist and the Patient Sscale, used by the study participants.</description>
