  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the REV clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of a virtual reality exposure to
      decrease patient anxiety before chemotherapy or an invasive act. If positive, the access to
      virtual reality exposure is aimed to be used as standard of care at Lyon's hospital to
      improve cancer patient well-being in a drug-free manner.

      The majority of cancer patients lives with high level of anxiety as soon as diagnosed. This
      level anxiety is particularly high before invasive acts but also before chemotherapy by side
      effects anticipation.

      Hypnosis is a highly interesting drug-free approach to decrease patient's anxiety. It however
      requires on site specialists to be available whenever needed.

      Virtual reality provides a distractive environment enabled to shift patient focus. It can
      support a switch of patient mindset by providing positive emotions.

      Since 5 years, this disruptive technology is being more and more used as medical support
      thanks to a new generation of headsets enabling improved performance at cheaper prices.

      Many publications have now demonstrated the positive impact of virtual reality to take in
      charge patients' pain or pre-operational anxiety.

      The primary objective of the REV study is to demonstrate the difference of anxiety before and
      after a virtual reality exposure using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) before
      patients undergo an oncological procedure (invasive act or chemotherapy (C1D1).

      The investigator's REV study aims to recruit 66 patients among three cohorts (22 patients per
      cohort) in 12 months.

        -  Breast cancer cohort (patient receiving an adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide)

        -  Head or neck cancer cohort (patient treated by concomitant radiochemotherapy)

        -  Cancer patient for which an invasive act inducing anxiety is planned (lumbar puncture,
           ascites puncture, thoracocentesis, myelogram, bone marrow biopsy, urinary
           catheterization, ..)

      The REV study aims to impact Lyon's hospital patients' quality of life and well-being by
      decreasing their anxiety level during oncological treatments thanks to innovative supportive
      cares.
