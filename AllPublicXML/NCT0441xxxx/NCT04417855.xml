      This study evaluates the effect of lumbar disc herniation on kinematics in the lumbopelvic
      region during daily living activities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the causes of low back pain and contributes to
      increasing the socio-economic problem. Depending on the reason for the dysfunction, various
      classifications describing the level of advancement are used. The literature on the subject
      commonly uses the division into protrusion and extrusion of the intervertebral disc, as
      approved by the American Society of Neuroradiology.

      The lumbopelvic kinematics, including gait and daily living activities, can be affected by
      the LDH: protrusion or extrusion. This pathology may be different due to the direction of
      disc migration: centre, left, right or all mentioned. Therefore, we believe that from the
      different direction of the disc migration the different symptoms can be observed.

    <description>The sensor mounted on the belt in lumbar 2nd (L2) vertebra. Following data will be obtained:
Spatio-temporal parameters standing phase, sitting phase and rotations, trunk kinematics (flexion and/or extension angle) will be collected.</description>

    <measure>6-meter walking test</measure>

    <description>The sensor mounted on the belt in lumbar 5th (L5) vertebra. Following data will be obtained:
Total distance travelled general spatio-temporal parameters, variation in spatio-temporal parameters during the 6 minutes walking, pelvis kinematics</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a valid and reliable assessment tool used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten sections concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.
For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0; if the last statement is marked, it = 5. After completing, the score is calculated by by summing scores from all sections (total maximum points=50). Total results are calculated as a percentage. The higher the score, the subject's condition is worse.
The results are interpreted as follows:
0% to 20%: minimal disability 21%-40%: moderate disability 41%-60%: severe disability 61%-80%: crippled 81%-100%:These patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms.</description>

    <description>Every individual will be examined with a non-invasive &quot;G-Walk&quot; device which is a sensor mounted on a belt and fasten on individuals' lumbar spine region during two test activities: Timed up and go and 6-meter walk tests. Data collection will include kinematic parameters. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score will also be collected.</description>
