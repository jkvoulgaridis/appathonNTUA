  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a single group pilot study of a novel intervention program which targets
      improvements in executive functions and adaptive skills in transition age young adults with
      high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. The main aim of the study is to test the
      effectiveness of the intervention using a pretest-posttest comparison. It is hypothesised
      that there will be an increase in executive functions and adaptive skills after the
      intervention.

      The participants engaged in a 10-week group-based intervention program which aims to improve
      daily adaptive skills based on executive functions and help the transition into adulthood in
      young adults with ASD. Before and after the intervention, the participants and their parents
      completed questionnaires that measure executive functions and adaptive skills, and the
      participants additionally completed an assessment of social adaptive skills. The differences
      between pre- and post-intervention scores of the outcome measures were analyzed using
      Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to evaluate the effect of the program.

    <measure>The change in the Korean version of Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (K-BDEFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention, between 5th and 6th session of the intervention and 1-3 week after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Korean version of Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale measures executive functions of adults in everyday life. The score range is 89-356. Higher score indicates worse executive functioning.</description>

    <measure>The change in the Korean version of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II (K-Vineland-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention and 1-3 week after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Korean version of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II measures adaptive behavior. The scores are converted into a standard score with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher score indicates better adaptive functioning.</description>

    <measure>The change in the Community Integration Skills Assessment-2 (CISA-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention and 1-3 week after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Community Integration Skills Assessment-2 measures adaptive skills necessary for people with developmental disorders to integrate into the community. The scores are converted into a standard score with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher score indicates better community integration skills.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention and 1-3 week after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Flexibility Inventory assesses cognitive flexibility. The score range is 19-113. Higher score indicates better cognitive flexibility.</description>
