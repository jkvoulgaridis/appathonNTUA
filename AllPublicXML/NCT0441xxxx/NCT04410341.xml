  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vildagliptin, an antidiabetic drug that inhibits the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP-4),
      increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and regulates blood glucose levels, favoring weight
      loss and lowering cardiovascular risk. A retrospective longitudinal study by Rizzo et al.
      showed that DPP-4 inhibitors administration could have protective effects against cognitive
      decline in diabetic elderly. Is has been observed that GLP-1 affects brain metabolism,
      increases neuritic growth, and protects neuronal cells from oxidative stress and death.

    <description>The principal measure of the outcome was the 17-items HAM-D. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-13 suggest mild depression, 14-17 moderate depression and scores over 17 are indicative of severe depression. Remission is defined as HAM-D total score ≤ 7 (primary outcome). Treatment response is defined as ≥ 50% drop in the HAM-D total score.</description>
