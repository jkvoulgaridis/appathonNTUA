  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of multiple CSJ117 doses
      (0.5; 1; 2; 4 and 8 mg) inhaled once daily compared with placebo, when added to
      standard-of-care (SoC) asthma therapy in adult patients with uncontrolled asthma with respect
      to change from baseline in FEV1 at the end of 12 weeks of treatment.

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IIb, multicenter, multi-national, double-blind, randomized,
      parallel-arm, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 5 dose levels of CSJ117
      (0.5; 1; 2; 4 and 8 mg) inhaled once daily compared with placebo, when added to standard of
      care asthma therapy in adult subjects with inadequately controlled asthma despite medium to
      high dose ICS plus LABA. Approximately 625 patients will be randomized into this study.

    <measure>ACQ-5 change from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from baseline in ACQ-5 score at Week 8 and Week 12. ACQ-5 (Asthma Control Questionnaire-5) consists of 5 items on symptom assessment. Patients will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ-5 score is the mean of the 5 questions: therefore, between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).</description>

    <measure>AQLQ+12 change from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from baseline in AQLQ+12 score at Week 8 and Week 12 AQLQ+12 (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) comprises a total of 32 individual questions that span a total of four domains: symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each item on a 7-point scale (7 = not at all impaired to 1 = severely impaired). The AQLQ+12 yields individual domain scores, which is the mean of all items in each domain, and an overall score, which is the mean of all 32 individual responses. Higher scores indicate less impairment in health related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Asthma symptom score change from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from baseline in asthma symptom score at week 8 and week 12. Asthma symptom score consists out of two parts i.e. ADSD (asthma daytime Symptom Diary) and ANSD (asthma nighttime symptom diary) integrated into one. Each part is comprised of 6 items assessing breathing symptoms, chest symptoms, and cough symptoms. All items are assessed using an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 ('None') to 10 ('As bad as you can imagine').</description>
