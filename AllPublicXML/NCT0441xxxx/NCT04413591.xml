  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a community based combination HIV
      prevention package, including biomedical, behavioral, and structural services for female sex
      workers (FSW) in Baltimore, Maryland. This study is a prospective two-group trial comparing
      the efficacy of a community-based comprehensive HIV/STI prevention package compared to
      standard of care (HIV testing, counseling, and referrals) among FSWs. Outcomes will be
      assessed through self-reported illicit drug use and sexual risk behaviors (behavioral) as
      well as HIV/STI testing (biological).

      This study aims:

        1. To examine the effect of exposure to community intervention components on HIV/STI risk
           behaviors (e.g., drug use/unprotected sex), and HIV/STI cumulative incidence over time
           in FSWs in the intervention (n=275) compared to those in the comparison group (N=175);

           a. to explore the intervention's effects on the risk environment of exotic dance clubs
           (N=15) over time

        2. To examine how socio-structural (e.g., social cohesion, stigma) and structural
           vulnerability (e.g., financial and housing stability) indicators change and are
           associated with the biological and behavioral outcomes over time in FSWs in the
           intervention (n=275) compared to those in the comparison (n=175) group

           a. examine the role of these indicators as mediators of the intervention effect on study
           outcomes;

        3. To examine the intervention's implementation through qualitative (e.g., in-depth
           interviews) and quantitative (e.g., assessment of program fit, reach, facilitators,
           barriers, program costs) measures.

      3.1 To examine participant knowledge of the COVID-19 crisis as well as the impact of the
      crisis on their mental, and physical well-being.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 month, 12 month, 18 month visits.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked for detailed information about sexual partners in the last 6 months.
For each listed partner, the investigators will ask: gender; age; drug use; incarceration history; type of partner (primary, casual, one-time); frequency of sexual activity and condom use; type of sex (oral, vaginal, anal); and if partner had other sexual partners during the time of their sexual involvement. This data collection method allows for calculation of the number of unprotected sexual acts.</description>
