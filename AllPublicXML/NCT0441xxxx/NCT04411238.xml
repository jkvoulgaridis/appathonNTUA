  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease often brings together 3 types of symptoms at one time or another of the
      disease during its evolution: motor, cognitive and psychiatric. Management requires
      comprehensive and multidisciplinary health, social or medico-social support. Its development
      generates additional difficulties for professionals who very often qualify this disease as
      &quot;very complex&quot; because it leads to a deep and severe impairment of physical and intellectual
      capacities. The sick person gradually loses their autonomy and becomes dependent for the acts
      of daily life, hence the choice of this disease for our study. Our study is focused on the
      quality of life at home of patients followed by the Angers Reference Center, &quot;expert&quot; on
      neurogenetic pathologies.

      Studies focusing on patients' quality of life at home have so far never been undertaken for a
      rare neurodegenerative disease like Huntington's disease.
