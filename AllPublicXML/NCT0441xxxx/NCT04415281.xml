  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation (PBM), is FDA-approved for temporary relief of muscle and joint pain, but
      there is no indication for TMD. Our goal in this study is to conduct a clinical trial of
      multimodal PBM for TMD pain. Also, we propose to determine if PBM-induced changes in
      inflammation contribute to PBM's analgesic effects. This study will be a double-blind,
      sham-controlled, randomized trial testing the efficacy of PBM for pain related to TMD.

    <description>Using a numerical rating scale (NRS) requires the patient to rate their pain on a defined scale 0=no pain and 100=the most intense pain imaginable to rate the average daily pain from Daily Pain &amp; Symptom Dairy over one week prior to V1 will be compared to the average daily pain one week prior to V8.</description>

    <description>PBM has been used clinically in the treatment of musculoskeletal and other pain conditions for over 30 years. Despite the low quality of the existing evidence, PBM has been increasingly used in other countries for the treatment of TMD. However, in the US PBM is not widely used for the treatment of TMD pain. Due to the multifactorial nature of chronic TMD pain, we propose that a multimodal PBM protocol targeting multiple pathophysiological mechanisms will be the optimal approach for PBM implementation in patients with TMD.</description>

    <description>When applying PBM therapy, there are some heating elements in the treatment device, and most of the sham treatment devices available do not offer this feature, which increases the likelihood of unblinding both the patient and the interventionist. The THOR® LX2.3 PBM machine includes this new feature, such that the sham condition mimics the heating activity of the active treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>THOR® laser system</intervention_name>
    <description>We chose the THOR® laser system given because their active treatment arm uses both coherent laser and monochromatic LED light. Therefore, we will use three types of active probes in this investigation including, A) Single Laser 810 NM 200 mw; B) Laser Cluster of 810 NM equivalent to 1 WATT and; C) LED Cluster, 34 X 660nm at 10 mw and 35 850nm, 30mw 1390mw total. As detailed in Table 3. We propose to use these three PBM probes in concert for the treatment of TMD pain. Laser A (Single Diode Laser) is designed for isolated trigger points and superficial muscles. Laser B (Cluster Laser) is designed for a more diffuse treatment area,targeting analgesia, anti-inflammatory, and deep tissue repair. Laser C (LED Cluster) is purportedly designed for the presence of diffuse inflammation.</description>
