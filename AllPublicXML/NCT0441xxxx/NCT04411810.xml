  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to develop a platform that can increase patient access
      to expert skin cancer diagnostic services via telemedicine. This is especially important for
      medically underserved areas where melanoma outcomes are worse than in areas with greater
      access to in-person evaluations. If successful, the widespread availability of such services
      would be combined with public education efforts to encourage individuals with changing skin
      lesions to seek evaluation. With decreased travel times to high quality diagnostic services,
      such efforts may decrease the diagnosis of more advanced melanomas (with a concomitant
      increase in the diagnosis of earlier stage tumors), and potentially decrease melanoma
      mortality.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether a teledermatologist can correctly diagnose skin
      cancer with the same accuracy as an in-person dermatologist. Telemedicine allows health care
      professionals to remotely evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients (i.e. without seeing you in
      person). A dermatologist who is not seeing the patient in person is called a
      teledermatologist. Currently, the standard of care, which means the accepted first choice of
      management, is an in-person evaluation. The telemedicine method that will use in this study
      is called 'store and forward'. This means the information will be sent to the
      teledermatologist after the patient leaves the clinic. The teledermatologist will use
      close-up photos and a device called Nevisense to make the diagnosis.

    <description>To determine the agreement between in-person recommendation and the telemedicine (tele) recommendation the number of discordant benign vs. malignant diagnoses will be calculated. In particular, the number of subjects that were recommended a biopsy from the in-person dermatologist but were recommended no biopsy from the teledermatology team, and the number of subjects that were recommended no biopsy from the in-person dermatologist but biopsy by the teledermatologist team.</description>

    <description>Participants who have up to 3 concerning skin lesions will be evaluated by both an in-person dermatologist and a team of three teledermatologists(board-certified dermatologists). The teledermatoogy team will deliver a consensus recommendation. If either the in-person dermatologist or teledermatologists are concerned that the skin spot(s) may be a skin cancer, a biopsy will be recommended and can be performed at no charge. Or if both agree that the spot(s) are not concerning for skin cancer, no biopsy will be needed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Nevisense 3.0</intervention_name>
    <description>Nevisense, an AI-based point-of-care system for the non-invasive evaluation of irregular moles remains the only FDA approved system available for melanoma detection in the US. Nevisense 3.0 will be used as a one-time exposure of &lt;8 seconds per lesion. Disposable electrodes that contact the participant are 5mm x 5mm in size. Nevisense 3.0 measures electrical impedance of skin lesions and provides an output called the electrical impedence spectroscopy (EIS) score. Electrical impedance is a measure of a material's overall resistance to the flow of alternating electric currents of various frequencies. The principle is that electrical impedance is different in normal versus abnormal tissue.</description>

    <description>Dermlite Cam is a digital camera that captures images of the skin under cross-polarized and non-polarized light and is 510(k) exempt. The DermLite Cam device appears as a single piece camera with a charging cable and USB computer cable. As part of the camera unit, an extensor arm exists to allow for the capture of standardized clinical images. The DermLite Cam will be used to acquire 3 images of &lt;5 seconds per lesion (one clinical, one polarized dermoscopic, and one non-polarized dermoscopic).</description>

    <intervention_name>Skin biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>A skin biopsy is a small procedure that removes a sample of skin from the surface of the body. The method utilized will be either a shave or punch technique. The maximum size of a punch biopsy will be 6mm and these wounds are generally closed with no more than 2-3 sutures. A skin biopsy takes &lt;15 minutes including preparation time, administration of intradermal anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000, removal of the skin sample, achievement of hemostasis, dressing the wound, and providing instructions for home care. Samples will be placed formalin for routine processing.</description>
