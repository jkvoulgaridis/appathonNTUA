  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetric Brachial Palsy (OBP) produces functional limitations in the involvement of the
      affected upper limb within the child's natural environment. The therapeutic interventions of
      Conventional Mirror Therapy (MT) and Mirror Therapy Virtual Reality (VR) are aimed at the
      rehabilitation of the affected upper limb and the quality life improvement.

      To quantify the increase in the affected upper limb spontaneous use and the quality of life
      of children with upper OBP from 6-16 years, when They are treated with Conventional MT or
      Mirror Therapy VR applying specific protocol: 20 min/day in 4 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The intervention protocol was permorfed for four weeks, three days per week applying
      Conventional Mirror Therapy or Mirror Therapy Virtual Reality, with 20-minute sessions in 4
      weeks. Designed to be done at home.

      Two measurements of the affected upper limb spontaneous use and quality of life were
      performed, a pre-treatment assessment corresponding to the baseline situation, and another
      post-treatment Assessment to observe the results after the therapy.

    <description>Therapy:
-With the affected upper limb into the mirror box, perform the exercise with the non-affected extremity which is reflected in the mirror box. -The affected side must perform the corresponding movement within its possibilities, according to the exercise that is being performed with the healthy arm. - It is very important to look at the mirror at all times, which reflects the non-affected side while doing the exercises.</description>

    <description>Therapy:
-Perform the exercises with the non-affected limb, which must be watched constantly with virtual reality glasses, to interpret that this limb corresponds to the affected side. - The affected side accompanies the movement within its possibilities (out of sight of the patient, it can be covered with a handkerchief). - It is very important to look at the non-affected side. The affected side should be out of the visual field to avoid confusion.</description>
