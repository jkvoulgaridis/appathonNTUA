  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficient health care systems for the management of chronic diseases in the community may
      improve clinical outcomes and simultaneously encourage patients to remain healthy. Supportive
      care, may contribute to empower heart failure (HF) patients for self- management and
      providing them with the follow-up and care based on their needs and values through the HF
      trajectory. To develop the current program an assessment of the support needs of HF patients'
      will be undertaken and the investigators will take into consideration of their personal
      preferences, for instance means of communication and way of exercise as part of the
      intervention. The present study aspires to evaluate the effectiveness of an individualized
      supportive care management program in terms of the four different components that comprise
      supportive care in HF. The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Determine supportive care needs of HF patients as reported in the literature.

        2. Explore Cypriot patients' identified supportive care needs.

        3. To develop and test a self-management supportive care programme for HF patients.
