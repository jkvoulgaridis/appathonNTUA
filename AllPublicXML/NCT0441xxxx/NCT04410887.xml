      The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of PIPAC+SOX+OLAPARIB
      for locally-invaded-gastric cancer (LIGC) patients in China. To obtain preliminary results
      for designing a new phase II/III randomized controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      Peritoneal metastases is the main cause of relapse and death after surgery in patients with
      serosa positive or locally-invaded-gastric cancer (LIGC). Recent researches showed that PIPAC
      and Olaparib are effective to control peritoneal metastases in different malignant diseases
      but it has not been tested for gastric cancer patients. The main purpose of this study is to
      compare the safety and efficacy of PIPAC+SOX+OLAPARIB for locally-invaded-gastric cancer
      (LIGC) patients in China. To obtain preliminary results for designing a new phase II/III
      randomized controlled trial.

PIPAC Intraperitoneal chemotherapy for PIPAC is Docetaxel Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Patients will receive three cycles of a standard dose of Tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule (TGO) plus oxaliplatin (SOX) +Olaparib prior to curative gastrectomy.
Adjuvant chemotherapy Three cycles of SOX +/- OLAPARIB will be given as postoperative chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy regimen A cycle consists of Day 1: Oxaliplatin 130mg/M2 intravenous Day 1-14 Tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule (TGO) 80mg/M2 oral (twice daily) Repeated every 21st day OLAPARIB Day 1-14: Olaparib 300mg oral twice a day</description>
