  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective randomized trial to be performed in pediatric patient's
      ages 4 to 10 years undergoing surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia. The purpose
      is to compare the effectiveness of interactive tablet devices vs. Virtual Reality headsets.
      The primary outcome measure being patient anxiety at the time of separation. Other comparison
      measures will include preoperative parent/caregiver anxiety, anesthesia mask acceptance
      characteristics at the time of induction, and time to fully recover in the post-operative
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After receiving IRB approval from our institution and consent from parents or guardians, ASA
      I or II status children ages 4 - 10 presenting for surgery requiring general anesthesia were
      recruited for this study. They were assigned to either tablet- or VR-based groups. At our
      institution, tablet-based distraction is widely used and represents standard practice.
      Children in this control group were given tablets in the preoperative holding area before
      transport to the operating room. Content consisted of entertainment apps providing access to
      music videos, movies and games targeting various age groups.

      The study group was given a Virtual Reality Smartphone headset in the preoperative holding
      area prior to transport to the operating room. This headset was chosen because of its low
      cost and wide compatibility for a variety of smartphones. The content consisted of several VR
      environments that the child/parent could choose from.

      In both groups, the distraction with tablet or VR was continued throughout separation from
      caregivers, transport to the operating room, placement of monitors and mask induction of
      general anesthesia. Anxiety at time of separation was measured by the modified Yale
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Caregiver anxiety was measured using the State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI). Mask acceptance at induction of anesthesia was
      determined by using the Mask Acceptance Scale.

    <description>We will compare modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) scores between the tablet based distraction group to those in virtual reality group. The mYPAS evaluates 27 items divided into 5 categories: activity, vocalization, emotional expressivity, state of arousal, and use of parent. The score ranges from 23 (low anxiety) to 100 (high anxiety).</description>
