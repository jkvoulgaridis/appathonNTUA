  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few studies indicating the effect of acute phase treatment approaches on
      creatine kinase and the musculoskeletal system in the physiotherapy and rehabilitation
      process. Rehabilitation in burn patients is a benchmark due to return to pre-burn life.
      Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of acute phase treatment
      approaches on creatine kinase and the musculoskeletal system in different types of burns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, there are very few objective and quantitative studies comparing the
      effects of standard wound care and rehabilitation period on different burn types in burn
      patients. Thus, our study was designed to investigate the effects of acute phase treatment
      approaches on creatine kinase and the musculoskeletal system in different types of burns.
