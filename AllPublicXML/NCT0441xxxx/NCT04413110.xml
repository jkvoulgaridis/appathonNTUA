    <textblock>
      Transformed migraine is the most common and challenging subtype of chronic daily headache
      disorders35. Patients with transformed migraine often report an evolutionary process that
      occurs over months or years in which headaches increase in frequency, change characteristics
      and ultimately result in patterns of daily or near-daily headaches resembling a mixture of
      tension-type headache and migraine.

      The present study aimed to investigate the presence and frequency of cognitive affection in
      patients with transformed migraines, as well as to analyze the association of cognitive
      affection with clinical features and headache impact, anxiety, depression, and quality of
      sleep.

    <description>PSG was carried out for 41 patients with subjective cognitive impairment and 41 age and sex-matched controls. PSG with standard EEG montage that includes bilateral EOG and four EEG leads were used. A single attended overnight PSG study was performed at the Clinical Neurophysiology Unit of Mansoura University Hospitals. Patients were studied in a quiet, darkened room with no medications were used to induce sleep. All participants underwent one night of laboratory-based PSG.</description>

        The diagnosis of headache disorders was based on the International Classification of
        Disease, Eleventh Revision (ICD-11). Patients included were adults with clinically
        confirmed of chronic migraine, completion of cognitive testing and questionnaires, and
        normal performance on cognitive tests based on normative data, stratified by gender, age,
        and education level.
