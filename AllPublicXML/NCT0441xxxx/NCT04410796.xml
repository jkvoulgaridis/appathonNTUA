  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of osimertinib alone with the combination of
      osimertinib and chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) in people with metastatic lung
      cancer that has a change (mutation) in the gene EGFR. Osimertinib alone is the usual
      treatment for metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Researchers think adding chemotherapy to
      osimertinib could possibly add to the anticancer effects of the usual treatment and help stop
      cancer from growing or spreading.

      Screening portion:

      Patients will begin on single agent osimertinib obtained commercially at the standard dose of
      80mg orally daily. Osimertinib monotherapy is currently standard of care first-line treatment
      for patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers. During the screening portion of the
      study, patients will be treated per standard practice as decided by the treating physician
      using the guidance of the osimertinib product label. The patient will proceed with three
      cycles (21 days per cycle) of single agent osimertinib.

      Randomization/treatment portion:

      Patients will be randomized to continue osimertinib alone (Arm A) or addition of
      carboplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy to osimertinib (Arm B).Randomization will be accomplished
      by the method of random permuted block and patients will be stratified by type of EGFR
      mutation (EGFR exon 19/EGFR L858R or other) and presence of CNS metastases (absent, present).
      Randomization will occur after data is available to identify the patients with persistent
      EGFR ctDNA detected in the C2D1 plasma sample; only patients with persistent EGFR ctDNA will
      be randomized. Subject's eligibility prior to randomization will be at the discretion of the
      individual sites enrolling the patients.

    <description>As the primary endpoint for the treatment comparison, it is the duration of time from randomization to the time of disease progression (in the CNS or systemically) or death. In addition, as a secondary endpoint, PFS is measured from the start of treatment to disease progression or death. Intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from time of randomization to time of progression (in the CNS) or death, whichever occurs first. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from first treatment to time of death.</description>
