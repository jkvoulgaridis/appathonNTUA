        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female Subject whose age is ≥ 30 at the time of consent

          2. Baseline mRS 0-1

          3. Patent Middle Meningeal Artery (MMA) and branches ipsilateral to cSDH (i.e., not
             interrupted or ligated by prior surgical intervention(s))

          4. cSDH measures ≥ 10 mm in greatest thickness

          5. cSDH exerts mass effect upon the subjacent brain, as indicated by local cortical
             flattening or midline shift

          6. Imaging characteristics indicative of chronicity (≥ 50% of the volume of the
             collection should be isodense or hypodense to normal cortical gray matter on Computed
             Tomography (CT))

          7. Subject presents with one or more of the following neurological symptoms: headache;
             cognitive decline; speech difficulty or Aphasia; gait impairment or imbalance; focal
             neurological deficit (weakness, paresthesia or sensory deficit involving of one or
             more extremities or facial droop); and/or seizure

          8. Subject, or his/her legally authorized representative, understands the nature of the
             procedure, consents to participation in the study and provides a signed Informed
             Consent Form

          9. Female Subjects of child-bearing potential must be able to provide a current negative
             urine pregnancy test and agree to an appropriate method of contraception throughout
             the trial

         10. Subject is able and willing to return to the investigational site for all follow-up
             visits (e.g., 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 1-year), as required per protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with prior craniotomy or burr hole evacuation of cSDH

          2. Subject requires (in the opinion of the treating surgeon) a full or mini craniotomy

          3. Subject with urgent or emergent (within 1 hour of assessment) subdural hematoma
             evacuation needed

          4. Subject with a cSDH with a focal location (confined to the frontal or temporal base or
             the inter-hemispheric space without cerebral convexity involvement)

          5. cSDH &lt; 10 mm in thickness

          6. cSDH without associated mass effect (no cortical flattening or midline shift)

          7. &lt; 50% volume of the blood collection is isodense or hypodense to normal cortical gray
             matter

          8. cSDH developed due to underlying condition such as a vascular lesion, brain tumor,
             arachnoid cyst, spontaneous intracranial hypotension or secondary to a previous
             craniotomy

          9. Life expectancy of &lt;1 year

         10. Subject who presents with an intracranial mass other than subdural hematoma

         11. Subject who presents with a meningioma with mass effect and/or ≥1 cm or currently
             undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma or sarcoma of the head or neck region

         12. Subject with serum creatinine level &gt; 3.0 mg/dL at time of enrollment (this will
             restrict the use of contrast) and not on dialysis

         13. Subject with significant liver function impairment

         14. Selective External Carotid Artery (ECA) angiography demonstrates opacification of the
             ophthalmic artery through an anastomotic connection with the middle meningeal artery

         15. Subject with a life-threatening allergy to radiographic contrast (unless treatment for
             allergy is tolerated or can be managed medically)

         16. Subject who is currently participating in another clinical research study

         17. Subject who is unable to complete the required follow-up

         18. Female Subject who is pregnant and/or breastfeeding

         19. Subject who has participated in a drug study within the last 30 days
