  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma and shows extremely poor survival. Several retrospective studies and randomized
      prospective phase 2 studies have shown that Peg-aspargase based chemotherapy regimens
      achieved a promising efficacy in the first line treatment of ENKTL. However, about one third
      of patients will relapse or become refractory after Peg-aspargase-based chemotherapy followed
      by radiotherapy, and some patients cannot tolerate the toxicities caused by chemotherapy.
      Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and Chidamide are active drugs for the treatment of
      relapsed/refractory ENKTL. However, there is no prospective study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody combine with Peg-asparaginase and Chidamide in the newly
      diagnosed early stage ENKTL. This prospective pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of the anti-PD-1 antibody combine with Peg-asparaginase and Chidamide regimen for stage IE
      and IIE ENKTL.

The regimen was repeated every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by involved-field radiotherapy after got CR and PR (patients with efficacy of SD and PD withdrew from the study). Intensity-modulated radiation treatment was done by linear accelerator at 2.0 grays (Gy) per daily fraction with 5-6 weeks. The involved- field radiation (IFRT) dose was 54-56 Gy. During the radiotherapy, the anti-PD-1 antibody is administrated (200mg ivdrip, every 3 weeks) for 2 cycles. After the completion of radiotherapy, the subsequent 2 cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody + Peg-Asparaginase + Chidamide are administrated. After the end of all the above induction treatments , anti-PD-1 antibody (200mg ivdrip, every 3 weeks for up to 9 cycles) is given as maintenance therapy for 6 months (the total cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody is 17）.</description>
