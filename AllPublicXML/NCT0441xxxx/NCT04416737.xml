  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In normal physiology insulin is secreted by beta cells into the portal vein. There have been
      a number of purported benefits among long-term intraperitoneal insulin users. In the present
      study we will inject ultra-rapid acting insulin into the upper and lower peritoneum under
      ultrasound guidance and compare it to subcutaneous injection. We will measure glucose,
      insulin and glucagon following these injections, to assess for benefits in counter-regulatory
      hormone production and insulin pharmacokinetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eventual goal of this line of work is an implanted insulin pump that delivers insulin
      automatically into the peritoneum based on continuous glucose data. All prior intraperitoneal
      pharmacokinetic studies used only concentrated regular insulin, which may be too slow to
      provide full closed-loop insulin delivery without meal announcement. A description of
      intraperitoneal ultra-rapid insulin kinetics, as well as counter-regulatory hormonal factors
      that may counter hypoglycemia is needed. Upper versus lower peritoneal delivery may also
      affect insulin kinetics. A possible benefit of intraperitoneal insulin is restoration of
      glucagon response in longstanding diabetes and clearance of insulin by the liver, both of
      which could provide hypoglycemic rescue in automated insulin delivery systems.
