  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) for patients with frequent
      premature ventricular contractions (FPVCs). Ninety participants will be randomized to TAES
      group and sham-TAES group with the ratio of 1:1. They will receive TAES plus usual care or
      sham-TAES plus usual care for 6 weeks, and then be followed up for 12 weeks after the
      treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with a 50% decrease of the
      24 hour (24h) premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) after 6-week treatment. Secondary
      outcomes include the proportion of participants with a 75% decrease of the 24h-PVCs; the
      decrease from baseline of 24h-PVCs, total 24h-heartbeat, and the frequency of
      supraventricular arrhythmia; the score change from baseline in PVCs-related symptoms; the
      score change from baseline in SAS and SDS. Subgroup analyses will be performed in age,
      gender, and the severity of PVCs. Safety assessment will be documented during the whole
      trial.
