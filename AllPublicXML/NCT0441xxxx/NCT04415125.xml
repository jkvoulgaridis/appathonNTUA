      BACKGROUND: In ice hockey, skating is a combination of speed, power, and balance.
      OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between previous injury
      history and on-ice and off-ice performance of elite male ice hockey players.

      METHODS: This study was designed as prospective cross-sectional study. Fifty elite men's ice
      hokey players included (n=50, mean age 23y 8mo, SD 5y 3mo). Off-ice performance measures were
      30 m Sprint Test, Broad Jump Test, Push-up Test, Hexagon Agility Test, Plank Test. The 2
      on-ice tests were 30m On-ice Sprint Test and Cornering &quot;S&quot; Turn Agility Test.The athletes'
      history of injury were including previous injury site, type, number and the mechanism of
      injury. RESULTS: In push up test, there was a significant difference in those who had left
      hand and right knee injuries and, athletes who had dislocation were found to be statistically
      significant (p &lt;0.05). According to cornering s turn agility test results, athletes who had
      puck injury were found to be statistically significant (p &lt;0.05). In 30m sprint and hexagon
      agility test results, athletes who had overuse injury were found to be statistically
      significant (p &lt;0.05). There was a significant correlation between on-ice 30m sprint and
      cornering s turn agility tests with broad jump test and also with off-ice push-up and plank
      tests (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the performance tests, push up test might be a
      distinctive test in determining the performance of the athletes after injury. Also on-ice
      tests had a correlation with off-ice plank test which is the indicator of core muscle
      strength.

      We believe that the current performance and performance deficiencies of the athletes
      determined and existing training programs will be arranged to eliminate performance
      deficiencies. We wanted to raise awareness about whether there is a general deficiency in ice
      hockey performance caused by past injuries and which exercises should be included in the
      training program in order to overcome performance deficiencies.

    <description>For the hexagon agility test, an equilateral hexagonal with 60 cm on each side was drawn to the ground, the athletes stood in the hexagonand started bouncing off the 6 sides in sequence and jumped back to their original positions. The athletes were reminded that their direction should always be the same when bouncing.The time was started with the start command. The test was stopped at moment he jumped from the last edge into the hexagon</description>
