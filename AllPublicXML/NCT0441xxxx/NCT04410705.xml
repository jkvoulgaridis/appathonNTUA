  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to investigate the effect of Ekstracorpereal shock wave treatment
      (ESWT) on muscle strength, flexibility and architecture of the lower extremity tendinopathies
      when applied using the frequencies specified in the literature with min and max frequency
      frequencies.

      Our hypothesis as researchers is ESWT treatment has an effect on muscle strength, flexibility
      and muscle architecture.

      The study will conduct in the Physical Therapy and Radiology Department in a private
      hospital. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Gaziantep the univsersity approved
      ethical compliance of the study with the decision number GO 2018-01. The participants will
      inform about the study and their write consent will obtain.

      Demographic information including the name, age, height, body weight and occupation of the
      participants will obtain before the evaluation. All the measurements will perform before,
      soon after the 1st session and after the last session.

      Outcome measures will be muscle strength, muscle flexibility, muscle architectures
      parameters.

    <description>The Ely's test will use for the measurement. The procedure will modify to incorporate active knee ﬂexion (rather than passive knee ﬂexion) into the testing protocol in order to facilitate goniometer measurement by only one examiner. Participants will instruct to actively ﬂex one knee and bring their heel towards the buttocks, while maintaining a neutral pelvic posture and contact of the anterior aspect of the hip with the plinth.Goniometric scores will be taken in degrees</description>

    <time_frame>Measurements will perform prior to ESWT,immidiately after the first ESWT and last ESWT treatment..Change of flexibility in 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flexibility of the muscles will be measured with using tape measure. A single measurement will be performed for each muscle. The muscle flexibility will record as centimeters (cm).The passive straight leg raise (PSLR) test will perform to assess the hamstring muscle flexibility. The subjects will lay supine with their legs will straight on an examining bed. The ankle of the testing leg will keep in a relaxed position throughout testing. The endpoint for the PSLR test will determine by the following two criteria: (i) the tightness felt by the examiner and (ii) the onset of pain in the hamstring reported by subject. Evaluation will do according to the angle on the hip. The scores will measure by tape measure. The distance between calcaneus and the floor will record.</description>

    <time_frame>Measurements will perform prior to ESWT,immidiately after the first ESWT and last ESWT treatment..Change of flexibility in 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The lunge test will use for gastrocinemius. The patient will stand against the wall so that the distance between the foot and the wall is about 10 cm long. They will move one foot back a foot's distance behind the other.
They will bend the front knee until it will touch the wall (keeping the heel on ground).
If knee can not touch wall without heel coming off ground, the foot will be moved closer to wall and then will be repeated.
If knee can touch wall without heel coming off ground, the foot will be moved further away from wall and then will be repeated.
Keep will be repeated step 5 until can just touch knee to wall and heel stays on ground.The flexion lunge will be measured the distance length in centimeters (to the nearest O.lcm) from the end of the big toe to the wall using a tape measure on the floor .</description>

For the hamstring muscle, isometric knee flexion strength will measure with the subject in a prone position and the pelvis and the contralateral leg will be fixed. The dynamometer will place at the ankle, perpendicular to the lower leg. The foot will in plantar flexion and the knee in an extended position. Three maximal voluntary isometric knee flexion contractions will ask with gradually increasing effort</description>
