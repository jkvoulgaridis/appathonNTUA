    <textblock>
      Phase I prospective study to determine the safety and feasibility of allogeneic,
      culture-expanded BM-MSCs in subjects with painful facet-mediated low back pain. Target
      accrual is 10 subjects with diagnosis of painful lumbar facet joint arthropathy. Eligible
      subjects will receive a single set of intra-articular bilateral injections of allogeneic,
      culture-expanded BM-MSCs human, allogeneic, culture expanded, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, treatment day 0, post-operative day 1,
      post-operative days 3-5, week 2, and months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-treatment.

    <measure>Change in number of red blood cells following treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be drawn in order to monitor for markers of systemic inflammation. The normal range of red blood cells varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 10^12 cells per liter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of platelets following treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test: Platelets are not complete cells, but actually fragments of cytoplasm from a cell found in the bone marrow called a megakaryocyte. Platelets play a vital role in blood clotting. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is in the range of 150,000 - 400,000/ cmm (150 - 400 x 10^9/liter).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test: C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. C-reactive protein is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/dL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test, and is a non-specific measure of inflammation. The normal range is 0-22 mm/hr for men and 0-29 mm/hr for women.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of the body in the urine. A BUN test is done to see how well the kidneys are working. Results of the blood urea nitrogen test are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, so blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. Results are reported in mg/dL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A sodium blood test allows the doctor to see how much sodium is in the subject's blood. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. A normal sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) of sodium.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Potassium</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliEquivalents per liter (mEq/L).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Chloride</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal blood reference range of chloride for adults in most labs is 96 to 106 milliequivalents (mEq) per liter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Inflamed or injured liver cells leak higher than normal amounts of certain chemicals, including liver enzymes, into the bloodstream, which can result in elevated liver enzymes on blood tests. The reference range for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is as follows: Males: 6-34 IU/L, Females: 8-40 IU/L.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
