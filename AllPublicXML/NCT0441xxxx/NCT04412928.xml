    <textblock>
      At present, around 30% of women with stress urinary incontinence have overactive bladder
      syndrome after mid-urethral sling procedure. But its predictive factor is still unclear. We
      will estimate the incidence of patients with overactive bladder syndrome after surgery and
      explore related predictors. In addition, we will explore the cure rate and predictors of cure
      of overactive bladder syndrome after the mid-urethral sling procedure for women with stress
      urinary incontinence. The above results will be used as a reference for preoperative and
      postoperative consultation.
