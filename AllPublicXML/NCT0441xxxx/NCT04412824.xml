    <textblock>
      This study proposes to examine both the peripheral and central nervous system responses when
      light social drinkers and binge/heavy social drinkers are exposed to visual ethanol cues,
      followed by oral ethanol. The findings will provide a greater understanding of the brain
      mechanisms (cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity) underlying the association
      between stress, cortisol release, alcohol craving, and alcohol stimulant and sedative
      effects. This knowledge could be significant in developing new therapies for the treatment of
      alcoholism.

    <textblock>
      Results from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that 26% of adults in the
      US engaged in binge drinking in the past month (SAMHSA 2014). Why some people &quot;mature out&quot; of
      this behavior while others persist may be due to one's physiological response to binge
      drinking. No previous study has assessed whether disrupted cortisol and neural network
      responses to alcohol cues may drive the compulsive alcohol consumption seen in binge drinking
      individuals who do not yet have an AUD.

      The investigator will recruit beer drinking, non-smoking men and women ages 21-45 (N=80,
      equal gender) who are either moderate drinkers or binge/heavy drinkers for two neuroimaging
      and neuroendocrine assessments to determine if their &quot;real world&quot; drinking behavior, in a
      prospective one month follow up, can be predicted based upon the cortisol and neural network
      responses to alcohol cues (with a placebo control, counter-balanced and randomized). Finally,
      the influence of genetic variation in the FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, which
      regulates cortisol activity, on the cortisol and neural network responses to alcohol cues
      will be explored.

    <measure>Change in Neural Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Procedure: measurements taken at 10, 20, 30 and 45 minutes during the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow is measured in ml/100 grams/minute. The interpretation is that blood flow to that area indicates that region of the brain is responding to the visual alcohol or non-alcoholic beverage cues. Change in blood flow will be calculated as the change (and slope) of measurements taken at 10, 20, 30 and 45 minutes during the procedure.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Procedure to 125 minutes after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The units for cortisol are micrograms/deciliter and the interpretation is that amount has been released into the blood stream from the HPA axis in response to alcohol or alcohol cues. Change in Cortisol will be calculated by taking the change (and slopes) of measurements at 45, 30 and 5 minutes prior to procedure and comparing it to measurements taken at 65, 95, 110, 125 minutes following the procedure.</description>

    <time_frame>Day after Procedure to 30 days after procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>A smartphone app will be used to collect 4 surveys a day for 30 days after completion of both arms. Multilevel modeling will be used to analyze patterns of drinking over time.</description>

    <measure>Amount of Alcohol Consumed</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>After exposure to alcoholic beverage and non-alcoholic beverage visual cues, quantity of alcohol consumed in a free choice test will be measured in milliliters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Alcohol Urges (AUQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Procedure to 125 minutes after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The urge to consume alcohol will be measured using the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ). The AUQ consists of 8 questions 8-56 total point distribution. The greater the total points, the greater the measured urge to consume alcohol. The change in alcohol urge will be assessed with the taking the change (and slopes) of measurements at 45, 30 and 5 minutes prior to procedure and comparing it to measurements taken at 65, 95, 110, 125 minutes following the procedure.</description>
