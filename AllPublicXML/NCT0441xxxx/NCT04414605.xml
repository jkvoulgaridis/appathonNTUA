      The aim of this study is to determine whether oral Chinese herbal medicine in combination
      with secukinumab is effective and safe in the treatment of severe psoriasis. Eligible
      participants will be treated with oral Chinese herbal medicine and secukinumab concurrently.
      No controlled group will be set up in this trial. The primary outcome is time to relapse.
      Secondary outcomes include Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75/90, PASI score
      reduction rate, physician's global assessment (PGA) score, body surface area (BSA) score,
      visual analogue scale (VAS) score, dermatology life quality index (QLQI) and Skindex 16.

    <description>Median time to relapse is a time interval. The time interval will be recorded between the end of treatment and the occurrence of relapse. Relapse was defined as loss of &gt; 50% of maximum Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement compared with pretreatment baseline.</description>

    <description>Oral Chinese herbal medicine (Gu Ben Hua Yu Fang decoction) and secukinumab will be used concurrently. The treatment duration for both secukinumab and oral Chinese herbal medicine is up to 16 weeks. Secukinumab will be administered by subcutaneous injection. The required dose (300 mg) is divided into two doses of 150 mg (contained in two separate syringes), which are injected at the same time. The first five doses (each consisting of 2 injections of 150 mg) are given at weekly intervals, with subsequent treatment given monthly (2 injections of 150 mg). Chinese herbal formula (Gu Ben Hua Yu Fang) decoction will be orally administrated twice a day. One pack of Gu Ben Hua Yu Fang will be taken for each time.
