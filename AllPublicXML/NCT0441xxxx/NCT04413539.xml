  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease in France. Its consequences on
      patient's life-course and quality of life need to be precisely identified among French
      patients and their family to be able to improve patients care according to their specific
      needs.

      The aim of the study is to accurately describe the impact of SCD on quality of life of
      patients living in France, or their family (for minor patients). The consequences of the
      disease on professional life, education and material condition of patients or their parents
      will be described by the patients themselves.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study. Patients or parents of minor patients living in France and
      suffering from SCD will be informed about the study and enrolled during their usual
      follow-up, or by patients' associations. They will be asked to answer an anonymous survey
      online relating to their whole life-course with SCD and exploring different aspects of the
      consequences of the disease on their life. It contains 4 different sections:

        1. socio-demographic questions to establish a respondent profile

        2. health status of the respondent to establish the severity of the disease

        3. education, professional life, material and economic situation

        4. quality of life through MOS SF-36 questionnaire This is a one-shot survey, which will
           take approximatively 20 to 30 minutes to answer by the respondent.

    <description>The perceived impact of disease on education will be confirmed by:
Type of education adjustment introduced
The level and the cause of leaving full-time education
The intensity of school absences
The feeling of discrimination on school time
The impact of disease on professional life will be measured by:
The professional status
The sick leaves
The feeling of discrimination at work
The compatibility of work conditions with the disease
The impact of disease on material and economic situation will be assessed by:
The income level
The patient cost sharing
The remaining balance
The recognition of handicap
The recognition of disability
The quality of life score of respondents:
