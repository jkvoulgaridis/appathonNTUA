    <textblock>
      A dose-escalation study to determine the optimum dose of CLAV for effects on craving and
      efficacy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group inpatient study of
      clavulanic acid for 10 days in adults (18-65) seeking treatment for cocaine use disorder. For
      those subjects who can tolerate 500 mg/day for 3 days (or matched placebo), there will be a
      forced dose escalation to 750 mg/day for 3 days. Subjects who can tolerate 750 mg/day for
      three days will have a forced dose escalation to 1000 mg/day for 4 days until the study ends.
      Structural MRI, functional MRI and MRS scans will be done throughout the study. At the time
      of each scan, safety of the subject to complete the scan will be re-assessed. Subjective,
      cognitive, and adverse effect assessments, blood pressure and pulse will be performed daily.

    <time_frame>1-24 days (during and up to 2 weeks after study dosing period)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AES) will be defined as any clinically significant changes in vital signs, indications of suicidal ideation or behavior on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), clinically significant change in Electrocardiogram (EKG) from baseline measurement, clinically significant changes in laboratory bloodwork (Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis), or any self reported side effects compared with baseline.
AEs will be collected throughout the study and reviewed by a physician. An evaluation of AE severity (mild, moderate, severe) will be evaluated by a physician based on participant self-report. AEs per subject will be listed by organ system, and the number of AEs within the subject population will be totaled.</description>
