  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal block is commonly used for postoperative analgesia in paediatric patients. A higher
      volume (1.5 ml/kg) of local anaesthetic for caudal block has been reported to not only
      increase the level of cranial spread but also provide better quality and longer duration of
      analgesia in comparison with the conventional volume (1.0 ml/kg). However, caudal block with
      a high volume of local anaesthetic can increase intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies
      have shown that propofol anesthesia lowers ICP when compared with volatile anesthesia.
      Therefore, this study was designed to test if propofol can reduce the magnitude of ICP
      increase following caudal block when compared with a volatile anesthetic, sevoflurane. There
      is increasing evidence that optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measured by ultrasonography
      correlates with degree of ICP and is able to detect intracranial hypertension. Therefore,
      ONSD will be measured as a surrogate of ICP.

    <textblock>
      Equal number of patients are randomly assigned to the P or S group. The participants in the P
      and S group are anesthetized with propofol and sevoflurane, respectively. Irrespective of
      assigned group, all participants receive caudal block with 1.5 ml/kg of 0.15% ropivacaine (up
      to 30 ml per individual participant). All anesthetic procedures except for main anesthetic
      agent are the same in all participants. ONSD is measured at the following time points: before
      (T0), immediately after (T1), and 10 min (T2) and 30 min(T3) after caudal block. Two
      measurements of each optic nerve sheath are acquired in each eye. The mean value of the four
      measurements is considered as the ONSD at each time point.

    <description>ONSD is a surrogate for ICP. ONSD was measured by transorbital sonography. Transorbital sonography is performed using a linear 6-13 Hz probe. After applying a thick layer of sterile coupling gel on the closed upper eyelid, the probe is placed gently without exerting pressure. Axial images of the orbit are acquired in the plane of the optic nerve, and ONSD is measured 3mm posterior to the optic nerve head as described previously.</description>
