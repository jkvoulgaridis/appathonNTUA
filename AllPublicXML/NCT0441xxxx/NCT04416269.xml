      The randomized controlled clinical trial will assess whether continuation of home oral
      antidiabetic agents during hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to
      insulin therapy in the management of diabetes in the hospital. The primary outcome of the
      study is to determine differences in glycemic control as measured by mean daily blood glucose
      concentration between oral antidiabetic medications and basal bolus therapy in hospitalized
      patients with T2D.

      Optional Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) study: For a subset of 50 patients per group, a
      CGM devise will be placed for the duration of the study to assess parameters of glycemic
      control and hypoglycemia. CGM reports will be reviewed at the end of the study and not used
      for insulin dose adjustment

      Hyperglycemia in the hospital is common and has been associated with increased hospital
      complications, length of stay, and mortality. Insulin therapy has been shown in randomized
      controlled trials to be effective reducing hyperglycemia and hospital complications but is
      cumbersome and contributes to rising health care costs.

The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System is a professional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device. It has three main parts: a handheld Reader, a disposable Sensor, and FreeStyle Libre Pro software. The Sensor has a small,flexible tip that is inserted just under the skin on the back of the patient's upper arm. The Sensor can be worn for up to 14 days.</description>
