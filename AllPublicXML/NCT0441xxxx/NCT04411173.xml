  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of isocaloric and isonitrogenous (2 x
      15-gram) doses of rice protein or whey protein to stimulate resistance training adaptations
      in young, healthy, resistance-trained men.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted using a randomized, double-blind approach with individuals being
      provided two doses of either 15 grams of rice or 15 grams of whey protein over an 8-week
      supplementation period while completing a heavy resistance training. One dose will be
      ingested within one hour of completing each workout and the other dose will be ingested
      within an hour of going to bed. On non-workout days, one dose of 30 grams will be ingested
      within 60 minutes of going to bed. The resistance training protocol will follow a linear
      periodization, split-body resistance training design consisting of two upper body and two
      lower body workouts each week resulting in each muscle group being trained twice each week.
      To minimize the influence of training experience and any learning effect, individuals with at
      least 12 months of resistance training history will be recruited. Participants will also be
      required to complete a two-week lead-in period (8 total workouts) before beginning the
      supplementation regimen to become accustomed to the training program and to account for any
      early neurological adaptations. Participants will then continue to follow the resistance
      training program for an additional 8 weeks. To assess the efficacy of the two different forms
      of protein supplementation on resistance training adaptations, changes in fat-free, lean, and
      fat mass will be determined using DEXA. Maximal strength and endurance of both upper and
      lower-body muscle groups will be determined while anaerobic capacity markers will be measured
      with the completion of a Wingate anaerobic capacity test. Participants will also be provided
      nutritional recommendations in order to ensure adequate energy and macronutrient consumption
      to facilitate positive training adaptations and eliminate any potential influence of
      differing dietary intakes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between the ages of 18-50 years, although it is anticipated that the majority of
             participants will be between 18 and 35 years of age.

          -  Participants will be healthy and free of disease as determined by evaluation of a
             medical history

          -  All participants will be required to abstain from taking any additional forms of
             nutritional supplementation (preworkouts, creatine, beta-alanine, etc.) for four weeks
             prior to beginning this study and for the entire duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those individuals with less than 12 months of structured resistance training
             experience will be excluded from the study.

             fat greater than 30%), immune, autoimmune, psychiatric, hematological, neurological or
             endocrinological disorder or disease will be excluded.
