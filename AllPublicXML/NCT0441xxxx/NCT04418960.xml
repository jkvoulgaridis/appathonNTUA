  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barlow disease (BD) is a common cause of mitral insufficiency. In 2012 the University
      Hospital of Basel started to perform a simplified mitral valve repair technique in BD just by
      implanting an annuloplasty-ring. It is hypothesized that the major mechanism of the valvular
      insufficiency in Barlow disease is a deformation of the left ventricle and the posterior
      mitral annulus, causing its aberrant displacement during the systole towards posterior and
      basal and thus impairing the coaptation of the leaflets. This prospective individual MRI
      study is to investigate the ventricle and the mitral annulus pre- and postoperatively for
      detailed analysis.
