  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions
      in various types of cancer, compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with various types of cancer underwent contemporaneous 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG
      PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was
      quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 18F-FDG and
      68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy.
