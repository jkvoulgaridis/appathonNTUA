  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if it is feasible to receive heated chemotherapy
      or heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) inserted directly into the abdomen at the time
      of a Second Look Reassessment Surgery and to monitor any effects good or bad that this has on
      participants' health.

      Primary Objective: Determine the feasibility of second look laparoscopy and hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy with carboplatin.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To compare the quality if life in patients with ovarian cancer after undergoing second
           look laparoscopic reassessment surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
           using carboplatin (CBDCA) versus quality of life in patients treated with cytoreduction
           surgery and systemic chemotherapy alone.

        -  To describe toxicities in patients with ovarian cancer treated with second look
           laparoscopy and simultaneous hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

    <measure>Number of Patients To Succesfully Undergo Second Look Laparoscopy and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of feasibility is defined as the number of patients who successfully undergo SLL and HIPEC divided by the number of patients who are eligible and consent to participate. The feasibility proportion and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer after undergoing second look laparoscopy reassessment surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy using Carboplatin (CBDCA) will be determined by the FACT-O questionnaire at pre-study, and months 3, and 6 in follow-up (post-treatment). The distribution of quality of life at each visit and the distribution of change in quality of life at each follow-up visit will be examined and the descriptive statistics will be presented. Scoring scale - (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = very much) and includes questions relating to Physical Well-Being (7 items), Social Well-being (7 items), Functional Well-Being (7 items), Emotional Well-Being (6 items) and Additional Ovarian Cancer Concerns (12-item). Scores could range from 0-156. Higher scores are associated with better QOL.</description>

    <measure>Number of Reported Toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be indicated by the number and severity of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. . Counts and percentages will be calculated for each adverse event. Mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range will be calculated for number of adverse events.</description>

    <description>Patient receives HIPEC with CBDCA 800 mg/m2 for 90 minutes.
Patients who exhibit the following will not receive the HIPEC procedure:
Extraperitoneal disease noted at the time of the second look procedure
Macroscopic intraperitoneal disease which is not resectable to R1
Technical problems which prevent continuous, adequate flow to maintain intraperitoneal temperature to 41°C during perfusion
Intraoperative complications such as cardiac or pulmonary instability precluding HIPEC
Participation will consist of completing surveys regarding their cancer and allowing researchers to use information from their medical records for research.</description>
