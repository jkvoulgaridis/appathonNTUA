  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yellow fever is an acute febrile infectious disease transmitted to man urban cycle by
      mosquitoes infected by an arbovirus of the genus Flavivirus family Flaviviridae. Its
      occurrence is recorded in South America Central America and Africa. In cities the yellow
      fever vector is the Aedes aegypti mosquito which also transmits dengue viruses zika and
      chikungunya. This disease is more frequent in males and the most affected age group is above
      fifteen years due to the greater exposure related to the penetration in wild areas of the
      endemic zone of yellow fever. Another risk group is unvaccinated people who live near wild
      environments where the virus circulates. According to the World Health Organization a single
      dose of the yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to maintain protective immunity against yellow
      fever for a lifetime therefore a booster dose is not required. This question is difficult to
      evaluate because there is no serological correlate of protection against yellow fever and
      seropositivity is defined with several cut off points. Although studies indicate that the
      duration of protection after vaccination is long there is considerable evidence in the
      literature that antibody titer falls over the years reaching levels considered as
      seronegative in at least a portion of the vaccinees. This is of more concern to people living
      in endemic areas who are exposed to the virus throughout their lives. For this reason Brazil
      recommended revaccinating once at least until additional studies were done. The need to
      increase Bio Manguinhos production capacity to meet the increased demand from Brazil and
      other countries is urgent. The occurrence of epidemics when millions of individuals need to
      be vaccinated in a short period of time exceeds production capacity and this is a recurrent
      problem. The current vaccine has a very high potency well above the thousand international
      units recommended by World Health Organization. But we need to generate additional evidence
      that very low doses of viral particles in the yellow fever vaccine are still immunogenic and
      that their immunogenicity can be maintained for at least ten years after vaccination. This
      evidence will support the rapid increase of their availability by the fractionation of doses
      or other alternatives.

      This is an observational study in young adult males who received the first dose of the yellow
      fever vaccine when they participated in the Dose response study of the yellow fever vaccine
      produced by Bio Manguinhos Fiocruz. The purpose of this study is to know whether reduced dose
      immunity is maintained for at least ten years. This information is crucial to support the
      recommendation to use fractional dose in adults a topic of great interest to World Health
      Organization.

      A volume of up to 10 mL of whole blood should be collected without anticoagulant. There will
      be at most two attempts at blood collection per participant.

      The study samples will be aliquoted and after will be stored for a maximum of 10 years in the
      biorepository of the Institute of Technology in Immunobiologicals (Bio-Manguinhos), Fiocruz,
      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this time will begin at the end of the last participant's
      collection.

      An additional written Informed Consent Form will assess whether the participant wishes to
      donate part of the samples to Bio-Manguinhos BioBank. In this case, the biological sample
      shall be stored for an indeterminate period.
