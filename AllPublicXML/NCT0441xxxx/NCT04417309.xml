  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test whether aerobic exercise improves the consolidation and subsequent
      recall of the learned safety memories among adult women with PTSD related to interpersonal
      violence exposure and whether this effect is mediated by the ability of exercise to increase
      acute levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and endocannabinoids (eCB).
      Participants can expect to be on study for up to 90 days, participating in 4 study sessions:
      Day 1 of Intake Screening, Day 2 of Emotional Learning, Day 3 of Fear Extinction and
      Exercise, and Day 4 of Recall of Emotional Learning.

    <description>Aim 1 fear extinction analyses consists of a 2 (group: low-intensity exercise vs moderate-intensity exercise) x 2 (cue: conditioned fear and safety) x 2 (task phase context: learning context vs extinction context) mixed design focused on Day 4 fear responding (skin conductance responses). SCR data will be acquired on a BIOPAC MP150 Data Acquisition System (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.) with electrodes placed on participant's left hand. Participants will be instructed to select an intensity of a 7/10 on the subjective pain scale, which should be &quot;uncomfortable, but not painful.&quot; Average intensity of participant skin conductance will be reported.</description>

    <description>Aim 1 fear extinction analyses consists of a 2 (group: low-intensity exercise vs moderate-intensity exercise) x 2 (cue: conditioned fear and safety) x 2 (task phase context: learning context vs extinction context) mixed design focused on Day 4 fear responding (expectancy ratings). Expectancy will be assessed throughout each phase of the experiment to estimate the degree to which the subject believes she will receive a shock following presentation of certain pictures presented during the experiment.</description>

    <measure>Group Differences in Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after 30 min exercise on Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Aim 2 group differences in BDNF consists of a 2 (group: moderate-intensity vs low-intensity) x 2 (cue: conditioned fear and safety) x 2 (task phase context: learning context vs extinction context) x 2 (timepoint: pre condition vs post condition,) mixed design. The hypothesis is BDNF increases following exercise will separately mediate the relationship between aerobic exercise and enhanced fear extinction recall.</description>

    <measure>Group Differences in Serum Endocannabinoid (eCB) Content</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after 30 min exercise on Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Aim 2 group differences in eCB consists of a 2 (group: moderate-intensity vs low-intensity) x 2 (cue: conditioned fear and safety) x 2 (task phase context: learning context vs extinction context) x 2 (timepoint: pre condition vs post condition,) mixed design. The hypothesis is eCBs increases following exercise will separately mediate the relationship between aerobic exercise and enhanced fear extinction recall.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Profile of Mood States (POMS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at each visit, up to Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS survey is a 65-item survey scored on a 5 point Likert Scale (0-4) where 0 s 'not at all' and 4 is 'extremely' for the tension, depression, fatigue, confusion, and anger subscales, and reversed for the vigor and esteem-related affect subscales. The range of total possible scores is XX-XX with higher numbers indicating more extreme or negative moods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>at each visit, up to Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>STAI is a 20-item assessment rated on a 4-point scale from 'almost never' to 'almost always' with the total scores ranging from 20-80. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at each visit, up to Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS is comprised of two 10-item scales for both positive and negative affect. Total combine scoring is from 20-100 where the higher the score the more negative the affect.</description>
