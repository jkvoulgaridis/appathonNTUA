  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational multicenter registry study will include adults greater than 40
      years old, diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, requiring home noninvasive
      ventilation as part of standard medical care. For the purposes of this study, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease is defined as chronic respiratory failure consisting of
      historical spirometry vales (FEV1 &lt;60% predicted and FEV1/VC &lt; 0.7) and chronic increased
      daytime carbon dioxide levels greater than 6.0 kPa or 45 mmHg. In addition, participants
      diagnosed with major organ system diseases or obstructive sleep apnea will be excluded. At
      least 100 men and women who consent and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked
      to participate. The anticipated study duration will be 6 months. The study will involve an
      initial visit for the standard of care initiation of home noninvasive ventilation. At this
      time, potential participants will be screened for participation. If eligible once consented,
      medical history will be collected and baseline questionnaires related to their respiratory
      disease will be completed. The registry study will include 6 month of home use of the
      noninvasive ventilator using the BiPAP A40 EFL device. Study staff will reach out to
      participants on a monthly basis to review any issues, medication changes, unscheduled visits,
      and device data download. Additional phone calls and or visits may occur on an as needed
      basis if issues arise. The final visit will be an in facility visit. The primary endpoint
      will be the overall prevalence of Expiratory Flow Limitation (EFL) in ventilated hypercapnic
      COPD patients, as defined as the percentage participants exhibiting a DeltaXrs value greater
      than or equal to 2.8 during one or more nights of therapy.

      Prospective observational multicenter registry study for chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease patients who require noninvasive ventilation in the home setting as part of standard
      medical care. The registry includes one in person screening or baseline visit, monthly
      follow-up phone calls (monitoring for medication changes, unscheduled visits and adverse
      events) and device data downloads, and a final in person study visit.

    <description>All participants in the observational registry will be using the BiPAP A40 EFL noninvasive ventilator as part of standard of care and will be participating in the same follows up and data collection. The BiPAP A-40 EFL ventilator is intended to provide non-invasive ventilatory support to treat adult patients with Respiratory Insufficiency with the primary cause being COPD. It is intended to be used within the home, institution/hospital, and diagnostic laboratory environments.</description>
