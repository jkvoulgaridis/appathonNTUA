  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no standard of care exists to prevent incisional hernias (IH). This study will
      compare how frequently IH develop in standard abdominal closures vs. abdominal closures with
      dHACM added. By adding dHACM to the standard closure, we think we can reduce the formation of
      IH.

      If patients decide to participate in this study, they will be randomly assigned to one of two
      study arms, Arm A or Arm B. They will have a 50% chance of being assigned to either arm. The
      assignment will be made by computer program and is completely random. Patients are not
      informed of which arm they are assigned.

      Arm A (Treatment Arm): dHACM Patients enrolled in this arm will have a thin sheet of dHACM
      placed as an overlay over the length of the closed incisions. dHACM is Dehydrated Human
      Amniotic-Chorion Membrane. It is a FDA-registered healing adjunct that has been applied in a
      broad range of diseases including wounds, plantar fasciitis and burns.

      Arm B (Control Arm) Patients enrolled in this arm will have standard fascial closure.

      Data collection will be performed at routine follow-up outpatient clinic visits with the
      primary surgeon to assess for IH related symptoms. At 6 months after surgery, patients will
      see a surgeon who is blinded to the randomization. This surgeon will perform a painless
      handheld ultrasound examination of the incision site.

      Two million laparotomies are performed annually in the United States (US). Following these
      surgeries, the incidence of new incisional hernias (IH) is estimated at 400,000 cases per
      year. These hernias are a major source of morbidity and mortality for patients, and they
      result in $6-10 billion per year in healthcare costs. Our multidisciplinary hernia prevention
      group has identified a novel IH prevention strategy in the form of dehydrated human
      amniotic-chorionic membrane (dHACM). We previously showed that dHACM prevents IH in animal
      models, and subsequently in a prospective cohort of high-risk patients.

      The purpose of this trial is to quantify the efficacy of dHACM in IH prophylaxis by
      performing a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Our specific aim is to
      test the hypothesis that augmentation of standard abdominal fascia closures with
      prophylactic, onlay dHACM sheets without fixation will reduce IH formation in a high-risk
      population.

Subjects will be randomized to treatment or control at a rate of 1:1, stratified by surgeon. Subjects, nursing staff, and surgeons not present at the time of fascial closure will be kept blinded to the subjects' treatment arm. Computer-generated randomization will be performed in permutated blocks of 20 patients, using SAS version 9.4.</intervention_model_description>
