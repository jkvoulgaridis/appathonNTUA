  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial palsy) is the most common peripheral lesion of the cranial
      nerves and the most common mono-neuropathy. Therapeutic ultrasound (US) is among the commonly
      used physical modalities for treating musculoskeletal disorders. The effects of US are due to
      alteration of cell membrane activity, vascular wall permeability and facilitation of tissue
      healing. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of pulsed US treatment in
      patients with Bell's palsy when added to superficial heating, massage and exercise therapies.

      In this double -blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 32 patients (aged 18-65 years)
      diagnosed as idiopathic facial palsy with appropriate criteria were included. All patients
      were evaluated with motor nerve conduction studies and electromyography at 3-4 weeks after
      the onset of paralysis and 3 months after the treatment. Paralytic side frontalis and
      orbicularis oris muscles were used for electrophysiological analysis. Electrophysiological
      examinations were performed by an experienced electromyographer who was blind to the
      patient's treatments. Patients were separated into two groups as Group 1 (pulsed ultrasound
      therapy) and Group 2 (sham). Both groups were undergone to a conservative treatment program
      (20 min hot pack, massage 20 min and facial expression exercises) for 3 weeks, 5 days a week.
      In group 1 pulsed US treatment (frequency: 1000 kHz, intensity: 0.5w/cm2, on-off ratio: 1:2,
      duration 5 min) were applied to the paralyzed facial muscles. The patients in group 2
      received exactly the same procedure as the treatment group, except that the power switch was
      off. All treatments were applied for 5 days a week for 3 weeks by the same 5-cm2 head US
      device (Enraf-Nonius Sonopuls 434) and the same physiotherapist. Patients were assessed at
      baseline, after last session, and 3 months after the treatment. Sunnybrook Facial Grading
      System, House Brackmann Facial Grading System and Facial Disability Index and
      electrophysiologic parameters were used for outcome evaluation.

    <description>Sunnybrook Facial Grading System is a scale used to assess facial function, and scores range from 0 (complete paralysis) to 100 (normal facial function). This scale provides a clinical score which combines a static and dynamic assessment of facial muscles with the degree of synkinesis.</description>
