      The patients assigned to either short-storage leukoreduced RBCs group (stored for ≤ 14 days)
      or longer-term storage leukoreduced RBCs group(stored for ≥21 days).When the hemoglobin
      concentration fell below 7.0 g per deciliter, PRBC were given to maintain the hemoglobin
      concentrations in the range of 7.0 to 10.0/dL. The primary outcome : Death from all causes
      in1-year after randomization. Secondary outcomes included: Intraoperative blood transfusion,
      Postoperative blood transfusion, Postoperative inflammatory reaction, Mechanical ventilation
      time in the intensive care unit, Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital
      were also recorded.
