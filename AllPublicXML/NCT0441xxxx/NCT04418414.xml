  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, non-randomized, open label, single treatment, Phase 1 study in
      approximately 7 patients with severe hemophilia A. The study will evaluate gene therapy by
      transplantation of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced ex vivo with the
      CD68-ET3 lentiviral vector.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will undergo CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell collection. These cells will be
      transduced ex vivo with CD68-ET3 lentiviral vector and subsequently, following a conditioning
      regimen of busulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin, the transduced cells will be infused to
      patients. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up
      to 15 years.
