  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective and retrospective registry will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of
      Germline Genetic, Genomic, and other Biomarker testing results over time in different
      clinical populations, in order to shape guidelines for testing, patient management, and
      precision therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interest and knowledge about the genetics and biology of an individual's inherited risk of
      disease and progression of disease is growing. Physicians are increasing using tests and
      technology, including Germline Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker Testing, to provide insight
      into a healthy individual's risk and an affected individual's disease characteristics, in
      order to provide individualized clinical treatments. However, many barriers to widespread and
      appropriate Germline Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker Testing persist due to complex
      guidelines for use, varied quality and cost, rapid advances, and adequate understanding of
      appropriate implementation by medical professionals. The iGAP Registry is a multi-center
      ongoing database designed to capture information on disease risk assessment, Germline
      Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker Testing, and their utilization and impact on treatment
      practices and outcomes to help determine, over time, the most effective use of testing in
      varied patient populations and to support the increased use of precision medicine.

    <description>To understand Physician Decision Impact and Patient Reported Outcomes resulting from the utilization of Germline Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker testing. This registry will gather information to capture the clinical management decision making processes of the physicians, before and after receiving information from Germline Genetic, Genomic, or other Biomarker testing. Further, this registry will collect information on Patient Reported Outcomes, or patient described impacts of Germline Genetic, Genomic, or other Biomarker testing on their treatment, clinician interactions, follow-up, and mental health.</description>
