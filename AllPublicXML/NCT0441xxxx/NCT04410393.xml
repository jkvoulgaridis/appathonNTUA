  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different surgical methods can be used in the treatment of vaginal cuff prolapse in patients
      who had previously undergone hysterectomy for benign reasons. One of these is sacrocolpopexy
      and the other is lateral suspension. the investigators want to compare the results of
      patients undergoing these two operations. Thus, the difference between surgical methods will
      be investigated.

    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic vaginal cuff prolapse will be operated; There will be two kinds of
      operation. After the operations, the patients will be followed up, a questionnaire will be
      applied to the postoperative patients and some questions will be asked. Pelvic examinations
      will also be performed and they will be evaluated for recurrence and complication. At the end
      of the study, the data of both groups will be compared and their superiority to each other
      will be shown.
