        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or legal representative has signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) and the patient
             has the capacity to participate in the study and complete the study questionnaires, in
             the estimation of the study investigator.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years

          3. NYHA Class III with dyspnea upon mild physical activity, regardless of left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

          4. Survive to discharge during a current hospital admission with cardiogenic shock (CS)
             as defined by clinical criteria previously used in cardiogenic shock trials: systolic
             blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for &gt; 30 minutes or requiring infusion of catecholamines to
             maintain the systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg, with evidence of end-organ
             dysfunction such as pulmonary edema or impaired end-organ perfusion including altered
             mentation, oliguria with urine output &lt; 30 mL/h, or serum lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L (5).
             Hemodynamic criteria include cardiac index ≤ 1.8 L/min/m2 without vasoactive
             pharmacologic agents, or cardiac index ≤ 2.2 L/min/m2 and pulmonary artery occlusion
             pressure ≥ 15 mmHg with vasoactive agents.

          5. Patients must have internet and phone access (to allow communication of the implanted
             device with the researchers).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Technical obstacles which pose an inordinately high procedural risk, in the judgment
             of the investigator.

          2. Treatment with ongoing mechanical circulatory support (MCS) such as a durable left
             ventricular assist device (LVAD) or recipient of a heart transplantation for the
             treatment of cardiogenic shock during the index hospitalization for CS.

          3. If of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test.

          4. Transition to hospice care.

          5. Intolerance to or inability to adhere to antiplatelet therapy for 1 year after device
             implantation.

          6. Presence of an active, uncontrolled infection.

          7. Any condition other than heart failure that could limit survival to less than 6 months

          8. Discharge to facility other than acute rehabilitation or to the ambulatory setting.

          9. No access to internet or phone.
