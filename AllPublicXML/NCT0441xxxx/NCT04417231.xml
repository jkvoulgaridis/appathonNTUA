    <textblock>
      CASTRO1 is a study to investigate the reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) by therapeutic
      apheresis (CRP-apheresis) in patients after primary treatment of ischemic stroke.

      The term therapeutic apheresis commonly refers to medical procedures, where pathogenic
      constituents are being removed from the circulating blood. Elimination is performed by
      adsorbers outside the body in an extracorporeal circulation. For removal of the pathogenic
      substances the plasma is separated from the blood (circulation) to pass the adsorber. The
      purified plasma is merged with the solid blood components thereafter and returned to the
      patient.

      The adsorber &quot;PentraSorb® CRP&quot; used for CRP apheresis is CE-certified. It is designated to
      the selective depletion of C-reactive protein from human blood.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CRP apheresis in patients
      following ischemic stroke. CRP apheresis is to be conducted with the aim of reducing cerebral
      damage following the guideline-appropriate primary therapy of ischemic stroke.

      A possible protective effect of CRP apheresis will be assessed by clinical scores, laboratory
      determination of immunologic parameters and determination of the size of the infarct area by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      The study will be randomized, controlled and monocentric.

    <description>10 patients receive a maximum of 3 apheresis treatments at intervals of 24 ± 12 hours each (from the beginning of the preceding treatment). The first treatment starts at the latest 36 hours after infarction or, in case of an unclear time window, within 36 hours after the patient was last seen free of symptoms. No further treatments are carried out if the CRP concentration before the start of a treatment is &lt;10 mg/l or if the patient has been discharged from hospital.
For each treatment, 1.5 - 2.5 times the plasma volume is processed. The duration of each treatment is approximately 4-6 hours.</description>
