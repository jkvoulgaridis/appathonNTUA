      This a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, objective performance clinical investigation,
      aiming to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Microport™ CardioFlow VitaFlow™ II
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve System for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. A total of 145
      subjects will be enrolled in 18 clinical centers within China. Clinical or telephone
      follow-up is scheduled at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and 2-5 years after valve
      implantation.
