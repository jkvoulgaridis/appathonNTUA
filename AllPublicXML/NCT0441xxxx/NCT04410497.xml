      Prospective randomized trial where two dressings has been compared for partial thickness
      scald burns in children 6 months to 6 years.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to compare two different treatment regimes for children with
      partial-thickness scald burns. Burns were treated with either a porcine xenograft (EZderm®,
      Mölnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden) or a silver foam dressing (Mepilex® Ag, Mölnlycke
      Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden).

      Methods: A prospective randomized clinical trial including 58 children admitted between May
      2015 and May 2018 for partial-thickness scalds to The Burn Centre in Linkoping, Sweden.
      Primary outcome was time to wound closure. Secondary outcomes were pain, need of surgery,
      wound infection, length of hospital stay, required dressings changes, and labour time.

    <description>Children were diagnosed with burn wound infection by the burn surgeon and a consultant physician specialized in infectious diseases if fulfilling at least two of the following criteria based on American Burn Association definition of burn wound infection
Clinical signs such as localised pain and swelling, spreading erythema (redness), and heat at the affected site.
Surface wound swab culture presenting a minimum of 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/L (equivalent to the ABA definition of 105 CFU/g) [29].
Systemic signs of infection indicated as a rise of C-reactive protein (CRP) level (reference range &lt; 10 mg/L for capillary sampling) together with increased body temperature exceeding 38 °C- 48 hours after injury where other sources of infection are excluded</description>
