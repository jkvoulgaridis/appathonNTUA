    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Modulus
      3D-printed titanium interbody implant in patients undergoing thoracic and/or lumbar XLIF as
      measured by reported complications, radiographic outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes.

      Patients considered for this study will have previously undergone surgery for their spinal
      condition according to the standard of care of the practitioner. All patients at a given site
      who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the study. Once
      enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan at 12 months
      postoperative or later to evaluate their fusion status. If the patient already had a
      postoperative CT scan at 12 months or greater, this will be used in this study and an
      additional CT scan should not be performed for this study. Available progress notes, medical
      records, patient-reported outcomes, radiographs (plain film and CT scans, if available), and
      complications will be obtained from the medical records of all enrolled subjects.

      The safety and performance of the Modulus XLIF interbody implant will be assessed using the
      following:

        1. Complications attributable to the use of the Modulus XLIF interbody implant as noted in
           surgical summaries, progress notes, and hospital records

        2. Radiographic outcome (fusion) and description of device status from plain film
           radiographs and CT scan(s)

        3. Neurologic status, symptoms, and/or subject self-reported clinical outcomes (e.g., pain
           and disability), as available

        Patients considered for this study will have previously undergone surgery for their spinal
        condition according to the standard of care of the practitioner. All patients at a given
        site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the
        study. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan at
        12 months postoperative or later to evaluate their fusion status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients who are ≥18 years of age at the time of surgery

          2. Treated with XLIF procedure with the Modulus 3D-printed titanium interbody implant at:

               1. One or two thoracic and/or lumbar levels for degenerative disc disease or
                  degenerative spondylolisthesis, or

               2. Any number of thoracic and/or lumbar levels for degenerative scoliosis (defined
                  as &gt;10º coronal curve)

          3. Interbody fusion with autograft and/or allograft

          4. Any NuVasive supplemental fixation

          5. Patient is able and to undergo a CT scan. If the patient already had a postoperative
             CT scan at 12 months or greater, this will be used in this study and an additional CT
             scan should not be performed for this study.

          6. Patient understands the conditions of enrollment and is willing to sign an informed
             consent form to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any bone graft with the Modulus XLIF interbody implant that is not FDA-cleared
             for use in the interbody space. Examples of these include:

               1. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) (e.g., Infuse (Medtronic))

               2. Synthetic bone graft extenders (e.g., AttraX (NuVasive), Formagraft (NuVasive),
                  Mastergraft (Medtronic), Vitoss (Stryker), Actifuse (Baxter), nanOss (RTI
                  Surgical), Fibergraft (Prosidyan/Depuy Synthes), ChronOs (Depuy Synthes))

                  Grafton Putty/Gel (Medtronic), DBX (MTF/Depuy Synthes), Accell Evo3 (IsoTis),
                  Propel Putty/Gel (NuVasive))

               4. Peptide enhanced bone graft (e.g., iFactor (Cerapedics))

          2. Previous lumbar fusion surgery at the currently treated level(s) (adjacent-level

             claim is allowed if it is not contested)

          5. Patient is unwilling or unable to undergo a CT scan due to pregnancy or other medical
             condition
