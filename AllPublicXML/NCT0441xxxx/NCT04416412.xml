    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study that will evaluate the association between bone and
      tissue perfusion, as measured by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, and
      complications, in an effort to develop ICG fluorescence imaging as a diagnostic tool to
      quantitatively guide operative debridement.

      This is a prospective observational study that will evaluate the association between bone and
      tissue perfusion, as measured using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, and
      complications. This will be used to develop ICG fluorescence imaging as a diagnostic tool to
      objectively and quantitatively guide operative debridement. The study population includes all
      open fracture patients regardless of race, ethnicity, or sex/gender. Primary outcome measure
      is all-cause re-operation and secondary outcome measure is surgical site infection. All
      patients will be followed for a total of 12 months.

    <description>Patients will be administered FDA approved ICG through intravenous injection and imaged by a FDA approved surgical microscope (Spy Elite) which is 0.5 meter away from the subject. Both ICG fluorescence and the two imaging systems have been used for routine clinical practice for many years. Figure (a) shows the Schematic sketch of the imaging systems. ICG fluorescence imaging utilizes intravenously injected ICG, which is a fluorescent dye that is FDA-approved for clinical use, illuminated with near-infrared light. The ICG dye is indirectly activated and the dynamic fluorescence due to bone perfusion can be captured by a video rate imaging system.</description>

        Patients 18 years of age or older who present with an open fracture will be considered for
        the open fracture cohort (Cohort 1). Similarly, patients who present with a closed fracture
        will be considered for the closed fracture cohort (Cohort 2).
