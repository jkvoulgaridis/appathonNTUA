    <textblock>
      ICARUS is an interventional single-centre hospital-based cohort study in patients admitted to
      the stroke unit with an acute ischemic stroke. The aims of the study are to i) define the
      characteristics and determinants of microglial activation after human stroke, and ii) assess
      the correlation of microglial activation with circulating inflammatory markers, structural
      brain changes on neuroimaging, and neurological outcomes.

      ICARUS involves serial TSPO-PET imaging along with serial MRI, immune cell profiling in
      blood, and both clinical and laboratory assessments in 36 patients with acute ischemic stroke
      caused by a cortical (N=18) or strictly subcortical (N=18) infarct.

      In a substudy, the investigators will include 10 independently recruited patients with acute
      ischemic stroke to assess MRI arterial spin labelling (ASL) sequences as a marker for
      perfusion measurement of the TSPO tracer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The neuroinflammatory response after ischemic brain injury has been identified as a
      pathomechanism in ischemic stroke. Stroke induces an activation of microglia in the brain,
      which lasts over months. However, the characteristics and mechanisms of this microglia
      activation are insufficiently defined.

      Our study hypotheses are (i) that a subpopulation of patients with acute stroke develop
      prominent microglial activation, and (ii) that patients with extensive microglial activation
      are more likely to experience poor outcome.

      Against this background, the investigators set up the &quot;Inflammatory faCtors AfteR acUte
      ischemic Stroke (ICARUS)&quot; study as an interventional single-centre hospital-based cohort
      study. N=36 patients with a cortical (N=18) or strictly subcortical (N=18) acute ischemic
      stroke will be recruited through the local stroke unit (Department of Neurology, LMU Munich).
      Study participation involves serial TSPO-PET imaging along with serial MR imaging, immune
      cell profiling in blood, and both clinical and laboratory assessments. Follow-up assessments
      at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months will be conducted at the Institute for Stroke
      and Dementia Research (ISD) and at the Department of Nuclear medicine, both LMU Munich.

      In a substudy, the investigators will include 10 independently recruited patients with acute
      ischemic stroke to assess MRI arterial spin labelling (ASL) sequences as a marker for
      perfusion measurement of the TSPO tracer. These patients will receive dynamic PET in addition
      to the ASL sequences.
