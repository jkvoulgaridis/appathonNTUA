  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspire intends to conduct this study to compare Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), between the two
      randomization arms, at 6 months post-activation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, multi-center study of therapy
      optimization related to the Inspire UAS System (implanted in a commercial setting under
      current labeling).

      Comparison of outcomes between two (2) groups of patients (both implanted with the Inspire
      UAS system) who undergo different post-implant care algorithms throughout follow-up, in order
      to determine whether home sleep monitoring may be used as a surrogate for an in-lab PSG
      titration in a sub-set of patients.

      Subjects who have been identified as candidates for Inspire therapy (implant of the Inspire
      UAS system), according to commercial labeling, will be recruited to participate in the study.

      A maximum of 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 clinical centers. A total of 60
      subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two study arms.

    <measure>Comparison of Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), between the two randomization arms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The AHI endpoint will be determined by performing three equivalency tests for the following: Absolute AHI and, change in AHI. All comparisons will be done on the treatment AHI at 6 months between the control group and the home monitoring group. The objective is to demonstrate the equivalence in AHI, change in AHI, and response rate between the two groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), between the two randomization arms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) endpoint will be determined by performing an equivalence test for the ESS score at 6 months between the control group and the home monitoring group. The objective is to demonstrate ESS score to be equivalent between the two groups.
H0: |x ̃_diff |&gt;2 Ha: |x ̃_diff |≤2
where x ̃_diff is the median of differences (location shift) in the ESS score between the two groups.
As the ESS score at 6 months has been shown to be non-normally distributed in previous studies, a non-parametric Hodges-Lehmann test at a significance level of 0.05 will be used to determine the location shift and its confidence interval between the two groups. An equivalence margin between -2 and 2 will be used as this is the defined meaningful clinical difference based on the AASM guidelines8.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), between the two randomization arms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) endpoint will be determined by performing an equivalence test for the ODI score at 6 months between the control group and the home monitoring group. The objective is to demonstrate ODI score to be equivalent between the two groups.
H0: |x ̃_diff |&gt;15 Ha: |x ̃_diff |≤15 where x ̃_diff is the median of differences (location shift) in the ODI score between the two groups.
As the ODI score at 6 months has been shown to be non-normally distributed in previous studies, a non-parametric Hodges-Lehmann test at a significance level of 0.05 will be used to determine the location shift and its confidence interval between the two groups. ODI is closely related to AHI and therefore an equivalence margin of -15 and 15 will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Therapy Usage (hours per week), between the two randomization arms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The therapy usage endpoint will be determined by performing an equivalence test for the average therapy usage at 6 months between the control group and the home monitoring group. The objective is to demonstrate therapy usage to be equivalent between the two groups.
H0: |x ̃_diff |&gt;0.5 hrs Ha: |x ̃_diff |≤0.5 hrs where x ̃_diff is the median of differences (location shift) in therapy usage between the two groups.
As the treatment therapy usage at 6 months has been shown to be non-normally distributed in previous studies, a non-parametric Hodges-Lehmann test at a significance level of 0.05 will be used to determine the location shift and its confidence interval between the two groups. An equivalence margin between -0.5 and 0.5 hrs will be used as this is the defined meaningful clinical difference based on the AASM guidelines8.</description>

    <description>Subjects who have undergone implant of the Inspire UAS System and are randomized to this group will undergo a 2-night HST at 3 months post-activation. Depending on the results of the 2-night HST, the subject will either (a) undergo a PSG titration at 5 months post-activation and a 2-night HST at 6 months post-activation OR (b) undergo only a 2-night HST at approximately 6 months post-activation</description>

    <description>Two-night Home Sleep Tests (HSTs) will be conducted using commercially available Home Sleep Test equipment. The HST will be ordered by the clinical center through a HIPAA compliant HST service that has been selected by the study sponsor.
The HSTs will be scored and interpreted according to AASM Guidelines by board certified sleep physicians affiliated with the HST service. The HST will be scored using the 4% oxygen desaturation rule.</description>
