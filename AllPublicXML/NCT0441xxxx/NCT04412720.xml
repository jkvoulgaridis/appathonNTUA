  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have reported the benefits of aerobic and breathing exercises such as, reduction
      of symptoms and reduced the use of medications, the number of crises, exercise induced
      bronchoconstriction (EIB), and improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This
      study will be a randomized and controlled trial (RCT) with 2 parallel arms and blinded
      assessment. Fifty-four moderate or severe patients with asthma under optimized medication
      will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either aerobic+breathing exercises (AB)
      or aerobic+stretching exercises (AS). All patients will receive the same educational session
      and will perform the physical exercise proposed for the group for 12 weeks, 2 times/week,
      60-minute sessions; however, the AB group will perform Buteyko breathing technique and AS
      will perform muscle stretching exercise. All patients will be assessed to clinical control,
      quality of life, psychosocial symptoms, pulmonary function, functional capacity, physical
      activity levels, sleep quality, thoracoabdominal mechanics, hyperventilation symptoms, and
      asthma exacerbation. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The variables
      obtained before interventions will be compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test.
      Comparisons of the outcomes initial and final data will be analyzed with repeated measures
      ANOVA with appropriate post hoc test. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.

    <description>Clinical control will be evaluated by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). The ACQ contains 7 items rated on a 7-point scale (0 = without limitation, 6 = maximum limitation), with a higher score indicating worse control. Scores lower than 0.75 are associated with good asthma control, whereas scores greater than 1.5 are indicative of poorly controlled asthma, and a change of at least 0.5 points in the ACQ score is regarded as clinically significant.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 10 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed by Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The AQLQ consists of 32 items rated on a 7-point scale (1 = great deal, 7 = not at all) divided into the following 4 domains: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function and environmental stimuli. Higher AQLQ scores indicate a better quality of life, and treatments resulting in a 0.5-point increase in scores following an intervention are considered to be clinically effective.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 10 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of anxiety and depression symptoms will be assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs), which consists of 14 items divided into 2 subscales (7 for anxiety and 7 for depression). Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a maximum score of 21 points for each subscale. A score greater than 8/9 in each subscale suggests a diagnosis of either anxiety and/or depression.</description>

    <description>Physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be objectively quantified using a movement sensor (ActiGraph, Pensacola, USA) for 7 consecutive days on the hip using an elastic belt. Sedentary behaviour will be quantify by the time spent sedentary (&lt; 100 counts/min).</description>

    <measure>Change in sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 10 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be objectively quantified using a movement sensor (ActiGraph, Pensacola, USA) for 7 consecutive nights on the wrist (non-dominant side), and by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 9 items divided into the following 7 domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>

    <description>Aerobic exercises will be performed on a treadmill, twice a week, totaling 20 sessions of 60 minutes each. The initial intensity will be 50% to 60% of maximum heart rate and the progression will take place according to the level of effort (Borg) in the last two sessions. In addition, following the aerobic training, Buteyko Breathing Technique also will be performed during 20 minutes each exercise, in the same treatment session. During the first two weeks, the patient will learn the technique supervised by a physical therapist. In addition, the patients will receive a breathing exercise booklet for in-home training. Before and after each session, patients will be evaluated in relation to blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and asthma symptoms.</description>
