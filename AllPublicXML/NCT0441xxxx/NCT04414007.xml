  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological reports show that the incidence of atrial fibrillation continues to increase.
      AF is the most common arrhythmia with high mortality and disability rate. Radio frequency
      ablation has good therapeutic effect of AF symptoms. However, even after successful radio
      frequency ablation, there are still many discomforts that deserve medical attention. The
      benefits of cardiac rehabilitation for patients with heart disease have been recognized，but
      the adherence with cardiac rehabilitation is not satisfactory. Home-based rehabilitation has
      received increasing recognition because it has overcome many obstacles for patients to
      participate in cardiac rehabilitation. The application of Internet+ follow-up mode and
      intelligent wearable devices provide new ideas for home-based cardiac rehabilitation with the
      progress of information technology nowadays. This study used an experimental research design.
      The aim was to explore the application effects of Internet platform and wearable devices in
      home-based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with atrial fibrillation after radio frequency
      ablation. The final goal is to provide the basis for the development and application of this
      kind of home-based cardiac rehabilitation care in patients with atrial fibrillation after
      radio frequency ablation.
