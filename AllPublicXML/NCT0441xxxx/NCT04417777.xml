  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis, defined by an increase in bronchial caliber and thickening of the bronchial
      wall, is associated with recurrent respiratory infections, chronic cough and bronchorrhea,
      and a frequent progression to chronic respiratory failure. Investigator distinguish focal
      bronchiectasis usually resulting from a localized cause and diffuse bronchiectasis which the
      possible causes are multiple (immune deficiencies, genetic diseases, auto immune pathologies,
      aspergillosis broncho -allergic lung, sequelae of pulmonary infections).The etiological
      assessment is negative in 26 to 53% of cases, defining the idiopathic bronchiectasis.
      However, the discovery of an underlying cause can change the patient's management (up to 37%
      of cases).

      Despite the lack of epidemiological data in French Polynesia, Australian and New Zealand
      studies found a high prevalence of bronchiectasis in Polynesians. Few clinical studies
      published in the early 1980s suggested a ciliary origin.

      Due to its geographic characteristics, the Polynesian population constitutes an interesting
      ethnic group. Indeed, there is a low genetic mixing and the prevalence of certain genetic
      diseases like the syndrome of Alport or some hereditary retinal dystrophies are high. This
      type of population is very suitable for discovering new genes in human pathology.

      Investigator decided to conduct an observational study to find an underlying genetic cause of
      bronchiectasis in Polynesians by performing a whole exome sequencing. Investigator chose to
      study index cases defined by an upset of symptoms during the childhood, a family history of
      idiopathic bronchiectasis, and/or a consanguinity. Investigator also want to study healthy
      first degree relatives, in order to be able to better identify the clinical significant of
      DNA variants and focus the analysis on those that may be pathogenic
