    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of a breast cancer vaccine (SV-BR-1-GM) and
      how well it works in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of breast cancer that
      is persistent, has come back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic). Breast cancer vaccine SV-BR-1-GM is a human breast cancer cell line that has
      been genetically engineered to produce a substance called &quot;GM-CSF&quot; (granulocyte-macrophage
      colony stimulating factor) which occurs naturally in the body. GM-CSF is normally produced by
      white blood cells and helps the body develop immunity to disease-causing germs. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Anti-cancer
      drugs such as cyclophosphamide may help boost the immune response. Interferon alpha 2b may
      help stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. This trial may help doctors see whether
      SV-BR-1-GM injections help boost the immune system and/or help control or help shrink breast
      cancer along with the other drugs that also boost the immune system.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine SV-BR-1-GM
      (SV-BR-1-GM) regimen when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the overall response rate of
      the SV-BR1-GM regimen in combination with pembrolizumab. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the non-progressive rate of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      III. To evaluate immune responses elicited by the SV-BR-1-GM regimen when administered in
      combination with pembrolizumab.

      IV. To evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that may be predictive of responses to the
      SV-BR-1-GM regimen when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.

      V. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) in patients administered the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in
      combination with pembrolizumab by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Survey.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1, SV-BR-1-GM
      intradermally (ID) on day 3, pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 5, and
      interferon-alpha-2b ID on days 5 and 7. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Patients may not be on a concurrent treatment clinical trial, unless approved by
             principal investigator
