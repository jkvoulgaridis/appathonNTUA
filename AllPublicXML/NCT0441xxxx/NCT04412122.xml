      A randomised clinical trial in a single centre.The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effect of kinesio taping and breathing exercises on pain management applied after benign
      gynecological abdominal operations. A total of 132 women, divided into 4 groups of 33
      subjects each, were included.Women underwent gynecological abdominal operation were assigned
      to the groups randomly, depending on the application of two different methods of kinesio
      taping and breathing exercise.In randomization, a table of numbers was created, and an equal
      number of women were assigned to groups with four block patterns. Using kinesio taping and
      breathing exercise, 33 women were included in kinesio taping group (1st Group), 33 in
      breathing exercise group (2nd Group), and 33 in kinesio taping + breathing exercise group
      (3rd Group). No intervention was applied to the women in the control group (4th Group). Pain
      levels of women were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after administration
      of the interventions.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of kinesio taping and breathing
      exercises on pain management applied after benign gynecological abdominal operations.

      Design-Setting: This was an experimental, randomized controlled trial. This study was
      conducted at the Gynecology Service of Oncology Training and Research Hospital.

      Participants: A total of 132 women, divided into 4 groups of 33 subjects each, were included.

      Methods: The sampling size was calculated with G*Power Ver.3.1.9.2 computer software. A total
      of 132 women, 33 of whom were in kinesio taping group, 33 in breathing exercise group, 33 in
      kinesio taping + breathing exercise group, and 33 in the control group, who matched the
      sampling selection criteria, were included in the study. In randomization, a table of numbers
      was created, and an equal number of women were assigned to groups with four block patterns.
      Women underwent gynecological abdominal operation were assigned to the groups randomly,
      depending on the application of two different methods of kinesio taping and breathing
      exercise. No intervention was applied to the women in the control group.

      The personal information form was filled for each individual, who agreed to participate in
      the study, before the procedure.

      Outcome Measures Pain scores of the women in all groups before, and after the procedure were
      evaluated by the researcher independent from each other using Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

    <intervention_model_description>After abdominal surgery, kinesio taping and breathing exercise were applied.
Intervention Protocol of the Study Kinesio Taping (KT) Group In the study, kinesio taping method was applied immediately after the surgical operation. The tape was applied on one centimeter above and one centimeter below the incision site with a 25% tension in web cutting technique. In order to facilitate gas passing and defecation, the tape was applied around the navel in the Y shape with a 25% tension. No tension was applied to the starting and ending points of the tape. Kinesio tape remained on women for 72 hours.
Breathing Exercises (BE) Group Before the surgery, researchers informed the women about the purpose and benefits of breathing exercises and showed the how to perform them. Breathing exercises were performed 3 times a day for 30 minutes on the first, second and third days. 15 minutes of exercises were done while sitting and in a comfortable position and 15 minutes while mobilizing.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The data of the research were collected with personal information, postoperative follow-up and discharge risk assessment forms and Visual Analog Scale by the researcher. Pain levels of women were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after administration of the analgesic or interventions by the researcher. Data were collected on the postoperative days 0, 1, 2 and 3 during the hospital stay.</masking_description>

    <description>VAS, developed by Freyd, is a scale consisting of 100-millimeter lines and used in the assessment of pain (Yaray, Akesen, Ocakolu &amp; Aydınlı, 2011). For pain assessment using VAS, &quot;no pain&quot; on one end, &quot;worst possible pain&quot; is written on the other end of the scale and the individual shows or marks their current situation on the 100-millimeter line (Jensen, Chen, Brugger, 2003).</description>

    <description>Postoperative follow-up form in the study were developed by the researcher in line with the literature, and expert opinion was obtained (Gürşen, İnanoğlu, Kaya, Akbayrak &amp; Baltacı, 2016; Hadi &amp; Akbar Haind, 2011; Sahai Sharma, Yadav &amp; Bindal, 2015; Stanirowski, Wunk, Cendrowski &amp; Sawick, 2015). The postoperative follow-up form contains questions regarding the planned interventions following surgery (pain scores before and after kinesio taping and/or breathing exercises) and the postoperative recovery process (oral intake, mobilization, gas-passing, defecation time).</description>

    <description>Discharge risk assessment form in the study were developed by the researcher in line with the literature, and expert opinion was obtained (Gürşen, İnanoğlu, Kaya, Akbayrak &amp; Baltacı, 2016; Hadi &amp; Akbar Haind, 2011; Sahai Sharma, Yadav &amp; Bindal, 2015; Stanirowski, Wunk, Cendrowski &amp; Sawick, 2015). Discharge risk assessment form includes questions regarding the improvement of the incision site (infection, wound color, tenderness, bleeding, ecchymosis, edema) and the individual's self-perception of healing on the day of discharge.</description>

    <description>Kinesio taping is thought to remove the barriers that slow the healing process, activate neurological suppression and reduce pain (El-Refayea, El Nahasa &amp; Ghareebb, 2016; Kamali, Sinaei &amp; Taherkhan, 2018). Kinesio tape stimulates cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors decrease sympathetic nervous system activity and increase parasympathetic activity, which can improve intestinal control (Azam, 2017; Szczegielniak, Krajczy, Bogacz, Luniewski &amp; Sliwinski, 2007). Kinesio taping changes skin contours and accelerates blood flow. Increased blood flow brings more oxygen and nutrients to the area. This phenomenon contributes to the natural healing process (Kafa et al., 2015).</description>

    <description>Breathing exercise is accepted as a key to relaxation or cooling down (El-Refayea et al., 2016). It is stated that breathing exercises reduce anxiety by preventing the transmission of pain messages to the spinal cord (Rejeh et al., 2013), reducing the catecholamine response (Rakel &amp; Herr, 2004) and muscle tension by distracting subjects (Kelle, Güzel &amp; Sakallı, 2016).</description>

The tape was applied on one centimeter above and one centimeter below the incision site with a 25% tension in web cutting technique (Figure 1.). In order to facilitate gas passing and defecation, the tape was applied around the navel in the Y shape with a 25% tension (Figure 2). No tension was applied to the starting and ending points of the tape. Pain level was evaluated with VAS before and after 45 minutes of tape application. Pain level was evaluated by VAS on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd postoperative day. Kinesio tape remained on women for 72 hours.</description>
