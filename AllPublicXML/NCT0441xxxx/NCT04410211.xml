  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is defined as the act of administrating a sedative drug to produce a state of calm
      or sleep. Sedation is commonly given to a patient in hospital settings to provide a tolerable
      and pleasant experience by relieving anxiety, pain and discomfort, as well as to expedite the
      duration of the procedure. Moderate sedation (conscious sedation) is the preferred state of
      sedation, whereby self-maintenance of ventilation and hemodynamic stability is achieved.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if inhalational Sevoflurane is a more
      superior sedative agent in terms of faster psychomotor recovery and time taken to fulfil
      discharge criteria when compared with intravenous Midazolam sedation.

      Secondary objective is to determine if inhalational Sevoflurane sedation has better patient's
      and endoscopist's satisfaction when compared with intravenous Midazolam sedation.

      A randomized controlled trial study was done on patients undergoing elective upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy in a single tertiary Centre in Malaysia. The study was approved by
      University Malaya Medical Centre medical research ethics committee. All patients gave written
      and informed consent. Patients were fasted, and three psychometric tests were performed as a
      baseline before sedation. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive IV Midazolam
      (Group M) or inhalational Sevoflurane (Group S) via nasal mask. Standard monitoring was
      applied. Patients in Sevoflurane group received the inhalational agent via a nasal mask with
      stepwise increment until and Observed Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale of 3 or maximum
      1.0 minimum alveolar concentration was achieved. Patients in Midazolam group were given a
      stat dose of IV Midazolam 2.5mg. Both groups received 30mcg of IV Fentanyl and lignocaine 1%
      gargle prior to the procedure. The unblinded observer monitored the level of sedation and
      recorded the patient's vital signs. A second blinded observer performed the psychometric
      tests before and at the end of the procedure. He also recorded the time to fulfil discharge
      criteria as well as the satisfaction scores from the patient and endoscopist.

    <masking_description>Patients are randomized to either the Sevoflurane sedation arm or the Midazolam sedation arm based on a randomizer application and the selections are placed in a non-transparent envelope. Once a patient fulfills the eligibility to be recruited in the study, one envelope will be taken to see which arm will the patient be recruited into. Neither the patient nor the investigator will know.
Two investigators will be selected to participate in this study, whereby one of the investigators who will be providing the care will not be masked. The other investigator who assess the pre and post procedure outcome will be masked from knowing which method is used.</masking_description>

    <description>The inhalational anaesthetic agent and oxygen will be delivered via an anaesthetic circuit with a vaporizer (Sevotec 3, Ohmeda, Streeton UK) with a nasal mask.
Patients who are allocated for Sevoflurane will be given initial oxygen flow of 8L/min and then Sevoflurane was introduced at a concentration of 0.2% and was increased stepwise by 02% for every 30s up to a maximum of 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC; 2.05% end tidal). Patient's deepest sedation was recorded and adjusted to achieve optimal Observer's Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation Scale (OAAS) score of 3.
Inadequate or over sedation was treated by reducing or increasing the Sevoflurane concentration dial by 0.2 - 0.6% until the desired effect is reached.
Full vital signs monitoring are done for every participant</description>

    <description>Patients who are allocated for Midazolam will be given the similar nasal mask delivering 8L/min oxygen. However, Sevoflurane will not be introduced to these patients.
Midazolam is titrated slowly to achieve OAAS score of 3 but no more than 2.5mg is to be given within 2 minutes period to patients selected to be in Midazolam group.
Inadequate sedation is treated by giving slow titration of the medication based on the unblinded observer's judgement. Over sedation is treated by withholding the midazolam and continuing oxygen supplementation until the patient returned to the desired sedation level. No other sedative agents are allowed to be given to the patient or else patient will be excluded from this study.</description>
