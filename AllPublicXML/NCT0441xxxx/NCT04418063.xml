  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational case series the investigators would like to investigate wether or not
      the strenuous activity exerted on over head athletic athletes (ie. javelin throwers, discus
      throwers) may incite injury on their shoulders.

      The investigators understood that these athletes had to perform repeated throwing motions and
      yet reports on their effects are very limited. This condition in the long run may contribute
      to injury and affecting performance of the athletes.

      The investigators found that these relationships have not been looked at closely by others
      and largely overshadowed by athletes in other fields; such injury patterns had been described
      in details in baseball pitchers but not in other athletes.

      Description of protocol:

      In this study, the investigators would recruit athletes from the national athletics
      federation training in our city.

      Data collection:

      History taking:

        -  complaints of shoulder stiffness

        -  need for prolonged warm-up

        -  pain

        -  discomfort relating to the shoulders

      Physical examination:

        -  Bilateral shoulder range of motion (internal and external rotation)

        -  Posterior shoulder flexibility test (denotes internal rotation deficit)

        -  Scapular malpositioning, inferior medial border prominence, coracoid pain and
           malposition and dyskinesis of scapular movement (SICK) scapula rating

      Notes: measurements are taken by at least two investigators separately and compared to ensure
      accuracy.

      Results are presented in a table and analysed.
