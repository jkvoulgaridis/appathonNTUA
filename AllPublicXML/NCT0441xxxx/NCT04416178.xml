  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this prospective mixed-method interview study are to use
      semi-structured interviews in parents of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to describe
      parental attitudes of research involving genomic sequencing, including concerns about
      participation and expectations from researchers and to use surveys to quantitatively measure
      genetic/genomic knowledge, trust in health care provider, and literacy/numeracy ability in
      parents of children with SCD and adolescents with SCD.

      Investigators hope to use the results of the planned surveys and interviews to reduce the
      risk of misunderstanding about DNA and genetic research and build strong relationships
      between SCD families and researchers in the future, and to design educational information and
      study materials that will help parents with children with SCD understand important details
      about DNA and genetic research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical gap in knowledge regarding the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of
      parents around clinical research trials involving genomic sequencing of children with sickle
      cell disease (SCD). SCD primarily affects children of African American (Black) race;
      institutionally we have found differences in enrollment on genomic sequencing trials (G4K
      (NCT02530658), PG4KDS) with patients identifying as black more likely to decline enrollment.
      Enrollment on SCCRIP (NCT02098863), a biobank study for children with SCD is high (92.3%),
      indicating that potential genomic research does not appear to concern many families with SCD.
      Given the rising prevalence of clinical research involving genomic sequencing in pediatric
      SCD, coupled with the increasing likelihood that sequencing will be required for enrollment
      on therapeutic drug or gene therapy trials, there is a clear need for research to better
      understand stakeholder concerns and expectations around genomic sequencing in this
      population.

      Parents of children with SCD and adolescent patients will be approached to complete a short
      survey during a routine clinic visit. Survey questions will be administered at the time of
      the informed consent conversation. Those who agree will be given an ipad to complete survey
      items which focus on genetic/genomic knowledge, trust in health care provider, and
      literacy/numeracy ability in parents of children with SCD and adolescents with SCD.
      Participants also have the option to have questions read to them or they can take the survey
      on paper. Completion of the survey is expected to take &lt; 30 minutes. Patient and parent can
      complete surveys simultaneously.

      Of parents completing surveys, a subset will be approached for a private semi-structured
      interview. Participants willing to be interviewed will be interviewed at either the same
      study visit or at a future visit if this is more convenient for the participant.The interview
      guide (member of the study team) will ask questions designed to first assess parental
      perceptions about clinical research then begin to focus on parental attitudes, beliefs, and
      expectations around research involving clinical genomics. Interviews will be conducted
      on-site at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in a private, quiet area. The interview
      should last 30-60 minutes and will be audio recorded.
