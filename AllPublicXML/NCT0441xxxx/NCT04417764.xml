    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
      (TACE)combined with percutaneous transhepatic PD-1 knockout engineered T cell infusion in the
      Paitents with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Blood and tissue samples will also be
      collected for research purposes.

      This is a clinical study to investigate the safety and effect of transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in the Paitents
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. TACE would block the blood supply of the tumor to
      achieve ischemic, hypoxic andnecrotic effects. The PD-1 knockout engineered T cells were also
      prepared from autologous origin using CRISPR Cas9 technology. The patients performed one TACE
      treatment followed by 3 cycles of PD-1 edited T cells by percutaneous infusion in the
      peripheral of tumor under the guide of CT every four weeks. The safety and clinical efficacy
      will be evaluated. biomarkers and immunological markers will be monitored.

    <description>The PD-1 knockout engineered T cells are prepared from autologous origin using CRISPR Cas9 technology. The patients are plan to receive 3 or more cycles of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells infusion by percutaneous fine needle liver puncture with a 4-weeks interval. A total of 1 to 3× 10^9 PD-1 edited T cells will be infused each cycle. Patients continued receiving treatment unless they had unacceptable adverse effects, or progressive disease confirmed by CT or they withdrew consent.</description>
