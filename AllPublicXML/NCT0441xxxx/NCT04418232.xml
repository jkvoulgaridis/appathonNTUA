      The research team will train primary care practitioners from Kansas City clinics to enhance
      skills in cultural competence, dementia detection, treatment and referral to a Health
      Navigator among Latinos 65 and older with dementia. The Health Navigator will provide
      patient/caregiver dyads referred by Alianza Latina providers with care management,
      psychosocial support and links to relevant community resources. Outcomes include feasibility
      and acceptability of 1) PCP training and 2) patient and caregiver dementia care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major cause of mortality and
      disability in later life and cost the US healthcare system more than cancer or heart disease.
      The National Alzheimer's Plan Act and the National Institutes of Health have identified ADRD
      disparities among ethnic minorities as a public health priority. Latinos with ADRD experience
      substantial disparities with reduced rates of early diagnosis and lower quality care compared
      to their non-Latino white peers, which put them at an increased risk for steeper cognitive
      decline, morbidity, mortality and higher caregiver burden. A number of barriers conspire to
      create these disparities including a lack of an evidence-based strategy to address ADRD in
      clinics, patient and primary care provider (PCP) reduced ADRD knowledge, negative attitudes
      regarding ADRD, PCP's lack of time, cultural and language barriers and health insurance
      status. To improve healthcare delivery to Latinos with ADRD, researchers need to redesign
      current ADRD detection and care systems to follow evidence-based recommendations for early
      detection and culturally appropriate chronic care.

      The overall aim of this proposal is to enhance the delivery of ADRD services to Latinos in
      primary care through a scalable systems approach that includes evidence-based
      recommendations. Primary care clinics are the ideal setting to provide ADRD services, as 93%
      of older Latinos have a usual source of healthcare. The novel systems approach (Alianza
      Latina/Latino Alliance) will enhance timely ADRD diagnosis and optimal care to minimize
      behavioral symptoms and cognitive decline among Latinos in a linguistically and
      culturally-appropriate way. Alianza Latina will use the Collaborative Care Framework that
      capitalizes on PCPs and Health Navigators. 1) PCPs will undergo evidence-based training to
      enhance timely and culturally appropriate diagnosis and implement it in their work routine.
      2) PCPs will detect, treat and refer Latino ADRD patients to a bilingual Health Navigator to
      provide chronic care management, which will reduce PCP time burden.

      Aim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability of Alianza Latina. Aim 2.a: The research team
      will train PCPs from Kansas City clinics to enhance skills in cultural competence, ADRD
      detection, treatment and referral to a Health Navigator among Latinos 65 and older with ADRD.
      Aim 2.b. The Health Navigator will provide patients/caregiver dyads referred by Alianza
      Latina PCPs with care management, psychosocial support and links to relevant community
      resources. The research team will assess the feasibility and acceptability of 1) PCP training
      and 2) patient and caregiver ADRD care.

    <description>Brief version of the Neuropsychiatry Inventory Questionnaire: This is a validated clinical instrument for evaluating psychopathology in dementia. If any of the 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms is present, caregivers rate their own distress on a six-point scale (not distressing at all-extreme or very severe distress). For example, if the caregiver responds yes to &quot;is the patient resistive to help from others at times, or hard to handle?&quot;, the following question would follow: &quot;rate the severity of the symptom&quot;. An overall severity summary score is calculated by adding the severity scores of all items and higher scores mean higher severity.</description>

    <description>Short Geriatric Depression Scale: This scale consists of 15 yes vs no questions. Questions from the Long Form GDS which had the highest correlation with depressive symptoms in validation studies were selected for the short version. Of the 15 items, 10 indicated the presence of depression when answered positively, while the rest (question numbers 1, 5, 7, 11, 13) indicated depression when answered negatively. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, depending on age, education, and complaints; 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; and 12-15 indicate severe depression.</description>

Response options include 1(poor), 2(fair), 3(good) and 4 (excellent), for a total score of 13-52, with higher scores indicating better QoL.</description>

Response options include a 4 Likert type scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;nearly every day&quot;. Higher scores mean higher depressive severity.
A PHQ-2 score ranges from 0-6. The authors identified a score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint when using the PHQ-2 to screen for depression</description>

    <ipd_description>The final dataset will include patients' and caregivers' demographic and behavioral data from interviews as well as metrics and feasibility information provided by the primary care providers. Along with the dataset, we will create a code book documenting all variables. Study participants may find their diagnosis information potentially stigmatizing, and may prefer that these diagnoses remain entirely confidential. Although the data analytic files will not have direct identifiers (only study identification numbers), the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with certain clinical characteristics may remain. To safeguard against the unlikely event of deductive disclosure, we will only make the data files and codebook available to other researchers on a case-by-case basis.</ipd_description>
