  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The choice between ultra-congruent (UC) insert or posterior cruciate ligament-stabilized (PS)
      insert in posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) sacrificing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains
      debatable. Despite the potential advantages of the UC insert over PS insert with its
      different design, there are concerns about inferior clinical outcome related to its use.
      Therefore, isokinetic performance was used in this study to objectively evaluate knee
      function after TKA and the clinical scores of the patients were also evaluated. To the best
      of our knowledge, no prospective randomized study has compared the isokinetic performance of
      the knee following the use of UC and PS inserts in TKA. The hypothesis of the present study
      was that compared with the PS insert, the UC insert would be associated with a lower clinical
      outcome and isokinetic performance following TKA.

      A total of 65 patients scheduled to undergo TKA on for primary knee osteoarthritis were
      randomly assigned to either the UC (32 patients) or the PS group (33 patients). The Knee
      Society Score (KSS) and isokinetic performance results of each patient were recorded
      preoperatively and at postoperative 3, 6 and 12 months. The physiatrist performing isokinetic
      tests and patients were blinded to the study.

    <description>The Knee Society Score were applied preoperatively.
The Knee Society Score (KSS) is comprised to two sections (each worth 100 points) for a maximum 200 points. One section is the Knee Society Clinical Score (KSCS) - points are given for pain, motion, and stability and points are deducted for flexion contracture, extension lag, and misalignment. The other section is the Knee Society Functional Score (KSFS) - points are assigned for walking distances and climbing stairs and points are deducted for use of walking aids. For each section, a score of 80-100 = excellent, 70-79 = good; 60-69 = fair; and &lt; 60 = poor.</description>

    <description>Posterior cruciate ligament retention versus sacrificing is one of the main debates in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and retention or sacrificing depends on the individual preference of the surgeon during the surgery. Whenever the surgeon decides to sacrifice the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), another controversial question arises regarding the tibial insert type. While the posterior cruciate ligament-stabilized (PS) insert is widely used as the tibial insert in PCL-sacrificing TKA, it has some disadvantages such as increased polyethylene wear, additional bone resection, breakage of the post and patellar clunk syndrome. The ultra-congruent (UC) insert was designed to prevent bone loss in particular, and the other mentioned disadvantages of the conventional PS insert. However, patients with postoperative hyperextension have been seen to be associated with inferior clinical outcomes and knees become gradually more extended until two years after TKA using the UC insert.</description>
