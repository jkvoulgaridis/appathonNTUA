  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the accuracy of the Respimetrix flow-volume monitoring device in measuring the
      patient's inspiratory capacity as compared to gold-standard measurements of inspiratory
      capacity on pulmonary function testing. Accuracy will be assessed before and after (A)
      pulmonary function testing and before and after (B) the administration of an inhaled
      bronchodilator medication.

      1. Specific Aim #1: Compare the performance of the flow-volume test device to standard
           pulmonary function measurements.

           We hypothesize that measurements of inspiratory capacity with the Respimetrix test
           device will:

           A. Accurately measure the inspiratory capacity as assessed on standard pulmonary
           function tests, and will B. Correlate with other measures of pulmonary function
           including spirometry (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and lung
           volumes (total lung capacity, functional residual capacity and residual volume).

        2. Specific Aim #2: Examine the ability of the flow-volume test device to track changes in
           standard pulmonary function measurements after the administration of an inhaled
           bronchodilator.

      We hypothesize that the Respimetrix test device will:

      A. Accurately measure changes in inspiratory capacity in response to a standard dose of a
      short acting inhaled beta-agonist (4 puffs albuterol), B. Correlate with immediate changes in
      pulmonary function parameters including spirometry (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume
      in 1 second) and lung volumes (total lung capacity, functional residual capacity and residual
      volume).
