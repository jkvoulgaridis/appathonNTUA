  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational pilot study comparing triamcinolone acetonide injections with the
      investigational Med-jet needle-free drug-delivery system as an alternative to using a
      conventional syringe and needle in patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. There will be
      five (5) visits necessary for study participation. The hypothesis is that the efficacy,
      safety, pain tolerance, and quality of life (QoL) metrics of the Med-jet needle-free
      drug-delivery system will be equal to or superior to that of a conventional syringe and
      needle.

    <description>The Med-Jet injector is a novel needle-free drug-delivery system, which we believe may be a solution to the impracticalities of ILTA for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. It uses regulated compressed air as a power source to accelerate an injectable fluid through a 0.005&quot; orifice (6x smaller than a 30G needle) to penetrate the skin and deliver medication to a specific anatomical region.12 The drug-delivery device is highly configurable allowing adjustable depth and volume parameters.12 In addition, the high-performance design allows for triggering multiple injection sites rapidly which is practical when needing to treat large surface areas</description>
