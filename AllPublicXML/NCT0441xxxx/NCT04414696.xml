  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a web-based (eHealth) exercise intervention for
      new moms at increased risk for postpartum depression increases physical activity and
      decreases postpartum depression symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression is a debilitating and costly condition that is associated with
      significant health consequences for mothers and children. Counseling for prevention of
      postpartum depression is currently recommended in women at high risk of postpartum
      depression; however, there is a shortage of mental health care providers. There is a need for
      effective interventions to prevent postpartum depression that can be easily integrated into
      health care systems, yet do not involve intense health care system resources. eHealth
      interventions are promising in this regard.

      Strong evidence suggests physical activity can reduce depression risk. This study will assess
      the effectiveness of an eHealth exercise intervention tailored to postpartum mothers for
      increasing physical activity levels and improving depressive symptoms in women at increased
      risk of postpartum depression. This intervention addresses several identified barriers to
      physical activity in postpartum women. The study will randomize 200 women to receive an
      eHealth exercise intervention for postpartum women or usual postpartum care. Device-based
      physical activity and depressive symptoms will be measured at 3 and 6 months after
      randomization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous measure of depressive symptoms as assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).
PHQ-8 scores range from 0-24. A score of 1-4 suggests minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression and 20-24 severe depression.</description>

    <description>Continuous measure of depressive symptoms as assessed in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).
PHQ-8 scores range from 0-24. A score of 1-4 suggests minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression and 20-24 severe depression.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 months and 3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) asks about sleep quality during the past month, including questions on sleep duration, sleep disturbance, and use of sleep-inducing medications. A global score, ranging from 0 to 21, is calculated using seven components of sleep. Higher scores indicate poorer sleep quality.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mother-infant bonding</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 months and 3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Mother Infant Bonding Scale by Taylor et al will be used to assess mother-infant bonding.
Mother Infant Bonding Scale scores range from 0-24. Higher scores indicate worse mother-infant bonding.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 months and 3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) will be used to assess anxiety.
GAD-7 scores range from 0-21. A score of 1-4 suggests minimal anxiety, 5-9 mild anxiety, 10-14 moderate anxiety, and 15-21 severe anxiety.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 months and 3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10).
PSS-10 scores range from 0-40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. A score of 0-13 suggests low stress, 14-26 moderate stress, and 27-40 high perceived stress.</description>

    <description>Ages and Stages questionnaire for 12-month-old infants.
The ASQ-3 screens for delays in infant and child development in five domains: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal adaptive skills. Scores for each of the five domains range from 0-60 with higher scores indicating typical development.</description>

This eHealth exercise intervention includes over 90, 10-minute exercise videos with options for exercise type, time, and intensity, customized to the weight of the infant. Users can either select up to three 10-minute videos to create a 10 to 30-minute workout or choose a 'Ready Made' workout that is either 10, 20, or 30-minutes long.</description>
