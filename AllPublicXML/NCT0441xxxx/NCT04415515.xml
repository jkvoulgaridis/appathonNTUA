  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Standard Care Coordination (SCC) solution integrates aspects of case management &amp; care
      coordination &amp; was designed by UnitedHealth Group for high-cost, complex, at-risk consumers
      to facilitate health care access and decisions that can have a dramatic impact on the quality
      and affordability of the consumer's health care. Currently members only receive the SCC if
      they are: 1) identified as high risk for readmission upon discharge from the hospital, 2) are
      self-referred, or 3) are directly referred to the program by their physician. The current
      quality improvement study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to determine if the
      expansion of the SCC program to commercially insured members identified via a proprietary
      administrative algorithms as being at high risk would significantly impact rates of acute
      inpatient admissions.
