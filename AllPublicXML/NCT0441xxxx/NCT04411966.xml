  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to investigate the value of 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) and
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
      for early prediction of treatment response and survival in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer after salvage therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled and received PET/CT using 18F-FLT and
      18F-FDG at baseline, after 1st cycle , and after 2nd cycle of systemic chemotherapy. The
      standard reference for treatment response was classified according to Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) after 3
      months of systemic chemotherapy. The metabolic response on PET was assessed according to PET
      response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST) criteria and was correlated to the treatment
      response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

    <measure>Change in 18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) as response to therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post 1-cycle and post 2-cycle (at least 10 days prior to or after systemic chemotherapy, each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The response to therapy would be determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT). The change of SUVmax between the responders and non responders on 18F-FLT and 18F-FDG would be compared.</description>

    <measure>Compare Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORCT) response by 18F-FLT-PET and 18F-FDG-PET for the prediction of anatomic treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post 1-cycle and post 2-cycle (at least 10 days prior to or after systemic chemotherapy, , each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use both EORTC and PERCIST criteria to compare the 18F-FLT-PET and 18F-FDG-PET metabolic response for the predictions of anatomic treatment response. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and comparison were performed to evaluate the performance of 18F-FLT-PET and 18F-FDG-PET in predicting the anatomic treatment response, both with EORTC and PERCIST criteria.</description>
