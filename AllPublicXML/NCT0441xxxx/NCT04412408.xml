        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 12 Months to 12 years

          2. Histologic verification of stage IV high risk neuroblastoma at relapse following lack
             of complete response to at least two lines of therapy

          3. Fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anti-cancer treatment

          4. At least 21 days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if
             prior nitrosourea)

          5. At least 42 days after the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor
             vaccines

          6. At least 56 days must have elapsed after transplant or stem cell infusion; patients
             with prior allogeneic transplants are not eligible

          7. Blood counts recovery including White cell count &gt;= 750/mm^3 and Platelet count &gt;=
             50,000/mm^3

          8. Creatinine clearance ≥ 50ml/min

          9. Liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl, Alanine aminotransferase or Aspartate
             aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 U/dl (or &lt; 5 in case of liver impairment)

         10. Life expectancy of at least 4 months

         11. Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential

         12. Use of an effective contraceptive method during the whole treatment and

         13. up to 3 months after the completion of treatment in males and females

         14. Prior informed consent signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring daily systemic corticosteroids are not eligible; patients must not
             have received systemic corticosteroids within 7 days of enrollment on study

          2. Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible

          3. Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible

          4. Patients with a history of any grade autoimmune disorder are not eligible;
             asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities (e.g. antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid
             factor, altered thyroid function studies) will not render a patient ineligible in the
             absence of a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder

          5. Patients with &gt;= grade 2 hypothyroidism due to history of autoimmunity are not
             eligible; note: hypothyroidism due to previous irradiation on thyroidectomy will not
             impact eligibility

          6. Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          7. Patients with active autoimmune disease. (any autoimmune state requiring medical
             treatment-including chronic medications)all immune modifying drugs should be stopped
             at least 7 days prior to enrollment
