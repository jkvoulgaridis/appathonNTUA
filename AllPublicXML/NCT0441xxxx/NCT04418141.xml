  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first-in-human clinical trial of CN1 to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and preliminary efficacy of CN1 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors or B-cell lymphoma. This study will provide a basis for further clinical development
      of CN1.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CN1 could promote T cell activation and cytokine secretion, thereby enhancing the function of
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and could also regulate Treg cells, thus CN1 is considered to enhance
      the anti-tumor immune response and have potential antitumor activity.

      In this multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I study six dose levels are planned.
      Participants will receive CN1 by IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle (every 3 weeks). After
      completion of treatment cycles, the participant will be assessed by the Principal
      Investigator and/or Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).
