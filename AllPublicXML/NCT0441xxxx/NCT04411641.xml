      Primary Objective:

      To determine the efficacy of SAR442168 compared to placebo in delaying disability progression
      in NRSPMS

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate efficacy of SAR442168 compared to placebo on clinical endpoints, magnetic
      resonsnce imaging (MRI) lesions, cognitive performance, physical function, and quality of
      life To evaluate safety and tolerability of SAR442168 To evaluate population pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of SAR442168 in NRSPMS and its relationship to efficacy and safety To evaluate
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of SAR442168
