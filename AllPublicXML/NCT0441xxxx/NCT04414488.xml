  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basic aspects of thoracic anaesthesia are general anesthesia often combined with regional
      anesthesia, intubation with double lumen tube and separation of lung ventilation. Proper
      assessment of pain and adequate analgesia in intraoperative and postoperative period is a
      challenging issue for medical practitioners. Intraoperative trauma may lead to many metabolic
      implications and disturbance of haemostasis, what can be reflected in change of blood and
      saliva hormone and other substance levels. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of
      regional anesthesia on hormone levels in patients requiring videothoracoscopic procedures.

      Basic aspects of thoracic anaesthesia are general anesthesia often combined with regional
      anesthesia, intubation with double lumen tube and separation of lung ventilation. Proper
      assessment of pain and adequate analgesia in intraoperative and postoperative period is a
      challenging issue for medical practitioners. Intraoperative trauma may lead to many metabolic
      implications and disturbance of haemostasis, what can be reflected in change of blood and
      saliva hormone and other substance levels, such as alpha-amylase, cortisol, testosterone,
      secretory IgA, β-endorphin, nerve growth factor, calcitonin gene-related protein and P
      substance. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of regional anesthesia on hormone
      levels in postoperative period. Saliva was collected from participants in order to perform
      laboratory tests, using a special disposable Salivette tube (Sarstedt AG &amp; Co, Germany).
      Saliva was collected by placing a sterile tampon under the tongue or chewing for 30-45
      seconds. The soaked saliva pad was then placed in a suspended insert with a perforated
      bottom. The insert with a tampon was placed in a centrifuge tube and closed with a stopper.
      Next the tube was centrifuged (1000 x g for 10 min.) to obtain a ready to test saliva
      supernatant. Approximately 0,7 ml of the supernatant from every sample collected was used for
      further testing. Samples were frozen after centrifugation at - 85°C until performing
      laboratory tests. Blood was collected for laboratory tests from the ulnar vein. Blood for
      testing was collected using disposable equipment in a volume of 5ml into a tube containing
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and aprotinin. Next the tube was centrifuged (1000 x g
      for 5 min.). After centrifugation and separation of morphotic elements, the obtained plasma
      was divided into two tubes and frozen at - 85°C until performing laboratory tests.

The reaction was performed in pH 6,0 MES buffer at 37 ° C rendering a colored reaction product. The product was then analyzed via spectrophotometry at 405 nm. Results are presented in salivary α-amylase activity units (U/ml). Measurement imprecision of the method was 4.1%. Material was collected after enrollment to the study (T0), six hours after the surgery (T1) and 24 hours after the surgery (T2).</description>

    <description>General anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.1 mg*kg-1, propofol 2 mg*kg-1, cisatracurium 0.15 mg*kg-1 and fentanyl 1.5 µg*kg-1. Anaesthesia was maintained with one minimal alveolar concentration sevoflurane. Fractional doses of fentanyl 1-3 µg*kg-1 were administered if heart rate or mean blood pressure rose more than 20% above the base-line value obtained just before surgery commenced. After surgery, if a patient complained of pain then she/he was given i.v. oxycodone by an anaesthetist before commencing the patient controlled analgesia (PCA). The PCA solution was oxycodone (1mg*ml-1) and the PCA was programmed to allow a self-administered bolus dose of 1mg oxycodone with a lockout time of 5 min. During the night, basal rate oxycodone was 2-4 mg per hour. Additionally, patients were given 1g intravenous paracetamol every 6h and 100mg of intravenous ketoprofen every 12h, if required.</description>

    <description>Before induction of general anesthesia thoracic paravertebral block was performed.

    <intervention_name>Thoracic paravertebral block (ThPVB)</intervention_name>
    <description>Before the induction of general anaesthesia a single-shot ThPVB was performed at the Th3 to Th4 level, approximately, 2.5 to 3 cm lateral to tip of a spinous process. A preblock ultrasound examination was undertaken to assess the depth of the transverse process and the pleura. An insulated 10 cm long needle was used and this was connected to a peripheral nerve stimulator with a set current of 2.5 milliampere(mA). The current was gradually reduced as the needle was inserted until the appearance of visible intercostal muscles activity with a current of 0.3 to 0.5mA (paravertebral space identification). Plain bupivacaine (0.3 ml*kg-1) was then injected after a negative aspiration test for air or blood. The efficacy of the blockade to cold was checked after 20 min with a plastic ampoule of saline kept in the freezer. Testing was symmetrical on both sides of thorax. A difference in sensation to cold between the blocked and unblocked sides was taken to indicate an effective block.</description>
