  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of programmed exercise combined with CFTR protein
      modulator drugs in the cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, functional capacity and agility
      in a group of young patients with Cystic Fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a new clinical trial that extends our previous work intended to assess
      the effect of programmed exercise with or without electrical stimulation on cardiorespiratory
      fitness, strength, functional capacity and agility in a group of young patients with Cystic
      Fibrosis (ECOMIRIN) registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04153669).

      After finishing the study, a subset of the participants was treated with either TEZ/IVA or
      LUM/IVA per standard of care, as they were considered candidates according to the AEMPS
      (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2019-000833-37/ES). Those patients
      are expected to complete five months of pharmacological treatment without exercise by June
      2020.

      Primary Objective To evaluate the effect of an exercise program on physical fitness in cystic
      fibrosis patients after 5 months of administration of LUM/IVA or TEZ/IVA in comparison to the
      effect produced by the same exercise program before administration of the drug.

      Secondary Objectives Other specific objectives include comparing the beneficial effects of
      exercise and LUM/IVA or TEZ/IVA on: 1) cardiorespiratory function and muscle strength; 2) the
      concentration of chlorine in sweat; and 3) quality of life.
