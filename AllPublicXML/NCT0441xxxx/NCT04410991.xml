      Primary Objective:

      To assess efficacy of daily SAR442168 compared to a daily dose of 14 mg teriflunomide
      (Aubagio) measured by annualized adjudicated relapse rate (ARR) in participants with
      relapsing forms of MS

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess efficacy of SAR442168 compared to teriflunomide (Aubagio) on disability
      progression, MRI lesions, cognitive performance and quality of life To evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of daily SAR442168 To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) of SAR442168

             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies

          -  Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during

          -  Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below

          -  Agree to use a male condom and should also be advised of the benefit for a female
             partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or
             leak when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who
             is not currently pregnant

             - A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions apply:

          -  Is not a WOCBP OR

          -  Is a WOCBP and agrees to use a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year), preferably with low user dependency during the
             intervention period and until accelerated elimination procedure is completed (or for
             at least 10 days after the last dose of SAR442168, if the case was unblinded) and
             agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during the

                  required by local regulations) within the screening period before the first dose
                  of study intervention.

               -  If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a
                  serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded
                  from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.

               -  The Investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history,

                  study, as judged by the Investigator

               -  A requirement for concomitant treatment that could bias the primary evaluation

             conditions that would adversely affect participation in this study

          -  At screening, the participant is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and/or

          -  The participant has any of the following:

               -  A bleeding disorder or known platelet dysfunction at any time prior to the
                  screening visit

          -  The participant has a lymphocyte count below the lower limit of normal (LLN) at the
             screening visit

          -  The presence of psychiatric disturbance or substance abuse

          -  Prior/concomitant therapy

          -  The participant is receiving strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A
