  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of SAR442720 in combination with
           pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors including NSCLC who progressed on
           anti-PD-1/PD L1 containing therapy and advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) after
           progression to all standard of care (SOC) therapy

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the
           combination of SAR442720 and pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To document the pharmacokinetic (PK) of SAR442720 in combination with pembrolizumab and
           to document the PK of pembrolizumab in combination with SAR442720

        -  To estimate the anti-tumor effects of SAR442720 in combination with pembrolizumab in all
           participants

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label Phase 1 multicenter study is designed to evaluate the safety and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR442720 in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with solid tumors.

      The expected duration of study intervention for participants may vary, based on progression
      date; median expected duration of study per participant is estimated to be about 10 months
      (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 6 months for treatment, and a median of 3 months
      for long term follow-up).
