  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During surgery, researchers use different methods in respiratory equipment. In the study
      researchers examine the effects of these methods on intraocular pressure changes by looking
      at the intraocular nerve diameter. Then look at the effects of these effects on patients
      conscious functions by asking some questions.

      According to the mechanical ventilator application to be applied to the patients; Group P (n:
      30) pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), Group V (n: 30) volume controlled ventilation
      (VCV) are randomly assigned to two groups. General anesthesia will be applied to all
      patients. Mechanical ventilation settings will be able to 8ml / kg TV (tidal volume).
      Demographic data (age, gender, weight, height) of patients, duration of surgery and
      peroperative complications will be recorded choosen time intervals.T0: awake, T1: 5th min
      after induction, T2: Gas insufflation start in supine position, T3: Maximum gas pressure is
      reached in reverse trendelenburg position, T4:Before extubation. SAB, DAB, OAB, KAH, SpO2,
      Ppeek, PEEP, EtCO2, optic nerve diameter will be recorded at same times. Cognitive function
      test will be performed at postoperative 24th hour for comparing the first awaken routin MMDT
      (Mini Mental Status Detection) scale. The same test will be repeated for patients who are
      called for routine general surgery outpatient control 3 months after surgery.

    <description>Optic nerve sheath diameter; It was measured from the optic nerve sheath 3 mm behind the optic disc from the closed upper eyelid. T0: Awake, T1: 5th minute after induction, T2: Gas insufflation start in supine position, T3: Maximum gas pressure is reached in reverse trendelenburg position, T4: Before extubation in supine position. A typical optic nerve sheath is generally less than 5 mm in diameter and diameters greater than 5.5 mm predict an ICP of &gt;20 cmH2O .</description>

    <description>In optic nerve diameter measurements; A layer of water-soluble sterile gel was applied to the closed upper eyelid. The linear 10-5 MHz ultrasound probe was carefully placed on the upper eyelid over the gel. The entrance of the optic nerve to the orbital globe in 2D mode was displayed on the monitor without applying too much pressure. After finding the optimal contrast between the retrobulbar echogenic fat tissue and vertical hypoechoic band 23, the diameter of the optic nerve sheath was measured 3 mm behind the optic disc using an electronic caliper.</description>
