  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe brain injury (sTBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term disability and is
      considered the most frequent cause of mortality and serious disability in young adults in
      industrialized countries. It is defined as an alteration of brain function with loss of
      consciousness in the acute phase for at least 24 hours (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt;8) and it
      can induce a wide range of deficit, including cognitive-behavioural, motors, psychics,
      language, vision, coordination and balance impairments. Chronic vestibular symptoms such as
      dizziness and balance deficits (both static and dynamic postural instability) are present in
      patients with brain injury. These aspects can cause functions limitation and psychological
      distress, negatively impacting negatively on subjects' quality of life and social
      reintegration and are considered unfavourable prognostic factors of the recovery process. The
      literature supports the use of vestibular rehabilitation techniques in patients with mild and
      moderate brain injury, however, to date, no studies investigated the effect of vestibular
      rehabilitation in sTBI patients. The main aim of this randomized controlled trail is to
      verify the effect of a personalized vestibular training on balance and gait disorders in sTBI
      patients.

    <description>VR consisted of two types of exercises, i.e., those for gaze stability and those for postural stability
Gaze stability exercises The patients will perform the exercises while holding their gaze on a firm target (VORx1) during active horizontal and vertical head movements (one minute for each axis).
Postural stability exercises March in Place Each patient will ask to get on a foam cushion of 10 cm in height and then will blindfold. Treadmill Training As preparation for training, all subjects underwent a 1-minute walk on treadmill with open eyes using preferred walking speed. Immediately after preparation, patients will blindfold and will ask to walk on treadmill without support of hands for 4 minutes.
When patients made the mistake of changing direction, the physiotherapist help them to keep the right position using verbal cues (e.g., you are turning left or right).</description>
