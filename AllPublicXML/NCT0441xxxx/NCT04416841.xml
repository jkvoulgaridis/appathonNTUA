  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is expected to rise to 439 million in 2030,
      accounting for 7.7% the population in the world. There are nearly 10 million T2DM patients
      with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among people over 65 years old , accounting for about 8%
      of the people over 65 years old in China. The medical cost for patients with T2DM/MCI is 2.5
      to 4 times higher than those without T2DM. And T2DM will increase the risk of cognitive
      impairment, and lead to various complications which will bring serious social and medical
      economic burden.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is critically important to identify effective treatments to enhance functional status of
      T2DM/MCI patients. Exercise has been shown to be beneficial for T2DM/MCI patients. As a
      Chinese traditional mind-body exercise that consists of both physical and mediation
      components, Tai Chi Chuan has been proved to be helpful in global cognition, memory,
      executive function and attention of MCI, and blood sugar of T2DM. However, the evidence of
      the effect of Tai Chi Chuan on T2DM/MCI patients is limited. The purpose of this study is to
      explore the effect of Tai Chi Chuan treating T2DM/MCI patients in cognitive function,
      balance, motor and sensation function, blood sugar, biochemistry profile and quality of life.
