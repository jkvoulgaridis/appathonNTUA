      The purpose of this trial is to collect clinical outcomes including radiographic and CT
      outcomes in patients who undergo spinal fusion using the Keos Lumbar Interbody Fusion Device.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-comparative, single-center, post-market trial will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the PEEK-OPTIMA ™ HA Enhanced Keos Lumbar Interbody Fusion Device in patients
      suffering from degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis and retrolisthesis in the lumbar
      spine. The trial will capture clinical outcomes, radiographic and CT outcomes over a 24 month
      period post operatively. One centre will be involved in the recruitment of 30 patients the
      clinic involved will focus on this type of treatment.

    <description>Questionnaire SF-12 collection of questions health related to assess vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, emotional and physical functioning, social and mental health. Patients will pick from a set list of answers for each health related question. The responses on each item are scored and summarised into Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) and range from 0-100. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e.a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
