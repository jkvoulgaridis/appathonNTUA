        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          2. Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          3. BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          4. Body weight of 65 - 100 kg (inclusive) at screening

          5. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          5. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          6. Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          7. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          8. Chronic or relevant acute infections

          9. History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity Further exclusion criteria apply.

    <ipd_description>Clinical studies sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim, phases I to IV, interventional and non‐interventional, are in scope for sharing of the raw clinical study data and clinical study documents, except for the following exclusions:
1. studies in products where Boehringer Ingelheim is not the license holder; 2. studies regarding pharmaceutical formulations and associated analytical methods, and studies pertinent to pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials; 3. studies conducted in a single center or targeting rare diseases (because of limitations with anonymization).
