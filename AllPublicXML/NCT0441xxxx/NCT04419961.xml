  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual dysfunction is common in pregnant women (46.6%, 34.4%, and 73.3% in women in the
      first, second, and third trimester worldwide, respectively). These dysfunctions can persist
      after childbirth, affecting quality of life, marriage satisfaction, and family happiness. In
      Vietnam, a country heavily influenced by the Eastern traditions, sexual activity is
      considered private and only shared between husband and wife. Many women have wrong beliefs
      that having sexual intercouse during pregnancy will affect the safety of the fetus, and thus,
      are reluctant to engage in sexual activity with their husband. Interventions have been
      developed to improve the quality of sexual function in pregnant women.

      In Vietnam, data of sexual dysfunction in pregnant women are somewhat limited, and there have
      been no programs to improve the sexual function for this population. Therefore, the study
      team plans to develop an educational program with aim to improve the quality of sexual
      function in Vietnamese pregnant women. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and
      associated factors of sexual dysfunction in first-trimester pregnant women and evaluate the
      effectiveness of the educational program.

    <measure>Prevalence of sexual dysfunction in pregnant women</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual function is evaluated using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The FSFI includes 19 questions covering six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Questions ask about participant's sexual experience during the past four weeks, rating the degree/frequency of their experience on a scale from &quot;not at all&quot; or &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very&quot; or &quot;always&quot;. Four questions score 1-5 and fifteen score 0-5. Then, the scores of questions in an individual domain are added and the total score is multiplied by the domain factor. Finally, the six domain scores are added to obtain the full scale score. A total FSFI score of &lt;= 26.55 is considered sexual dysfunction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the FSFI score from baseline to two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Two months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are followed up after two months and repeated the FSFI. The difference between the baseline total FSFI score and the two-month total FSFI score is calculated. The mean difference is calculated for the intervention and the control arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knowledge and attitude at two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Two months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge and attitude are assessed by asking participants whether they agree or disagree with 24 statements. These statements are developed based on the key messages of the educational program. K/A assessment is repeated at two months. We calculate the proportion of participants who have changes in knowledge and attitude after the educational program.</description>

    <description>The educational program includes a group discussion and a booklet.
The group discussion lasts for 90 minutes, discussing importance of sexual activity during pregnancy, improving sexual experience during pregnancy, physical and mental changes of pregnant women, and measures to cope with discomfort, anxiety, fear and other issues. It includes a 30-minutes presentation, followed by 1-hour discussion.
The booklet is a color-printed A5-size booklet containing in-depth information of the content given during the discussion. Each participant can only receive one copy of the booklet, and the booklet is not given to the control participants.</description>
