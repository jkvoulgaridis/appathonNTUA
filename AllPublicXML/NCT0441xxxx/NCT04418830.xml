  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of NuVasive interbody
      implants when used during thoracic and/or lumbar spine surgery as measured by reported
      complications, radiographic outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. This study is being
      undertaken to identify possible residual risks and to clarify mid- to long-term clinical
      performance that may affect the benefit/risk ratios of these interbody implants.

      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of select interbody implant devices in patients who undergo interbody fusion
      surgery. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked
      to consent to participate in the study. These patients will present with degenerative
      conditions in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and
      will be screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled into the study, subjects will
      undergo interbody fusion surgery using one of the NuVasive interbody implant groups based on
      the surgeon's standard of care. At least 900 subjects (a minimum of 75 patients in each
      implant group) will be enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after the surgery.
