  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad goals of our pilot study are to (1) determine whether psychodynamic psychotherapy
      for psychosis (PPfP), relative to treatment as usual (TaU), can maintain or augment clinical
      and functional benefits for patients who have achieved initial recovery in our coordinated
      specialty care (CSC) early psychosis treatment program; (2) to conduct novel empirical study
      of how various psychodynamic factors may inform candidate selection, mediate therapeutic
      effects, and influence relational aspects of the therapy; and (3) to conduct a detailed study
      of how features of therapist and patient speech and behavior influence therapeutic outcomes,
      therapeutic alliance alliance, and relational process. This registration focuses on the first
      goal.
