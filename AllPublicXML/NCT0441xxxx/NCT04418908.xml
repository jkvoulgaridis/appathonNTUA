  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study planned to learn more about women and how the drop in estradiol levels during
      menopause may affect their cardiovascular risk. With aging, the arteries that are located
      around the heart get stiffer, and this increase in arterial stiffness can lead to a number of
      health problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease. In this study, the
      investigators examined whether a short-term drop in estrogen levels caused arteries to become
      stiffer, and explored potential reasons for stiffening arteries.

      Participants completed two study visits. The baseline study visit occurred during the early
      follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, confirmed via take-home ovulation testing. On the
      day of the baseline study visit, all participants underwent ovarian sex hormone suppression
      with GnRHant therapy (cetrorelix acetate, 0.25 mg/day) delivered daily as subcutaneous
      injections for a 1-week period. Participants were randomized to one of two concurrent
      intervention groups: transdermal estradiol patch (0.075 mg/day) (+E2) or placebo patch (+PL)
      and returned for a follow-up visit after 1 week of the intervention. Both study visits
      included collection of anthropometric measures, a fasting blood sample, measures of arterial
      stiffness, flow-mediated dilation, and endothelial cells via an intravenous catheter.
