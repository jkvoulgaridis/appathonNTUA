      Evaluation of clinical characteristics and pharmacotherapy of hospitalized Polish patients
      with atrial fibrillation (AF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia associated with increased cardiovascular
      mortality. An important element of management of patients with AF is anticoagulation to
      prevent thromboembolic events. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K
      antagonists (VKAs) are two main drugs groups used in thromboembolic events prevention.

      Primary objective of the study is to assess the frequency of VKAs vs NOACs prescription in AF
      patients treatment of with OACs.

      Secondary objective of the study are as follows: assessment of the frequency of
      appropriate/inappropriate OACs prescription in AF patients and assesment of the number of
      patients with AF treated with apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban with high thromboembolism
      risk according to CHA2DS2-VASc score.

      The POL-AF Registry is a multicenter prospective analysis of hospital records of patients
      with AF managed in ten cardiology centers.

      Collected data will include demographics, type of AF (valvular and non-valvular, as well as
      paroxysmal, persistent and permanent), medical history, laboratory tests, echocardiographic
      parameters and concomitant medications.

      Each patient will be evaluated regarding to common scales assessing risk of thromboembolic
      (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for
      bleeding in anticoagulated patients basing on the current guidelines for AF treatment)
      events.

    <measure>Number of patients with AF treated with apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban with high thromboembolism risk according to CHA2DS2-VASc (heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism, vascular disease and sex) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study completion, an average of 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The CHA2DS2-VAS score includes the following factors: heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism, vascular disease and sex.
According to the CHA2DS2-VAS score, high thromboembolic risk means 2 points in men, 3 points in women.
Data on the components of CHA2DS2-VASC are obtained from medical records.</description>
