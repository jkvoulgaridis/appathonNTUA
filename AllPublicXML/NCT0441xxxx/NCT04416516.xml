      The primary objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of intralesional ASN-002 when administered in
           combination with oral vismodegib in patients with Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCC)s;

        2. Evaluate the efficacy of intralesional ASN-002 in target tumours when administered in
           combination with oral vismodegib in patients with BCCs.

      The secondary objective is to:

      1) Evaluate the efficacy of intralesional ASN-002 in non-target tumours when administered in
      combination with oral vismodegib in patients with BCCs.

      The exploratory objective is to:

      1) Evaluate immunological biomarkers during the course of treatment.

      Methodology:

      This study will evaluate ASN-002 (in the dose range 0.5 to 1.5x10(11) vp/mL) with the Hh
      inhibitor vismodegib (Erivedge®). The study will initially evaluate two Arms receiving 1.0 x
      10(11) vp/injection, and following a safety review, may implement further arms in an adaptive
      study design.

      Following screening and baseline biopsies for target and non-target tumours, eligible
      subjects will be enrolled in the study.

      Cycle 1: Treatment with vismodegib (daily dose of 150 mg) for 4 weeks and ASN-002 for 3 weeks
      (i.e., three ASN-002 injections in total):

        -  Day 1 to Day 14 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 15 - vismodegib and ASN-002

        -  Day 16 to Day 21 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 22 - vismodegib and ASN-002

        -  Day 23 to Day 28 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 29 - ASN-002 alone

      Clinical response will be assessed at Week 17, following which, the investigator may where
      clinically indicated, initiate Cycle 2.

      Cycle 2: Treatment with vismodegib (daily dose of 150 mg) for 4 weeks, and one further
      injection with ASN-002:

        -  Day 1 to Day 7 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 8 - vismodegib and ASN-002

        -  Day 9 to Day 28 - vismodegib alone

      Surgical excision for all patients will occur between Week 25 and Week 33 at the
      investigators discretion, and dependent on when patient completed study treatment (1 or 2
      treatment cycles). Up to 10 BCCs to be excised including 3 target tumours. Excisions can be
      conducted over 2 visits as per Investigator's discretion.

      The Investigator may enrol eligible patients parallel into either Arm 1 or Arm 2, based on
      the number of tumours present. Up to 10 study BCC tumours (up to 3 target and up to 7
      non-target) will be selected per patient.

      Following review of at least Week 5 data for N=6 patients in Arm 1 and Arm 2, further Arms
      with varying doses of ASN-002 (in the dose range 0.5x10(11) vp or 1.5x10(11) vp) may be
      explored at the discretion of the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Vismodegib or ASN-002 may be
      evaluated as monotherapies to provide control groups to allow comparison of treatment Arms.

      Safety and clinical assessments will be performed at Weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 17, 25 to 33.

      Histological response will be evaluated in all study tumours via excision between Week 25 and
      Week 33 (as per investigator's discretion).

      Six patients will be recruited to each Arm of the study, each Arm may be expanded to 12
      patients at the discretion of the SRC.

    <intervention_name>ASN-002</intervention_name>
    <description>ASN-002 has been designed for clinical applications, especially for intratumoral administration in the treatment of various cancers. This rAd vector delivers the gene of interest, in the case of ASN-002 the human IFNγ gene, into target cells. The rAd vector in ASN-002 is replication deficient and although it infects cells, it is not able to replicate in the tumor or in normal human cells. The infected cells are able to transcribe and translate the IFNγ DNA leading to a sustained local concentration of IFNγ in the tumor mass that is designed to avoid high levels of systemic IFNγ that may be lead to unacceptable toxicity.</description>

             (refer to study procedure manual for biopsy size selection) from the thickest part of
             all the target tumours is required for histological confirmation of BCC and to exclude
             BCC non-eligible subtypes.

             Note: If a patient has mix of nodular and superficial BCC tumours, at least one target
             tumour should be a nodular BCC.

          2. Removal of &lt; 25% of the area of each biopsied tumour by initial biopsy performed 1-12

             the investigator may re-biopsy the tumour, provided not &gt; 25% of the area of the
             original tumour is removed. Non-study tumours may be resected or treated at the
