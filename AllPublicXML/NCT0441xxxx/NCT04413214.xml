      The trial is a study conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics of
      Carrimycin tablet and measure its anti-tumor efficacy initially in the treatment of patients
      with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (non
      NPC).

      This study is a prospective open phase-I study to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK
      characteristics of Carrimycin tablet in the treatment of patients with locally advanced,
      recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (non NPC). The 3x3 dose
      escalation design will be adopted, including 200mg, 400mg and 600mg of Carrimycin; and three
      subjects at each dose level initially. If there is no DLT in the dose level of 200mg, the
      dose level of 400mg will be followed; if there is one DLT in the dose level of 200mg, another
      three patients will be added in the dose level of 200mg; if there is no DLT occurs in the
      another three patients, the dose level of 400mg will also be followed; if there is one DLT in
      the another three patients, the trial will be closed. The same condition to the dose level of
      400mg and 600mg. If a patient fails to receive the full prescribed dose for reasons other
      than DLT at the time of the first administration, the patient will be replaced. Carrimycin
      treatment to the patients with DLT will be discontinued immediately and they will enter the
      follow-up period and will not be replaced. The study consists of screening period, treatment
      period and follow-up period. The treatment period continues until the patients develop
      progressive disease, dies, lost to follow-up or withdraw informed consent.
