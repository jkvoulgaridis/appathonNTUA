      The primary objective of this proposal is to compare a moderate or high intensity exercise
      intervention to improve physical function in persons aging with HIV. Both HIV-infected and
      HIV-uninfected older adults will be assigned to a moderate intensity cardiovascular and
      resistance training intervention for 12 weeks, and then randomized to either continue
      moderate intensity exercise, or increase to high intensity exercise for an additional 12
      weeks. The primary outcome is the impact of exercise on physical function, as measured by the
      overall score of a modified Short Physical Performance Battery (mSPPB) and the chair rise
      time from the mSPPB. The secondary outcomes include changes in insulin-like growth factor-1
      (systemic and local) and inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor
      receptors 1 and 2 (sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2)).

Participants with diabetes had hemoglobin A1c of 7.5% or less; sex hormone supplementation was restricted to stable, physiologic doses for ≥3 months prior to study entry and intramuscular testosterone was excluded.

At week 12, VO2 max measurements were repeated and participants were randomized to either continue moderate-intensity exercise or advance to high-intensity (60-70% of week 13 VO2 max and &gt;80% 1-RM) for the remaining 12 weeks.</description>

          <title>HIV-uninfected Controls</title>
          <description>All participants were aged 50 to 75 years, sedentary (&lt;60 minutes of physical activity each week for 6 months preceding by self-report), had a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 40 kg/m2, and had no contraindications to initiating an exercise regimen (e.g., severe mobility limitation, unstable angina, supplemental oxygen requirement, uncontrolled hypertension). Participants with diabetes had hemoglobin A1c of 7.5% or less; sex hormone supplementation was restricted to stable, physiologic doses for ≥3 months prior to study entry and intramuscular testosterone was excluded. PLWH were on stable ART with an undetectable HIV-1 RNA for &gt;2 years and a CD4 T-cell count &gt;200 cells/µL.
At week 12, VO2 max measurements were repeated and participants were randomized to either continue moderate-intensity exercise (40-50% VO2 max and 60-70% 1-RM) or advance to high-intensity (60-70% of week 13 VO2 max and &gt;80% 1-RM) for the remaining 12 weeks.</description>
