  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain initial safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      efficacy information on SPD489 in preschool children 4-5 years old who are diagnosed with
      ADHD. Generating such data will provide data on the use of SPD489 in the preschool ADHD
      population.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) at the Specified Dose Level</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment up to safety follow-up (Week 9)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An AE was considered treatment-emergent if it had a start date on or after, or had a start date before but increased in severity after the first dose of investigational product.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sleep Patterns Assessed by Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire at Week 8 / End of Treatment (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8/ET</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire is a tool designed to screen the most common sleep problems in children, and consists of 33 items for scoring. The instrument evaluates the child's sleep based on behavior within 8 different subscales: bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night walkings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness. Each item receives a score from 1 (problem occurs rarely) to 3 (problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: bedtime resistance: 6 to 18, sleep onset delay: 1 to 3, sleep duration: 3 to 9, sleep anxiety: 4 to 12, night walkings: 3 to 9, parasomnias: 7 to 21, sleep-disordered breathing: 3 to 9, daytime sleepiness: 8 to 24, and total disturbance (items from all scales): 33 to 99.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Suicide Related Behavior Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale Questionnaire (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8/ET</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answer to the first 2 ideation questions was &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;No,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) Preschool Version Total Score at FoTA (Final on Treatment Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, FoTA</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version is an 18-item questionnaire that requires the respondent to rate the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Data presented here was analysed at Final on-Treatment Assessment (FoTA).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>FoTA</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I was performed to rate the severity of a participant's condition on a 7-point scale (1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; or 7=very much worse). Data presented here was analysed at Final on-Treatment Assessment (FoTA). Improved is defined as a score of &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 7 [Dose Maintenance Phase] at pre-dose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC 0-last is the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration of SPD489 in plasma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were compared against the study NRP104-201 (NCT00557011) to observe and compare the effects of SPD489.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An AE was considered treatment-emergent if it had a start date on or after, or had a start date before but increased in severity after the first dose of investigational product.</description>

        <title>Change in Sleep Patterns Assessed by Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire at Week 8 / End of Treatment (ET)</title>
        <description>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire is a tool designed to screen the most common sleep problems in children, and consists of 33 items for scoring. The instrument evaluates the child's sleep based on behavior within 8 different subscales: bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night walkings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness. Each item receives a score from 1 (problem occurs rarely) to 3 (problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: bedtime resistance: 6 to 18, sleep onset delay: 1 to 3, sleep duration: 3 to 9, sleep anxiety: 4 to 12, night walkings: 3 to 9, parasomnias: 7 to 21, sleep-disordered breathing: 3 to 9, daytime sleepiness: 8 to 24, and total disturbance (items from all scales): 33 to 99.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicide Related Behavior Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale Questionnaire (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answer to the first 2 ideation questions was &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;No,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version is an 18-item questionnaire that requires the respondent to rate the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Data presented here was analysed at Final on-Treatment Assessment (FoTA).</description>
