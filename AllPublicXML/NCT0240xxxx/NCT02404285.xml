    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week, multi-site, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in subjects with mild
      to moderate facial acne. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to apply either topical NAG or
      vehicle gel daily. Subjects will be evaluated for clinical acne and quality of life outcomes
      at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.

      Sample Size: N= 60 completed subjects Male and female subjects 12 years or older diagnosed
      with mild to moderate inflammatory facial acne vulgaris.

      Subjects will be treated with once daily topical NAG or matching vehicle and will attend
      screening, randomization, 2,4,8 and 12 week visits. The following will be assessed:

        1. Lesion counts with photography

        2. Investigator Global Assessment

        3. Acne Quality of Life Questionnaire

        4. Treatment Area Assessment by Investigator

      Subjects will discontinue all baseline topical acne treatments with a 2 week washout and/or
      all systemic acne treatments with a 3 week washout. All subjects will be provided open label
      Cetaphil facial cleanser and double-blind NAG or vehicle product.

    <description>Change in Self Perception scores with daily use of NAG compared with vehicle after 12-weeks. The Acne Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire Form was used to determine the practical improvements in quality of life. The Acne-QoL form is a validated measure that contains 19 questions referring to the past week, organized into four area: self-perception, role-social, role-emotional, and acne symptoms. Each question gauges how much acne affects the subject, with answers ranging from 0 (extremely) to 6 (not at all). Domain scores are calculated by taking the average scores within each domain, with high scores reflecting better QoL determination. The number of subjects with a negative score for each quality of life region was determined at each time-point. Those with a negative score, were those with a score of 3.5 or less, indicating that the disease was having a meaningful effect on their lives.</description>

        <description>Change in Self Perception scores with daily use of NAG compared with vehicle after 12-weeks. The Acne Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire Form was used to determine the practical improvements in quality of life. The Acne-QoL form is a validated measure that contains 19 questions referring to the past week, organized into four area: self-perception, role-social, role-emotional, and acne symptoms. Each question gauges how much acne affects the subject, with answers ranging from 0 (extremely) to 6 (not at all). Domain scores are calculated by taking the average scores within each domain, with high scores reflecting better QoL determination. The number of subjects with a negative score for each quality of life region was determined at each time-point. Those with a negative score, were those with a score of 3.5 or less, indicating that the disease was having a meaningful effect on their lives.</description>

Next Science Acne Gel: Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin layer of the product to the entire face every evening after washing with Cetaphil cleanser and gently patting the skin dry. Product should not be applied around the eyes or near the mucous membranes. No other acne treatments will be applied to the face during study participation. Hands should be washed following application of study gel.</description>

          <title>Change in Quality of Life - Role Social With Daily Use of NAG Compared With Vehicle After 12-weeks.</title>
          <description>Change in subjects social response to their acne with daily use of NAG compared with vehicle after 12-weeks. At baseline and each subsequent visit, subjects completed the Acne-QoL form after being given verbal instructions by the study coordinator. The Acne QoL is a validated measure that contains 19 questions referring to the past week, organized into four areas: self-perception, role-social, role-emotional, and acne symptoms. Each question gauges how much acne affects the subject, with answers ranging from 0 (extremely) to 6 (not at all). Domain scores are calculated by taking the average scores within each domain, with high scores reflecting better QoL determination. The number of subjects with a negative score for each quality of life region was determined at each time-point. Those with a negative score, were those with a score of 3.5 or less, indicating that the disease was having a meaningful effect on their lives</description>
