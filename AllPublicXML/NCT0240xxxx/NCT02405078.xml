  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies tumor-specific markers (clonotype), blood tests, and
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in predicting treatment response
      at different times during chemotherapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that
      has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Studying samples of
      blood in the laboratory from patients during chemotherapy may help doctors learn more about
      the effects of treatment on cells and may help doctors determine whether patients are
      responding to treatment. PET/CT scan procedures are done at the same time with the same
      machine and the combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than
      either scan gives by itself and may help doctors find out how well treatment is working.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of blood based detection of a tumor-specific clonotype and
      metabolic profiling and functional imaging to predict response to standard
      immunochemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the optimal time points to create the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      response prediction model.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the prognostic value of clinical factors, cell of origin subtype, and
      circulating immune cell subsets for response to therapy.

      II. To evaluate for novel genomic aberrations or signatures which correlate with therapeutic
      failure.

      III. To evaluate the ability of additional positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) imaging interpretation techniques to correlate with clinical outcomes.

      IV. To evaluate the correlation of blood-based detection of clonotype with fludeoxyglucose
      F-18 (FDG) PET/CT disease assessment.

      V. To evaluate the utility of alternative methods of minimal residual disease detection.

      VI. To evaluate measurement of circulating metabolic profiling with imaging results and
      clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard salvage chemotherapy as determined by the treating physician.

      Patients undergo FDG PET/CT scans at baseline (between days -21 to 0), on day 4 after
      completion of first high-dose chemotherapy, on day 21 after completion of the first course of
      chemotherapy, and on day 42 after the end of the second course of chemotherapy. Blood samples
      are also collected for tumor-specific clonotype and metabolic profile at baseline (days -5 to
      0) and on days 4, 8, 21, and 42.

    <description>Defined as demonstrating the chemotherapy-sensitiveness for curative autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) based on fludeoxyglucose F 18 FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) results. Non-responders will be classified as having equivocal active disease with a positive biopsy for confirmation and unequivocal active disease in a previously biopsy-confirmed site of disease. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients. The concordance rate between the interim PET/CT scans and the final FDG PET/CT scan, and its 95% confidence interval, will be reported. The change in drug of choice (DoC) and metabolic profile tests will be explored using mixed effect linear regression models.</description>
