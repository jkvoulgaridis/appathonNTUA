  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether a parental training program using group-based
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for childhood asthma care, is effective in reducing the
      children's unplanned health care services utilization and asthmatic symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-tenth of children in worldwide are diagnosed with asthma and it is the leading cause for
      unplanned health care services utilization. Parents, as the primary caregivers, experience
      different level of psychological distress in taking care of their children with asthma. Some
      of them responded with avoidance-based coping, which results in poor asthma symptom
      management and monitoring. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a contextual focused,
      behavioral therapy aiming at improving psychological flexibility, so that a person can be
      more opened up to engaging in value-driven behavior modification, thus attaining an optimal
      disease control. The benefits of ACT have been demonstrated on both parents and their
      children with chronic health conditions such as developmental disabilities, acquired brain
      injuries, chronic pain, cancer and mental disorders. To date, no ACT intervention has been
      conducted on examining its effects on training parents in managing their children with
      asthmatic conditions.

      This is the first study aims to examine the effects of a parental training program using
      group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in reducing the unplanned health care
      services utilization and asthmatic symptoms, among children with asthma. Parents of children
      diagnosed with asthma will either receive one session of pediatric asthma educational talk as
      usual practice in the study hospital, or in addition, four sessions of group-based ACT
      integrated with asthma education.

      If the group-based ACT is effective in reducing children's asthmatic symptoms and overall
      unplanned asthma-related health services utilization, it could lead to substantial health
      benefits in children with asthma and on parents with a reduction in psychological distress.
      In addition to cutting medical expenses, it could also contribute to the community health
      through the reduction in mortality and morbidity due to asthmatic attacks. Furthermore,
      information collected from this proposed study will open up an opportunity for exploring the
      potential of ACT-based intervention in managing other childhood chronic diseases.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parents' Psychological Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II was used to assess the psychological flexibility of the parents.
The parents rated 7 statements on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true), for example: &quot;My painful experiences and memories make it difficult for me to live a life that I would value.&quot; The possible range of the total score is 7-49 (minimum value = 7; maximum value = 49). A higher score means a worse outcome, that is the parent is more psychologically inflexible.
The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II possessed good internal consistencies (mean Cronbach's alpha (Î±) = .84, range Î± = .86 to .88) and test-retest reliabilities over a 3-month interval (test-retest reliability coefficient (r) = .81) and 12-month interval (r = .79), respectively.</description>

    <measure>Parents' Psychological Adjustment to Their Child's Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Experience of Child Illness scale was used to capture the psychological adjustment of parents in caring for a child with asthma.
The Parent Experience of Child Illness scale contains 25 statements with 3 subscales for assessing the illness-specific psychological distress experienced by parents who have a chronically ill child, including Guilt and Worry, Unresolved Sorrow and Anger, and Long-term Uncertainty, together with 1 subscale on perceived Emotional Resources. The possible range of each of the subscale score is 0-4 (minimum value = 0; maximum value = 4). Higher scores in Guilt and Worry, Unresolved Sorrow and Anger, and Long-term Uncertainty mean worse outcomes. A higher score in Emotional Resources means a better outcome.
The Parent Experience of Child Illness scale had adequate internal consistencies (Î± in each subscale = .72 to .89) and test-retest reliabilities over a 2-week interval (r in each subscale = .83 to .86)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parents' Psychological Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 was used to evaluate the psychological symptoms of parents.
This instrument contains 21 statements with 3 subscales assessing the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress of parents, respectively. The parents rated the degree to which each statement applied to them in the past week on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (does not apply to me at all) to 3 (applies to me very much, or most of the time).
The subscale scores for depression, anxiety and stress subscale would be multiplied by two. The possible range for each of the subscale score is 0-42 (minimum value = 0, maximum value = 42). Higher scores mean worse outcomes. The cut-off scores indicating at least a mild level of psychological symptoms of an individual are 9 for depression; 7 for anxiety and 14 for stress, respectively.
The Cronbach's alpha for the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales in DASS-21 were 0.82, 0.88 and 0.90, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parents' Knowledge in Childhood Asthma Management</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge level among parents in pediatric asthma management.
This instrument composes of 25 true and false statements to measure parental asthma knowledge, including symptoms, triggers, treatment and prevention (Cronbach's alpha = 0.69).
The possible range of total score is 0-25 (minimum value = 0; maximum value = 25). A higher score means a better outcome, that is the parent has better asthma knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parents' Asthma Management Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Parental Asthma Management Self-Efficacy Scale was used to assess the self-efficacy of parents in childhood asthma care.
The instrument consists of 13 questions with two subscales in assessing the self-efficacy of parents in preventing and in managing children's asthma attacks. The parents rated the strength of their beliefs in a variety of situations related to childhood asthma management on a 5-point rating scale from 1 (not at sure) to 5 (completely sure). The possible range of each of the subscale score is 1-5 (minimum value = 1, maximum value = 5). A higher score means a better outcome, that is the parent has better self-efficacy.
This instrument had satisfactory internal consistency (Î± of each subscale = .77 to .82) and strong construct validity with the self-efficacy of children in managing asthma (r = 0.36).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parents' Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life was used to assess the quality of life of the parents in caring for a child with asthma.
This instrument is a 13-question, 7-point Likert scale measuring parental psychosocial well-being with 2 subscales, emotional function and activity limitation. The possible range of each of the subscale score is 1-7 (minimum value = 1, maximum value = 7). Higher scores in the subscales mean better outcomes, that is the parent has a better quality of life.
This instrument had stable reliabilities within the intervals of four weeks (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.80 to 0.85).</description>

          <description>Parents of children with asthma will receive one session of asthma educational talk as the usual care, plus three weekly sessions of telephone calls to assess the child's asthma symptoms
Control: One session of educational talk about pediatric asthma care, as the usual care.
To ensure the equivalency of the assigned sessions between groups, after attending the talk in the first week, the parents in the Control group will receive three telephone calls, starting from the second week on a weekly basis. This arrangement can also minimize the interference of the usual care naturalistically available in the study setting.</description>

          <description>Parents of children with asthma will receive four sessions of group-based ACT intervention integrated with asthma education (its content will be the same as that of the Control Group).
ACT: Four sessions of group-based ACT integrated with asthma education. Each session will compose of pediatric asthma education based on guidelines of Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention Revised 2011, plus group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The goal of ACT is to enhance the psychological flexibility of the parents, enabling them to (1) become aware of their thoughts and feelings regarding their childâs asthma and its management, (2) accept and adapt flexibly to challenging situations, and (3) take actions to achieve valued goals in childhood asthma management.</description>

ACT: Four sessions of group-based ACT integrated with asthma education. Each session will compose of pediatric asthma education based on guidelines of Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention Revised 2011, plus group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The goal of ACT is to enhance the psychological flexibility of the parents, enabling them to (1) become aware of their thoughts and feelings regarding their childâs asthma and its management, (2) accept and adapt flexibly to challenging situations, and (3) take actions to achieve valued goals in childhood asthma management.</description>

        <title>Parents' Psychological Flexibility</title>
        <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II was used to assess the psychological flexibility of the parents.
The parents rated 7 statements on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true), for example: &quot;My painful experiences and memories make it difficult for me to live a life that I would value.&quot; The possible range of the total score is 7-49 (minimum value = 7; maximum value = 49). A higher score means a worse outcome, that is the parent is more psychologically inflexible.
The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II possessed good internal consistencies (mean Cronbach's alpha (Î±) = .84, range Î± = .86 to .88) and test-retest reliabilities over a 3-month interval (test-retest reliability coefficient (r) = .81) and 12-month interval (r = .79), respectively.</description>

        <title>Parents' Psychological Adjustment to Their Child's Asthma</title>
        <description>The Parent Experience of Child Illness scale was used to capture the psychological adjustment of parents in caring for a child with asthma.
The Parent Experience of Child Illness scale contains 25 statements with 3 subscales for assessing the illness-specific psychological distress experienced by parents who have a chronically ill child, including Guilt and Worry, Unresolved Sorrow and Anger, and Long-term Uncertainty, together with 1 subscale on perceived Emotional Resources. The possible range of each of the subscale score is 0-4 (minimum value = 0; maximum value = 4). Higher scores in Guilt and Worry, Unresolved Sorrow and Anger, and Long-term Uncertainty mean worse outcomes. A higher score in Emotional Resources means a better outcome.

        <title>Parents' Psychological Symptoms</title>
        <description>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 was used to evaluate the psychological symptoms of parents.
This instrument contains 21 statements with 3 subscales assessing the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress of parents, respectively. The parents rated the degree to which each statement applied to them in the past week on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (does not apply to me at all) to 3 (applies to me very much, or most of the time).
The subscale scores for depression, anxiety and stress subscale would be multiplied by two. The possible range for each of the subscale score is 0-42 (minimum value = 0, maximum value = 42). Higher scores mean worse outcomes. The cut-off scores indicating at least a mild level of psychological symptoms of an individual are 9 for depression; 7 for anxiety and 14 for stress, respectively.
The Cronbach's alpha for the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales in DASS-21 were 0.82, 0.88 and 0.90, respectively.</description>

The instrument consists of 13 questions with two subscales in assessing the self-efficacy of parents in preventing and in managing children's asthma attacks. The parents rated the strength of their beliefs in a variety of situations related to childhood asthma management on a 5-point rating scale from 1 (not at sure) to 5 (completely sure). The possible range of each of the subscale score is 1-5 (minimum value = 1, maximum value = 5). A higher score means a better outcome, that is the parent has better self-efficacy.
This instrument had satisfactory internal consistency (Î± of each subscale = .77 to .82) and strong construct validity with the self-efficacy of children in managing asthma (r = 0.36).</description>
