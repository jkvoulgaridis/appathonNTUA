             lesions and who consent to the biopsies.)

          4. Participants must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1.

                  suppression ≥3 months, throughout treatment and for 6 months after

               -  Participants Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-positive after successful treatment (defined
                  as sustained virologic response [SVR] 12 or SVR 24) are allowed as long as 4
                  weeks have passed between completion of HCV therapy and start of study drug

         10. Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g., influenza, varicella, etc.)
             within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study therapy and 60 days after the last
