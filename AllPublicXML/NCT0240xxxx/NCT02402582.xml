  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to determine if a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (CR)
      programme using the Family-Centered Empowerment Model (FCEM) as compared with standard CR
      will improve patient quality-of-life, perceived stress and state anxiety of patients with
      myocardial infarction (MI).

    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled blinded study in patients admitted for MI
      to the CCU of an academic teaching hospital from June 2012 to January 2015. The study was
      approved by the institutional investigative review board at Tarbiat Modares University and
      Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences. Patients were block randomized to receive either
      standard home cardiac rehabilitation (CR) or CR using the Family-centered Empowerment Model
      (FCEM) strategy. Patients had not previously gone through CR programs. The difference between
      the two groups was not disclosed at any point. Patients consented knowing that they would
      receive cardiac rehabilitation, but without knowing the details. Patients and their
      designated family/friend were enrolled as a 'unit'.Patient empowerment was measured with FCEM
      questionnaires pre-intervention and post-intervention for a total of 9 assessments.
      Quality-of-life, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety were assessed using the
      36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the 14-item Perceived Stress, and the 20-item State
      and 20-item Trait Anxiety questionnaires, respectively.

    <intervention_model_description>All patients had similar inpatient rehabilitation programs. Both groups exercised for 0-2h/day. Walking distance was measured using a Fitbit (Fitbit, San Francisco, USA). Routine care included education on smoking cessation and education on food selection.
FCEM: Daily exercise occurred between 8-10 AM and was supervised by designated family members. Investigators randomly attended sessions in an unannounced fashion. Physical therapy consultation was available on investigator request. Exercise data were independently collected from the patient and their designated family member on a weekly basis (κ statistic=0.9).
Control: Patients exercised daily, at any time. Sessions were supervised by family members. Investigators did not attend sessions. Exercise data were independently collected from the patient and their designated family member on a weekly basis (κ statistic=0.4).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>FCEM and Control groups had similar inpatient care. Patients in the intervention group received care employing the FCEM in four stages. Stage 1: Awareness and cognition. During 3-5 group sessions they were evaluated for their insight into their perceived illness severity and perceived sensitivity, or the degree to which they felt threatened by their illness. Stage 2: Expectations. 3-5 sessions. Stage 3: Acceptance. Assessed using an educational participation method in group discussion. Stage 4: Formative summative evaluations. The formative evaluation encourages patients to internalize their locus of control by seeing his/her self-empowerment (increasing self-responsibility about their health). Summative evaluations were performed to evaluate the influence of the intervention on HRQoL dimensions, perceived stress and anxiety -- assessed at baseline and at 3 months post-intervention. Empowerment was measured at baseline and at 10 days post-intervention by deploying FCEM questionnaires.</description>
