      The objective of this pilot trial is to demonstrate the safety and the performance of the
      Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device before conducting clinical trials in type 1 diabetes
      patients.

      1. Safety: To evaluate safety issues related to implantation and use of the Hyposafe
           hypoglycaemia alarm device.

        2. Performance: To evaluate the performance of the Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device.

        3. Usability: To obtain information about the subjects use and acceptance of the Hyposafe
           Hypoglycaemia alarm device.

    <measure>Performance: EEG Recordings - Impedance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The EEG performance was measured as the mean impedance as a function of time. An impedance value below 5 kOhm is considered very good.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance: EEG Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The power spectrum densities from the two modalities were directly compared on an integer scale from -5 to 5, where &quot;-5&quot; signifies that the scalp EEG was of much higher quality than the subcutaneous. &quot;0&quot; means they were of equal quality and &quot;5&quot; means the subcutaneous signal was of much higher quality</description>

    <measure>Usability: Reported Discomfort During Day While Wearing the Device</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The discomfort during the day was recorded by the study subject every day wearing the device. Reported discomfort was evaluated by the following question: &quot;How much do you agree with the following statement: There has been no discomfort while wearing the HypoSafe device during day?&quot;. The scale ranged from 1 to 5 (strongly agree = 5, agree = 4, neutral = 3, disagree = 2, strongly disagree=1).</description>

    <time_frame>19±4 days after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The discomfort was recorded by the study subjects 19±4 days after implantation. Reported discomfort was evaluated by the following question: &quot;How much do you agree with the following statement: I have not experienced any implant discomfort the past two days?&quot;. The scale ranged from 1 to 5 (strongly agree = 5, agree = 4, neutral = 3, disagree = 2, strongly disagree=1).</description>

    <description>The discomfort was recorded by the study subjects 51±3 days after implantation. Reported discomfort was evaluated by the following question: &quot;How much do you agree with the following statement: I have not experienced any implant discomfort the past two days?&quot;. The scale ranged from 1 to 5 (strongly agree = 5, agree = 4, neutral = 3, disagree = 2, strongly disagree=1).</description>
