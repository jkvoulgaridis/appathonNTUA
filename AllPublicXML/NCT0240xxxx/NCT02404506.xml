  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women, world-wide the leading cause of
      cancer mortality. One of the strongest risk factors for developing breast cancer is age, with
      a prevalence approaching 7% in women &gt;70 years; more than 40% of breast cancer patients are
      older than 65 years. Although the survival rate has increased in the last years, about one
      third of patients will relapse with distant metastases. Treatment for patients with
      metastatic breast cancer is palliative, therefore maintaining or improving quality of life.

      The use of taxanes and anthracyclines as first line chemotherapy regimen for metastatic
      breast cancer is widely accepted. Both taxanes and anthracyclines have considerable side
      effects, especially in elderly patients.

      Eribulin, a synthetic analogue of a chemotherapeutically active compound derived from the sea
      sponge Halichondria okadai, acts as an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. It is registered as
      palliative chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer after anthracyclines and taxanes. Studies
      with eribulin treatment have shown similar efficacy compared to anthracyclines and taxanes,
      but less toxicity. Those studies showed that often the dose of eribulin had to be reduced
      during treatment due to toxicity without compromising the efficacy of the treatment.

      The main objective of the trial is to explore the efficacy of a reduced starting dose of
      eribulin as first-line treatment in elderly metastatic breast cancer patients. The secondary
      objective of the trial is to investigate the safety of eribulin in those patients.

      Eribulin mesilate 1.1mg/m2 i.v. will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks on day 1 and
      day 8 until progressive disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to a rising number of elderly patients, fit for chemotherapy, investigating a
      well-tolerated and effective first line treatment is warranted. In this specific population
      often there are contra-indications for the use of standard first line drugs like
      anthracyclines and taxanes due to comorbidities (e.g. cardiac impairment or Peripheral
      neuropathy). Response rates in first line treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines usually
      do not exceed 30%. Eribulin has shown a response rate of 29% and a clinical benefit rate
      (corresponding to the investigators primary endpoint) of 52% in first line, so the
      investigators expect similar efficacy, but less toxicity.

      Optimal dose, schedule and tolerability of this drug in the first line setting are unknown in
      the elderly population. No information on dose modifications in this population is available.
      Based on the data of eribulin in the first line with higher efficacy in those patients with
      dose reductions, the SAKK 25/14 trial investigates the reduced starting-dose of eribulin of
      1.1mg/m2 for this vulnerable population of elderly patients. Growth factors to maintain a
      certain dose level of eribulin are not recommended, respecting the international guidelines.

      SAKK has a tradition in conducting trials in the elderly population, such as SAKK 25/99 in
      metastatic breast cancer, SAKK 38/08 in aggressive B-cell-Lymphoma, SAKK 41/10 in metastatic
      colorectal cancer.
