    <textblock>
      Background:

      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disorder that can cause plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).
      These are tumors that grow along nerves. Some PNs cause serious health problems. PNs often
      can t be operated on because of their large size, location, or number. There are no effective
      treatments known for people with NF1 and PNs. Researchers want to test if the drug
      selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) causes PNs to shrink or slows down their growth.

      Objectives:

      To test if selumetinib helps treat PNs. To test how the body handles selumetinib and how it
      affects peoples symptoms.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with NF1, with an inoperable PN that causes morbidity or is growing

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history and physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Eye exam

      MRI: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

      PN biopsy: A small piece of the tumor is removed by a large needle.

      Questionnaires

      Participants will swallow selumetinib capsules every 12 hours for several 28-day cycles. The
      capsules are taken with a full glass of water on an empty stomach. Participants may have only
      water for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose.

      Participants will keep a drug diary. They will continue taking the drug as long as they
      tolerate it and their disease doesn t progress.

      Participants will have several visits throughout the study. These will include repeats of the
      screening tests.

      Participants will have a final visit after they stop taking selumetinib.

      Background:

        -  Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1:3500
           in the US. One of the cardinal features of NF1 is the development of histologically
           benign peripheral nervesheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in 25-40% of
           individuals with NF1. Unlike discrete neurofibromas, PN grow along the length of nerves
           and involve multiple branches of a nerve. They are a major source of morbidity, causing
           disfigurement, impairment of nerve function, pain, and in some cases development of
           malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

        -  Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a novel orally bioavailable mitogen activated protein kinase
           inhibitor, is a specific inhibitor of MEK 1/2, which may mediate anti-tumor effects in
           PN by inhibition of downstream signaling of Ras. Selumetinib is currently undergoing
           evaluation in adult cancers and children with brain tumors and NF1-related plexiform
           neurofibromas.

        -  In an NCI phase I trial of selumetinib for children and young adults with NF1 and
           inoperable PN we have observed preliminary activity with PN volume decrease in &gt;50% of
           patients enrolled. This degree of activity has not been observed in prior trials
           directed at PN. While preliminary activity has been seen in most patients enrolled to
           date, in several patients who required (Bullet) 1 dose reduction for toxicity, after an
           initial volume decrease, the PN volumes appear to be increasing slowly, and in one
           patient a nodular appearing lesion is not responding to selumetinib. These findings
           suggest that not all PN types may be responsive to selumetinib and that a certain
           selumetinib tissue concentration may be required for target inhibition and anti-tumor
           activity.

      Objective:

      -Determine the objective response rate (PN volume decrease greater than or equal to 20%
      compared to baseline) to selumetinib in adult patients with inoperable PN.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of NF1, with an inoperable,
           measureable PN that causes morbidity or is growing, which is amenable to percutaneous
           biopsy, and must be willing to undergo two biopsies.

        -  Up to 10 patients who meet all criteria, but have PN, which cannot be biopsied safely,
           will be eligible for the treatment portion of the study.

        -  Patients must have adequate organ function, be able to undergo serial MRI scans and have
           recovered from acute toxicity of all prior treatment.

      Design:

        -  This is a single site open label phase II study in which all subjects will receive
           selumetinib orally approximately every 12 hours until patient develops progression of
           disease, unacceptable toxicity or, in patients with non-progressive, symptomatic PN at
           enrollment, a maximum of 2 years (unless they experience a partial response, or an
           improvement in symptoms or function in which case they may continue until progression of
           disease).

        -  Selumetinib will be administered at a dose of 50 mg BID on a continuous dosing schedule
           (1 cycle=28 days), which is the recommended adult dose. A maximum accrual of 35
           evaluable patients to meet the primary objective; while a maximum of 60 patients in
           total may be enrolled to allow for a small number of screen failures, inevaluable
           patients and up to 10 patients who cannot safely undergo two biopsies of PNs. Enrollment
           will proceed over approximately 24 months.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have positive genetic testing for NF1in a CLIA certified laboratory or a
             diagnosis of NF1 based on clinical NIH consensus criteria51 of at least one other
             diagnostic criterion in addition to the presence of a PN. NF1 mutation analysis will
             be performed on germline DNA as described by Messiaen &amp; Wimmer 52. Histologic
             confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and
             imaging findings, but should be considered if malignant transformation of a PN is
             clinically suspected. Additional criteria are as follows:

               -  Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to 0.5cm in prepubertal
                  subjects or greater than or equal to1.5 cm in post pubertal subjects)

               -  Freckling in axilla or groin

               -  Optic glioma

               -  Two or more Lisch nodules

               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or
                  thinning of long bone cortex)

               -  A first-degree relative with NF1

          -  Measurable disease: Patients must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a lesion
             of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Patients who underwent surgery for
             resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is
             measurable as per criteria above. Measurability and suitability for volumetric MRI
             analysis of the target PN must be confirmed with the NCI POB prior to enrolling a
             patient. The target PN will be defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which has
             to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis. PN will be classified as typical PN versus
             nodular PN versus solitary nodular PN prior to enrollment

          -  The PN must be inoperable, defined as a PN that cannot be surgically completely
             removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to: encasement of or close
             proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN. The PN
             either causes morbidity or it is growing and has the potential to cause morbidity such
             as (but not limited to): Head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or
             great vessels, paraspinal lesions that can cause myelopathy, brachial or lumbar plexus
             lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could
             result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring,
             and lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function or pain.
             PN growth will be defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in PN volume
             within approximately 3 years prior to enrollment on this trial.

          -  Patients must have a PN amenable to a percutaneous biopsy to participate in the biopsy
             portion of this study, and must be willing to undergo pre-, and on treatment tumor
             biopsies. There should be no contraindication for serial biopsies. NOTE: Up to 10
             patients who meet all criteria, but have PN which cannot be biopsied safely, will be
             eligible for the treatment portion of the study.

          -  Must be able to undergo serial MRI scans for response evaluation

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Patients who are wheelchair bound
             because of paralysis secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be considered
             ambulatory when they are up in their wheelchair. Similarly, patients with limited
             mobility secondary to need for mechanical support (such as an airway PN requiring
             tracheostomy or CPAP) will also be considered ambulatory for the purpose of the
             study.)

             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the
             study.

          -  Prior therapy: Patients with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumor resection is
             not considered to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity, or if a patient
             with a surgical option refuses surgery.

               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN,

               -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not
                  have been administered within the past 7 days and are not permitted while on the
                  study.

               -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received
                  any prior radiation therapy, and no prior radiation therapy should have been
                  directed at the target PN.

               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at
                  the PN.

               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgeries, with evidence of

          -  Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine
             eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent
             from all patients, which can be accomplished using the screening consent for this
             protocol. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical indications (not
             exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for screening or baseline values
             even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained, if the patient
             agrees.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, or have received an

             volumetric analysis of target PN on MRI.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory
             bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate
             absorption.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (despite medical therapy); blood pressure should be &lt;140/90
             in accordance with American Heart Association definition of hypertension.

          -  While not an exclusion criterion, unless clinically indicated, patients should avoid
             taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the study
             medications. In particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to either
             induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and
             CYP3A4, as this may interfere with the metabolism of selumetinib.

          -  Known Cardiac Disorder, including:

               -  Known inherited coronary disease

               -  Symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV prior or current cardiomyopathy, or
                  severe valvular heart disease)

               -  Current cardiomyopathy

               -  Severe valvular heart disease

               -  Atrial fibrillation

               -  Ejection fraction (ECHO) &lt;53%

               -  QTcF &gt;450 msec

          -  Known Ophthalmologic conditions, such as:

               -  Current or past history of central serous retinopathy

               -  Current or past history of retinal vein occlusion

               -  Known intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 21 mmHg (or ULN adjusted by age) or
                  uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP). Patients with known glaucoma and
                  increased IOP who do not have meaningful vision (light perception only or no
                  light perception) and are not experiencing pain related to the glaucoma, may be
                  eligible after discussion with the study chair.

               -  Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic should be discussed
                  with the Study Chair for potential eligibility

               -  Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such
                  as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing
                  orbito-temporal PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a
                  significant abnormality for the purposes of the study

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to selumetinib or any excipient of selumetinib or
             history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to selumetinib

          -  Have had recent major surgery within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to starting study
             treatment, with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access.

          -  Have any unresolved chronic toxicity with CTC AE grade greater than or equal to 2,
             from previous anti-NF1 therapy, except for alopecia.

          -  Clinical judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the
             study
