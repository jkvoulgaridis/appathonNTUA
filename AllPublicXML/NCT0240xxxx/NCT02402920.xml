      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given
      together with chemoradiotherapy or radiation therapy in treating patients with small cell
      lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink
      tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells. Giving
      pembrolizumab with chemoradiotherapy or radiation therapy may be a better treatment for small
      cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety of pembrolizumab (MK 3475) plus chemotherapy (chemo)/radiation for limited-stage
      small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC).

      II. Safety of MK-3475 plus radiation for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. MK-3475 will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to historical controls for
      LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients are assigned to either
      Part A or Part B based on diagnosis.

      PART A (LS-SCLC): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1
      and undergo radiation therapy twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Patients also
      receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and etoposide IV over 4
      hours on days 1, 2, and 3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 16 courses (1 course for
      radiation therapy, 4 courses for chemotherapy) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve systemic disease control and do not exhibit
      severe (grade &gt; 3) pembrolizumab related toxicity during/after completion of 16 courses may
      receive 16 additional courses of pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PART B (ES-SCLC): Beginning after the completion of chemotherapy, patients receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo radiation therapy BID 5 days a week for
      3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 16 courses (1 course for radiation therapy) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed up at 30 days and then every
      12 weeks.
