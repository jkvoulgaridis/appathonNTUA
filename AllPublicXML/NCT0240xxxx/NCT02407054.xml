        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Metastatic disease documented by positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on computed
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

          -  Prostate cancer progression documented by PSA and/or radiographic progression
             according to prostate cancer working group 2 (PCWG2).

          -  Prior abiraterone treatment completed at least 4 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1.
             Participants must have failed prior abiraterone treatment.

          -  Surgically or medically castrated, with testosterone levels of &lt; 50
             nanograms/deciliter.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Ability to swallow the study drugs whole.

          -  Adequate hematologic function.

          -  Adequate coagulation parameters, defined as international normalization ratio (INR) ≤
             2.

          -  Availability of tumor tissue from any time since diagnosis of prostate cancer disease.
             If no tumor samples are available the participant might still be eligible following
             discussion between the investigator and the medical monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, a PI3K/AKT/mTOR agent (including TORC1
             and TORC2 inhibitors), or RA 223 dichloride for the treatment of castration resistant
             prostate cancer (CRPC). Participants may have received docetaxel in the
             hormone-sensitive setting.

          -  Prior investigational new generation potent anti-androgen therapy (such as ARN 509).

          -  Prior treatment with enzalutamide.

          -  Pathological finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Prior systemic treatment with an azole drug (fluconazole, itraconazole) within 4 weeks
             of cycle 1 day 1.

          -  Known brain metastasis.

          -  History of (a) seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (prior cortical
             stroke or significant brain trauma); (b) loss of consciousness or transient ischemic
             attack within 12 months prior to day 1 of cycle 1.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥ 160 millimeters of mercury
             [mmHg] or diastolic BP ≥ 95 mmHg).

          -  Have serious pre-existing medical conditions (at the discretion of the investigator).

          -  Have known acute or chronic leukemia or current hematologic malignancies that, in the
             judgment of the investigator and sponsor, may affect the interpretation of results.

          -  Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with a type 2 diabetes mellitus
             are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral
             anti-diabetics as documented by hemoglobin A1c &lt;7%.

          -  Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will interfere
             significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of oral
             therapy (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, grade ≥2 diarrhea,
             and malabsorption syndrome).

          -  Have a history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class ≥3, QTc interval &gt; 480
             milliseconds (ms) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) per Friderica's formula,
             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction (MI) in 6 months prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  Clinically significant electrolyte imbalance ≥ grade 2.

          -  Currently receiving treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium.

          -  Have initiated treatment with bisphosphonates or approved receptor activator of
             nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) targeted agents (e.g. denosumab) ≤28 days prior
             to day 1 of cycle 1.

          -  Concurrent serious infections requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy.

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and medical
             monitor may affect the interpretation of results.

          -  Have an active, known fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection.
