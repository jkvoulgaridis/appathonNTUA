  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of Octafibrin, a fibrinogen concentrate in in the
      on-demand treatment of spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes in paediatric patients less
      than 12 years of age.The planned study duration is up to 5 years. The study will be
      considered completed when a minimum of 6 subjects (i.e., at least 3 subjects aged between 0
      and &lt;6 years and 3 subjects aged between 6 and &lt;12 years) have at least one documented
      bleeding episode and when in total a minimum of 2 surgical procedures have been performed.

      All patients will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) study after screening. This will have a
      duration of 14 days, after which a patient can be treated for a bleeding episode or planned
      surgical procedure when they occur.

    <measure>Overall Clinical Assessment of the Haemostatic Efficacy of Octafibrin in the On-demand Treatment of the First Documented Bleeding Episode of Each Patient Based on a 4-point Haemostatic Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>First Octafibrin infusion for the treatment of a bleeding episode until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes last</time_frame>
    <description>The overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode (BE) of each patient. The first bleeding episode covered the time from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e. 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, which ever came last.
The investigator's overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding was based on a 4-point haemostatic efficacy scale (excellent, good, moderate or none). Excellent result was defined as immediate cessation of bleeding; 'Good' was eventual complete cessation of bleeding; 'Moderate' was incomplete cessation of bleeding and 'None' was no cessation of bleeding with alternative haemostatic intervention required.
The IDMEAC conducted an independent adjudication of all haemostatic efficacy results and evaluated the investigator's assessments of the efficacy in the treatment of each BE.</description>

    <time_frame>Before first infusion and 1 hour post-infusion of Octafibrin</time_frame>
    <description>MCF was measured using thromboelastometry (ROTEM). ROTEM is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation and clot firmness. It utilises a mechanical detection system which is based on the ability of the blood or plasma clot to form a mechanical coupling over a distance of 1 mm.
ROTEM was used to measure MCF as a surrogate efficacy marker for haemostatic efficacy before and after the first infusion of Octafibrin for treatment of the first bleeding episode and all bleeding episodes. The change in MCF was measured from baseline to 1 hour post-infusion of Octafibrin administration.</description>

          <description>Of the 15 patients screened,14 patients received at least one infusion of Octafibrin and were included in the study safety (SAF) and full-analysis set (FAS) populations.
For the pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment, 13 patients received a single intravenous infusion of 70mg/kg body weight (BW) of Octafibrin. Dosage of Octafibrin when treating bleeding &amp; surgeries was individually dosed to achieve recommended target fibrinogen plasma levels.8 patients had at least 1 bleeding episode (BE) treated with Octafibrin and constitute the first bleeding (firstBLEED) population, and 8 patients had all documented BEs treated with Octafibrin and therefore constitute the all bleeding (BLEED) population. Target fibrinogen plasma level for minor bleeding were 80-100 mg/dL; major bleeding:130-150mg/dL.
3 patients underwent surgical interventions with at least 1 infusion of Octafibrin (SURG population). Target fibrinogen plasma level for minor surgeries: 80-100 mg/dL; major surgeries: 130-150 mg/dL.</description>

        <title>Overall Clinical Assessment of the Haemostatic Efficacy of Octafibrin in the On-demand Treatment of the First Documented Bleeding Episode of Each Patient Based on a 4-point Haemostatic Efficacy Scale</title>
        <description>The overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode (BE) of each patient. The first bleeding episode covered the time from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e. 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, which ever came last.
The investigator's overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding was based on a 4-point haemostatic efficacy scale (excellent, good, moderate or none). Excellent result was defined as immediate cessation of bleeding; 'Good' was eventual complete cessation of bleeding; 'Moderate' was incomplete cessation of bleeding and 'None' was no cessation of bleeding with alternative haemostatic intervention required.
The IDMEAC conducted an independent adjudication of all haemostatic efficacy results and evaluated the investigator's assessments of the efficacy in the treatment of each BE.</description>

        <title>Change in Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) for the First Bleeding Episode for Each Patients and for All Bleeding Episodes</title>
        <description>MCF was measured using thromboelastometry (ROTEM). ROTEM is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation and clot firmness. It utilises a mechanical detection system which is based on the ability of the blood or plasma clot to form a mechanical coupling over a distance of 1 mm.
ROTEM was used to measure MCF as a surrogate efficacy marker for haemostatic efficacy before and after the first infusion of Octafibrin for treatment of the first bleeding episode and all bleeding episodes. The change in MCF was measured from baseline to 1 hour post-infusion of Octafibrin administration.</description>

The change in MCF was measured from baseline to 1 hour post-infusion of Octafibrin administration.</description>

        <title>Efficacy of Octafibrin in Surgical Prophylaxis Based on a Four-point Haemostatic Efficacy Scale</title>
        <description>The haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin was assessed during surgery prophylaxis by the surgeon and the Independent Data Monitoring &amp; Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC), on a 4-point scale ranging from excellent, good, moderate and none. Intra-operative blood loss lower or equal to the average expected blood loss was rates as 'Excellent'; intra-operative blood loss higher than average expected blood loss but lower or equal to maximal expected blood loss was rated as 'Good'; intra-operative blood loss was higher than expected blood loss was rated as 'Moderate' and haemostasis that was uncontrolled and necessitated a change in clotting factor replacement regimen was rated as 'None'.

          <description>The haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin was assessed during surgery prophylaxis by the surgeon and the Independent Data Monitoring &amp; Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC), on a 4-point scale ranging from excellent, good, moderate and none. Intra-operative blood loss lower or equal to the average expected blood loss was rates as 'Excellent'; intra-operative blood loss higher than average expected blood loss but lower or equal to maximal expected blood loss was rated as 'Good'; intra-operative blood loss was higher than expected blood loss was rated as 'Moderate' and haemostasis that was uncontrolled and necessitated a change in clotting factor replacement regimen was rated as 'None'.
The surgical observation period started lasted from the first dose of Octafibrin to at least 3 post-operative days for minor and 7 post-operative days for major surgeries or until the day of the last post-operative infusion, whichever comes last.</description>
