  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to fifty (50) children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 4 to ˂18 years at
      time of enrolment will be selected for inclusion in the study. The target is to obtain
      treatment response and user-experience data following use of Nasal Glucagon (LY900018) in
      treating episodes of hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of nasal glucagon (NG) administered
      under clinical use conditions in treating episodes of moderate or severe hypoglycemia in
      persons with T1D.

      This study also aims to assess the ease with which caregivers can administer the experimental
      medication in treatment of hypoglycemic events.

    <measure>Number of Participants Awakening or Returning to a Normal Status Within 30 Minutes Following Studied Drug of Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes after each drug administration for an episode of hypoglycemia</time_frame>
    <description>Responses to questions completed by the caregiver are used to assess this outcome. An episode of severe hypoglycemia is generally defined as an event associated with severe neuroglycopenia usually resulting in coma or seizure and requiring parenteral therapy (glucagon or intravenous glucose) administered by a third party. In this study moderate hypoglycemia is defined as an episode wherein the child/adolescent with diabetes has symptoms and/or signs of neuroglycopenia and has a blood glucose ≤3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]) based on a blood sample taken at or close to the time of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Ease-of-use of Dry-Mist Nasal Glucagon by Completion of Questionnaire by the Caregiver</measure>
    <time_frame>After each drug administration for an episode of hypoglycemia</time_frame>
    <description>Assess ease-of-use of intranasal administered glucagon in the hands of caregivers of participants who may be called upon to treat episodes of hypoglycemia.
Measurement for Degree of difficulty: opening the kit, Degree of difficulty: understanding the instructions on how to use the kit, Degree of difficulty: administering the medication into the nostril, Degree of satisfaction is 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy). Measurement for Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon will be easy to teach other caregivers, Nasal formulation of glucagon is less intimidating for caregivers, Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon is easy to carry and would be willing to carry it, Intranasal delivery of glucagon is preferable: level of agreement 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events Through the Nasal Score Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 hours of full recovery from a hypoglycemic event</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events solicited through the Nasal Score Questionnaire included: runny nose, nasal congestion (nostrils plugged), nasal itching, sneezing, watery eyes, itchy eyes, redness of eyes, itching of ears, itching of throat, and other.
A summary of other non-serious AEs, and all SAE's, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section.</description>

    <measure>Change in Blood Glucose Level Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (just prior to dosing or right after study drug administration), 15, 30 and 45 minutes after drug administration for an episode of hypoglycemia</time_frame>
    <description>Glucometer-based measurements of blood glucose after the studied drug administration. The participants' change in blood glucose level from baseline (just prior to dosing or right after the study drug administration) was measured by the caregiver using a glucometer at 15, 30 and 45 minutes after NG administration. The change in glucose was calculated from each time point (15, 30 and 45 minutes) minus the baseline.</description>

        <description>Responses to questions completed by the caregiver are used to assess this outcome. An episode of severe hypoglycemia is generally defined as an event associated with severe neuroglycopenia usually resulting in coma or seizure and requiring parenteral therapy (glucagon or intravenous glucose) administered by a third party. In this study moderate hypoglycemia is defined as an episode wherein the child/adolescent with diabetes has symptoms and/or signs of neuroglycopenia and has a blood glucose ≤3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]) based on a blood sample taken at or close to the time of treatment.</description>

Events for which participants required external professional medical assistance or used injected glucagon or oral carbohydrates within 30 minutes and before responding were non-evaluable.

Measurement for Degree of difficulty: opening the kit, Degree of difficulty: understanding the instructions on how to use the kit, Degree of difficulty: administering the medication into the nostril, Degree of satisfaction is 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy). Measurement for Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon will be easy to teach other caregivers, Nasal formulation of glucagon is less intimidating for caregivers, Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon is easy to carry and would be willing to carry it, Intranasal delivery of glucagon is preferable: level of agreement 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).</description>

        <description>Glucometer-based measurements of blood glucose after the studied drug administration. The participants' change in blood glucose level from baseline (just prior to dosing or right after the study drug administration) was measured by the caregiver using a glucometer at 15, 30 and 45 minutes after NG administration. The change in glucose was calculated from each time point (15, 30 and 45 minutes) minus the baseline.</description>
