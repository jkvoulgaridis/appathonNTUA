      In Part I of the study RO5126766 will be given twice weekly or three times per week in
      treatment cycles of 4 weeks to investigate a safe and tolerable dose of the drug.

      Once the optimal dosing schedule is defined, the following patients with BRAF, KRAS and/or
      NRAS mutations will be enrolled: 26 patients with solid tumours (Part IIA&amp;C), 10 patients
      with Multiple Myeloma (Part IIB) and upto 34 patients with solid tumours who will take
      RO5126766 in combination with everolimus (Part IID).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two centre Phase I trial evaluating two intermittent dosing schedules of RO5126766
      alone and then in combination with everolimus.

      Part I: Patients will be given RO5126766 (4mg) twice weekly or three times per week in
      treatment cycles of 4 weeks to investigate a safe and tolerable dose of the drug. Upto six
      patients will be enrolled to each dosing schedule and once they have completed 1 cycle of
      treatment the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review their safety data, PK and PD data and
      define the optimal schedule to be taken forward into Part II.

      On the basis of the previous Phase I trial, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not expected
      at a dose of 4 mg but in the event of ≥ 2 DLT's occurring in (a) the 2 x weekly arm, then no
      further patients will recruited into that arm and the schedule will not be taken forward to
      Part II, or (b) the 3 x weekly arm, a single dose reduction to 3.2mg on the same dosing
      schedule will be implemented and 6 patients enrolled at the reduced dose. If 4 mg given 3 x
      weekly is considered non-tolerable then the SRC may decide to enrol patients to the 3.2 mg
      dose level in the absence of dose limiting toxicity.

        -  If both the 2 x weekly (Mon &amp; Thurs) and 3 x weekly (Mon, Wed &amp; Fri) schedule are
           tolerated at 4 mg i.e. &lt; 2 DLT's out of a 6 patients in each schedule, then the 3 x
           weekly schedule will be selected.

        -  If the 3 x weekly schedule requires a dose reduction to 3.2 mg and the 2 x weekly
           schedule is tolerated at 4 mg then PD data will be evaluated relative to AUC to aid the
           selection.

        -  If ≥2 DLT's occur out of 6 patients in both schedules (despite the 3 x weekly arm being
           dose reduced), Part II will not be initiated and the study will be terminated.

      Selection of the optimum schedule from Part I will be made by the Safety Review Committee and
      will be the schedule that delivers the highest, tolerable, cumulative weekly dose.

      Part II: Once the optimal dosing schedule has been established in Part I, the following
      groups of patients will be enrolled:

      Part IIA - 20 patients with documented RAS-RAF-MEK pathway mutant solid tumours (including
      KRAS, NRAS or BRAF).

      Part IIB - 10 patients with documented KRAS, NRAS or BRAF multiple myeloma. NB: In order to
      accommodate steroid use for patients with multiple myeloma, the optimal dosing schedule as
      determined in Part I will be administered for 3 weeks followed by a week interruption.

      Part IIC - An additional 6 patients with RAS-RAF-MEK pathway mutant solid tumours (including
      but not exclusive to KRAS, NRAS or BRAF) will be enrolled at the MTD determined in Part I
      however, upon occurrence of Grade 2 drug-related skin rash, CPK elevation or diarrhoea the
      dosing intensity will be reduced to 3 weeks followed by a week interruption. Of the six
      patients in Part IIC, at least three patients should have KRAS mutant lung cancer.

      Part IID - a maximum of 34 patients with documented RAS-RAF-MEK pathway mutant solid tumours
      (including KRAS, NRAS and/or BRAF) will be administered with the combination of R05126766 and
      everolimus.

             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree
             to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal contraception and condom, have an intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm
             with spermicidal gel and condom) for four weeks before entering the trial, during the
             trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.

          5. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or
             neonate.

          6. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

          7. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active

         10. History of any bowel disease including abdominal fistula, gastro-intestinal
             perforation, and diverticulitis.

               1. Patients with history of glaucoma, history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO),
                  predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled
                  diabetes, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia,
                  hyperviscosity syndromes, medically significant history of vasculitis,
                  inflammatory, atherosclerotic or thrombophilic conditions and coagulopathy.

             Appendix 6 table for CYP3A4 inhibitors).

         14. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of RO5126766 and/or everolimus. Participation
             in an observational trial would be acceptable.

         15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for a clinical trial with RO5126766 e.g. hypersensitivity to RO5126766.

             Part IID specific exclusions:

         16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines and are not allowed.

         17. Clinically significant abnormalities of glucose metabolism as defined by any of the
             following:

               -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus types I or II (irrespective of management).

               -  Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥7.0% at screening

               -  Fasting Plasma Glucose ≥ 8.3mmol/L at screening. Fasting is defined as no caloric
                  intake for at least 8 hours.

         18. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for a clinical trial with Everolimus. Examples of which include:
             hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or
             glucose-galactose malabsorption; hypersensitivity to Everolimus, to other rapamycin
             derivatives or to any of the excipients; pre-existing infections.
