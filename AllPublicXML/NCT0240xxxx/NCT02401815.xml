  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how PLX9486 may affect cancer cells with
      certain mutations in the KIT gene, specifically in patients with types of advanced solid
      tumors including Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST).

      PLX9486 is designed to block KIT gene mutations. These mutations can cause cancer and cancer
      cell growth. By blocking these mutations, the drug may kill the cancer cells with the
      mutation and/or stop the tumor from growing. By combining PLX9486 with PLX3397 and PLX9486
      with Sunitinib, the investigators hope to block most gene mutations in KIT.
