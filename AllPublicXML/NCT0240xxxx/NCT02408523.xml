    <measure>Time to the Second Primary Generalized Tonic Clonic (PGTC) Seizure During the 24-week Treatment Period From Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 10 (Week 24)</measure>

    <description>The primary efficacy variable was the time to the second primary generalized tonic clonic seizure (PGTCS) during the 24-week Treatment Period. Relative difference between groups (Lacosamide vs Placebo) was expressed as Hazard Ratio.
The indicated measured values are the observed number of events of second PGTCS in the treatment period which form the basis of the statistical analysis of the time to event analysis.
The hazard ratio compares 2 treatment groups for the times to a specified number of events (125) for the combined treatment groups, and so both the number of events and the times until those events pertain to the computation of the hazard ratio.
A Hazard Ratio below 1 indicates time to second PGTCS was improved for LCM compared to Placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>During the Treatment Period from Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 10 (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>A seizure-free day from primary generalized tonic clonic seizures (PGTCS) was defined as a day where no PGTCS were reported in the seizure diary and PGTCS were assessed, which was estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE) as Reported Spontaneously by the Subject and/or Caregiver or Observed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 1 (Week -4) to End of Study Period (up to Week 36)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation study participant administered a pharmaceutical product that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not related to the IMP.</description>

    <description>Lacosamide plasma concentration was expressed in micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL).
Means and standard deviation (SD) were only calculated if at least 2/3 of the concentrations were quantified at the respective timepoint. Values Below Limit of Quantification (BLQ) were replaced by value of 0 in calculations of means and SDs.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with a confirmed diagnosis at least 24 weeks prior to Visit 1 and a disease
             onset prior to 30 years of age, consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)
             experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures (Type IIE) that are
             classifiable according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ILAE, 1981)

          -  Subject has &gt;=3 PGTC seizures during the 16-week Combined Baseline (12-week Historical
             Baseline plus 4-week Prospective Baseline)

          -  If a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) scan has been
             performed, there must be no evidence of any progressive abnormality or any lesion
             likely to be associated with partial-onset seizures

          -  Subject has been maintained on a stable dose regimen of 1 to 2 non-benzodiazepine
             marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with no benzodiazepine AEDs OR 1 benzodiazepine
             marketed AED with 1 to 2 non benzodiazepine marketed AEDs for at least 28 days prior
             to Visit 1 with or without additional concurrent stable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)

          -  Subjects are required to have had an electroencephalogram (EEG) report consistent with
             idiopathic generalized epilepsy (eg, generalized 3Hz epileptiform discharges and a
             normal EEG background) confirmed by a Central Reviewer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is receiving any investigational drugs or using any experimental devices in
             addition to Lacosamide (LCM)

          -  Subject meets the withdrawal criteria for SP0982 or is experiencing an ongoing serious
             adverse event (SAE)

          -  Subject has an active suicidal ideation as indicated by a positive response ('Yes') to
             either Question 4 or Question 5 of the 'Since Last Visit' version of the
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

          -  Subject has &gt;=2x upper limit of normal (ULN) of any of the following: alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             or &gt;ULN total bilirubin (&gt;=1.5xULN total bilirubin if known Gilbert's syndrome). If
             subject has elevations only in total bilirubin that are &gt;ULN and &lt;1.5xULN, fractionate
             bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%)

        For randomized subjects with a Baseline result &gt;ULN for ALT, AST, ALP, or total bilirubin,
        a Baseline diagnosis and/or the cause of any clinically meaningful elevation must be
        understood and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).

        If subject has &gt;ULN ALT, AST, or ALP that does not meet the exclusion limit at screening,
        repeat the tests, if possible, prior to dosing to ensure there is no further ongoing
        clinically relevant increase. In case of a clinically relevant increase, inclusion of the
        subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

        Tests that result in ALT, AST, or ALP up to 25% above the exclusion limit may be repeated
        once for confirmation. This includes re-screening.

        <title>Time to the Second Primary Generalized Tonic Clonic (PGTC) Seizure During the 24-week Treatment Period From Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 10 (Week 24)</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy variable was the time to the second primary generalized tonic clonic seizure (PGTCS) during the 24-week Treatment Period. Relative difference between groups (Lacosamide vs Placebo) was expressed as Hazard Ratio.
The indicated measured values are the observed number of events of second PGTCS in the treatment period which form the basis of the statistical analysis of the time to event analysis.
The hazard ratio compares 2 treatment groups for the times to a specified number of events (125) for the combined treatment groups, and so both the number of events and the times until those events pertain to the computation of the hazard ratio.
A Hazard Ratio below 1 indicates time to second PGTCS was improved for LCM compared to Placebo.</description>
