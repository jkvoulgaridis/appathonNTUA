      The OSMITTER study protocol is designed as a master protocol governing multiple substudies
      for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy is
      being conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing
      a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic. Following placement of the
      Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one placebo-embedded IEM tablet approximately
      every other hour, for a total of 4 ingestions.

      Placebo-embedded IEM tablets are being tested to measure the accuracy of IEM detection by the
      MIND1 system. Approximately 30 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy.
      The duration of this substudy from Visit 1 (Day 1) to safety follow-up will be approximately
      1 week, of which approximately 1 day will be allotted for active subject participation, plus
      a 1-week safety follow-up period.

        <title>Latency Period Between the Clinical Site-reported Ingestion Time and the Signal Detection of the Ingestion Event by the Patch</title>
        <description>All participants ingested one placebo-embedded IEM tablet approximately every other hour, for a total of 4 ingestions (hours 0, 2, 4, and 6). The time of each ingestion of an IEM was recorded. The compatible computing device (eg, smartphone) was checked at 30-minute intervals for the presence of a timeline ingestion tile and the time was recorded. To evaluate the latency period between site-reported ingestion time and detection of the ingestion event by the patch which displayed on the MIND1 System compatible computing device (eg, smartphone) as a timeline.</description>

            <description>On Day 1, for all enrolled participants, a single adhesive patch (paired with the compatible computing device [eg, smartphone] application) was placed on torso (just above the left costal margin, anywhere from the xyphoid to the left mid-axillary line) before the ingestion of the first placebo-embedded IEM tablet. All participants ingested one placebo-embedded IEM tablet approximately every other hour, for a total of 4 ingestions (hours 0, 2, 4, and 6). Placebo-embedded IEM tablets were tested to measure the accuracy of IEM detection by MIND1 system. Clinic staff recorded the time of each ingestion of an IEM. Clinic staff checked the compatible computing device (eg, smartphone) at 30-minute intervals for the presence of a timeline ingestion tile and recorded the time that was detected by the MIND1 system compatible computing device (eg, smartphone).</description>

            <title>MIND1 System IEM Detection (All Enrolled Participants)</title>
            <description>On Day 1, for all enrolled participants, a single adhesive patch (paired with the compatible computing device [eg, smartphone] app) was placed on torso (just above the left costal margin, anywhere from the xyphoid to the left mid-axillary line) before the ingestion of the first placebo-embedded IEM tablet. All participants ingested one placebo-embedded IEM tablet approximately every other hour, for a total of 4 ingestions (hours 0, 2, 4, and 6). Placebo-embedded IEM tablets were tested to measure the accuracy of IEM detection by MIND1 system. Clinic staff recorded the time of each ingestion of an IEM. Clinic staff checked the compatible computing device (eg, smartphone) at 30-minute intervals for the presence of a timeline ingestion tile and recorded the time it was detected by the MIND1 system compatible computing device (eg, smartphone).</description>

      <desc>Safety and tolerability was assessed by the frequency and severity of AEs, device-related AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and unanticipated adverse device effects. Vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) were analyzed as additional safety variables. The Safety sample included all participants who ingested at least 1 dose of a placebo + IEM, which is the same as the ITT dataset.</desc>
