  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab as
      intravenous (IV: into the vein) infusion in induction study in participants with moderately
      to severely active Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and as subcutaneous (SC) administration in
      maintenance study in participants with moderately to severely active Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
      who have demonstrated a clinical response to Induction treatment with IV ustekinumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo-controlled
      (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect in a clinical trial), parallel-group (a medical research study comparing the
      response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving different interventions), multi-center
      (more than one clinical site will work on a medical research study), protocol of ustekinumab.
      The protocol will consist of 2 studies: an Induction study and a Maintenance study with
      unique endpoints. Screening period will be up to 8 Weeks. Induction study will be at least 8
      weeks duration for each participant. Participant with clinical response in the Induction
      study will be eligible for the Maintenance study. The Maintenance study will be 44 weeks
      duration. After completion of the maintenance study, a long term extension will follow
      eligible participants for an additional 3 years. Clinical remission will be evaluated at Week
      8 in the Induction study. Clinical remission among ustekinumab Induction responders will be
      evaluated at week 44 in the Maintenance study. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout.

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>As per global definition, clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score less than or equal to (&lt;=)2 points, with no individual subscore greater than (&gt;)1. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding [RB], endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment [PGA]), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score was calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe; higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant ulcerative colitis (UC) medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 8 were considered not to be in clinical remission. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With Clinical Remission at Week 8 (As Per Global Definition)</title>
        <description>As per global definition, clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score less than or equal to (&lt;=)2 points, with no individual subscore greater than (&gt;)1. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding [RB], endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment [PGA]), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score was calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe; higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant ulcerative colitis (UC) medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 8 were considered not to be in clinical remission. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With Clinical Remission at Week 8 (As Per US Definition)</title>
        <description>As per US definition, clinical remission was defined as absolute stool number &lt;=3, a Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no blood seen), and a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 (normal or inactive disease) or 1 (mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]) without the physician's global assessment. Absolute stool number is average of daily stool number over the three days. The Mayo rectal bleeding and endoscopy findings subscores were rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 or who were missing all 3 of the Mayo components pertaining to this outcome measure (OM) (absolute stool number, rectal bleeding subscore, and Mayo endoscopy subscore) at Week 8 were considered not to be in clinical remission. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of the video of the endoscopy was used.</description>

          <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With Clinical Remission at Week 8 (As Per US Definition)</title>
          <description>As per US definition, clinical remission was defined as absolute stool number &lt;=3, a Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no blood seen), and a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 (normal or inactive disease) or 1 (mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]) without the physician's global assessment. Absolute stool number is average of daily stool number over the three days. The Mayo rectal bleeding and endoscopy findings subscores were rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 or who were missing all 3 of the Mayo components pertaining to this outcome measure (OM) (absolute stool number, rectal bleeding subscore, and Mayo endoscopy subscore) at Week 8 were considered not to be in clinical remission. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of the video of the endoscopy was used.</description>

        <description>As per global definition, clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score &lt;=2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score was calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe; higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to the Week 44 or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 44 were considered not to be in clinical remission.

        <description>The IBDQ is 32-item questionnaire for participants with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) used to evaluate disease-specific health-related quality of life. IBDQ consists of 32 items, each item score ranged from 1 (worst possible response) to 7 (best possible response). The 32 items were grouped into 4 domains: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function. The 4 domains were scored as follows: 10 to 70 (bowel symptoms); 5 to 35 (systemic symptoms); 12 to 84 (emotional function); and 5 to 35 (social function). For each domain, higher score indicated better quality of life. Total score is sum of each item score and ranges from 32 to 224 with higher score indicating better quality of life. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 had their baseline value carried forward from the time of event onward or participants who had missing IBDQ score at Week 8 had their last value carried forward.</description>

Total score is sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5= mild; 6 to 10= moderate; 11 to 12= severe; higher scores indicate worsening of disease. Participants who lost clinical response at any time before Week 44, had prohibited change in UC medication, ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ AE of worsening of UC before Week 44 or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 44 were considered not to be in clinical response. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <description>Mucosal healing is defined as having both endoscopic healing (EH) and histologic healing (HH). Endoscopic healing: an endoscopy subscore of 0 (normal or inactive disease) or 1 mild disease ([erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]).

        <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With Individual Mayo Subscore (Stool Frequency) up to Week 8</title>
        <description>The stool frequency subscore of Mayo score is rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Stool frequency scores: 0 =normal number of stools, 1 = 1-2 stools more than normal, 2 = 3-4 stools more than normal, 3 = 5 or more stools more than normal. Higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 had their baseline value carried forward from the time of the event onward. Participants who had a missing Mayo stool frequency subscore at the designated analysis timepoint had the last available value for that subscore carried forward.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With Individual Mayo Subscore (Endoscopy Findings) at Week 8</title>
        <description>The endoscopy findings subscore of the Mayo score is rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Endoscopy finding scores: 0 = normal or inactive disease, 1 = mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 = moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions), and 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). Higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 had their baseline value carried forward from the time of the event onward. Participants who had a missing Mayo endoscopy subscore at Week 8 had the last available value for that subscore carried forward. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <description>Global definition of clinical remission: Mayo score&lt;=2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1. Mayo score included 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score = sum of 4 subscores and range from 0 to 12, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; 11 to 12 = severe; higher scores indicate worsening of disease. BF: participants received treatment with 1 or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists and/or vedolizumab at dose approved for treatment of UC and did not respond initially or responded initially but lost response or were intolerant of medication. Participants with prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ ostomy/colectomy before Week 8 or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 8 considered not in clinical remission. Endoscopy subscore assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With Endoscopic Healing at Week 8 by Biologic Failure Status</title>
        <description>Number of participants with endoscopic healing at week 8 by BF status were reported. Endoscopic healing is improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa. It is defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore = 0 (normal or inactive disease) or 1 (mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]). BF: Participants received treatment with 1/ more TNF antagonists and/or vedolizumab at dose approved for treatment of UC, and either did not respond initially, responded initially but then lost response/ were intolerant of medication. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to Week 8 or who had a missing endoscopy score at Week 8 were considered not to have endoscopic healing. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Number of Participants With a &gt;20-point Improvement From Baseline in Total Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The IBDQ is 32-item questionnaire for participants with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) used to evaluate disease-specific health-related quality of life. IBDQ consists of 32 items, each item score ranged from 1 (worst possible response) to 7 (best possible response). The 32 items were grouped into 4 domains: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function. The 4 domains were scored as follows: 10 to 70 (bowel symptoms); 5 to 35 (systemic symptoms); 12 to 84 (emotional function); and 5 to 35 (social function). For each domain, higher score indicated better quality of life. Total score is sum of each item score and ranges from 32 to 224 with higher score indicating better quality of life. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 8 or who had a missing IBDQ score at either baseline or Week 8 were considered not to have achieved a greater than 20-point improvement.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) at Week 8</title>
        <description>SF-36 evaluates 8 individual subscales (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each 8 scales scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Based on scale scores, physical component summary (PCS: calculated from subscales physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health) and mental component summary (MCS: calculated from subscales vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) scores were derived. Summary MCS and PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to Week 8 had their baseline value carried forward from time of event onward or participants who had missing component summary score at Week 8 had their last value carried forward.</description>

        <title>Induction Study - Change From Baseline in EuroQOL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health Questionnaire Index Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). The responses to 5 EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 (death) to 1 (full health). Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to Week 8 had their baseline value carried forward from time of event onward or participants who had missing score at a designated analysis timepoint had their last value carried forward.</description>

          <title>Induction Study - Change From Baseline in EuroQOL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health Questionnaire Index Score at Week 8</title>
          <description>EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). The responses to 5 EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 (death) to 1 (full health). Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy prior to Week 8 had their baseline value carried forward from time of event onward or participants who had missing score at a designated analysis timepoint had their last value carried forward.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study - Change From Maintenance Baseline in Mayo Score at Week 44</title>
        <description>The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe; higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy , or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to Week 44 had their Week 0 value of the induction study carried forward or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 44 had their last available individual Mayo subscores carried forward. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study - Change From Induction Baseline in Mayo Score at Week 44</title>
        <description>The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total Mayo score is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe; higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy, or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to the Week 44 had their Week 0 value of the induction study carried forward from the time of the event onward or who had all 4 Mayo subscores missing at Week 44 had their last available individual Mayo subscores carried forward. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <description>The rectal bleeding subscore of the Mayo Score is rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Rectal bleeding scores: 0 = no blood seen, 1 = streaks of blood with stool &lt;half time, 2 = obvious blood with stool most of time, and 3 = blood alone passed. Higher scores = worsening of disease. Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ due to AE of worsening of UC before Week 44 had their Week 0 value of induction study carried forward from time of event onward and who had missing Mayo subscores at timepoint had last available value for that subscore carried forward.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study - Number of Participants With Individual Mayo Subscore (Endoscopy Findings) at Week 44</title>
        <description>The endoscopy findings subscore of the Mayo score is rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Endoscopy finding scores: 0 =normal/ inactive disease, 1 =mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 =moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions), and 3 =severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). Higher scores = worsening of disease. Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ AE of worsening of UC before Week 44 had Week 0 value of induction study carried forward from time of event onward and who had missing endoscopy subscores at timepoint had last available value for that subscore carried forward. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

          <description>The endoscopy findings subscore of the Mayo score is rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Endoscopy finding scores: 0 =normal/ inactive disease, 1 =mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 =moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions), and 3 =severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). Higher scores = worsening of disease. Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ AE of worsening of UC before Week 44 had Week 0 value of induction study carried forward from time of event onward and who had missing endoscopy subscores at timepoint had last available value for that subscore carried forward. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study - Change From Maintenance Baseline in Partial Mayo Score Through Week 44</title>
        <description>The partial Mayo score, which is sum of 3 subscores of the Mayo score without the endoscopy subscore (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment subscores), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). The partial Mayo score is calculated as the sum of the 3 subscores and values range from 0 to 9; higher scores indicate worsening of the disease. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy, or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to the Week 44 had their Week 0 value of the induction study carried forward from the time of the event onward. Participants who had a missing partial Mayo score at a time point had their last available individual partial Mayo subscore carried forward to that time point.</description>

          <description>Symptomatic remission was defined as a Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 (normal number of stools) or 1 (1-2 stools more than normal) and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no blood seen). Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy, or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to the Week 44 were considered not to be in symptomatic remission from the time of the event onward. Participants who had both stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores missing at Week 44 were considered not to be in symptomatic remission for that visit. Endoscopy subscore as assessed during central review of video of endoscopy was used.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study: Number of Participants Who Maintained 20-point Improvement From Induction Baseline in IBDQ up to Week 44 Among Participants With a &gt;20-point Improvement in IBDQ at Maintenance Baseline</title>
        <description>IBDQ is 32-item questionnaire for participants with IBD used to evaluate disease-specific health-related quality of life. IBDQ consists of 32 items, each item score ranged from 1 (worst possible response) to 7 (best possible response). The 32 items were grouped into 4 domains: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function. The 4 domains were scored as:10 to 70 (bowel symptoms); 5 to 35 (systemic symptoms); 12 to 84 (emotional function); and 5 to 35 (social function). For each domain, higher score indicated better quality of life. Total score is sum of each item score and ranges from 32 to 224 with higher score indicating better quality of life. Participants who had prohibited change in UC medication/ ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ AE of worsening of UC before Week 44 or who had missing IBDQ score were considered not to have maintained improvement in IBDQ.</description>

          <title>Maintenance Study: Change From Maintenance Baseline in the IBDQ Score at Week 20 and 44</title>
          <description>IBDQ is 32-item questionnaire for participants with IBD used to evaluate disease-specific health-related quality of life. IBDQ consists of 32 items, each item score ranged from 1 (worst possible response) to 7 (best possible response). The 32 items were grouped into 4 domains: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function. The 4 domains were scored as follows: 10 to 70 (bowel symptoms); 5 to 35 (systemic symptoms); 12 to 84 (emotional function); and 5 to 35 (social function). For each domain, higher score indicated better quality of life. Total score is sum of each item score and ranges from 32 to 224 with higher score indicating better quality of life. Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or ostomy or colectomy prior to the Week 44 had their Week 0 value of the induction study carried forward from the time of the event onward and participants who had a missing IBDQ score at a timepoint had their last value carried forward.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study: Change From Maintenance Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) at Weeks 20 and 44</title>
        <description>SF-36 evaluates 8 individual subscales (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health). Each 8 scales scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Based on scale scores, PCS (calculated from subscales physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health) and MCS (calculated from subscales vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) scores were derived. Summary MCS and PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Participants with prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ due to AE of worsening of UC before Week 44 had Week 0 value of IS carried forward from time of event onward and participants with missing component summary score at timepoint had last available value carried forward.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Study: Change From Maintenance Baseline in EuroQOL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health Questionnaire Index Score at Weeks 20 and 44</title>
        <description>EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). The responses to 5 EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 (death) to 1 (full health). Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy, or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to the Week 44 had their Week 0 value of the induction study carried forward from the time of the event onward and participants who had a missing individual scale score at a timepoint had their last available value carried forward.</description>

          <title>Maintenance Study: Percentage of Participants With Change From Maintenance Baseline in EuroQOL-5 (EQ-5D) Dimensions Score at Weeks 20 and 44</title>
          <description>EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). The responses to 5 EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 (death) to 1 (full health). Participants who had prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to AE of worsening of UC prior to Week 44 had their Week 0 value of induction study carried forward from time of event onward and who had missing individual scale score at timepoint had their last available value carried forward. Percentage of participants with various responses to the 5 dimensions were reported.</description>
          <population>PEAS consisted of all participants who were in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction and were randomized at Week 0 of the maintenance study to ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w, ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w, or placebo SC. Here, n (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were analyzed for this OM at specified timepoint.</population>

        <description>Mucosal healing included EH and HH. EH: endoscopy subscore of 0 (normal/ inactive disease) or 1 (mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]). HH: neutrophil infiltration in &lt;5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, no erosions/ ulcerations/ granulation tissue. Participants with prohibited change in concomitant UC medication/ ostomy/ colectomy/ used rescue medication after clinical flare/ discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect/ due to AE of worsening of UC prior to Week 44/ missing endoscopy score/ missing any component of histologic healing (i.e. assessment of neutrophils in crypts, crypt destruction/ erosions/ ulcerations/ granulations) at Week 44 and had unevaluable biopsy (biopsy collected but could not assessed due to sample preparation/ technical errors) at Week 44, but who did not achieve endoscopic healing, considered not to have mucosal healing.

        <description>Change from Maintenance baseline in fecal lactoferrin concentration at Weeks 8, 24, and 44 were reported. Participants who had a prohibited change in concomitant UC medication or an ostomy or colectomy, or used a rescue medication after clinical flare, or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC prior to the Week 44 had their Week 0 value of the induction study carried forward from the time of the event onward.
