    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation of breast cancer. Ten patients with
      early-stage breast cancer with a maximum diameter of 3 cm will undergo MR-HIFU ablation,
      followed by MRI and surgical resection to evaluate treatment effect. The main purpose of the
      study is to demonstrate the feasibility of total tumor ablation with MR-HIFU. The secondary
      objective is safety assessment.

    <description>Ten patients undergo MR-HIFU ablation with the Sonalleve MR-HIFU Breast Tumor Therapy System (Profound Medical). According to a treat-and-resect protocol, these patients also undergo standard therapy consisting of breast cancer surgery 1 to 2 weeks after MR-HIFU treatment (+/- radiotherapy).</description>

    <description>Magnetic Resonance-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a completely non-invasive treatment technique. HIFU uses focused ultrasound to achieve temperature rise in the targeted tissue. Real time monitoring of the treatment with MR-thermometry is used to ensure optimal safety.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, aged 18 years and older.

          -  Able to give informed consent herself.

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance score ≤ 2.

          -  Biopsy proven cT1-2 N0-2 MX invasive breast cancer with a size of ≤ 3.0 cm.

          -  Histological type of tumor: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), not otherwise specified
             (NOS) or no special type (NST).

          -  The target breast fits in the cup of the dedicated MR-HIFU breast system.

          -  Patient weight is limited to ≤ 90 kg, because of restrictions to the HIFU table top.

        Additional inclusion criteria based on DCE-MRI findings:

          -  The distance of the tumor, including a 5 mm margin around the tumor, from the skin,
             nipple and pectoral wall is at least 1.0 cm measured on MRI.

          -  The tumor is located within the reach of the HIFU beam produced by the transducers in
             the HIFU breast system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with: neo-adjuvant systemic therapy in the past 3 months or
             radiotherapy or thermal therapy or surgery of any kind in the targeted breast.

          -  Contraindications to MR imaging according to the hospital guidelines (e.g. pacemaker
             in situ, severe claustrophobia, big metal implants, body size incompatible with MR
             bore).

          -  Contraindications to administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent, including:
             prior allergic reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent, kidney disease (e.g.
             nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy) and/or renal failure
             (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1,73m2).

          -  Contra-indications for procedural sedation analgesia with Propofol and Esketamine or
             Propofol and Remifentanil.

          -  Extensive intraductal components in the lesion determined by biopsy.

          -  Scar tissue or surgical clips in the HIFU beam path.

          -  Inability to lie in prone position.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Communication barrier with patient.

        The following groups of patients will be excluded because the risk of adjuvant over- or
        undertreatment due to performing the Bloom and Richardson (B&amp;R) grading on the tumor biopsy
        is considered to high:

          -  N0, Her2neu negative, &lt;35 years, ≤1cm (T1a/b) with B&amp;R grade 1 or 2 on biopsy.

          -  N0 Her2neu negative, ER/PR negative (triple negative), 35-70yr, 1.1-2cm (T1c) with B&amp;R
             grade 1 or 2 on biopsy.

          -  N0, Her2neu negative, ER/PR positive &gt; 50%, ductal carcinoma, 60-70yr, 1.1-2cm (T1c),
             with B&amp;R grade 3 on biopsy and if the MammaPrint is not reimbursed by health insurance
             also for grade 1 on biopsy.

          -  N0, Her2neu negative, ER/PR positive, ductal carcinoma, 35-60yr, 1.1-2cm (T1c) with
             B&amp;R grade 1 on biopsy.

          -  N0, Her2neu negative, ER/PR positive, but ≤50%, ductal carcinoma, 60-70yr, 1.1-2cm
             (T1c) with B&amp;R grade 1.

        The following group of patients will be excluded based on the results of the MammaPrint:

        • Only if the MammaPrint is reimbursed by health insurance: N0, Her2neu negative, ER/PR
        positive, &gt; 50% ductal carcinoma, 60-70yr, 1.1-2cm (T1c), with B&amp;R grade 1 and MammaPrint
        high risk.
