    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best method of delivery of
      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in improving heart function in patients
      with heart failure caused by anthracyclines (a type of chemotherapy drug used in cancer
      treatment). MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into
      many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart
      failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse
      remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from
      progression to advanced heart failure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered
      by intravenous infusion in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure
      secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion in
      patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt; 40%)
      and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive allogeneic hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes once weekly
      for 4 weeks and standard of care drugs for heart failure.

      ARM II: Patients receive only standard of care drugs for heart failure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months and then
      at 12 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>90% criterion achieved if the first 2 patients on investigational arm die and the single patient assigned to the control arm is still alive. It will also be achieved if 4 of the first 10 investigational patients die and with no deaths among the 5 patients on the control arm; however, the probability of an increased death rate would be less than 90% if 1 of the 5 control patients had died. As a third example, the 90% criterion would be achieved should there be 7 deaths of 20 investigational patients and 1 death of 10 control patients, but not if there had been 6 deaths among the 20 investigational patients. Statistical analyses of safety will be descriptive.</description>
