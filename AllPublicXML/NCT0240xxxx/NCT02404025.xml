  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open label, non-randomized, phase II study of eltrombopag in combination with
      rabbit ATG/CsA in subjects with moderate or more severe AA who did not received prior
      ATG/ALG-based immunosuppressive therapy. The objective was to assess additive effects of
      eltorombopag on overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months (Week 26) of treatment with ATG/CsA.
      Subjects were assessed at least weekly for safety during the period from the start of ATG/CsA
      to 4 weeks after the start of administration of eltrombopag. After that, subjects had visits
      every 2 weeks until Week 26. Subjects in whom the treatment was assessed as effective at Week
      26 could continued treatment with eltrombopag after 6 months when clinically indicated at the
      discretion of the investigator. There were five follow-up visits: at discontinuation of the
      treatment of eltrombopag, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 26 after treatment discontinuation. As
      this study was the first Japanese phase II study in which this product was administered in
      combination with ATG/CsA to subjects with naive moderate or more severe AA, the subject
      number of this study was determined to be 10 based on the feasibility survey.

    <description>Subjects received rabbit ATG diluted by 500 mL of saline or 5% glucose injection at a dose of 2.5 to 3.75 mg per kilogram (kg) per day for 5 days as a slow intravenous infusion over 6 hours. CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag wasadministered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26.After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator's discretion.</description>

          <description>Subjects received rabbit ATG diluted by 500 mL of saline or 5% glucose injection at a dose of 2.5 to 3.75 mg per kilogram (kg) per day for 5 days as a slow intravenous infusion over 6 hours. CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>

            <description>Subjects received rabbit ATG diluted by 500 mL of saline or 5% glucose injection at a dose of 2.5 to 3.75 mg per kilogram (kg) per day for 5 days as a slow intravenous infusion over 6 hours. CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>

        <description>Platelet or RBC transfusions will be based on physician's subjective judgement. Platelet transfusion will be done if the platelet count is less than 10×10^9/L with significant bleeding tendency or the platelet count is less than 20×10^9/L with pyrexia. RBC transfusion will be done to keep the hemoglobin concentration at over 7 g/dL or in the presence of clinical symptoms such as dyspnea.</description>

CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>

            <description>Subjects received rabbit ATG diluted by 500 mL of saline or 5% glucose injection at a dose of 2.5 to 3.75 mg per kilogram (kg) per day for 5 days as a slow intravenous infusion over 6 hours. CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>

Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>

            <description>Subjects received rabbit ATG diluted by 500 mL of saline or 5% glucose injection at a dose of 2.5 to 3.75 mg per kilogram (kg) per day for 5 days as a slow intravenous infusion over 6 hours. CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>

            <description>Subjects received rabbit ATG diluted by 500 mL of saline or 5% glucose injection at a dose of 2.5 to 3.75 mg per kilogram (kg) per day for 5 days as a slow intravenous infusion over 6 hours. CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg per kg twice a day from day 0. The dose level was adjusted based on the monitoring of blood level or renal function. Eltrombopag was initiated on day 14 and it could be delayed up to 2 weeks if the subject had infection, serum sickness, or other adverse events. Eltrombopag was administered orally once a day at fasting at an initial dose of 75 mg, and the dose adjusted every 2 weeks according to the platelet count. Eltrombopag and CsA were continued until Week 26. After Week 26, eligible subjects received eltrombopag; and CsA was tapered or maintained as per the investigator’s discretion.</description>
