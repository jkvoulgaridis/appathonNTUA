  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a tool to facilitate asthma self-management in children, the
      electronic-AsthmaTracker (e-AT). The e-AT changes ambulatory asthma care delivery to a new
      model that is continuous and proactive, focusing on prevention and control, rather than
      reactive and focusing on management of asthma attacks. The e-AT 1) engages parents in weekly
      monitoring of their child's chronic asthma symptoms, 2) guides parents to recognize warning
      signs of asthma attacks in order to prompt appropriate interventions and timely visits to
      Primary Care Providers, and 3) provides Primary Care Providers with real-time, objective
      patient data to assess the effectiveness of asthma therapy and prompt adjustments. In a
      preliminary study of the paper-based version of the AT, frequent users had significantly
      fewer emergency department (ED) and hospital visits. Parent comments during the e-AT pilot
      testing revealed that the tool was useful in helping them manage their child's asthma and
      were interested in assessing the tool's effectiveness and in identifying and addressing
      barriers to their sustained use of the e-AT.

      Improving asthma control in children will be facilitated by broad e-AT dissemination, and by
      identifying and addressing critical factors that contribute to parent sustained participation
      in self-management. The investigators propose to assess the effectiveness of the new
      ambulatory care model supported by the e-AT and conduct an e-AT process evaluation, assessing
      barriers and facilitators of sustained parent use. The investigators will engage parents
      throughout this study to identify and address themes that matter to them. The target
      population is children with persistent asthma, ages 2-17 years. The investigators have
      engaged 10 parents since conception of this project, from the planning to design and
      validation of the paper-AT, and the design and pilot testing of the e-AT. Input from parents
      was received through 3 iterative focus groups (one for the paper-AT and 2 for the e-AT) and
      facilitated discussions to inform the development of this proposal including research
      objectives and outcome measures. In addition, the investigators have recruited other key
      stakeholders for whom the results of the research will be relevant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the following specific aims, the investigators will:

      Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness of the new ambulatory care model, by comparing outcomes at
      the 1.a. child (child's quality of life (QOL), asthma control, missed school days),
      1.b.parent (satisfaction, parent missed work days) and 1.c. clinic (ED/hospital visits)
      levels, between clinics randomly assigned to either the standard e-AT intervention vs.
      intensive e-AT intervention. 1.d. Use non randomized comparisons to determine the
      effectiveness of the e-AT relative to a control group (usual care) in which the e-AT was not
      used

      Aim 2: Assess the association of QOL, asthma control, and ED/hospital admissions with the
      prior frequency of e-AT use and assess if the association differs between parent subgroups
      (high vs. low literacy, Medicaid vs. private insurance, and frequent vs. less frequent e-AT
      users).

      Aim 3: Determine the association of demographic, socio-economic, behavioral, and technology
      factors with sustained parent participation in asthma self-management.

      The outcome measures are:

      Primary Outcome:

        1. Child quality of life (QOL)

           Secondary Outcomes:

        2. Child asthma control

        3. Child interrupted/missed school days

        4. Child use of oral steroids (surrogate measure of an asthma exacerbation)

        5. Parent satisfaction with care

        6. Parent interruption/missed work days

        7. Clinics: ED/Hospital admissions

    <masking_description>We initially enrolled 327 randomized (at the clinic level) participants who received the e-AT interventions overall, including 267 participants receiving the standard intervention and 60 receiving the intensive intervention. We also included another set of 599 non-randomized matched controls of patients with persistent asthma retrieved electronically from non-participating clinics. This is why we stated that 926 subjects (327+599) overall were included.</masking_description>

        Facility Eligibility

        Clinics are eligible for participation if they meet the following criteria:

          1. Primary care clinics with the clinical leadership to adopt use of e-AT for asthma
             management.

          2. Have patients between 2 and 17 years of age with persistent asthma.

          3. Ability of the facility to accommodate patient enrollment and training about use of
             e-AT.

        Patient Inclusion Criteria

          1. Children ages 2 through 17 years and their parents (main parents or caregiver)

          2. English speakers

          3. Children who received or are receiving asthma treatment (at participating clinics).

          4. Parents have Internet access

          5. Children with persistent asthma.

        Patient Exclusion Criteria:

        As this is a pragmatic trial assessing evidence of the e-AT in a real clinical environment,
        no patients will be excluded as long as they meet inclusion criteria. However, during the
        time of analysis, we will conduct a sub-analysis, comparing the effectiveness of the new
        care model among patients with or without co-morbid conditions that may affect measured
        asthma outcomes. These include patients with a history or increased risk of pulmonary
        disease (cystic fibrosis, bronco-pulmonary dysplasia, aspiration pneumonia, severe Cerebral
        Palsy (CP) with aspiration risk, technology dependency (gastrostomy tube, tracheostomy),
        history of congenital heart disease requiring surgical correction or with complicating
        congestive heart failure requiring medical management, immunodeficiency (including patients
        on immunosuppressants), and malignancies.

        <title>Patient Quality of Life (QOL), Compared Mean QOL Change From Baseline at Each Follow-up Assessment Between the Clinics Assigned to the Intensive and Standard e-AT Interventions</title>
        <description>Patient QOL and missed school days was collected longitudinally through surveys of the study population defined above. The QOL questionnaire included the Integrated Therapeutics Group Child Asthma Short Form (ITG-CASF) and was used at baseline (at first assessment), 3, 6, and 12 months in the study.
Items within QOL scales are summed and linearly transformed from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>
        <time_frame>Quality of Life assessed at baseline, then compared to 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after intervention.</time_frame>
        <population>We enrolled 327, 2 clinics with only 1 patient enrolled were excluded, leaving 325 patients. Of 325, 7 did not provide baselines and were excluded, leaving 318 (261 standard vs. 57 intensive) participants. Row numbers differ due to different number of participants completing 3, 6, and 12 months follow-ups, due to withdrawal and loss to follow-up.</population>

        <description>Patient QOL and missed school days was collected longitudinally through surveys of the study population defined above. The QOL questionnaire included the Integrated Therapeutics Group Child Asthma Short Form - ITG-CASF and was used at baseline (at first assessment), 3, 6, and 12 months in the study. Items within scales are summed and linearly transformed from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

        <description>Number of parent interrupted/missed work days were collected longitudinally at the same time as collecting the QOL scores: baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months in the study.
Number of parent interrupted/missed work days during the 3 months prior to baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up surveys were counted.</description>
        <time_frame>Interrupted/missed work days were measured baseline 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
        <population>We had 261 Standard and 57 Intensive e-AT who completed baseline survey. Numbers in the row differ due to different number of participants who completed 3, 6, and 12 months surveys, due to participant compliance, withdrawal or loss-to-follow-up. 3, 6, and 12 month measurements were compared to Baseline, between Standard vs Intensive interventions</population>

        <description>Asthma control information was collected through the e-AT, comparing change of asthma control from baseline to quarter 1, quarter 2, quarter 3 and quarter 4.
Asthma control was measured using the Asthma Control Test (ACT), which scale ranged from 5-25, with 5=poorly controlled and 25=well controlled.
Each patient submitted an ACT score weekly for 12 months.</description>

        <title>Oral Steroid Use, Early vs Late Starting Clinics (During the 3 Months When Late Starting Clinics Have Not Started the e-AT)</title>
        <description>Use of oral steroid was evaluated using data collected through Intermountain Healthcare claims data and oral steroids prescribed. Statistical analysis was not conducted since the numbers of ED/Hospital admissions was very small (2 and 0) in both group (during the 3 months study window). Here we used intent-to-treat analysis and included the overall 325 (rather than 318 used in analysis of other outcomes) participants</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat analysis was used, including all 325. Randomized comparisons compared intensive vs. standard e-AT, but not e-AT efficacy vs usual care. This nonrandomized analysis (Early vs Late Clinics) assesses e-AT efficacy, comparing outcomes between “period” clinics were under the e-AT vs “periods” other clinics were not using the e-AT.</population>
