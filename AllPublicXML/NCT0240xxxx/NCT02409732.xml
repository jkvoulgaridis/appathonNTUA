      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of PDT with blue light and topical Levulan in the
      treatment of actinic cheilitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening visit, up to three scheduled treatments, and two
      scheduled office visits. There can be a three-day window period for each scheduled visit in
      order to accommodate the subject's schedule and unforeseen scheduling conflicts.

        1. Visit 1 (Screening): Subjects can be screened for the study up to two weeks before Visit
           2 (Baseline). During screening, the study will be reviewed, written informed consent
           obtained, and eligibility confirmed. If applicable, the washout from prohibited
           medications or treatments will be determined at this visit.

        2. Visit 2 (Baseline): Following signed, written informed consent and confirmation of
           eligibility, all subjects will have their lips photographed. Medical history,
           dermatologic exam, urine pregnancy test (if applicable), review of concomitant
           medications, clinical evaluations, and tolerability assessments will be performed at
           this visit. Study medication application to clean skin will be followed by a 90 minute
           incubation period under occlusion. Subsequently, patients will be exposed to blue light
           therapy for 16 minutes and 40 seconds. Post-therapy assessments will be performed
           afterwards, as well as education on appropriate sun protection methods.

        3. Visits 3-4: Subjects will return every six weeks for up to two additional treatments.
           Treatment will be discontinued once the patient has achieved clinical clearance.
           Tolerability assessments, study medication application, blue light therapy, post-therapy
           assessments, and photographs will be performed.

        4. Visit 5-6 (End of Study): Subjects will return 12 and 24 weeks after the last treatment
           for clinical evaluations, tolerability assessments, and photographs.

    <description>Clearance will be estimated clinically as minimal (0%-25%), mild (26%-50%), moderate (51%-75%), good (76%-99%), or complete (100%). Results will also be evaluated by comparing photographs before and immediately after treatments, and 12 and 24 weeks after the last treatment.</description>

    <measure>Average Change in Participant Reported Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Subject reported pain before, during and after blue light illumination was documented using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). The maximum change in pain is 10 for each occurrence (pain before compared to during treatment and pain during compared to after treatment). This is multiplied by the number of subjects and then divided by the number of treatments to generate the range. The summation of the change between subject reported pain prior to compared to during blue light treatment was divided by the total number of treatments to obtain the average value. The summation of the change between subject reported pain during compared to after blue light treatment was divided by the total number of treatments to obtain the average value.</description>

    <measure>Average Change in Local Skin Reactions to Blue Light Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of swelling, erythema, and flaking/scaling were conducted after each treatment and two days post-treatment using a five-point ordinal scale (0: none to 4: severe). The average change in swelling, erythema and flaking/scaling after each treatment and two days post treatment were divided by the 50 total treatments to obtain the average value.</description>

    <description>Assessments of vesiculation/pustulation, erosion/ulceration, and crusting were conducted immediately after each blue light treatment using a five-point ordinal scale (0: none to 4: severe). The presence or absence of hyperpigmentation in the treatment area was also documented after each treatment visit. The total number of participants who developed a local skin reaction is documented.</description>

        <description>Subject reported pain before, during and after blue light illumination was documented using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). The maximum change in pain is 10 for each occurrence (pain before compared to during treatment and pain during compared to after treatment). This is multiplied by the number of subjects and then divided by the number of treatments to generate the range. The summation of the change between subject reported pain prior to compared to during blue light treatment was divided by the total number of treatments to obtain the average value.
