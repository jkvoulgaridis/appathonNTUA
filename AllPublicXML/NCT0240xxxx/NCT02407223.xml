  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in adult
      participants with active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA) measured by the
      reduction in signs and symptoms of nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in the treatment of participants with active
      non-radiographic axial spondylo arthritis. Participants will receive either placebo or
      ustekinumab 45 or 90 milligram (mg). Participants will primarily be assessed for Assessment
      of Spondylo Arthritis (ASAS) International Society criteria 20 at Week 24. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
    </textblock>

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was stopped because ustekinumab did not achieve key endpoints in a related study.
    The safety profile was consistent with past ustekinumab studies.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 50% Improvement From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), and morning stiffness (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 centimeter (cm) visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe. In order to give each of the 5 symptoms equal weight, the mean of the 2 questions about morning stiffness were added to the total of the remaining 4 scores, and the final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is the average of the overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in response based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), non-responder[NRI] (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is composed with 10 questions (each question is answered with a visual analogue scale 0-10 cm) to assess the disease severity, including the first 8 questions regarding to functional anatomy related activities and the remaining 2 questions related to daily activities of ankylosing spondylitis participants. Each question is a 10cm VAS with a value between 0 (easy) and 10 (impossible). The final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 scores. The BASFI score is the average of the 10 responses and has a possible minimum value of 0 and a possible maximum value of 10. Higher BASFI score indicates more severe functional limitations of the participant due to AS. Early escape rule was applied (measurement value at Week 20 and Week 24 was set as missing).</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 356 participants were randomized and received treatment (116 participants to placebo, 118 participants to ustekinumab 45 milligram [mg], and 122 participants to ustekinumab 90 mg).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants received placebo subcutaneous (SC) at Week 0,4,16 and 20. At Week 16, participants in placebo group who qualified for early escape (EE) criteria (with &lt;10 % improvement from baseline in both total back pain and morning stiffness measures at Week 12 and 16) re-randomized to receive ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg at Week 16,20,28 followed by every 12 Weeks (q12w) through Week 52. Participants received placebo SC at Week 24 to maintain blind. At Week 24, remaining participants in placebo group who did not meet EE criteria, re-randomized to receive ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg at Week 24, 28 followed by q12w through Week 52. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease ASDAS [ESR]&lt;1.3 at Week 40, 52 underwent re-randomization to either ustekinumab or placebo. Participants who did not achieve inactive disease either at Week 40 or 52 received previously assigned ustekinumab dose at scheduled visits. Last dose was scheduled for Week 88 and last study visit for Week 100.</description>

        <description>ASAS 20 defined as improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 % from baseline and absolute improvement from baseline of 1 on a 0 to 10 centimeter(cm) scale in at least 3 of following 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well,10=very poor), total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain,10=most severe pain), BASFI (self-assessment represented as mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to participant's functional anatomy and 2 to participant's ability to cope with everyday life), Inflammation (0 to 10 cm;0=none,10=very severe); absence of deterioration (&gt;= 20% and worsening of at least 1 on a 0 to 10 cm scale) from baseline in remaining domain. ASAS20 response based on imputed data using treatment failure (consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules (consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24),non-responder[NRI] (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

            <description>Participants received placebo subcutaneous (SC) at Week 0,4,16 and 20. At Week 16, participants in placebo group who qualified for early escape (EE) criteria (with &lt;10 % improvement from baseline in both total back pain and morning stiffness measures at Week 12 and 16) re-randomized to receive ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg at Week 16,20,28 followed by every 12 Weeks (q12w) through Week 52. Participants received placebo SC at Week 24 to maintain blind. At Week 24, remaining participants in placebo group who did not meet EE criteria, re-randomized to receive ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg at Week 24, 28 followed by q12w through Week 52. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease ASDAS [ESR]&lt;1.3 at Week 40, 52 underwent re-randomization to either ustekinumab or placebo. Participants who did not achieve inactive disease either at Week 40 or 52 received previously assigned ustekinumab dose at scheduled visits. Last dose was scheduled for Week 88 and last study visit for Week 100.</description>

        <description>The BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), and morning stiffness (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 centimeter (cm) visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe. In order to give each of the 5 symptoms equal weight, the mean of the 2 questions about morning stiffness were added to the total of the remaining 4 scores, and the final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is the average of the overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in response based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), non-responder[NRI] (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

ASDAS scores calculated as: ASDAS(CRP) = (0.121*total back pain)+ (0.110*PGA)+ (0.073*peripheral pain/swelling)+ (0.058* DMS)+ (0.579*Ln(CRP+1)). The disease activity, TBP, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and DMS on a numeric rating scale (0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of =&gt;2 hours). Inactive disease is defined as an ASDAS score &lt;1.3.

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) C-reactive Protein (CRP) Inactive Disease (&lt;1.3) at Week 24</title>
          <description>ASDAS includes CRP milligram per liter (mg/L); four additional self-reported items (rated on 0-10cm VAS or 0-10 numerical rating scale [NRS]) included total back pain(TBP), duration of morning stiffness (DMS), peripheral pain/swelling and patient global assessment(PGA). ASDAS scores calculated as: ASDAS(CRP) = (0.121*total back pain)+ (0.110*PGA)+ (0.073*peripheral pain/swelling)+ (0.058* DMS)+ (0.579*Ln(CRP+1)). The disease activity, TBP, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and DMS on a numeric rating scale (0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of =&gt;2 hours). Inactive disease is defined as an ASDAS score &lt;1.3. ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease is based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), NRI (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 50% Improvement From Baseline in BASDAI at Week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20</title>
        <description>The BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), and morning stiffness (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 centimeter (cm) visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe. In order to give each of the 5 symptoms equal weight, the mean of the 2 questions about morning stiffness will be added to the total of the remaining 4 scores, and the final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is the average of the overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in BASDAI based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), NRI(missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responders).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 50% Improvement From Baseline in BASDAI at Week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20</title>
          <description>The BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), and morning stiffness (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 centimeter (cm) visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe. In order to give each of the 5 symptoms equal weight, the mean of the 2 questions about morning stiffness will be added to the total of the remaining 4 scores, and the final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is the average of the overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom. 50% improvement in BASDAI based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), NRI(missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responders).</description>

        <description>The BASFI is composed with 10 questions (each question is answered with a visual analogue scale 0-10 cm) to assess the disease severity, including the first 8 questions regarding to functional anatomy related activities and the remaining 2 questions related to daily activities of AS participants. Each question is a 10cm VAS with a value between 0 (easy) and 10 (impossible). The final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 scores. The BASFI score is the average of the 10 responses and has a possible minimum value of 0 and a possible maximum value of 10. Higher BASFI score indicates more severe functional limitations of the participant due to AS. Missing data were imputed using early escape rule (measurement value at Week 20 and 24 was set as missing). Here 'n' defined as number of participants who were analyzed at each specified timepoint, for each arm, respectively.</description>

        <description>ASDAS includes CRP mg/L; four additional self-reported items (rated on 0-10cm VAS or 0-10 numerical rating scale [NRS]) included total back pain(TBP), duration of morning stiffness (DMS), peripheral pain/swelling and patient global assessment(PGA). ASDAS scores calculated as: ASDAS(CRP) = (0.121*total back pain)+ (0.110*PGA)+ (0.073*peripheral pain/swelling)+ (0.058* DMS)+ (0.579*Ln(CRP+1)). The disease activity, TBP, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and DMS on a numeric rating scale (0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of =&gt;2 hours). Inactive disease is defined as an ASDAS score &lt;1.3. ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease is based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), NRI (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>

            <description>Participants received placebo subcutaneous (SC) at Week 0,4,16 and 20. At Week 16, participants in placebo group who qualified for early escape (EE) criteria (with &lt;10 % improvement from baseline in both total back pain and morning stiffness measures at Week 12 and 16) re-randomized to receive ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg at Week 16,20,28 followed by every 12 Weeks (q12w) through Week 52. Participants received placebo SC at Week 24 to maintain blind. At Week 24, remaining participants in placebo group who did not meet EE criteria, re-randomized to receive ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg at Week 24, 28 followed by q12w through Week 52. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease ASDAS [ESR]&lt;1.3 at Week 40, 52 underwent re-randomization to either ustekinumab or placebo. Participants who did not achieve inactive disease either at Week 40 or 52 received previously assigned ustekinumab dose at scheduled visits. Last dose was scheduled for Week 88 and last study visit for Week 100.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease (&lt;1.3) at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20</title>
          <description>ASDAS includes CRP mg/L; four additional self-reported items (rated on 0-10cm VAS or 0-10 numerical rating scale [NRS]) included total back pain(TBP), duration of morning stiffness (DMS), peripheral pain/swelling and patient global assessment(PGA). ASDAS scores calculated as: ASDAS(CRP) = (0.121*total back pain)+ (0.110*PGA)+ (0.073*peripheral pain/swelling)+ (0.058* DMS)+ (0.579*Ln(CRP+1)). The disease activity, TBP, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and DMS on a numeric rating scale (0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of =&gt;2 hours). Inactive disease is defined as an ASDAS score &lt;1.3. ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease is based on imputed data using treatment failure(consider non-responders at and after treatment failure),early escape rules(consider non-responder at Week 20 and 24), NRI (missing responses at post baseline visit imputed as non-responder).</description>
