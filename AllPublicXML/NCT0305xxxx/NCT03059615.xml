  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, Open-label, one arm study in which the eligible patients will be treated
      with IV Nerofe, three times a week in 28 days cycles (up to 12 cycles).

      Evaluation will include safety procedures, blood level of study drug in certain time points,
      immune system response and tests checking the mechanism of the drug action.

      Nerofe is a first-in-class hormone peptide with cancer suppressive properties. It works in
      three mechanisms of action. The purpose of this research is to study Nerofe's effect in
      patients diagnosed with AML and MDS.

    <description>Nerofe is a first-in-class hormone-peptide with cancer suppressive properties. Nerofe is a derivative of the human hormone-peptide Tumor-Cells Apoptosis Factor (TCApF). It contains 14 amino-acids. Binding Nerofe to the T1/ST2 receptor caused a rapid activation both of Caspase 8 and Bcl-2 mediated downstream in proliferating cancer cells.</description>

    <description>Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis.</description>
