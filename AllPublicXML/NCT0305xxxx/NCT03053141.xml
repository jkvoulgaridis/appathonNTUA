    <textblock>
      The objective of the RHAPSODY study is to evaluate the performance of new software features
      in subjects undergoing standard of care catheter-based endocardial mapping for atrial or
      ventricular tachyarrhythmias using a commercial Rhythmia Mapping System. Results from this
      study will be used to guide development and refinement of new software features that may be
      implemented in future commercial software releases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Rhythmia Mapping System is designed for electroanatomical mapping in catheter ablation
      procedures by optimizing the need for speed and accuracy. The system is able to
      simultaneously acquire data from multiple electrodes. In addition, based on user-defined
      criteria, the system is able to efficiently acquire data over multiple cardiac beats. When
      used in conjunction with the Rhythmia Mapping Catheter, the system is able to acquire up to
      hundreds of points per minute leading to fast and detailed map creation.

      Since its market release, physicians and users have gained experience with the Boston
      Scientific Rhythmia Mapping System in the human clinical setting. Improvements to the first
      generation system are in development and include new and improved software features and
      mapping algorithms to enhance the clinical operation. These new and improved software
      features and algorithms require leveraging clinical use data as part of the development and
      iteration process.

      This study will evaluate the performance of potential next-generation software features in a
      low-risk clinical environment by streaming raw signals from a commercial Rhythmia Workstation
      during standard of care cardiac mapping and ablation treatments for tachyarrhythmias,
      specifically atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardias, and ventricular tachycardia. The data
      will be evaluated on a parallel investigational Rhythmia Workstation using prototype software
      features. These next-generation software features and algorithms will not be available to the
      physician during the case and will therefore have no diagnostic or therapeutic impact on the
      clinical case.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 or above, or above legal age and willing and capable of giving informed consent
             specific to national law

          2. Scheduled for standard of care catheter-based endocardial mapping for atrial or
             ventricular tachyarrhythmias using a commercial Rhythmia Mapping System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prothrombotic or bleeding tendency due to coagulopathy or blood dyscrasia

          2. Inability to tolerate heparin therapy (e.g. heparin induced thrombocytopenia, allergy,
             etc.)

          3. Prosthetic or stenotic valves in the chamber where the intended mapping will occur, or
             in the path of the catheter access route

          4. Active systemic infection or sepsis

          5. Hemodynamic instability or shock at baseline precluding ablation in the assessment of
             the investigator.

          6. Presence of intracardiac thrombus, tumor, or other abnormality which precludes
             catheter introduction

         12. Long QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, or Torsade de Pointes

         13. Congenital heart disease with or without corrective surgery that would complicate a
             mapping procedure

         14. Subjects having untreatable allergy to contrast media

         15. Vascular pathology or tortuosity precluding standard vascular access techniques

         16. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study, except when the patient is
             participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry
             with no associated treatments. Each instance should be brought to the attention of the
             sponsor to determine eligibility.
