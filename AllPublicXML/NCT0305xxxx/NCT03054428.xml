    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response was an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 were reported. [Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Participants with missing score at week 16 were considered as a non-responder. Participant considered non-responder after rescue treatment use. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized).]</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Peak Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used by subjects to report intensity of pruritus (itch) during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: For maximum itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable,' how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot; For post-baseline NRS, the mean weekly NRS was calculated as the prorated average of the reported daily NRS within the week. For example, if there were 3 scores in a week, the prorated average = (score1 + score2 + score3) /3. [Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing peak NRS at Week 16 were counted as non-responders.]</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 45 sites in the United States and Canada between 21 Mar 2017 and 05 Jun 2018. A total of 295 participants were screened, of which, 251 were eligible. The most common causes for screening failures were lack of adequate disease severity and lack of willingness to comply with study visits and procedures.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants were randomized (1:1:1) &amp; stratified by baseline Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score (3 vs 4) &amp; body weight (&lt;60 kg vs ≥60 kg) to 16 wks treatment with dupilumab every 2 wks (q2w) or q4w,or placebo q2w.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants received placebo matching dupilumab once every 2 weeks (Q2W) (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). Participants in the &lt;60-kilogram (kg) weight stratum received, in a 1:1 ratio, either placebo matching 200 milligram (mg) or placebo matching 300 milligram (mg). In the ≥60 kg weight stratum, the participants randomized to the placebo group received placebo matching 300 mg dupilumab.</description>

          <description>Participants received once every 4 weeks (Q4W) subcutaneous (SC) injections of 300 milligrams (mg) dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. To maintain blinding, all participants received an injection once every 2 weeks (Q2W) from day 1 to week 14. Participants received placebo 2 millilitre (mL) injection at the weeks dupilumab was not given.</description>

          <description>Peak Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used by participants to report intensity of pruritus (itch) during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question for maximum itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable,’ how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?” Baseline NRS was the prorated average of NRSs reported continuously for 7 days right before and on the baseline visit (i.e., study day -6 to day 1).</description>

          <description>The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults with atopic eczema. The format is participant response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on symptom frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = ‘no days’, 1 = ‘1 to 2 days’, 2 = ‘3 to 4 days’, 3 = ‘5 to 6’ days, and 4 = ‘every day’). The total score is the sum of the 7 items which is ranged from 0 to 28; a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life (QOL).</description>

A person could score between 0 &amp; 21 for each subscale (anxiety &amp; depression). A high score is indicative of a poor state. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale are considered a 'definite case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8 to 10 represents 'probable case’ &amp; 0 to 7 'not a case'. The total score was the sum of the 2 sub-scores; therefore, the full range of possible values for the reported data is 0-42.</description>

        <description>Peak Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used by subjects to report intensity of pruritus (itch) during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: For maximum itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable,' how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot; For post-baseline NRS, the mean weekly NRS was calculated as the prorated average of the reported daily NRS within the week. For example, if there were 3 scores in a week, the prorated average = (score1 + score2 + score3) /3.

EASI-90 responders were the participants who achieved ≥90% overall improvement in EASI score at Week 16. [Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Participants with missing value at week 16 were considered as a non-responder.]</description>

        <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire used to measure how much a participant's skin problem had affected the participant's quality of life (QOL) over a recall period of the past week. The questionnaire consists of 10 items. For each item the scale is rated as follows: 0 = Not at all = Not relevant; 1 = Only a little; 2 = Quite a lot; 3 = Very much = Yes = Prevents school. The CDLQI total score is the sum of the score of each question with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the greater the impact is on the QOL.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
          <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire used to measure how much a participant's skin problem had affected the participant's quality of life (QOL) over a recall period of the past week. The questionnaire consists of 10 items. For each item the scale is rated as follows: 0 = Not at all = Not relevant; 1 = Only a little; 2 = Quite a lot; 3 = Very much = Yes = Prevents school. The CDLQI total score is the sum of the score of each question with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the greater the impact is on the QOL.</description>

        <description>The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults with atopic eczema. The format is subject response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on symptom frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = 'no days', 1 = '1 to 2 days', 2 = '3 to 4 days', 3 = '5 to 6' days, and 4 = 'every day'). The total score is the sum of the 7 items which is ranged from 0 to 28; a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life (QOL).</description>

        <description>Peak Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used by participants to report intensity of pruritus (itch) during a 24-hour recall period. Particpants were asked the following question for maximum itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable,' how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot; For post-baseline NRS, the mean weekly NRS was calculated as the prorated average of the reported daily NRS within the week. For example, if there were 3 scores in a week, the prorated average = (score1 + score2 + score3)/ 3.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improvement (Reduction ≥4 Points) of Weekly Average of Daily Peak Pruritus NRS From Baseline at Week 4</title>
        <description>Peak Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used by participants to report intensity of pruritus (itch) during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question for maximum itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable,' how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot; For post-baseline NRS, the mean weekly NRS was calculated as the prorated average of the reported daily NRS within the week. For example, if there were 3 scores in a week, the prorated average = (score1 + score2 + score3)/ 3.</description>

        <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to the end of study (Week 16)). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
