      Investigator-initiated study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prostate artery
      embolization for the treatment lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single center, prospective, single arm, investigational study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of
      severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in
      patients that have either failed or are intolerant to medical management. Once eligibility is
      confirmed, patients will undergo PAE with Embosphere Microspheres. Embolization will consist
      of a minimally invasive angiogram and treatment of the prostate arteries with the Embosphere
      particles to reduce blood flow to the prostate. Following treatment, patients will return for
      follow-up visits at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post PAE.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>International Prostate Symptom Score change from baseline measured at 1 and 6 months. The IPSS scale grades lower urinary tract symptoms on a scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (severe). Patients answer 7 questions about symptoms they have had in the past month and grade each symptom severity for each question on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always). Change is reported as outcome measure time point minus baseline. A positive value indicates improved symptoms and negative value worsened symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Post-void Residual (PVR) on Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>PVR (mL) change from baseline measured at 1 and 6 months. Change is reported as outcome measure time point minus baseline. A negative value indicates less post-void residual and a positive value indicates greater PVR at each outcome time point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Peak Urinary Flow Rate (Qmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Qmax measured at 1 and 6 months. Change is reported as outcome measure time point minus baseline. A positive value indicates improved Qmax and negative value indicates decreased Qmax at each outcome time point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>IIEF score change from baseline measured at 1 and 6 months. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a scale grading erectile function based on 5 questions. Questions are answered from 1 (low function) to 5 (high function). Total scores range from 5 to 25. A total score of 5-7 is severe erectile dysfunction, 8 to 11 is moderate erectile dysfunction, 12 to 16 is mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, 17 to 21 is mild erectile dysfunction, and 22-25 is no erectile dysfunction. Change is reported as outcome measure time point minus baseline. A positive value indicates improved erectile function and a negative indicates worsened erectile function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prostate Volume (PV)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in prostate volume measured at 1 and 6 months. Change is reported as outcome measure time point minus baseline. A negative value indicates decreased prostate volume and a positive value indicates increased prostate volume.</description>

The IPSS scale grades lower urinary tract symptoms on a scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (severe). Patients answer 7 questions about symptoms they have had in the past month and grade each symptom severity for each question on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always). Change is reported as outcome measure time point minus baseline. A positive value indicates improved symptoms and negative value worsened symptoms.</description>
