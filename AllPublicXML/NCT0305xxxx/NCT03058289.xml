    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the intratumoral administration of escalating doses of a novel,
      experimental drug, INT230-6. The study is being conducted in patients with several types of
      refractory cancers including those at the surface of the skin (breast, squamous cell, head
      and neck) and tumors within the body such (pancreatic, colon, liver, lung, etc.). Sponsor
      also plans to test INT230-6 in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INT230-6 is comprised of a 3 agents in a fixed ratio - a cell permeation enhancer and two,
      potent anti-cancer payloads (cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate). The penetration enhancer
      facilitates dispersion of the two drugs throughout injected tumors and enables increased
      diffusion into cancer cells. (Nonclinical safety studies showed no findings following drug
      injection into healthy tissues.)

      Historically physicians administer the two active drugs comprising INT230-6 by intravenous
      (IV) infusion to achieve a systemic blood level at the limit of tolerability. The objective
      is destroy both visible tumors and unseen circulating cancer cells (micro-metastases).
      Unfortunately, dosing drugs IV delivers only a small amount with a low concentration at the
      tumor site. This approach especially for late stage cancers is not highly effective and often
      quite toxic to the patient.

      Attempts at direct intratumoral injection with chemotherapeutic agents have not shown the
      ability to treat the injected tumor, non-injected tumors or micro-metastases. This lack of
      efficacy for local administration is due possibly to poor dispersion and a lack of cell
      uptake of the agents.

      Due to the use of the novel cell penetration enhancing agent INT230-6 treatment demonstrates
      strong efficacy in animals having large tumors. The Sponsor's in vivo, non-clinical data
      shows that INT230-6 thoroughly saturates and kills injected tumors. In addition, the drug
      induces an adaptive (T-cell mediated) immune response that attacks not only the injected
      tumor, but non-injected tumors and unseen micro-metastases. Cured animals become permanently
      immunized against the type of cancer that INT230-6 eliminates.

      Clinical trial IT-01 seeks to determine the safety and potential efficacy of dosing INT230-6
      directly into several different types of cancers. In addition animal studies showed a strong
      synergy of INT230-6 with immune modulation agents. Thus as part of study IT-01 the Sponsor
      seeks to understand the safety and efficacy of INT230-6 when administered in combination with
      immuno-therapeutic agents such as antibodies that target Programmed Cell Death (PD-1 or
      anti-PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA-4 or anti-CTLA-4) receptors.

      This study seeks to understand whether tumor regression can be achieved and patient outcomes
      improved.

    <intervention_model_description>There were 6 cohorts in the escalation portion of the protocol. Five dosed INT230-6 alone and one was combined with pembrolizumab. Cohorts A and B1 treated superficial tumors at a 1:4 ratio of drug to tumor with a low tumor load once per month. Cohort EA was similar to cohort A with INT230-6 every 2 weeks. Cohort EC escalated the total and maximal dose per any one tumor to a ratio of 1:2 &amp; dosed every two weeks. Cohort EC2 explored a drug load ratio of 1:3 and escalated the dose per tumor further. Cohort DEC combined INT230-6 with a fixed amount of pembrolizumab.
On-going, non-escalation cohorts include 1) monotherapy INT230-6 cohort (EC3) dosed every two weeks 2) INT230-6 in a combination with pembrolizumab (DEC2) and 3) INT230-6 in combination with ipilimumab (FEC). Other specific regimens or combinations of INT230-6 may be designated by the Study Steering Committee.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple intratumoral doses of INT230-6 in subjects with advanced or recurrent malignancies. This will be assessed by the rate of ≥ grade 3 AE's attributed to INT230-6 and not the underlying disease.
All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and dose and coded according to the most current version of MedDRA. The incidence of adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.
Adverse Events will be summarized for all reported data and by study period: a) up to and including 28 days post last dose of initial treatment, and b) from first dose of re-initiation of treatment, for subjects who re-initiate study therapy while in follow-up, up to 28 days post-dose of the last re-treatment dose.</description>

        criteria will be noted.

          1. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial.

          2. Men and Women &gt; 18 years of age on the day of signing consent.

          5. Includes subjects with metastatic disease who must have failed approved standard
             therapies that have a clinically significant survival benefit. Failure of all approved
             therapies that have a modest or marginal impact on survival is not required as long as
             the treating physician believes that treatment on study is appropriate for the subject
             and documents that the subject elects to defer the approved therapies.

             Note: There is no limit on the number of prior therapies that a patient (subject) may
             have received prior to enrollment in any cohort.

          6. Subjects must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria including one target

             non-injected tumors only) or image guidance).

          7. Subjects must have a minimum of one injectable lesion as determined by the
             investigator (for superficial tumors) or radiologist (deep tumors); Lesions situated
             in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been
             demonstrated in such lesions.

          8. Prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy (tumor vaccine, cytokine, or growth factor given
             to control the cancer: systemic or IT) must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior
             to dosing (with the exception of kinase inhibitors or other short half-life drugs, a 2
             weeks washout is acceptable prior to treatment).and all adverse events have either
             returned to baseline or stabilized; note: subjects who have received prior platinum
             therapy are eligible irrespective of their response.

          9. Prior systemic radiation therapy (either IV, intrahepatic or oral) completed at least
             4 weeks prior to study drug administration.

         10. Prior focal radiotherapy completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

             administration.

         12. No prior primary or metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless clinically and
             radiographically stable as well as off steroid therapy for at least 2 months.

         13. Life expectancy ≥8 weeks.

         14. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)

               2. A WOCBP Subjects who may become pregnant or who are sexually active with a

                  contraception during the study and for at least 60 days in monotherapy (for the
                  pembrolizumab combination please see cohort DEC and for the ipilimumab
                  combination see cohort FEC for the pregnancy criteria) for female subjects.

             (Male subjects must agree to use contraception during the study for 180 days after
