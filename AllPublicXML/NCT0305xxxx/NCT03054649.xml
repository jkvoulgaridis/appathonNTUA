    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the HARMONI®
      Modular Intraocular Lens System with a toric optic in subjects with pre-existing corneal
      astigmatism in need of cataract surgery.

    <textblock>
      Subjects were implanted with the HARMONI® Modular Intraocular Lens System (HMIOL). The eye
      with the higher corneal astigmatism (study eye) was assigned to Cohort 1 and received the
      HARMONI® Modular Intraocular Lens System with a toric optic. The fellow eye was assigned to
      Cohort 2 and received the HARMONI® Modular Intraocular Lens System with a non-toric optic
      during primary implantation, which was replaced with the appropriate optic power (toric or
      non-toric) during an intraoperative exchange (IOE) procedure. A total of 7 study visits were
      planned, including a preoperative visit, operative visits for each eye, and 4 follow-up
      visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperative. The total duration of
      participation for each subject was up to 6 months, which included a Day -90 to Day -0
      preoperative period.

    <measure>Mean Manifest Refraction Cylinder (MRCYL) for Eyes Implanted With HMTIOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 postoperative, Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. Manifest refraction cylinder is the amount of added correction needed to compensate for any astigmatism that may be present. MRCYL was measured in diopters and reported as a negative number, with a less negative number indicating a lesser amount of added correction. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

    <measure>Mean Manifest Refraction Cylinder (MRCYL) Prediction Error (PE) for Eyes Implanted With HMTIOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 postoperative, Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. Manifest refraction cylinder is the amount of power needed to correct any astigmatism that may be present. MRCYL was measured in diopters and reported as a negative number. MRCYL PE was calculated as postoperative MRCYL adjusted to 6 meters minus MRCYL target residual refractive error (TRRE), with a lower absolute value indicating a more accurate cylinder power calculation. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

    <measure>Mean Reduction in Cylinder Power for Eyes Implanted With HMTIOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 preoperative), Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. Manifest refraction cylinder is the amount of power needed to correct any astigmatism that may be present. MRCYL was measured in diopters and reported as a negative number. Cylinder power reduction was calculated as the absolute preoperative magnitude of corneal cylinder (K) minus the absolute postoperative magnitude of MRCYL at the corneal plane. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent Reduction in Cylinder Power for Eyes Implanted With HMTIOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 preoperative), Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. Manifest refraction cylinder is the amount of power needed to correct any astigmatism that may be present. MRCYL was measured in diopters and reported as a negative number. Cylinder power reduction was calculated as the absolute preoperative magnitude of corneal cylinder (K) minus the absolute postoperative magnitude of MRCYL at the corneal plane. Therefore, the cylindrical power percent reduction was the cylinder power reduction divided by the absolute value of preoperative magnitude of corneal cylinder (K) × 100. A higher number (greater percent reduction) indicates better astigmatism correction by the toric IOL. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) Prediction Error (PE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. The manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder, and measured in diopters (D). MRSE PE was calculated as postoperative MRSE adjusted to 6 meters minus MRSE target residual refractive error (TRRE). The lower the absolute number, the more accurate the IOL power calculation is. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

    <measure>Mean Absolute Rotation of IOL Meridian</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 operative), Day 1 postoperative, Week 1 postoperative, Month 1 postoperative, Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>IOL orientation was measured with slit-lamp photography. IOL rotation was defined as the difference between axis of IOL orientation on the day of surgery and the subsequent postoperative visit. IOL rotation was measured in degrees, with a lower number indicating less rotation. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) by Visit - Cohort 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 operative), Week 1 postoperative, Month 1 postoperative, Month 3 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Acuity of the eye was tested while reading charts at 20-foot equivalent distance from the participant with the correction obtained from manifest refraction testing. BCDVA is reported categorically using the Snellen fraction, which compares the participant's result to the result expected from a 'normal' visual system. The numerator represents the distance between the participant and the chart, and the denominator represents the distance at which a person with 'normal' vision would be able to discern the same letter size. 20/20 is considered to be 'normal' vision, whereas visual acuity of 20/40 means the participant is able to read a certain size letter 20 feet away that a person with 'normal' vision would be able to read from 40 feet away. A larger denominator, therefore, indicates a lower visual acuity. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Reduction in Cylinder Power for Eyes Implanted With HMTIOL</title>
        <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. Manifest refraction cylinder is the amount of power needed to correct any astigmatism that may be present. MRCYL was measured in diopters and reported as a negative number. Cylinder power reduction was calculated as the absolute preoperative magnitude of corneal cylinder (K) minus the absolute postoperative magnitude of MRCYL at the corneal plane. Therefore, the cylindrical power percent reduction was the cylinder power reduction divided by the absolute value of preoperative magnitude of corneal cylinder (K) × 100. A higher number (greater percent reduction) indicates better astigmatism correction by the toric IOL. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

        <title>Mean Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) Prediction Error (PE)</title>
        <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. The manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder, and measured in diopters (D). MRSE PE was calculated as postoperative MRSE adjusted to 6 meters minus MRSE target residual refractive error (TRRE). The lower the absolute number, the more accurate the IOL power calculation is.

          <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. The manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder, and measured in diopters (D). MRSE PE was calculated as postoperative MRSE adjusted to 6 meters minus MRSE target residual refractive error (TRRE). The lower the absolute number, the more accurate the IOL power calculation is. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

        <description>Visual Acuity of the eye was tested while reading charts at 20-foot equivalent distance from the participant with the correction obtained from manifest refraction testing. BCDVA is reported categorically using the Snellen fraction, which compares the participant's result to the result expected from a 'normal' visual system. The numerator represents the distance between the participant and the chart, and the denominator represents the distance at which a person with 'normal' vision would be able to discern the same letter size. 20/20 is considered to be 'normal' vision, whereas visual acuity of 20/40 means the participant is able to read a certain size letter 20 feet away that a person with 'normal' vision would be able to read from 40 feet away. A larger denominator, therefore, indicates a lower visual acuity. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Eyes With Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UCDVA) by Visit - Cohort 1</title>
        <description>Visual Acuity of the eye was tested while reading charts at 20-foot equivalent distance from the participant with an optical infinity adjustment of +0.25 diopter (D). The Snellen fraction compares the participant's result to the result expected from a 'normal' visual system. The numerator represents the distance between the participant and the chart, and the denominator represents the distance at which a person with 'normal' vision would be able to discern the same letter size. 20/20 is considered to be 'normal' vision, whereas visual acuity of 20/40 means the participant is able to read a certain size letter 20 feet away that a person with 'normal' vision would be able to read from 40 feet away. A larger denominator, therefore, indicates a lower visual acuity. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

      <desc>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical event that does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study device or protocol. Conditions or diseases that were pre-existing and/or chronic but stable were not recorded as adverse events. Similarly, changes in a pre-existing and/or chronic condition or disease that were consistent with natural progression were not recorded as adverse events.</desc>
