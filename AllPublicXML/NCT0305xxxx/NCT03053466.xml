  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose
      schedule of APL-501 in individuals with advanced or relapsed or recurrent solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, 3-part study with a Dose-Escalation Segment, Cohort Extension
      and Dose and Disease Expansion cohorts of APL-501 injection, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal
      antibody, targeting the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes and
      other cells of the immune system. Select advanced solid tumor malignancies will receive
      escalating doses of APL-501.

      Dose escalation will occur in three subject cohorts until a protocol defined dose limited
      toxicity (DLT) occurs, not due to disease progression or inter-current illness, and a
      tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or biologically effective dose (BED) is determined.

      Cohort Extension will evaluate APL-501 at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 15 every 28
      days and on Day 1 every 21 days in PD-1 approved labelled indications.

      At the tentative MTD, BED or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), at least four tumor types in
      the Dose and Disease Expansion will be assessed at a equivalent non-weight based dose to
      further evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy.

In the Dose Escalation Segment, each treatment cycle is comprised of 2 doses of study drug administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In the Cohort Extension, the treatment cycle will consist of 2 doses of study drug administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle and 1 dose of study drug administered on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
In Dose and Disease Expansion, the treatment cycle will consist of 2 doses of study drug (non-weight based dosing of 400 mg) administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.</description>
