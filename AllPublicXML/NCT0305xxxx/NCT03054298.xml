    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells with and without cyclophosphamide and via different routes of
      administration.

        -  Cohort 1 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
           huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

        -  Cohort 2 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
           huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide
           administered 2-4 days prior to huCARTmeso cells (day -4 to day -2).

        -  Cohort 3 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
           huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen. **Cohort 3
           permanently closed**

        -  Cohort 4 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral
           transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m^2 of
           cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (day -4 to day -2).
           **Cohort 4 permanently closed**

        -  Cohort 5 (N=up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
           huCART-meso cells on day 0 by intrapleural infusion (IP) through an indwelling pleural
           catheter without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen. The safety of this dose
           level has been established by Cohorts 1 and 2.

        -  Cohort 6 (N=up to 6): will receive lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells at a dose of
           1-3x10^7 via IV infusion on Day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m^2 of
           cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (~Day -4 to -2). This
           initial infusion may be followed by up to two additional IV infusions of huCART-meso
           cells at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart, if the subject meets
           eligibility to receive additional infusions. Cyclophosphamide will not be repeated prior
           to subsequent doses of huCART-meso cells. Enrollment into Cohort 6 will occur in
           parallel with Cohort 5.

      The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0-1 DLT occurs in 6
      evaluable subjects tested within the dose range of this study. The maximum tolerated dose has
      been established as 1-3x10^7/m^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells.

      Adverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event
      reporting period

             eligibility confirmation by investigator.

         19. Subjects with significant lung disease as follows:

               -  Subjects with radiographic evidence of greater than lobar lymphangitic pulmonary
                  involvement, greater than lobar bronchial wall thickening suggestive of

                  parenchymal metastatic burden.

                  pneumonitis.

                  including evidence of unresolved drug toxicity from any agent (e.g. chemotherapy,
