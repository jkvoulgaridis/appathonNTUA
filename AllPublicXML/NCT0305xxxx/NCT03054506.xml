  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common gastrointestinal motility disorder that is often chronic, negatively
      affects patients' daily lives. Constipation occurs when bowel movements become difficult or
      less frequent.This study is being done to study the effectiveness of the hydrogel capsule,
      CSP01, compared to the active control (carboxymethylcellulose) and placebo (non-medicine
      sugar pill), to relieve constipation among subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC) or with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Colonic Transit Time (CTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week; measured once during the run-in-period and again during third week of the treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Colonic Transit Time is the amount of time (in minutes) that the SmartPill capsule spent in the large intestine before expulsion. We measured the difference between CTT pre-treatment and post-treatment and calculated the mean difference for each treatment group. Negative values equal a reduction in CTT.</description>

    <measure>Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM) Frequency Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>55 days (baseline, treatment, &amp; follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Average number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movements per day (BMs where participant felt that they emptied their bowels). More CSBMs are interpreted as a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>55 days (baseline, treatment, &amp; follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Stool consistency for each bowel movement based on the Bristol Stool Scale A descriptive numerical scale from 1 to 7 where lower numbers indicate constipation, numbers toward the middle indicate normal stool consistence, and the highest numbers indicate diarrhea. Therefore middle scores mean a better outcome
1= hard lumps 2 = lumpy sausage 3 = cracked sausage 4 = smooth sausage 5 = soft lumps 6 = mushy 7 = watery</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of Passage Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>55 days (baseline, treatment, &amp; follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient assessment of the ease with which bowel movements are passed using a descriptive numerical scale where lower numbers indicate difficult passage of stool, numbers toward the middle indicate more normal passage of stool, and numbers on the highest end indicate abnormally urgent passage of stool. Middle scores indicate a better outcome.
= manual disimpaction needed
= enema needed
= straining needed
= normal
= urgent without pain
= urgent with pain

    <time_frame>55 days (baseline, treatment, &amp; follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's daily assessment of abdominal discomfort using a numerical rating scale of 0 to 10, where 0 = no discomfort at all and 10 = severe discomfort. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Patient's daily assessment of constipation severity using a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 where 0 = no constipation at all and 10 = severe constipation. Higher numbers mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relief Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>55 days (baseline, treatment, &amp; follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's feeling of overall relief after each bowel movement using a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 where 0 = no relief and 10 = complete relief. Higher scores mean a better outcome (feeling more relief after a bowel movement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Assessment of Constipation - Symptoms (PAC-SYM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -14 to Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Patient assessment of constipation symptom severity questionnaire. A validated 12-question questionnaire.
Numerical scale from 0 to 4 where 0 = absent and 4 = very severe. Possible total score ranges from 0 to 48. Higher total PAC-SYM scores mean a worse outcome.
PAC-SYM was completed at four time-points (Day -14, Day 0, Day 15, &amp; Day 22). Scores were aggregated based on time period as either pre- (Day -14 &amp; Day 0) or post- (Day 15 &amp; Day 22) treatment start. Values reported are averages based on patient total scores from these time points. Data was specifically analyzed based on patient diagnosis in addition to treatment.</description>

    <measure>Patient Assessment of Constipation - Quality of Life (PAC-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -14 to Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire. A validated questionnaire containing 28 total questions with four sub-sections each broadly ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot; on 0 to 4 scales.
Possible total range is 0 to 112. An overall higher total score on the PAC-QOL means a worse outcome. PAC-QOL was completed at four time-points (Day -14, Day 0, Day 15, &amp; Day 22). Scores were aggregated based on time period as either pre- (Day -14 &amp; Day 0) or post- (Day 15 &amp; Day 22) treatment start.

CSP01 capsules are taken prior to a meal with water, after which the small particles within the capsules hydrate and expand in the stomach and small intestine. By acting as a bulking agent and possibly reducing colonic transit time through increase of colonic water content, CSP01 may contribute to constipation relief.

        <title>Patient Assessment of Constipation - Symptoms (PAC-SYM)</title>
        <description>Patient assessment of constipation symptom severity questionnaire. A validated 12-question questionnaire.
Numerical scale from 0 to 4 where 0 = absent and 4 = very severe. Possible total score ranges from 0 to 48. Higher total PAC-SYM scores mean a worse outcome.
PAC-SYM was completed at four time-points (Day -14, Day 0, Day 15, &amp; Day 22). Scores were aggregated based on time period as either pre- (Day -14 &amp; Day 0) or post- (Day 15 &amp; Day 22) treatment start. Values reported are averages based on patient total scores from these time points. Data was specifically analyzed based on patient diagnosis in addition to treatment.</description>

        <title>Patient Assessment of Constipation - Quality of Life (PAC-QOL)</title>
        <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire. A validated questionnaire containing 28 total questions with four sub-sections each broadly ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot; on 0 to 4 scales.
Possible total range is 0 to 112. An overall higher total score on the PAC-QOL means a worse outcome. PAC-QOL was completed at four time-points (Day -14, Day 0, Day 15, &amp; Day 22). Scores were aggregated based on time period as either pre- (Day -14 &amp; Day 0) or post- (Day 15 &amp; Day 22) treatment start. Values reported are averages based on patient total scores from these time points. Data was specifically analyzed based on patient diagnosis in addition to treatment.</description>

CSP01 capsules are taken prior to a meal with water, after which the small particles within the capsules hydrate and expand in the stomach and small intestine.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Target number of participants needed to achieve target power was not attained. One subject's post-treatment SmartPill data was irretrievable due to unexpected technical malfunction, therefore post-treatment colonic transit time was not collected.</limitations_and_caveats>
