    <textblock>
      The ADO II AS Study is a single arm, prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label
      study to characterize the safety and effectiveness of the ADO II AS device in patients with a
      patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Subjects will be implanted with the ADO II AS device using a
      transcatheter femoral vessel approach under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance.

      To account for subject dropout, up to 50 subjects will be enrolled in this clinical
      investigation. Up to an additional 150 subjects may be enrolled under continued access. The
      clinical investigation will be conducted at up to 10 centers in the United States.

      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will be followed for 3 years. The
      expected duration of enrollment is 18 months. The total duration of the clinical
      investigation is expected to be 4.5 years.
