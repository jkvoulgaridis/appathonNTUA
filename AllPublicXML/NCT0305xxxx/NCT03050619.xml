  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, was launched in the
      United Kingdom (UK) in August 2014. It can be expected that patients initiating empagliflozin
      may differ in their characteristics from patients initiating other glucose lowering drugs
      (GLDs) that have been on the market longer (e.g. patients may have poorer glucose control).
      Therefore, the proposed study aims to characterize patients with T2DM in the UK initiating
      empagliflozin in terms of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and
      comorbidities compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) initiating other
      SGLT-2 inhibitors or other non-insulin GLDs. Due to the mode of action, some patients taking
      empagliflozin have experienced weight loss in clinical trials. A theoretical possibility
      exists that empagliflozin may be used by patients without T2DM. Therefore, this study also
      aims to assess the potential off-label use of empagliflozin compared to other non-insulin
      GLDs.

    <description>To assess off-label use the number of study participants without a recorded diagnosis of T2DM was calculated for each exposure category (people with other types of diabetes, people without diabetes, people younger than 18 years old, and women during pregnancy and breastfeeding). For the assessment of drug use during the pregnancy and breastfeeding period, the look-back period was 270 days (9 months) before and including the index date. To assess the use in pediatric population, the study participants were stratified by age into adults (≥18 years of age) and pediatrics (&lt;18 years of age).</description>

Use of empagliflozin, other SGLT-2i or other commonly used non-insulin GLDs in other types of diabetes (other than T2DM) or without diabetes or in people younger than 18 years old or in women during pregnancy or during breastfeeding is considered as off-label. As per CPRD guideline, no cell that contains &lt;5 events should be reported to protect patient confidentiality. Since empagliflozin group reported &lt;5 events for all off-label categories except for unspecified DM therefore baseline characteristics are presented for only unspecified DM category. Subjects taking medication up to 60 days before index date are presented.</description>
