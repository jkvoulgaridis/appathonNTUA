  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to combat the growing global health issue of sedentary behavior and
      the associated health consequences of prolonged sitting in the workplace. The population of
      desk-based workers makes up a relatively large population and are an important target for
      this health promoting initiative with a focus on improving posture, encouraging movement, and
      fostering a more active and healthy business community. It's important to recognize that
      occupational therapy practitioners can contribute to community health promotion/disease
      prevention programs by the skill-set of practitioners to understand habits and routines that
      influence the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors.

    <measure>Reported Musculoskeletal Discomfort Per Group at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three scales were compiled 1) aches and pains, 2) discomfort and 3) interference due to aches and pains. All three scales included 9 questions centered on the occurrence in body regions, including the neck, shoulder, upper and lower back, upper arms, forearm/wrist, hip, thigh, and knee/lower leg. Aches and Pains was on a 5 point scale, from 1) Never to 5) Several Times a Day. Uncomfortable was on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0) No Discomfort to 3) Very Uncomfortable. Interference was on a 4 point scale from 0) Not a problem to 3) Substantially interfered. Higher scores indicated more problems in each of these areas.</description>

          <description>The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire consists of three scales that were compiled 1) aches and pains, 2) discomfort and 3) interference due to aches and pains. All three scales included 9 questions centered on the occurrence in body regions, including the neck, shoulder, upper and lower back, upper arms, forearm/wrist, hip, thigh, and knee/lower leg. Aches and Pains was on a 5 point scale, from 1) Never to 5) Several Times a Day. Higher scores indicated more problems in each of these areas.</description>

        <title>Reported Musculoskeletal Discomfort Per Group at 3 Months</title>
        <description>Three scales were compiled 1) aches and pains, 2) discomfort and 3) interference due to aches and pains. All three scales included 9 questions centered on the occurrence in body regions, including the neck, shoulder, upper and lower back, upper arms, forearm/wrist, hip, thigh, and knee/lower leg. Aches and Pains was on a 5 point scale, from 1) Never to 5) Several Times a Day. Uncomfortable was on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0) No Discomfort to 3) Very Uncomfortable. Interference was on a 4 point scale from 0) Not a problem to 3) Substantially interfered. Higher scores indicated more problems in each of these areas.</description>
