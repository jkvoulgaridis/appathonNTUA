      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study Assessing the Effect of
      Gelesis200 on Body Weight in Overweight and Obese Subjects without or with Type 2 Diabetes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, two-cohort, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      fixed-dose, adaptive (Two Phases).

      In the first Phase of the adaptive design, unblinded interim analyses were conducted on 57
      subjects and used to adjust the design for the second Phase. The first Phase was completed
      under protocol Version 1.0. Data used in the unblinded interim analyses of the first Phase
      will not be included in the second Phase (protocol Version 2.0 and subsequent protocol
      versions) analyses.

      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Gelesis200 as a
      superabsorbent hydrogel for weight loss in treated diabetic subjects, untreated diabetic
      subjects, and prediabetic subjects (Cohort 1).

      The study will evaluate separately the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Gelesis200 for
      weight loss in normoglycemic subjects (Cohort 2).
