    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 75 % or Higher Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI75 response assessments were based on at least 75 % improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieve a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Clear or Almost Clear Response (With at Least 2-category Improvement) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>This Outcome Measure applied to participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque Psoriasis (PSO).
The Investigator assessed the overall severity of Psoriasis (PSO) using the following 5-point scale: 0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 90 % or Higher Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI90 response assessments were based on at least 90 % improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>This Outcome Measure applied to participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque Psoriasis (PSO).
The DLQI is a subject-reported questionnaire designed for use in adult participants with PSO.
The DLQI is a skin disease-specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect patients' health related quality of life (HRQoL). This instrument asked participants about symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has been shown to be valid and reproducible in PSO patients. The DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower HRQoL. A higher than or equal to (&gt;=) 4-point change in the DLQI score (DLQI response) has been reported to be meaningful for the patient (within-patient minimal important difference Basra et al, 2015) a DLQI absolute score of lower than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 indicates DLQI remission (i.e., no or small impact of the disease on HRQoL).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Itch Numeric Rating Scale at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>This Outcome Measure applied to participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque Psoriasis (PSO).
The Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) has been developed as a simple, single item instrument to assess the patient-reported severity of itch at its most intense during the past 24h period. Participants indicate itch severity by circling the integer that best describes the worst level of itching due to PSO in the past 24h period on an 11-point scale anchored at 0, representing &quot;no itching&quot; and 10, representing &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot; (Kimball et al, 2016).</description>

    <measure>Plasma Concentration of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at Baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 52, 60</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentration was expressed in micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL).
Values below Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) were set to half the LLOQ to present summaries.
The geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation were only displayed if at least 2/3 of the data were above the LLOQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive Anti-Certolizumab Pegol-antibody Levels in Plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples will be collected at Baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 52, 60</time_frame>
    <description>A pre-anti-drug (CZP) antibody (ADA) positive subject was defined as having a confirmed positive sample at Baseline. A pre-ADA negative subject was defined as having a Screening below the cut point (BCP) sample, or a screening above the cut point (ACP) sample, but not confirmed positive at Baseline.
A treatment-emergent ADA positive subject was defined as either 1) pre-ADA negative subjects having at least 1 ADA confirmed positive sample or 2) pre-ADA positive subjects with at least 1 sample with greater then or equal to (&gt;=) 1.67-fold increase from Baseline on CZP treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 75 % or Higher Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI75 response assessments were based on at least 75 % improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

        <description>The PASI90 response assessments were based on at least 90 % improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>This Outcome Measure applied to participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque Psoriasis (PSO).
The DLQI is a subject-reported questionnaire designed for use in adult participants with PSO.
The DLQI is a skin disease-specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect patients' health related quality of life (HRQoL). This instrument asked participants about symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has been shown to be valid and reproducible in PSO patients. The DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower HRQoL. A higher than or equal to (&gt;=) 4-point change in the DLQI score (DLQI response) has been reported to be meaningful for the patient (within-patient minimal important difference Basra et al, 2015) a DLQI absolute score of lower than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 indicates DLQI remission (i.e., no or small impact of the disease on HRQoL).</description>

        <description>This Outcome Measure applied to participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque Psoriasis (PSO).
The Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) has been developed as a simple, single item instrument to assess the patient-reported severity of itch at its most intense during the past 24h period. Participants indicate itch severity by circling the integer that best describes the worst level of itching due to PSO in the past 24h period on an 11-point scale anchored at 0, representing &quot;no itching&quot; and 10, representing &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot; (Kimball et al, 2016).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all participants in the RS who received at least 1 dose of the study medication and had valid efficacy assessments for Baseline and for at least 1 post-Baseline visit.
Missing data were handled using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for the Itch Numeric Rating Scale.</population>
