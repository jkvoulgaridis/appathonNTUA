  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of
      INCMGA00012 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCMGA00012 administered on
      either every two week or every four week schedules of administration among patients with
      solid tumors. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of INCMGA00012
      will also be assessed.

      The purpose of Amendment 5 is to obtain additional safety experience at the newly defined
      recommended Phase 2 dose of 500 mg every 4 weeks in patients with endometrial cancer,
      specifically either microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient
      (dMMR). Additionally, every 3 week (Q3W) flat-dosing will be studied in an additional tumor
      agnostic cohort.

      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and cohort expansion study designed to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor
      activity of INCMGA00012 administered IV every 2, 3, or 4 weeks in patients with
      relapsed/refractory, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation,
      once every two weeks and once every four weeks administration of single agent INCMGA00012.
      Following the establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in expansion cohorts
      of specific tumor types and/or INCMGA00012 dose.

      The Cohort Expansion Phase will include tumor-specific cohorts, consisting of patients with
      endometrial cancer (unselected [up to n = 35] and MSI-H or dMMR [up to n = 70]), cervical
      cancer (up to n = 35), sarcoma (up to n = 35), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (up to n =
      35), and 3 cohorts of any tumor histology (tumor-agnostic) (up to n = 15) who will receive
      flat dosing: 1 cohort treated with INCMGA00012 500 mg Q4W, 1 cohort with INCMGA00012 750 mg
      Q4W, and 1 cohort treated with INCMGA00012 375 mg Q3W.
