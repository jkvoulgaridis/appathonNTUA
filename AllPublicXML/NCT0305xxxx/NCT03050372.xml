  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited and screened through ongoing studies in the sleep and anxiety
      disorders clinic. Participants with insomnia will be consented to complete several
      questionnaires, undergo a brief physical exam, provide a urinalysis, and undergo 5 nights of
      active or sham Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) followed by an overnight sleep study.
      Each of the two treatment conditions (active versus sham) will be conducted on two
      consecutive nights. There will be no more than 7 days between the adaptation night and the
      first treatment condition and no more than 7 nights between each of the two-night treatment
      conditions . Thus, each participant who completes the full study will spend a total of 5
      nights in the sleep laboratory and the time interval from the first adaptation night to
      completion of the study may range from 5-19 days for any particular individual.

    <measure>Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) After Sham vs. Active LFMS (Each Averages of Two Consecutive Nights); and Difference From Baseline (Adaptation Night)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each night (5 nights total): Baseline (adaptation night #1), First Intervention (nights #2,#3), Second Intervention (nights #4,#5); Interventions randomized Sham or Active LFMS</time_frame>
    <description>SOL is the time of transition from wake to sleep (non-REM S1) measured in minutes; a validated objective measure extracted directly from full-night polysomnography (PSG). SOL of 0-5min is associated with severe sleep deprivation; 5-10min is moderate sleep debt; 10-15min indicates mild sleep debt; 15-20min is little-to-no sleep debt; and &gt;20min is considered to be associated with no sleep debt.</description>

    <description>Total time awake after initial sleep onset in minutes; validated objective measure directly extracted from polysomnography (PSG); we average measures from both consecutive nights under each of the two interventions (Sham or Active LFMS)</description>

    <measure>Total Sleep Time (TST) After Sham vs. Active LFMS (Each Averages of Two Consecutive Nights); and Difference From Baseline (Adaptation Night)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each night (5 nights total): Baseline (adaptation night #1), First Intervention (nights #2,#3), Second Intervention (nights #4,#5); Interventions randomized Sham or Active LFMS</time_frame>
    <description>Total Sleep Time is the total time spent sleeping (non-wake stages S1-S5) in minutes; validated objective measure directly extracted from polysomnography (PSG).</description>

    <measure>Sleep Efficiency (SE) After Sham vs. Active LFMS (Each Averages of Two Consecutive Nights); and Difference From Baseline (Adaptation Night)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each night (5 nights total): Baseline (adaptation night #1), First Intervention (nights #2,#3), Second Intervention (nights #4,#5); Interventions randomized Sham or Active LFMS</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Efficiency (SE) is an objective measure of sleep quality derived from polysomnography (PSG); it is a unitless measure defined as the total sleep time (TST) divided by total time in bed (TiB); it can theoretically range from 0 (no sleep at all) to 1 (slept the entire time in bed). Values close to zero indicate very little time spent sleeping while values close to one indicate a large sleep utilization while in bed.</description>

    <measure>Ease of Sleep (EOS) After Sham vs. Active LFMS (Each Averages of Two Consecutive Nights); and Difference From Baseline (Adaptation Night)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each night (5 nights total): Baseline (adaptation night #1), First Intervention (nights #2,#3), Second Intervention (nights #4,#5); Interventions randomized Sham or Active LFMS</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of Sleep (EOS) is assessed after each night as a subjective measure; participants self-rate their ease to fall asleep on a visual analog scale 0-100mm where 0mm is associated with not easy at all (no sleep) and 100mm is associated with no problems to fall asleep. EOS is a proxy measure for a participants sleepiness.</description>

    <description>MUSC Sleep Quality Score (SQS) is assessed after each night as a subjective measure; participants self-rate their perceived sleep quality on a 0-6 scale where 0 is associated with extremely poor sleep quality and 6 is associated with extremely good sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Number of Awakenings (#awake) is the integer number of nocturnal awakenings after initial sleep onset, i.e. a count.</description>

    <time_frame>Each night (5 nights total): Baseline (adaptation night #1), First Intervention (nights #2,#3), Second Intervention (nights #4,#5); Interventions randomized Sham or Active LFMS</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate after each night how fatigued they feel on a 0-100mm continuous scale; 0mm not at all; 100mm very/a lot.</description>

          <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) is a well established 10-question questionnaire (24 items incl. sub-questions 5a-j and 10a-e) that assesses subjective sleep quality, -latency, -duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, daytime dysfunction. Individual items' responses are in the range of 0-3; a total PSQI score is derived by first deriving 7 equally weighted components from all 24 responses; each component is in the range of 0-3, resulting in a total score (sum of all components) of 0-21; a total PSQI score of &gt;=5 is associated with poor sleep.</description>

        <title>Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) After Sham vs. Active LFMS (Each Averages of Two Consecutive Nights); and Difference From Baseline (Adaptation Night)</title>
        <description>SOL is the time of transition from wake to sleep (non-REM S1) measured in minutes; a validated objective measure extracted directly from full-night polysomnography (PSG). SOL of 0-5min is associated with severe sleep deprivation; 5-10min is moderate sleep debt; 10-15min indicates mild sleep debt; 15-20min is little-to-no sleep debt; and &gt;20min is considered to be associated with no sleep debt.</description>

        <description>Sleep Efficiency (SE) is an objective measure of sleep quality derived from polysomnography (PSG); it is a unitless measure defined as the total sleep time (TST) divided by total time in bed (TiB); it can theoretically range from 0 (no sleep at all) to 1 (slept the entire time in bed). Values close to zero indicate very little time spent sleeping while values close to one indicate a large sleep utilization while in bed.</description>

      <time_frame>Beginning with the baseline adaptation night adverse effect were actively monitored over the duration of the study interventions (distributed over approx. two weeks for each subject); monitoring specifically included all 5 nights spent in the sleep lab (adaptation night #1, first intervention nights 2&amp;3, washout period, and second intervention nights 4&amp;5)</time_frame>
      <desc>Each study participant was further informed that adverse effects, should they occur outside the active monitoring period and/or after the study concluded, can be reported directly to either the sleep-lab manager, to the attending physician (T. Uhde), or to the clinical psychologist (A. Wilkerson).</desc>

          <description>All participants completed an adaptation night (night #1) in the sleep lab including baseline assessment. Participants were treatment randomized to receive, after the adaptation night in the sleep lab, either two consecutive nights (night #2,#3) of &quot;Active Low Field Magnetic Stimulation&quot; followed by two consecutive nights (night #4,#5) of &quot;Sham Low Field Magnetic Stimulation&quot;, or vice versa. A washout period was permitted between nights #3 and #4 when the intervention changed.
Interventions:
Active Low Field Magnetic Stimulation A non-invasive form of brain stimulation administered from a device resembling a bird cage. The device covers the top part of the head for the duration of stimulation (20 minutes before sleep)
Sham Low Field Magnetic Stimulation A simulation of the LFMS-Active intervention, using the same device that produces a sound similar to the sound made by the device during the active treatment, for a similar duration (20 minutes before sleep)</description>
