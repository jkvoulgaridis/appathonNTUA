  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an OA-specific aerobic and
      strengthening exercise program, delivered within the workplace, on mobility, pain, physical
      capacity, and resilience among workers with knee or hip OA as well as those with no joint
      pain. The investigators hypothesize that exercise designed for OA, delivered at work, will
      improve all of these outcomes.

    <textblock>
      The Canadian workforce is aging. The most prevalent age group is 50-54 years and most of
      these Canadians will aim to continue working over the next 10 years. However, the impact of
      arthritis on aging Canadians compromises their ability to continue working. By 2031, over 2
      million Canadians aged 45 to 64 years will have arthritis. The investigators aim to boost the
      ability of adults with the most common arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), as well as adults
      without OA, to engage in the workforce for as long as they desire. Identifying strategies to
      promote productivity among workers with knee and hip OA will be of great public health
      significance in the coming decades. However, the investigators face two challenges. First,
      obesity among sedentary workers is a risk for worsening knee and hip OA. Second, large
      occupational loads on the knee and hip worsen OA. Exercise has the most promise in addressing
      these challenges because it reduces pain and sick time, and improves mental health. Thus,
      there is a call for studies examining exercise for workers with knee and hip OA.

    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Functional Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) consists of 20 items, on an adjectival scale, that assess difficulty during mobility tasks ranging from transfers to running. Each item is scored from 0 (extreme difficulty or unable to perform activity), to 4 (no difficulty to perform activity). The minimum possible score is 0, and the maximum possible score is 80. Scores closer to 80 represent better self-reported physical function. It is reliable and valid in knee OA and has superior sensitivity to change compared to similar measures</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Knee and Hip Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>Change in self-reported knee and hip pain will be assessed with 3 valid and reliable questionnaires: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) score. The KOOS and HOOS pain scores represent a normalized score from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms). KOOS and HOOS scores closer to 100 indicate fewer symptoms. The ICOAP consists of two sub-scales: constant pain (5 items) and intermittent pain (6 items). The score from each subscale represents a normalized score from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain). ICOAP scores closer to 0 indicate less pain. The items from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized ICOAP total score, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain).</description>

    <measure>Change in Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>Resilience will be measured using the Resilience Scale 25 Survey, which is a 25-item questionnaire designed to evaluate a participants ability to adapt to stress and adversity. The test is scored out of 175 (scores ranging from 25 to 175), with higher scores indicating higher resilience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Work Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Ability Index (WAI) is a widely-used self-report questionnaire that evaluates a worker's capacity to perform a job accounting for their physical and mental well-being in addition to the demands of their job. The WAI consists of seven dimensions including current work ability relative to life-time best, work ability related to job demands, number of current physician-diagnosed health conditions, estimated work impairment due to the conditions, sick leave over the past year, own prognosis, and mental resources. Total scores range from 7 to 49 and can fall under one of four classifications: poor work ability that should be restored (7-27), moderate work ability that should be improved (28-36), good work ability that should be supported (37-43), and excellent work ability that should be maintained (44-49). The WAI produces reliable data.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed with the Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, a 20-item scale developed for the general population with emphasis on affect. Elements of affect include mood, guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, appetite, and sleep. Each item is scored from 0 (rarely or none of the time), to 3 (most of the time). The items are summed to produce a total score between 0 and 60 with a score of 16 or higher indicating depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Arthritis-related Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) measures arthritis-specific beliefs regarding perception of performance on certain tasks to cope with the disease. The ASES is measured using 20 questions on a 10-100 scale with respect to three main areas: pain management (5 questions), physical function (9 questions), and other symptoms (6 questions). Each question is scored from 10 (very uncertain), to 100 (very certain), in 10-point increments. The minimum score for each subscale is 10, and the maximum score for each subscale is 100. The scores from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized total score. Scores closer to 100 indicate greater certainty that a participant can cope with a particular task as a consequence of their disease.</description>

        <title>Change in Lower Extremity Functional Scale</title>
        <description>The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) consists of 20 items, on an adjectival scale, that assess difficulty during mobility tasks ranging from transfers to running. Each item is scored from 0 (extreme difficulty or unable to perform activity), to 4 (no difficulty to perform activity). The minimum possible score is 0, and the maximum possible score is 80. Scores closer to 80 represent better self-reported physical function. It is reliable and valid in knee OA and has superior sensitivity to change compared to similar measures</description>

        <title>Change in Self-reported Knee and Hip Pain</title>
        <description>Change in self-reported knee and hip pain will be assessed with 3 valid and reliable questionnaires: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) score. The KOOS and HOOS pain scores represent a normalized score from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms). KOOS and HOOS scores closer to 100 indicate fewer symptoms. The ICOAP consists of two sub-scales: constant pain (5 items) and intermittent pain (6 items). The score from each subscale represents a normalized score from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain). ICOAP scores closer to 0 indicate less pain. The items from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized ICOAP total score, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain).</description>

        <title>Change in Work Ability</title>
        <description>The Work Ability Index (WAI) is a widely-used self-report questionnaire that evaluates a worker's capacity to perform a job accounting for their physical and mental well-being in addition to the demands of their job. The WAI consists of seven dimensions including current work ability relative to life-time best, work ability related to job demands, number of current physician-diagnosed health conditions, estimated work impairment due to the conditions, sick leave over the past year, own prognosis, and mental resources. Total scores range from 7 to 49 and can fall under one of four classifications: poor work ability that should be restored (7-27), moderate work ability that should be improved (28-36), good work ability that should be supported (37-43), and excellent work ability that should be maintained (44-49). The WAI produces reliable data.</description>

        <title>Change in Arthritis-related Self-Efficacy</title>
        <description>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) measures arthritis-specific beliefs regarding perception of performance on certain tasks to cope with the disease. The ASES is measured using 20 questions on a 10-100 scale with respect to three main areas: pain management (5 questions), physical function (9 questions), and other symptoms (6 questions). Each question is scored from 10 (very uncertain), to 100 (very certain), in 10-point increments. The minimum score for each subscale is 10, and the maximum score for each subscale is 100. The scores from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized total score. Scores closer to 100 indicate greater certainty that a participant can cope with a particular task as a consequence of their disease.</description>

          <description>The participants in this arm will be asked to refrain from changing their physical activity over the 12 weeks and maintain any strategies typically used to manage knee and/or hip pain. Since it is known that exercise is beneficial for pain management and strengthening in knee OA, participants randomized to the no exercise group will be offered the same exercise program following completion of the study. Measurements will be obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention). Outcomes included clinical mobility; pain; isometric leg strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.
No Exercise: A no exercise (control) group will be asked to maintain their existing activity level for 12 weeks. Outcomes included mobility performance; pain; strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.</description>
