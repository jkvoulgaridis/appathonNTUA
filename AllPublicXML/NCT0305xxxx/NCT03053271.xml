  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of ATR-101
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally-administered ATR-101 in adults with endogenous
      Cushing's syndrome. Following wash-out (if needed), all eligible subjects will enter an
      open-label intra-subject dose-escalation period of 8 weeks' duration, followed either by a
      double-blind randomized withdrawal period of 4 weeks' duration (if the subject meets
      randomization criteria) or by an additional open label dosing period of 4 weeks' duration (if
      the subject does not meet randomization criteria).It is anticipated that the overall duration
      of the study per subject will range from approximately 16-22 weeks.
