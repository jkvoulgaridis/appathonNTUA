  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of MDMA on encoding and retrieval of
      emotional and social memories in healthy young adults. The study will explore the effects on
      memory retrieval when the drug is administered 1) before encoding, and 2) before retrieval.

    <textblock>
      Here, we aim to investigate the effects of MDMA (1 mg/kg) on the encoding and retrieval of
      positive, negative, social, and neutral memories. The study will use a between subjects
      design with three groups (N = 20 per group). Two of the groups will be randomly assigned to
      receive MDMA before one of the two stages of memory: Encoding (ENC) or Retrieval (RET). The
      third group will receive placebo only (PLC). All three groups will receive capsules before
      viewing the study materials, and at retrieval two days later, but they will receive MDMA only
      in the capsule appropriate to their condition, and other capsules will contain placebo.

      Participants will participate in two sessions: a viewing session during which they will view
      emotional and neutral stimuli, followed 48 hours later by a retrieval session, during which
      there will be a surprise memory test with two components (verbally cued recollection and
      picture recognition). On all sessions subjects will also complete mood questionnaires.

            <description>20 healthy adult volunteers will be randomly assigned to the encoding group (MDMA at Encoding). This group will receive capsules before viewing the study materials, and at retrieval two days later, but they will receive MDMA only in the capsule appropriate to their condition, and the next session capsule will contain placebo.
Oral MDMA: This is a between subjects, double-blind, placebo controlled design. We are administering oral MDMA to healthy volunteers to measure its effects on the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval stages of memory.

          <description>After the cued recollection task, all of the pictures were presented to participants (i.e., the ones that they had seen, as well as the ones that were not seen). Participants were then asked, &quot;Did you see this picture?&quot; Hit and false alarm rates were calculated, and memory accuracy was measured as hits minus false alarms.</description>
