  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess pharmacokinetics parameters for nalbuphine after intravenous and intranasal
      administration in infants. Also effect on pain score: Neonatal Infant Pain Score (NIPS) and
      safety will be evaluated with summary of Adverse Events.

      Inclusion criteria are: Infants 29 days-3 months, minimum Body weight 3.0 kg, Indications:
      septical work up.

      Exclusion criteria are: Infants who were born prematurely (before 37 weeks gestation), known
      kidney or liver disease, known chronic illness.

  <overall_status>Suspended</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    We conclude that the doses we administered were safe, but too low. We plan to continue the
    study with higher doses (0.1 mg/kg iv and 0.2 mg/kg intranasal).
