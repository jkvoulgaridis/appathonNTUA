        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females, age &gt;18 years

          2. Signed the informed consent

          3. Late Stage Histologically proven advanced solid tumours for which no standard curative
             therapy exist who failed or refused anti-cancer treatment

          4. Subject should not have any illness or condition deemed by the physician to
             contra-indicate treatment with ACC or may interfere with the assessment of the therapy

          5. Performance Status: ECOG 0-3/ Karnofsky performance status &gt;50

          6. Life Expectancy : about 2 months

          7. Hormonal therapy is allowed if needed

          8. Patient is on conservative treatment for relieving his symptoms

          9. Subjects within normal range of serum-corrected albumin calcium (between 7.0-10.5
             mg/dl)

         10. Acceptable haematology and biochemistry variables:

             WBC ≥3000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil count ≥ 1500 /mm3 Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/mm3
             Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN; for patients with
             hepatic metastases, ALT and AST ≤ 5 x ULN PT/PTT ≤ 1.5 ULN

         11. Subjects should have sufficient Vitamin D levels upon study entry, which is defined as
             25(OH)D serum level &gt;20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) according to a document composed by the Food
             and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, USA. If the subject is Vitamin D
             insufficient or deficient, then a loading dose of Vitamin D3 will be administered
             during subject's enrollment or during the study as follows:

               1. If the serum 25(OH)D level is 12-20 ng/mL (30-50 nmol/L) then a loading oral dose
                  of 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3 should be administered twice with 3-5 days in between
                  the doses.

               2. If the serum 25(OH)D level is ≤ 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L), then a loading oral dose of
                  50,000 IU of Vitamin D3 will be administered three times with 3-5 days in between
                  the doses. Serum 25(OH)D levels will be checked 1-2 weeks following the last
                  loading.

             Nevertheless, if levels of vitamin D levels will not be within the normal range after
             adjustment efforts, patients will not excluded from the study.

         12. Regardless of Vitamin D levels, all subjects will receive a daily maintenance dose of
             1000 IU Vitamin D3, which should be taken in the morning with breakfast.

         13. Subjects receiving Denosumab or bisphosphonates are eligible. Denosumab or
             bisphosphonates can be administered during the study to alleviate bone metastasis
             pain.

         14. Negative Pregnancy Test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent treatment with acute anti-cancer therapy

          2. Hypercalcemia (serum calcium concentration &gt; 12.0 mg/dL)

          3. Clinical Significant Cardiovascular Disease

          4. Known alcohol or drug abuse

          5. Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit understanding or rendering of Informed
             Consent

          6. Active Participation in Clinical Trial in the last 2 weeks prior to inclusion

          7. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic or treated and stable
             off steroids and anti-convulsants for at least 1 month prior to study treatment.

          8. Pregnancy
