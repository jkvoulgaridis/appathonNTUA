  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 120 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial will be conducted at 3 United States sites and is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two priming doses of
      M-001 followed by a seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). The duration
      of this trial for each subject will be approximately 7 months. The entire study duration will
      be approximately 24 months. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety as measured
      by vaccine related adverse events, reactogenicity, and laboratory adverse events of two doses
      of M-001 vaccine, each dose administered approximately 21 days apart; and 2) To assess the T
      cell responses to M-001 component peptides following two doses of M-001.

      cell responses to M-001 component peptides following two doses of M-001. The secondary
      objectives are: 1) To assess all serious adverse events (SAEs) following receipt of each dose
      of M-001 vaccine or placebo, each dose separated by approximately 21 days, through the end of
      the study; 2) To assess all unsolicited non-serious AEs following receipt of each dose of
      M-001 or placebo, each dose separated by approximately 21 days, through 21 days after each
      dose of M-001 or placebo; and 3) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to the
      2018-2019 IIV4 vaccine viruses.

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          4. Are in good health*.

             *As determined by medical history and targeted physical examination to evaluate acute
             or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that
             have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the
             safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical
             diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days prior to investigational
             vaccine study product administration. This includes no change in chronic prescription
             medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical
             diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment and investigational vaccine
             study product administration. Any prescription change that is due to change of health
             care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long
             as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the
             site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional
             risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not
             indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes
             subsequent to enrollment and investigational study product vaccination are acceptable
             provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that
             necessitated a medication change. All chronic medical condtions should pose no
             additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to
             study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception

The percentages were calculated as the number of cells positive for these proteins divided by the total number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells counted in each sample.</description>

        <description>The percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing markers were determined using fluorescence-based flow cytometric assays from cryopreserved PBMCs collected and isolated from participants at Day 1 prior to initial vaccination and again at 14 days after the second vaccination. The percentages were calculated as the number of cells positive for these proteins divided by the total number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells counted in each sample.</description>

        <description>The percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing markers were determined using fluorescence-based flow cytometric assays from cryopreserved PBMCs collected and isolated from participants at Day 1 prior to initial vaccination and again at 14 days after the second vaccination. The percentages were calculated as the number of cells positive for these proteins divided by the total number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells counted in each sample.</description>

        <description>The percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing markers were determined using fluorescence-based flow cytometric assays from cryopreserved PBMCs collected and isolated from participants at Day 1 prior to initial vaccination and again at 14 days after the second vaccination. The percentages were calculated as the number of cells positive for these proteins divided by the total number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells counted in each sample.</description>

        <description>Participants maintained a memory aid and thermometer to record daily oral temperatures and the occurrence of systemic reactions of feverishness, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and nausea, as well as local injection site reactions of pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling for 8 days after vaccination (Day 0-7) based on their interference with daily activities, with a severity grade of mild meaning no interference, moderate as some interference and severe as significant interference/prevented daily activity. Fever was defined as an oral temperature of 38 degree Celsius or higher. Participants are counted if they reported experiencing the symptom at any severity on any of the 8 days post vaccination.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Solicited Injection Site and Systemic Reactogenicity Events After the Second M-001 Vaccination</title>
        <description>Participants maintained a memory aid and thermometer to record daily oral temperatures and the occurrence of systemic reactions of feverishness, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and nausea, as well as local injection site reactions of pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling for 8 days after vaccination (Day 0-7) based on their interference with daily activities, with a severity grade of mild meaning no interference, moderate as some interference and severe as significant interference/prevented daily activity. Fever was defined as an oral temperature of 38 degree Celsius or higher. Participants are counted if they reported experiencing the symptom at any severity on any of the 8 days post vaccination.</description>
