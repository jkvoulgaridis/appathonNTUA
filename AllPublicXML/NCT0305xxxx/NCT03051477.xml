      This study will seek to determine the safety and toxicity profile as well as the maximum
      tolerated dose of Helixor® M in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study is a Phase I study that consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and an
      expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will be used to evaluate the safety and toxicity
      of Helixor® M (mistletoe extract). An accelerated titration design (ATD) will be utilized to
      determine the MTD. The expansion phase will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data about
      Helixor® M.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Any patients who have had any prior treatment with Mistletoe (injection or infusion) will
        not be eligible for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with advanced solid tumors and have received first line standard systemic
             therapy with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or other standard
             treatments for metastatic disease. Patients must either have progressed, are
             refractory, have stable disease and/or removed from therapy due to toxicities.
             Patients beyond first line therapy that do not meet criteria may be considered on a
             case by case basis and allowed at discretion of PI.

          -  Patients with the presence of at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1
             criteria for response assessment.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below (without growth
             factor or transfusion support within 14 days prior to first dose of investigational
             product):

               -  WBC ≥ 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥ 90,000/mcL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN (patients with diagnosed Gilbert's Syndrome will not
                  be excluded if their direct bilirubin is within normal institutional limits)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the patient to be
             eligible.

          -  Female patients enrolled in the study, who are not free from menses for &gt;2 years, post
             hysterectomy / oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized, must be willing to use either 2
             adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of contraception
             to prevent pregnancy or to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study,
             starting with Visit 1 through 28 days after the last dose of study therapy. Approved
             contraceptive methods include for example; intra uterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, female condoms with
             spermicide, or oral contraceptives. Spermicides alone are not an acceptable method of
             contraception.

             -- Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study therapy.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
