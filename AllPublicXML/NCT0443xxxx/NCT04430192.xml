    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the dosimetry, efficacy and toxicity of Lu-PSMA in men with
      high PSMA-expressing high-risk localized or locoregional advanced prostate cancer (HRCaP)
      undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label, phase I/II non-randomised clinical trial will evaluate the dosimetry,
      efficacy and toxicity of Lu-PSMA in men with high PSMA-expressing high-risk localized or
      locoregional advanced prostate cancer (HRCaP) undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and
      pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Patients will receive one or two cycles of 177Lu-PSMA
      followed by surgery. The primary objective is to determine the radiation absorbed dose in the
      prostate and involved lymph nodes. Secondary objectives include evaluating imaging response
      to therapy using PSMA-PET, biochemical response, pathological response, adverse effects of
      Lu-PSMA and surgical safety, and health-related Quality of Life (QoL).
