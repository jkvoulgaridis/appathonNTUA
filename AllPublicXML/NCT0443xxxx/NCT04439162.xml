  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During coronary artery bypass surgery, myocardial protection, especially of the right
      ventricle, may be inadequate in the presence of severe coronary lesions that obstruct the
      antegrade delivery of cold cardioplegia
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asymetric myocardial cooling has been reported to yield postoperative right ventricular
      dysfunction, which may contribute to postoperative morbidity and mortality. Retrograde
      coronary sinus perfusion was introduced in 1956 to facilitate surgery involving the aortic
      valve. This technique was introduced as a means of myocardial protection for coronary artery
      bypass surgery in 1967 and has recently received renewed interest. An innovative method of
      delivering retrograde cardioplegia through the right atrium was recently developed by Fabiani
      and associates. This technique has obviated the need to directly cannulate the coronary sinus
      and thus has eliminated concerns regarding coronary sinus rupture due to cannulation, and
      concerns of inadequate right ventricular perfusion. In contrast to antegrade delivery,
      retrograde delivery of cardioplegia through the right atrium is not subject to the problem of
      limited distribution in the presence of coronary artery occlusive disease and thus allows
      more uniform cooling of the left ventricle,so the study will compare the results of combined
      antegrade and retrograde versurs antegrade cardioplegia in complex coronary artery bypass
      surgeries
