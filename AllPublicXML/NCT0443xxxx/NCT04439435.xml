  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis,and chronic
      infection with HBV often leads to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis,and hepatocellular
      carcinoma. So far, the most effective way to prevent HBV infection in susceptible population
      is to inject hepatitis B vaccine. However, long-term protection against hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) after vaccination remains widely debated. This study aims to evaluate the existence of
      immune protection in healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody and find a
      method to evaluate the immune protection induced by hepatitis B vaccine.

      One method to determine the long-term protection provided by hepatitis B vaccine against HBV
      infection is to estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic carrier status and breakthrough
      infection of previously vaccinated individuals in different periods. Up to now, no
      international standard suggests that hepatitis B vaccine should be used as a routine
      immunization program. However, it is an important issue to discuss the immune protection of
      healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody and the duration of this
      protection in the future. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the existence of immune
      protection of healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody, find a method to
      evaluate the immune protection induced by hepatitis B vaccine.

      The main content of the study: To recruit healthy children. Children lacking HBsAb were
      selected for immune memory test and receive a Hep B booster. The results of Antibody positive
      group and antibody negative group were compared and analyzed. To find out the most suitable
      method for evaluating immune protection.
