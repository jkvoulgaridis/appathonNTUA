    <textblock>
      This phase II MATCH treatment trial identifies the effects of VS-6063 (defactinib) in
      patients whose cancer has a genetic change called NF2 mutation. Defactinib may block a
      protein called FAK, which may be needed for cancer cell growth when NF2 mutations are
      present. Researchers hope to learn if defactinib will shrink this type of cancer or stop its
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple
      myeloma.

      II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. III. To identify potential
      predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or
      resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and
      imaging-based assessment platforms.

      IV. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes
      from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free
      survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and
      targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive defactinib hydrochloride (defactinib) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if less than 2
      years from study entry, and then every 6 months for year 3 from study entry.

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial response to treatment among eligible and treated patients. Objective response rate is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, the Cheson (2014) criteria for lymphoma patients, and the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for glioblastoma patients. For each treatment arm, 90% two-sided binomial exact confidence interval will be calculated for ORR.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 3 months for =&lt; 2 years and every 6 months for year 3</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as time from treatment start date to date of death from any cause. Patients alive at the time of analysis are censored at last contact date. OS will be evaluated specifically for each drug (or step) using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, then every 2 cycles for the first 26 cycles and every 3 cycles thereafter until disease progression, up to 3 years post registration</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as time from treatment start date to date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
