  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is nowadays a leading cause of disability with devastating sequelae. Upper limb
      spasticity is one of them. Nevertheless, not all the muscles are equally affected, as some
      may turn spastic or paretic and other remain intact. This unique pathophysiological mosaic
      dictates a precise therapeutic plan. Existing spasticity treatment has significant drawbacks
      due to its unspecific targeting and short duration. A causal, life-lasting treatment,
      precisely adapted to every single patient's needs and to disease pattern, is currently
      missing. Hyperselective muscle denervation and subsequent cognitive reinnervation with
      appropriate unaffected donor nerves may break the pathological spastic circuit and provide
      volitional muscle control. With this pioneering study we will perform cognitive nerve
      transfers to spastic muscles and will prospectively investigate their effects on clinical,
      electrophysiological, molecular-biological and histological level. Accurate donor nerve
      selection will be for the first time quantified through motor unit number estimation with
      high-density needle electromyography. This revolutionary concept can open the window to a new
      era of therapeutic possibilities for stroke victims.

    <description>Muscle biopsies from spastic muscles will be obtained during the surgery of nerve transfers. The muscle satellite cell population (%) will be calculated with the use of Flow Cytometry and be compared to the one of healthy muscles of control group. There will be no recruitment procedure for the control group. Routinely, when we carry out surgery for ulnar nerve release in the elbow and nerve transposition, a part of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle needs to be excised and discarded. After obtaining informed consent from patients for further use of their biological material, we will collect these muscles and use them as control group.</description>

    <description>Patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity will be operated for cognitive nerve transfers to spastic muscles to allow for volitional muscle reinnervation and disrupture of spasticity.

    <description>Based on the fact that upper motor neuron syndrome after stroke is presented with variable clinical features, usually without affecting in the same way the entire upper extremity, we aim to investigate the efficacy of nerve transfers to spastic muscles after stroke using as donor nerves that innervate unaffected ipsilateral volitionally controlled muscles.</description>
