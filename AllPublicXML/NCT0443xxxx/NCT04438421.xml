  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a mouthwash containing Hydrogen
      Peroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate and Glycine in the prevention and management of complications
      associated gingivitis by film forming action.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 subjects will be enrolled, who show with gingivitis caused by accumulation of plaque
      and/or tartar selected consecutively. Subsequently, subjects will be equally divided and
      randomized into the test group or control group.

      During the three examinations, the subjects will undergo the collection of bleeding and
      plaque indices according to Silness J &amp; Loe H 3,4. Four surfaces per tooth (vestibular,
      lingual/palatal, mesial, distal) will be considered.

    <intervention_model_description>50 subjects affected with gingivitis, caused by accumulation of plaque and/or tartar, will be selected and enrolled in this study.

    <masking_description>The products will be packaged in such a way that they are not recognizable neither by the operator, nor by the patient. Each package will be assigned a number that in turn will refer to the type of the product. The association between the number and type of the product will be collected by another operator according to the association carried out by a dedicated software. The operator who will deliver the product will be informed about the type only at the end of the treatment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bleeding index</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo the measurement of bleeding index according to Silness J &amp; Loe. Four surfaces per tooth (vestibular, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal) will be considered.
Data will be collected based on four possible clinical conditions:
Code 0: absence of bleeding during probing depth measurement; Code 1: absence of bleeding during probing depth measurement, presence of redness and oedema; Code 2: presence of bleeding during probing depth measurement with redness and oedema; Code 3: spontaneous bleeding
Higher score means worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo the measurement of plaque index according to Silness J &amp; Loe. Four surfaces per tooth (vestibular, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal) will be considered.
Data will be collected based on four possible clinical conditions:
Code 0: absence of plaque; Code 1: presence of plaque not visible to the naked eye but evidenced by the periodontal probe passage; Code 2: presence of plaque at the level of the gingival margin; Code 3: abundant presence of plaque at the level of the gingival margin and/or the rest of the dental surface.
The sum of the values of the four surfaces examined, divided by the very number of surfaces, will give the plaque and bleeding index value for each individual tooth. The sum of the indices of each examined tooth divided by the total number of teeth examined will indicate the overall plaque and bleeding index of the subject at that time.</description>
