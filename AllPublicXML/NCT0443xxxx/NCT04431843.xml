    <measure>MoCA-K; Korean Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive function evaluation using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA-K) is a total of 8 items, and evaluates cognitive functions such as time / execution power, vocabulary, memory, attention, sentence, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation.
Time / execution power's total score is 5 points, vocabulary's total score is 3 points, attention's total score is 3 points, sentence's total score is 3 points, abstraction's total score is 2 points, delayed recall's total score is 5 points, orientation's total score is 6 points. It takes about 10 minutes to complete, and the total score is 30 points and total score make sum score. A score of 23 points or more is regarded as normal. If you have less than 6 years of education, add 1 point.
