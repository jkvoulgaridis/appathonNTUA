      This study evaluates the feasibility of the intervention and the study design. Furthermore,
      it investigates the effects of an exergame training including strength, balance, cognitive
      and pelvic floor muscle training. The main risk in this study is related to potential
      accidents/falls during the training (and not mainly to the data acquisition procedures). But
      as the difficulty of the training game is adaptive, the participants will always be
      challenged on an appropriate level for their physical condition. Furthermore, before and
      after the training period, several low risk measurements are conducted. This study
      contributes to fundamental research investigating how multicomponent exergame training
      influence physical and cognitive functions.
