  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric guidelines recommend preoperative weight loss of 5% to reduce the risk of surgical
      complications. However, results in the literature on the improvement of surgical procedure
      and outcomes are still conflicting.

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative weight loss by means of a 14-day
      low-calorie diet in bariatric patients on operative time, the ease of the Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGB) procedure and long-term weight loss in a real-life experimental setting.

    <description>Ten aspects of the RYGB procedure will be scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The total score can range from 10 to 50, with 10 being the easiest.
The ten aspects include:
Exerting force on instruments (1=very low, 5= very high)
Difficulty of moving the liver (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)
Size of the liver (1=very small, 5= very large)
Size of omentum (1=very small, 5= very large)
Difficulty of approaching pouch (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)
Accessibility of Treitz ligament (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)
Difficulty of creating pouch (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)
Difficulty of measuring small intestine (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)
Difficulty of entero-entero connection (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)
Difficulty of abdominal wall hernia repair (1=very easy, 5=very difficult)</description>
