      This pilot randomized controlled trial seeks: (1) to determine the preliminary efficacy of
      our modernized collaborative care intervention for depression in improving the diabetes risk
      markers of hemoglobin A1c and insulin resistance and (2) to explore whether somatic
      depressive symptoms - i.e., hyperphagia (increased appetite/weight) and/or hypersomnia
      (increased sleep) - moderate the effect of the eIMPACT-DM intervention on diabetes risk
      markers.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects 31 million (12%) U.S. adults, and another 82 million (34%) adults have
      prediabetes, a precursor to diabetes. The ramifications of diabetes are grave and include
      cardiovascular disease, disability, and death. While these statistics highlight the
      importance of diabetes prevention, current approaches have only partial effectiveness. This
      has created a clear need to identify new primary prevention targets and approaches for
      diabetes, and depression and depression treatment are strong candidates in this regard. Over
      20 years of evidence indicates that depression is an independent, clinically important,
      robust, biobehaviorally plausible, and modifiable risk factor for diabetes. However, research
      has yet to determine whether depression treatment can prevent the development of diabetes in
      people with prediabetes. Given that depression is still receiving limited attention in
      settings where diabetes prevention occurs (e.g., primary care), there is a large cohort of
      patients with an underdetected or undertreated diabetes risk factor (depression). This status
      quo and the strong state of the depression-to-diabetes science create the need for a pilot
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the utility of depression treatment as a new diabetes
      prevention strategy. Thus, we propose a pilot RCT of 64 primary care patients (50% minority)
      with a depressive disorder and prediabetes. Patients will be randomized to 6 months of
      eIMPACT-DM (intervention) or Active Control (comparator). eIMPACT-DM is our modernized
      collaborative stepped care intervention consisting of (1) computerized and telephonic
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression and (2) select antidepressant medications
      included in an algorithm optimized for diabetes risk reduction. Our preliminary data
      establish the feasibility and antidepressive efficacy of eIMPACT-DM. The Active Control
      consists of depression education, symptom monitoring, and primary care for depression. Our
      primary aim is to determine the preliminary efficacy of eIMPACT-DM in improving the diabetes
      risk markers of hemoglobin A1c (primary outcome) and insulin resistance (secondary outcome).
      Our exploratory aim is to explore whether somatic depressive symptoms - i.e., hyperphagia
      (increased appetite/weight) and/or hypersomnia (increased sleep) - moderate the effect of
      eIMPACT-DM on diabetes risk markers. A positive pilot trial would pave the way to an
      R01-level RCT by: (1) generating critical proof-of-concept data (eIMPACT-DM can improve A1c)
      to support the premise of the definitive trial; (2) providing preliminary effect sizes for
      eIMPACT-DM on diabetes risk markers to help justify future power analyses; (3) identifying a
      potentially important moderator of eIMPACT-DM efficacy that may need to be incorporated into
      the definitive trial. Ultimately, demonstrating that depression treatment reduces diabetes
      risk would identify a novel target (depression) for diabetes prevention efforts, and it would
      equip healthcare providers with a new practical, scalable, and disseminable intervention
      (eIMPACT-DM) to help lower diabetes risk for a large cohort of high-risk patients. These
      practice changes should translate into reduced diabetes morbidity, mortality, and costs.

    <description>Fasting blood samples will be collected, and whole blood and plasma aliquots will be frozen. A1c will be measured by an immunoturbidimetric method on a Randox Daytona Clinical Analyzer.A1c is the primary outcome because: (1) it is the gold standard measure of glycemia and a common surrogate endpoint, (2) it strongly predicts future diabetes, (3) interventions decreasing A1c improve clinical diabetes endpoints, and (4) diabetes prevention interventions targeting glycemic control result in lower rates of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. Thus, A1c is well suited to evaluate if a new intervention approach holds promise.</description>

HOMA scores will be derived from fasting glucose (glucose oxidase method on a Randox Daytona Clinical Analyzer) and insulin (two antibody immunoassay on a Roche cobas e411 Analyzer). HOMA score is an established index of insulin resistance that correlates highly with the more invasive euglycemic clamp and is appropriate for assessing change.</description>

    <description>eIMPACT-DM is a 6-month, modernized, collaborative, stepped care intervention consisting of (1) computerized and telephonic cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression and (2) select antidepressant medications included in an algorithm optimized for diabetes risk reduction. It is a collaborative care intervention in which a multidisciplinary team delivers established depression treatments consistent with patient preference. It uses a stepped, flexible, treat-to-target approach that modernizes the IMPACT intervention by harnessing technology to minimize staff and space requirements. Interventions are Beating the Blues, Problem Solving Treatment in Primary Care, and select FDA-approved antidepressants. The treatment team consists of a depression clinical specialist, a supervising MD with expertise in primary care and IMPACT, and the patients' primary care providers (PCPs).</description>

    <description>BtB US, a computerized CBT designed for primary care patients, uses an interactive, multimedia format to deliver 8 50-minute, weekly sessions, the structure and content of which mirror face-to-face CBT. General topics include challenging dysfunctional thoughts, activity scheduling, problem solving, graded exposure, task breakdown, sleep management, and relapse prevention. BtB has more empirical support than any other computerized psychotherapy. BtB is a potent intervention, with effect sizes comparable to face-to-face CBT. To minimize time/transportation barriers, BtB sessions will occur at the PI's lab or a location with internet access selected by the patient (patient's, family member's, or friend's home).</description>

    <description>We first considered all FDA-approved antidepressants and excluded those with weight gain effects (tricyclics, paroxetine, mirtazapine) and those rarely used in primary care (MAOIs). Then, we used existing evidence to inform the structure. We made bupropion (an aminoketone) and fluoxetine (an SSRI) our first-line and second-line antidepressants, as meta-analyses indicate that their use is associated with weight loss. We made other SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, sertraline) and SNRIs (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine) our third-line antidepressants, given their negligible effects on weight. Our team will make recommendations to the patient's PCP, who will write prescriptions. Our team and the PCP will then collaboratively manage pharmacotherapy.</description>

    <description>(1) The graduate research assistant (RA) will have a 50-minute call with AC patients to review depression materials. The RA will provide a list of Eskenazi Health mental health services and will encourage patients to follow-up with their PCP. We will then send an electronic health record message to the PCP encouraging them to address their patient's depression, note that there are no care restrictions, and provide the same list of services. (2) The RA will call AC patients every 4 weeks to assess depressive symptoms and will notify clinical staff to encourage additional care when indicated. (3) AC patients will receive current primary care for depression. The Eskenazi Health primary care clinics utilize a team care approach, with PCPs supported by embedded behavioral health clinicians and affiliated psychiatrists.</description>
