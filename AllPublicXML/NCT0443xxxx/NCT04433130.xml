  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will take a mixed-methods approach to gather relevant information from both
      children or adolescents, and their parents on profiles of eye health, as well as routinely
      available indicators. This includes a series of baselining and follow-up analyses of cohort
      data collected on epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and service aspects of eye health
      and individual-level outcomes

      symptoms, biomarkers, self-reported measures, risk profiles, etc.).
