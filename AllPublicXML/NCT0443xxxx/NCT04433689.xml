  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that intraocular pressure changes during pregnancy. Collagen structure changes
      during pregnancy to enable softening of the symphysis, whitening of the birth chanel, and,
      thus, ultimately to enable delivery of a child. The cornea consists of highly structured
      collagen fibers. Hence, it seams logically that corneal biomechanics also change during
      pregnancy.

      It is known that intraocular pressure changes during pregnancy. Collagen structure changes
      during pregnancy to enable softening of the symphysis, whitening of the birth chanel, and,
      thus, ultimately to enable delivery of a child. The cornea consists of highly structured
      collagen fibers. Hence, it seams logically that corneal biomechanics also change during
      pregnancy.

      Measurement of intraocular pressure is highly dependant on corneal properties. With the
      Corvis ST device by Ocular Inc. it is possible to measure intraocular pressure and
      investigated corneal biomechanics. The aim of this study is therefore to compare corneal
      biomechanical properties during the third trimester with corneal biomechanical properties at
      3 months after delivery.
