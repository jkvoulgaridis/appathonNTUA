  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients suffer from badly decayed anterior teeth mostly in young age, causing esthetics
      and functional issues. This may be due to more than cause as fights, contact sports,
      accidents and falls.

      However; implant placement might not be the treatment of choice in some situations such as:
      medically compromised patients with absolute contraindications for implant placement or
      requiring extensive augmentation procedures, growing patients, patients with financial
      limitations, in addition to patients living in rural areas with no access for CBCT machines.

      Moreover, clinicians must be aware of cost-to-benefit ratios when attempting to recommend a
      specific treatment modality, especially in patients having financial limitations.

      Regarding the aforementioned conditions, surgical extrusion might be considered a
      cost-effective 'often overlooked' alternative compared to immediate single-tooth implant
      placement. Regarding healing time, cost, soft and hard tissue outcomes, surgical extrusion
      may be a good alternative yielding better soft tissue results as we preserve the natural
      tooth with the whole periodontium.

    <description>The next step will be atraumatic extraction which will be initiated by using straight periotome until it is sufficiently luxated and gently pulled out to the amount of sufficient ferrule effect without encroaching the biological width. 90- or 180-degrees rotation of the tooth will be done if needed. The tooth will be supported from palatal side, etching will be done using 37% phosphoric acid, rinsing, drying, bonding agent and then application of 3M Filtek flowable composite on rounded 16mm stainless steel wire for splinting in the middle of the tooth without extension of flowable composite neither to the mesial nor to the distal. This procedure should be followed by occlusal adjustment if needed. Splint will be removed after 2 weeks.</description>

    <description>The patient is anaesthetized. Atraumatic extraction of the badly broken-down teeth will be performed using peroiotome. Luxation should be done mesiodistally and not buccolingually, 11 to avoid damaging the buccal plate. After tooth removal, a curette is used to confirm that the location of the buccal plate is intact. Standard drilling procedures are performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the implant is placed in the prepared site. Temporization should be done using composite 3M Filtek Z250 XT material. Finally, a porcelain fused to zirconia crown will be performed. Jumping gap occurring subsequent to atraumatic extraction and immediate implant placement more than 2 mm will be grafted using Xenograft.</description>
