  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, joint diseases are common health problems as identified by the Elderly Health
      Service under the Department of Health. It accounts for most of the disability of the elderly
      in Hong Kong. In particular, osteoarthritis (OA) is on the rise and the prevalence of OA
      increases with age. Women are more likely to have OA in knee and hip joints after menopause.
      A study in 2000 reported that among Hong Kong people aged 50 and above, 7 percent of men and
      13 percent of women suffered from OA. With an ageing population, it is expected that OA will
      become a major public health problem in Hong Kong and worldwide and the socio-economic cost
      of supportive care to these patients can become a major burden to Hong Kong society and many
      regions in the world. Early diagnosis and prevention of OA and effective technology for
      treatment monitoring are very important. At present, the management of OA is not optimal and
      standard quality indicators suggest that the majority of persons with the disease do not
      receive appropriate care. Over half of the population affected with OA are unaware of the
      diagnosis. The research team have developed a quantitative and fully automated non-contrast
      MRI application for early detection and monitoring of joint diseases. The whole project was
      funded by the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) (MRP/001/18X ) started in January 2019.
      This clinical trial is part of the quantitative assessment of this developed technology. The
      team anticipate this innovation will address both OA diagnosis, surveillance and management.
      This can potentially increase diagnostic capabilities with minimum efforts, improving patient
      awareness, and improved treatment monitoring of the disease state after the interventions.
      Thus, the proposed technology is expected to provide betterment in the quality of life for
      the elderly population.

    <description>The selection of patients with different level of OA will be made using the existing Kellgren-Laurence grading systems. The recruited patients will receive MRI exams with our enhanced sequencing. The OA level of each patient will be determined objectively through our quantitative OA grading system on MRI, which will be compared to Kellgren-Laurence grading results to evaluate the clinical performance of the MRI.</description>
