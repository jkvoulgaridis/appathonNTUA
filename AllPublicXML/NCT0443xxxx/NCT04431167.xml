  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research program aims to investigate the clinical, physiological, metabolic and
      molecular effects of lifestyle change in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with high
      cardiovascular risk. This 6-month parallel-group randomized controlled trial aims to
      investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed lifestyle change intervention -
      through recommendations for structured and unstructured physical activity and healthy eating
      - on increasing physical activity level and improving eating habits. Potential effects of the
      intervention on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors, health-related quality of
      life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, sleep quality and immune function will be
      investigated. Gold-standard techniques and a variety of analyses will be performed to access
      the potential mechanisms involved in response to this intervention.

    <description>The lifestyle change intervention will involve two constructs: increasing the level of physical activity and improving eating habits, each with its own specific domains and goals. It will be based on a structured program of physical exercises and selection of individualized goals in the domains of transportation, leisure and work to reduce sedentary behavior with the aim of increasing the level of physical activity, as well as establishing changes in dietary aspects, involving consumption domains, structure, behavior and eating attitude using nutritional counseling techniques.</description>
