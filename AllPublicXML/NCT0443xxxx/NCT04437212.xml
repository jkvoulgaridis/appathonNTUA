  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery has become the standard treatment
      option for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). However, only 20% to 40%
      of patients can achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT with
      favorable prognosis and about 10% of patients have disease progression after
      chemoradiotherapy. How to improve the the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy is an important
      clinical problem to be solved.

      Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints has demonstrated promising activity in
      advanced EC especially in ESCC. In Keynote181 study, for patients with metastatic esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of PD-L1 expression, pembrolizumab significantly improved
      overall survival compared with chemotherapy. However, the efficacy and safety of
      immunotherapy therapy in surgery-based multidisciplinary treatment of local advanced
      esophageal cancer still need a lot of clinical studies to further confirm.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy combined with perioperative toripalimab in patients with locally advanced
      esophageal squamous cell cancer.
