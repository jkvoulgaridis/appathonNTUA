  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In the Netherlands the two main surgical approaches for hemiarthroplasty are the
      posterolateral and the direct lateral approach. Currently there is no conclusive evidence
      which of these two approaches results in better patient outcomes.

      Objective: Assessing the patient outcome comparing the posterolateral with the direct lateral
      approach in patients being treated with cemented hemiarthroplasty after femoral neck
      fractures.

      Study design: A randomised controlled multi-center superiority trial and natural experiment
      with an economic evaluation alongside.

      Study population: All patients older than 18 years with a femoral neck fracture whereby
      treatment with cemented hemiarthroplasty is recommended according the national guidelines.

      Intervention: Treatment with cemented hemiarthroplasty using the posterolateral approach.

      Standard intervention to be compared to: Treatment with cemented hemiarthroplasty using the
      direct lateral approach.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the patient-rated quality of life
      (EQ-5D-5L) at 6 months after surgery.

      Secondary outcomes are: ADL functionality (KATZ), Balance test (SPPB), Tendency to Fall
      (FES-I), Pain (NRS), Re-interventions, Mobility, Discharge destination, Complications, and
      cost-effectiveness.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The different approaches in the two treatment arms of the randomised controlled
      trial are widely used techniques in the Netherlands and many of the outcome measures are part
      of the standard clinical follow-up after hip fracture. Therefore, there is no extra risk or
      burden for participating patients, except for the time to complete some additional follow-up
      measurements. The primary outcome measurement and secondary outcomes, will be assessed
      through questionnaires online, by hardcopy or by phone at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months
      postoperatively. The assessment of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) balance
      test, will be performed by one of the study researchers or nurse practitioner to protect
      continuity and feasibility.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system assesses health in five dimensions (MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT, ANXIETY / DEPRESSION), each of which has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to). This part of the EQ-5D questionnaire provides a descriptive profile that can be used to generate a health state profile. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the patient rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>

    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) is a short, easy to administer tool that measures the level of concern about fallingduring 16 social and physical activities inside and outside the home whether or not the person actually does the activity. The minimum score is 16 (no concern about falling) to the maximum score of 64 (severe concern about falling).</description>

    <description>Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is an instrument to assess functional status as a measurement of the client's ability to perform activities of daily living independently. The Index ranks adequacy of performance in the six functions of bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. Clients are scored yes/no for independence in each of the six functions. A score of 6 indicates full function, 4 indicates moderate impairment, and 2 or less indicates severe functional impairment.</description>

    <description>An economic evaluation will be performed for physical functioning and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). For estimating QALYs, the patients' EQ-5D-5L health states will be converted into utility scores using the Dutch tariff. QALYs will subsequently be calculated using linear interpolation between measurement points.</description>
