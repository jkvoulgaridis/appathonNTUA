  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with HIV face unique challenges to engagement in care and
      their ability to achieve optimal health outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that
      developmentally-tailored behavioral interventions will improve engagement in HIV care and
      viral suppression among AYA with HIV in Kenya. This two stage study will initially randomize
      880 AYA with HIV to either standard of care (SOC) or electronic navigation to prevent
      treatment lapse. Participants who have a lapse will be re-randomized to SOC, in-person peer
      navigation, or conditional cash transfers. Formative work will be conducted initially to
      tailor the interventions to AYA and then later to assess AYA perception, experience, and
      satisfaction with the interventions. We will evaluate the most effective and cost-effective
      intervention and sequence of interventions to inform HIV program managers, public policy
      makers, and other key stakeholders the best approaches to improve engagement of care of AYA
      with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the global response to HIV has reached close to 20 million persons with life-saving
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and saved upwards of 60 million life-years, progress has been
      uneven and adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 14-24 years represent a key group left
      behind. Compared to adults, AYA with HIV face more numerous, more diverse and more intense
      barriers to adherence and retention. The investigators will utilize a SMART study design in
      two stages among 880 AYA with HIV in Kenya to improve retention and viral suppression. In
      stage 1 AYA will be randomized 1:1 to either (1) standard of care education or counseling vs.
      (2) electronic navigation. Participants who do well (no lapses in retention, medication pick
      up and viral suppression) will be maintained on these low-intensity interventions, whereas
      those who fail will be re-randomized a second time to one of three re-engagement
      interventions (stage 2): (1) standard of care tracing, (2) a conditional cash transfer and
      (3) in-person peer navigation. The primary outcome will be a combination of visit adherence
      and documented viral load suppression. The investigators anticipate that enrolling 880 AYA
      will result in 99% power to detect a 15% difference in the primary outcome between
      intervention groups. The investigators believe this study will yield evidence specific to AYA
      with HIV, quantify the relative magnitude of different sequenced interventions, capture the
      costs, and have direct relevance for public health programming to end the AIDS epidemic
      through engaging adolescents and young adults with HIV.
