  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants often suffer from apnea of prematurity (AOP; a cessation of breathing) due to
      immaturity of the respiratory system. AOP can lead to oxygen shortage and a low heart rate
      which might harm the development of the newborn, especially the central nervous system. In
      order to prevent oxygen shortage, infants are treated with non-invasive respiratory support
      and caffeine. Despite these treatments, many preterm newborns still suffer from AOP and need
      invasive mechanical ventilation. Although this will result in complete resolution of AOP,
      invasive mechanical ventilation has the disadvantage of being a major risk of chronic lung
      disease and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome. Restrictive invasive ventilation is
      therefore advocated nowadays in preterm infants. Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant that has
      been administered off-label to treat AOP. Doxapram, as add-on treatment, seems to be
      effective in treating AOP and to prevent invasive mechanical ventilation. It is unclear if a
      preterm infant benefit from doxapram treatment on the longer term. This study compares
      doxapram to placebo and hypothesizes that doxapram will protect preterm infants from both
      invasive ventilation (and related lung disease) and AOP related oxygen shortage (and related
      impaired brain development).

      The main objective of the trial is to investigate if doxapram is safe and effective in
      reducing the composite outcome of death and neurodevelopmental impairment/severe disability
      at 2 years corrected age as compared to placebo. This multicenter double blinded randomized
      placebo-controlled superiority trial will be conducted in multiple neonatal intensive care
      units in the Netherlands and Belgium, including 8 years follow-up. After written
      informed-consent the patients will be randomized into the doxapram treatment group or the
      placebo treatment group. Randomization will be stratified based on center and gestational age
      &lt; or &gt;= 26 weeks.

      The participating departments include Dutch and Belgian Neonatal Intensive care units. The
      units include both academic and non-academic level III and IV units that are specialized in
      the care for critically ill and preterm born infants. Postnatal ages of patients at doxapram
      start vary from directly after birth up to months for the most-preterm born infants.

      Blinded continuous doxapram or placebo (glucose 5%) will be infused as long as needed.
      Therapy is down titrated or stopped based on the patients' condition. If endotracheal
      intubation is needed study drug is stopped. After extubation study drug may be restarted.
      Switch to gastro-enteral administration is allowed if no iv-access is needed for other
      reasons. Next to study drug infusion, there will be no other study-related interventions. All
      outcome variables are already collected as standard of care. In a subset of patients doxapram
      plasma levels will be determined to validate the doxapram pharmacokinetic (PK) model. Blood
      will only be collected during routine blood sampling, with a maximum amount of 0.6 ml.
      Economic and cost-effectiveness evaluation will be performed. The national protocol for
      preterm birth advices follow-up at 2, 5.5 and 8 years respectively, as in the current study.
      Additional questionnaires will be used to collect data on the quality of life of patients and
      their parents.

    <description>Disability will be defined as cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, severe hearing loss, or bilateral blindness. Cognitive delay will be defined as a Mental Development Index score of less than 85 on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Bayley Score of Infant Development (BSID) III scores. Cerebral palsy will be diagnosed if the child had a non-progressive motor impairment characterized by abnormal muscle tone and decreased range or control of movements. The level of gross motor function will be determined with the use of the Gross Motor Function Classification System. Audiometry will be performed to determine the presence or absence of hearing loss. Blindness will be defined as a corrected visual acuity less than 20/200</description>
