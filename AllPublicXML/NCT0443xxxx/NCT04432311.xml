  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder in adults, affecting 2.8% of
      the population. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating which are
      not followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviours such as self-induced vomiting. BED is
      associated with an increased risk of health complications, significant impairment to social
      and occupational functioning, and reduced quality of life. Despite the negative consequences
      associated with this disorder, standard therapy for BED is often inaccessible and costly.

      To address the limitations of standard therapy for BED our research team has developed Binge
      Focused Therapy (BFT) as an innovative, guided self-help approach to BED treatment. BFT was
      derived from elements of &quot;The Brain Over Binge Recovery Guide&quot; by Kathryn Hansen, which
      incorporates fundamental aspects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dialectical Behaviour
      Therapy, Motivational Enhancement Therapy, and addictions treatment. We further streamlined
      this approach into a protocol that can be delivered by non eating disorder specialists (e.g.,
      honours psychology students, nurses, occupational therapists).

      In 2018, our research team conducted a proof-of-concept pilot study with a sample of 40
      individuals with BED. Unpublished results of this uncontrolled study indicated that the
      sample experienced significant reductions in binge episodes per month, binge eating severity,
      general eating disorder symptomology, and improved confidence in changing binge eating
      behaviours.

      Although the results from this small, uncontrolled, proof-of-concept study are encouraging,
      qualitative and quantitative data highlighted several aspects of the BFT intervention that
      could be altered and tested in a randomized controlled trial that compares BFT to an active
      comparator.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-Treatment (10 week)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the global score generated from the Binge Eating Scale (BES). The BES is a 16-item measure, each item has 3-4 coded responses. The total score ranges from 0-46, where a higher score indicates greater binge eating severity.</description>

    <description>This will be measured using the global score generated from the Binge Eating Scale (BES). The BES is a 16-item measure, each item has 3-4 coded responses. The total score ranges from 0-46, where a higher score indicates greater binge eating severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binge Eating Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 10 week, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported changes in Binge Eating Frequency over past 28 days will be measured using Item 15 from the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 (EDE-Q; Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 1994) which inquires about the number of days with objective binge episodes over the past 28 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Symptomology (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 10 week, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported changes in Eating Disorder Symptomology will be measured using the global score generated from the EDE-Q (Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 1994). The EDE-Q is a 28-item measure that assesses four areas of eating disorder psychopathology (eating concern, shape concern, weight concern, dietary restraint). Each item uses a Likert scale ranging from 0 (lowest frequency/severity) to 6 (highest frequency/severity). The global score ranges from 0-6 where higher scores indicate greater impairment. The global score is obtained using the mean of the four subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 10 week, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported changes in clinical impairment will be measured using the Clinical Impairment Assessment Questionnaire (CIA; Bohn &amp; Fairburn, 2008). This is a 16-item self-report measure of the severity of psychosocial impairment due to eating disorder features over the past 28 days. Each item is ranked on a 0-3 scale (0 being &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 being &quot;a lot&quot;). Total scores range from 0-48, with higher scores indicating greater clinical impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confidence to Change Binge Eating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 10 week, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Confidence to Change Binge Eating will be measured using the question, &quot;On a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can change your binge eating if you wanted to?&quot;, with higher scores indicating greater confidence. This question assesses perceived confidence in ability to change binge eating.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Abstinence is defined as a 100% reduction in binge episodes in the 28 days prior to collecting outcome measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Remission is defined as meeting criteria for abstinence (100% reduction in binge episodes in the 28 days prior to collecting outcome measures) in addition to having EDEQ global score less than or equal to 2.77 (Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 1994).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention adherence for participants in the BFT group will be based on session attendance. Completers will be defined as anyone who completes Session 1 and at least one other session. Adherence questionnaires at Week 6 and Week 10 time points inquire about which aspects of the intervention outside of the sessions have been used.
Intervention adherence for participants in the CBT USH group will be calculated using questionnaires provided at both the Week 6 and Week 10 time points that inquire about which chapters have been read and which &quot;CBT Steps&quot; have been completed thus far. Completers will be defined as anyone who indicates that they have read Chapters 1, 4, 5, and 'Getting Ready', and completed Step 1 through Step 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Expectations</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention, Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly &amp; Borkovec, 2000). The CEQ is a six item self-report measure that measures treatment expectancy and rationale credibility of therapeutic interventions. Each item is scored on a 1-9 Likert-type scale or as a percentage rating from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%. Higher scores indicate greater credibility/expectancy of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in both groups will respond to developed Likert-style and open-ended questions asking about their perceptions of their assigned program. Each Likert item is ranked on a scale from 1-9. Higher total scores indicate greater satisfaction with the intervention.</description>
