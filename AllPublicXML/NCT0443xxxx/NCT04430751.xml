  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population is aging and increasingly at risk for falls and fractures with substantial
      consequences to wellbeing, health and costs. Training interventions such as Tai Chi have been
      demonstrated to help reduce these risks. Tai chi is a subset of both martial and medical qi
      gong.

      This is a prospective intervention study with wait time control that will examine the ability
      of a manualized medical qi gong training protocol improve balance, gait and health
      self-confidence.

      The intervention is a 12 week manualized medical qi gong training program where students are
      taught a progressive series of 10 qi gong forms that are designed to build upon each other
      and restore balance and function. These forms involve both physical movement and
      visualization.

      The Community Balance and Mobility scale (a performance based measure) and
      Activities-specified Balance Confidence scale (a survey)will be the prime outcome instruments
