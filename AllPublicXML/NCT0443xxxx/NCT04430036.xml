  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial to evaluate the tolerability, efficacy, and immune outcomes of
      AGEN1884 plus AGEN2034 concurrent with cisplatin and gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant treatment
      of muscle-invasive, non-metastatic bladder cancer prior to radical cystectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will begin with an initial safety run-in to establish the safety of the combination prior
      to expansion to the full planned phase II. The overall phase II will be an open-label, single
      arm study in two stages to evaluate the efficacy of the combination in pathologic downstaging
      of MIBC. Patients will receive four 21-day cycles of neoadjuvant therapy consisting of
      cisplatin and gemcitabine plus AGEN2034 in all 4 cycles and AGEN1884 in cycles 1 and 3.
      Patients will proceed to radical cystectomy within 10 weeks after the final dose of this
      therapy. The primary endpoint of pathologic tumor downstaging will be assessed at the time of
      cystectomy.

    <description>The safety run-in of the study will first enroll three patients at the chosen dose and schedule of the combination. These first 3 patients will be followed to completion of day 1 cycle 2 of neoadjuvant therapy in the final patient in this cohort prior to enrollment and assessed for DLTs.If there are no DLTs in the first 3 patients, we will proceed to further accrual to stage I of phase II. If there is 1 DLT in the initial 3 patients, we will enroll 3 additional patients to the safety run-in. If a second DLT is experienced, the study will be terminated. If there is only 1 DLT in the 6 patients treated, further accrual can proceed.</description>

          7. History of intolerance or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to AGEN1884 or AGEN2034.
