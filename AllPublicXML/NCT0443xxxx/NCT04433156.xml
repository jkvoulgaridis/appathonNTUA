  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to observe the
      efficacy and safety of VR-CAP (Velcade and Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and
      Prednisone) in the first-line treatment for patients with marginal zone lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a relatively common group of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
      The incidence rate is only inferior to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular
      lymphoma (FL). Currently, NCCN guidelines recommend same treatment plan of FL like R-CHOP as
      the primary treatment for MZL. However, due to the great difference in cell origin and
      biological characteristics between FL and MZL, some patients can not achieve complete
      remission or relapse quickly after standard first-line treatment. A number of phase II
      clinical studies have evaluated the good efficacy of rituximab combined with chemotherapy in
      the treatment of MZL. Previous studies have shown that NF-κB signaling pathway is in abnormal
      activation state in MZL. Velcade(Bortezomib), a proteasome inhibitor targeting NF-κB pathway,
      has a promising therapeutic prospect in relapsed and refractory MZL. The goal of our trial is
      to assess the efficacy and safety of VR-CAP (Velcade and Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide,
      Epirubicin and Prednisone) in the first-line treatment for patients with marginal zone
      lymphoma.
