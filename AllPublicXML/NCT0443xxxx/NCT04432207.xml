      The phase 1 study is an open label, multi-center, non-randomized, dose escalation and
      expansion study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      IMU-201(PD1-Vaxx) as monotherapy and in combination with Standard of Care (SOC) treatment in
      participants with PD-L1 expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigational Medicinal Product, IMU-201, consists of drug substance, APi2568, which is a
      B-cell epitope (amino acids 92-110 from PD-1) linked to a promiscuous T-cell epitope (amino
      acid residues 288-302 from measles virus fusion protein) via a 4-amino acid linker
      (Gly-Pro-Ser-Leu), and combined with Water for Injection (WFI) forms the drug product,
      IMU-201, which becomes PD1-Vaxx when emulsified with excipient Montanide ISA 720 VG.

      It is hypothesized that a polyclonal induced B-cell antibody response will be more effective
      or as effective with improved safety over current monoclonal antibody therapy.

      This phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx) as monotherapy and in combination with Standard of Care (SOC) treatment in
      participants with PD-L1 expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study consists of
      two parts. Part 1, monotherapy dose-escalation of IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx) to establish an optimal
      biological dose as monotherapy (Part 1a) followed by a combination dose escalation with
      standard of care treatment to establish a combination optimal biological dose of IMU-201
      (PD1-Vaxx)(Part 1b). Part 2 dose expansion, will further characterize the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of IMU-201 in combination with SOC treatment for NSCLC at
      the defined expansion dose-level from Part 1b.
