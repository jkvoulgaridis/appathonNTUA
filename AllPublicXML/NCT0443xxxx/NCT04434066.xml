      The purpose of the study is to investigate differences in perioperative and postoperative
      outcomes between the abdominal (AM) versus vaginal (VM) routes of contained morcellation in
      participants undergoing laparoscopic total hysterectomies in a randomized controlled trial.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate differences in intraoperative and
      postoperative outcomes between the abdominal (AM) versus vaginal (VM) routes of contained
      morcellation in subjects undergoing laparoscopic total hysterectomies in a randomized
      surgical trial.

      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate differences in total operating time between subjects undergoing AM compared
           to VM.

        2. To evaluate differences in morcellation time between AM and VM.

        3. To evaluate differences in the amount of total narcotic use during hospital admission
           between AM and VM through morphine milligram equivalents (MME).

        4. To evaluate differences in the patient's subjective pain assessment via Visual Analogue
           Scale (VAS) before surgery, at 2-weeks, and at 6 week post-operative visits in both AM
           and VM groups.

        5. To evaluate differences in the patient's pain medication usage as reported by the
           patient verbally at 24-hours post-operatively and 2-weeks post surgery between AM and VM
           groups.

        6. To evaluate differences in body image survey (BIS) scores at enrollment and 6-week
           postoperative visit between the AM group compared to VM group.

        7. To evaluate differences in overall Quality of Life (QoL) scores at enrollment and 6-week
           postoperative visit between the AM group compared to VM group.

        8. To evaluate differences in Quality of Recovery (QoR) scores at enrollment and at
           24-hours post-operatively, and then 2-weeks post surgery between AM and VM group.
