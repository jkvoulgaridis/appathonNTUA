        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF);

          -  New initiation of anticoagulation therapy (apixaban or warfarin) due to the ischemic
             event (stroke/TIA) meaning patients previously not anticoagulated due to diagnosis of
             NVAF;

          -  Indication to anticoagulation therapy as a secondary stroke prevention within 7 to 30
             days after the stroke/TIA event;

          -  Apixaban arm: genetically determined higher sensitivity to warfarin;

          -  Patients whose status allowed oral treatment with apixaban/warfarin;

          -  Age ≥ 18;

          -  Access to patient´s records of the first 6 months of the warfarin/apixaban treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of valvular disease;

          -  Treatment with other anticoagulants in previous 6 months due to other the NVAF
             indication;

          -  Treatment or prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism;
