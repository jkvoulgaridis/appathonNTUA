  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to examine the effects of aerobic exercise and
      balance-proprioception exercises on pain, functionality and strength parameters of
      fibromyalgia patients and to compare the two exercise types.

      In the study planned to evaluate the effect of aerobic and balance-proprioception exercises
      on the symptoms of the disease and the superiority of the two exercise models in patients
      with fibromyalgia syndrom (FMS), 62 women who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly
      divided into two groups. Aerobic exercise group (n = 26) and balance-proprioception exercise
      group (n = 26) will be applied for 3 weeks a week, 6 days a week under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist in the exercise laboratory of the Istanbul Medical Faculty Sports Medicine
      Department. Pain (VAS), functional status (FİQ) and knee extension muscle strength (Cybex
      isokinetic dynamometer) will be evaluated before and after the program. Cognitive status will
      be evaluated with standardized Mini Mental Test only before the program.

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the functional status in patients with FMS, FIQ Burchardt et al. It is a specific scale developed by. FIQ consists of 10 items. Calculation is made so that the upper limit of each item is 10 points. The maximum score that can be reached is 100. A high total score indicates that the person is more affected by the disease.</description>

    <measure>Pain (Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analaog Scale is used to measure the severity of pain in patients. The patient is told that there is no &quot;0&quot; pain on the 10 cm ruler drawn on paper, &quot;10&quot; is the most experienced pain, and the patient is asked to mark on the ruler according to the severity of the pain he/she feels. The distance of the marked point from zero is recorded as the Visual Analogue Scale score in cm.</description>
