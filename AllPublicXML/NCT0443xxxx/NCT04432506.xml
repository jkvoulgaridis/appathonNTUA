  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of anakinra and to see how well it
      works in reducing side effects (toxicity) associated with a CAR-T cell treatment called
      axicabtagene ciloleucel in patients with large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed)
      or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Anakinra is a drug typically used to treat
      rheumatoid arthritis but may also help in reducing CAR-T cell therapy toxicity. Giving
      anakinra in combination with axicabtagene ciloleucel may help control relapsed or refractory
      large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability of anakinra in reducing incidence of cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS) within 30 days after infusion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine incidence of all grades and duration of both CRS and immune-cell associated
      neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).

      II. To determine the complete response rate (CRR), overall response rate (ORR),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of anakinra on the cytokine and chemokine profile in peripheral
      blood after CAR-T therapy.

      II. To determine the effects of anakinra on the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells.

      III. To correlate baseline characteristics with toxicity, response and survival after
      anakinra combined with CAR-T therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of anakinra.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and fludarabine IV over
      30 minutes on days -5 to -3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then receive axicabtagene ciloleucel IV over 30 minutes or less on day 0 and
      anakinra subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-6 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 4 weeks, and then at
      2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
