  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a prospective French population based cohort. A hundred moderate preterms born
      at GA30-326/7 will be enrolled for a longitudinal follow-up up to 2 years of corrected age.
      Eligible neonates will be those born at 30-326/7 weeks of gestation admitted to the neonatal
      intensive care unit of Rennes Hospital, including transferred infants during the first day of
      life. The infants will be followed up to the corrected age of 2 years by pediatricians.

    <measure>to associate preterms microbial profiles and psychomotor outcomes at 2 years of corrected age using the 'Ages and Stages Questionnaire' ASQ survey</measure>

    <description>To associate preterms microbial profiles (bacteria and fungi; alpha- and beta-diversity, abundancies and complex interactions between neonatal microbiotas) and psychomotor outcomes at 2 years of corrected age using the 'Ages and Stages Questionnaire' survey. Each questionnaire includes 30 items covering five developmental domains: communication abilities, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving abilities, and personal-social skills. Items are scored on a three point scale depending on whether the child performs the task: yes (10 points), sometimes (5 points), or not yet (0 points). Responses are summed to give a score of 0 to 60 for each domain and an overall maximum ASQ score of 300 points. Analyses were based on domain specific scores, using established screening cut-off points: an ASQ score below threshold was defined as a score lower than 2 standard deviations from the mean on any of the five domains.</description>
