    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in order to determine the prevention effect of caries preventive
      regimen using herbal toothpaste and regimen using fluoride toothpaste versus fluoride
      toothpaste and fluoride varnish on the caries risk of patients with high caries risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is highly predominant worldwide. So, in addition to treating this caries,
      patients should be managed to avoid new caries. Preventive measures could be applied to the
      patients who are most expected to develop dental caries who are identified by caries risk
      assessment. Thus, effective caries risk assessment is essential to control new caries
      development.

      Dental caries can be prevented by conducting appropriate measures; therefore, it is crucial
      to identify those who are most likely to have dental caries by caries risk assessment and
      giving them the essential preventive measures. Though some caries preventive measures have
      showed success in descriptive clinical trials, there is little information on their
      practicality with high caries risk groups in everyday usage.

      Oral health is an essential part of general well being, people have used herbs in order to
      prevent dental diseases for centuries. In 2008 the Federal Council of Dentistry approved the
      use of medicinal plants for oral healthcare.

      Medicinal plants can heal bacterial diseases as it is full of antimicrobial agents. They are
      becoming more popular than chemicals due to the side effects of synthetic antibiotics and the
      antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.

      Studies propose that herbal extracts are highly effective against significant microorganism
      which cause dental caries like Streptococcus mutans. Herbal toothpaste decreases dental
      caries through combined effects of antibacterial agents, oral acid neutralisers and decreased
      plaque bacterial enzyme inhibitors present in the herbal toothpaste.
