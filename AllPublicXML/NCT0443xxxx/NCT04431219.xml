    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The AD cohort will be first recruited and will include 5 patients: 1 patient per dose, sequentially recruited, the recruitment of the next dose level patient will be assessed by Data Safety Monitoring Board :
Patient 1: 0.6 mg/Kg/day
Patient 2: 1 mg/Kg/day
Patient 3: 3 mg/Kg/day
Patient 4: 6 mg/Kg/day
Patient 5: 8 mg/Kg/day
Once the 5 AD patients complete LIS1 treatment, the sponsor and the DSMB will rule on the LIS1 dose to obtain an optimal CD3+ cells depletion, with a good safety profile and will determine the therapeutic dose.</description>

    <description>The TD cohort will be recruited once the therapeutic dose is defined. This cohort will be divided in 2 subgroups of respectively 2 and 3 patients sequentially recruited. The DSMB will evaluate the accuracy of the chosen therapeutic dose safety profile after the first two patients' treatment completion and will allow the recruitment of the 3 patients of the second subgroup at the same dose, or adapt LIS1 dose for the next three patients.</description>

    <intervention_name>LIS1</intervention_name>
    <description>LIS1 is an induction treatment on top of maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. All patients from AD and TD cohort will receive the conventional immunosuppressive regimen: tacrolimus (0.2 mg/kg) / mycophenolic acid (MMF, 2x1000 mg) / prednisone (20 mg from day 2). This conventional treatment should be started and monitored for all patients independently of their participation in the clinical trial. Methylprednisolone 500 mg / 100 mL saline / 30 minutes will be administered before reperfusion during the surgery and on post operation day 1 just before LIS1 administration.</description>
