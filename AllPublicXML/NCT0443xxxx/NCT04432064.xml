  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop a line of research using new non-invasive neurostimulation
      technology to treat adults with opioid use disorders (OUDs). In the short term, the
      investigators aim to identify novel target brain regions for neurostimulation treatment and
      characterize their effects behaviorally and neurally. In the longer term, investigators aim
      to use these preliminary data to justify NIH sponsored clinical trials to apply transcranial
      direct current stimulation and non-invasive deep brain stimulation to these areas to
      partially or completely disrupt addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that temporal interference non-invasive deep brain stimulation
      (TI-NDBS) will be well tolerated and effective at manipulating brain activity and reducing
      drug cravings. The investigators will investigate whether stimulation with a mild current
      from temporal interference non-invasive deep brain stimulation (TI-NDBS) to the Anterior
      Cingulate Cortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI), or the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) will reduce
      nicotine craving and seeking. The TI-NDBS is similar to the traditional transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS), a method approved for use in a number of other studies. Other
      studies have shown there have been some effects of reducing craving with tDCS, however, tDCS
      cannot stimulate structures such as the ACC very effectively because tDCS cannot stimulate
      deeper brain regions. Thus, the Specific Aim ultimately will compare TI-NDBS with tDCS and
      sham stimulation. The study is broken up into four phases. The first two will involve device
      feasibility and identifying the best locations for the electrodes to be placed. In the third
      phase, the investigators will compare TI-NDBS with sham stimulation. In the fourth phase, the
      investigators will compare TI-NDBS with sham stimulation and with tDCS.

    <time_frame>Within the first year of testing TI-NDBS in nicotine smokers.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators predict that TI-NDBS will outperform sham stimulation at an overall change in smoking and cigarette craving, which in turn will outperform sham stimulation. The investigators will sum the total inhaled nicotine vapor volume in liters over the 60 minute session and perform pairwise t-tests to determine if total drug intake is lower with TI-NDBS vs tDCS. Also, the investigators will average the self reported craving levels on a Likert scale across each subject during the 60 minute session, and the investigators will perform pairwise tests to determine if stimulation lowers self reported craving.</description>

    <description>In the active TI-NDBS condition, subjects will receive stimulation for 60 minutes applied to the brain through scalp electrodes. There will be a maximum of 2 mA per electrode pair and no single region will receive more than 2 mA because the currents will be administered to distinct regions. At the beginning of each stimulation period, the current will increase slowly at a constant rate for 30 seconds until it reaches the appropriate intensity. At the end of the stimulation, the current will decrease slowly for 30 seconds until it reaches zero.</description>
