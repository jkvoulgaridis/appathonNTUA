  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease in which skin cells build up and
      develop thick, red and white scaly patches on the skin. There is an unmet medical need for
      effective treatment in pediatric patients and this study is being done to evaluate
      risankizumab in pediatric participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This study
      will assess the change in disease symptoms.

      Risankizumab is a drug being studied for the treatment for plaque psoriasis in pediatric
      participants. This study has 4 parts.

      Part 1: Participants aged 12 &lt; 18 will receive a fixed dose of risankizumab.

      Part 2: Participants aged 12 &lt; 18 will receive;

        -  Period A: Risankizumab or ustekinumab based on body weight followed by;

        -  Period B: Risankizumab or no treatment.

        -  Period C: Re-treatment with risankizumab (if needed).

      Part 3 and Part 4: Participants aged 6 &lt; 12 will receive risankizumab based on body weight.

      Around 132 participants will be enrolled in approximately 30 sites worldwide.

      Risankizumab and ustekinumab are given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.

      Parts 1, 3, and 4: Risankizumab for 40 weeks with a follow-up call 20 weeks later for a study
      duration of approximately 65 weeks.

      Part 2:

        -  Period A: Risankizumab or ustekinumab for 16 weeks.

        -  Period B: Risankizumab or no treatment for 36 weeks.

        -  Period C: Re-treatment with risankizumab for 16 weeks. Follow-up call 20 weeks later for
           a study duration of approximately 81 weeks. Participants from each Part who meet
           eligibility criteria for an open-label extension (OLE) study may continue on
           risankizumab for 52 additional weeks.

      There may be a higher burden for study participants compared to standard treatment.
      Participants will attend monthly visits and medical assessments will check the effect of
      treatment through blood tests, questionnaires, and checking for side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months before the Baseline Visit.

          -  Stable severe or moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as defined in each study part by
             body surface area (BSA) psoriasis involvement and scores on the PASI and sPGA.

          -  Candidate for systemic therapy as assessed by the investigator and meet the disease
             activity criteria at both the Screening and Baseline Visits per the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent clinically significant medical conditions other than the indication being
             studied or any other reason that the investigator determines would interfere with the
             participant's participation in this study, would make the participant an unsuitable
             candidate to receive study drug, or would put the participant at risk by participating
             in the study.
