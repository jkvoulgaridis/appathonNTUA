  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has no evidence for the anticoagulation in patients who had undergone catheter ablation
      of atrial fibrillation, and has maintained sinus rhythm for more than 1 year. However,
      anticoagulation can increase the risk of bleeding, the study evaluating the role of oral
      anticoagulation is needed in this patients. This study will compare the efficacy and safety
      of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in patient with sinus
      rhythm one year after catheter ablation of AF.

      This study is a prospective randomized study which was performed in multicenter (General
      Hospital) in Korea. Inclusion criteria is atrial fibrillation patients with moderate or high
      stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc&gt;=1 male, and &gt;=2 female) who had undergone catheter ablation of
      atrial fibrillation, and has maintained sinus rhythm for more than 1 year. Anticoagulation
      (Apixaban group) will take apixaban (5 mg bid or 2.5 mg bid according to dose guideline) for
      2 years, and nonanticoagulation group will not take any oral anticoagulants for the same
      period. If the patients have the recurrence of AF, they will take anticoagulation according
      to standard treatment, and will be censored. We will analyze and compare the efficacy and
      safety of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in these
      patients.
