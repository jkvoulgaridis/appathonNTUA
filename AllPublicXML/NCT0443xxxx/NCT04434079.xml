  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive fluid status has been consistently associated with worse prognosis in critically ill
      adult patients.However, observational studies showed poor agreement between fluid balance and
      body weight changes. The objective of the study is to compare the measurements of FB and BW
      over time and to assess correlation with ICU mortality.

    <textblock>
      Positive fluid status has been consistently associated with worse prognosis in critically ill
      adult patients. Daily and cumulative fluid balance (FB) is a routine nursing activity in
      intensive care unit (ICU). In view of the potential for errors in the calculation of FB
      totals and the problem of accounting for insensible fluid losses, measurement of body weight
      (BW) changes is an alternative non-invasive method commonly used for estimating body fluid
      status. Its accuracy over FB assumes a one kilogram change in BW equates to a one liter gain
      or loss in body fluid volume. However, observational studies showed poor agreement between
      those measurements, particularly among individuals staying more than a week in ICU possibly
      due to muscle and fat loss as well as bone demineralization. The objective of the study is to
      compare the measurements of FB and BW over time and to assess correlation with ICU mortality.
