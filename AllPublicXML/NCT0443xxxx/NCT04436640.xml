      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      bimekizumab in patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA, also known as
      radiographic axSpa (r-axSpA)) including ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial
      spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpa).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Metrology Index (BASMI) characterizes the spinal mobility of subjects with axial Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). It is a disease-specific measure consisting of 5 clinical measures to reflect subject axial status: cervical rotation; tragus to wall distance; lateral lumbar flexion; lumbar flexion (modified Schober test); intermalleolar distance. According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their axial SpA. A negative value in BASMI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline of AS0010 (NCT03928704) or AS0011 (NCT03928743) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Metrology Index (BASMI) characterizes the spinal mobility of subjects with axial Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). It is a disease-specific measure consisting of 5 clinical measures to reflect subject axial status: cervical rotation; tragus to wall distance; lateral lumbar flexion; lumbar flexion (modified Schober test); intermalleolar distance. According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their axial SpA. A negative value in BASMI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis (MASES) Index at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline of AS0010 (NCT03928704) or AS0011 (NCT03928743) to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis (MASES) is an index that measures the severity (ie, intensity and extent) of enthesitis through the assessment of 13 entheses (bilateral costochondral 1, costochondral 7, anterior superior iliac spine, posterior iliac spine, iliac crest and proximal insertion of the Achilles tendon sites, and the fifth lumbar vertebral body spinous process) each scored as 0 or 1 and then summed for a possible score of 0 to 13. A higher score indicates worsening.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
