    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a comfortable system that uses a wearable eye-tracker
      similar to eyeglasses to assist people with epilepsy in counting and measuring the severity
      of seizures. Participants will wear an eye-tracker during a routine EEG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seizures can be difficult to detect outside of the hospital even with careful observation by
      a caregiver. EEG is the best method that we have to detect seizures- but it is uncomfortable
      for long term use outside of the hospital. The goal of this study is to develop a comfortable
      system that uses a wearable eye-tracker similar to eyeglasses to assist people with epilepsy
      in counting and measuring the severity of seizures. People participating in this study will
      have a routine EEG performed while an eye tracker measures eye movements. After the EEG is
      complete the researchers will compare the eye movements to the EEG to develop a software
      program that can detect seizures from eye movements.

    <description>EEG is burdensome and limited. The current accepted method of counting seizures is observation which fails to identify &gt; 50% of seizures. The goal is to validate the Eysz absence seizure detection algorithm and show significant improvement over current standard of care</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form- per local IRB

          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures including the clicker test and
             availability for the duration of the study

          3. Male or female, aged 4-100

          4. Experience known typical absence seizures as defined by the ILAE 2017 classification
             or referred to EEG lab for staring spell or concern for absence seizure

             a. This will allow for inclusion of children and adults across the entire spectrum of
             disease states including new diagnosis (medication naive), medication responsive and
             non-medication responsive

          5. Scheduled for clinical EEG observation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intolerant of wearing or unable to wear the eyeglasses

          2. Autism or other developmental disorder that the PI thinks will interfere with data
             collection

          3. History of aggression that the PI thinks will interfere with data collection

          4. History of not tolerating EEG that the PI thinks will interfere with data collection

          5. Unable to give consent (for individuals ≥ 18 years old) unless they have an adult with
             power of attorney to consent
