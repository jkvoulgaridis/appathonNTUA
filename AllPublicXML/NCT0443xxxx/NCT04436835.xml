      This trial studies whether a form of psychotherapy called accelerated resolution therapy can
      help with cancer distress and psychological trauma. Accelerated resolution therapy is an
      evidence-based therapy for the treatment of depressive symptoms, trauma, and stress-related
      disorders. This study may provide evidence to support integration of accelerated resolution
      therapy into psychological treatment of cancer patients, which may decrease cancer related
      trauma and distress.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Calculate changes, and estimate mean changes, in primary outcomes of psychological trauma
      and cancer distress over a six week time period while receiving weekly accelerated resolution
      therapy (ART).

      II. Calculate changes, and estimate mean changes, in secondary outcomes of anxiety and
      depression over a six week period while receiving weekly ART.

      III. We will use a qualitative, descriptive design to explore contextual elements of the
      cancer experience that are consistently distressing and/or psychologically traumatic to more
      fully inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing in ART in cancer distress and
      psychological trauma.

      IV. Calculate changes, and estimate mean changes, in secondary outcomes of resilience and
      symptom distress over a six week period while receiving weekly ART.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ART over 60-90 minutes once a week for up to 5 sessions.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 1 week and again at 1
      month.

    <description>Symptoms of psychological trauma will be measured with both the Primary Care-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Screening (PC-PTSD-5) and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5). The PCL-5 (PTSD Patient Checklist) is a 20-item self-report instrument that will be used to assess the DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD (psychological trauma). The total symptom severity score ranges from 0 to 80.</description>

    <measure>Cancer distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cancer distress will be measured with the Cancer Treatment Distress Scale (CTxD). The CTxD is a 22 item Likert type scale that contains 6 subscales: uncertainty, health burden, identity, medical demands, finances, and family strain. Scores on individual items range from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) distress related to an aspect of the cancer experience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) is a measure of anxiety scored from 0 (not at all)-3 (nearly every day) scale for each item with total scores ranging from 0-21. A score of 10 or more indicates high anxiety, although a cut-score of 7 or higher has been suggested for cancer populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an 8 item measure of depression scoring DSM -IV criteria for depression on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale for each item with total scores ranging from 0-24 (25). A score of 10 or more indicates depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) is a 10 item scale in which participants rate statements on a scale of 0 (not at all true) to 4 (true nearly all the time). Higher scores indicate higher levels of resilience.</description>

    <measure>Symptom distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) consists of 11-point numerical rating scales for self-report of ten common symptoms of cancer. A summary score is calculated with higher scores representing greater symptom distress.</description>
