  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the continued usage of standard diabetes medications
      in the post operative period following bariatric surgery to determine whether this approach
      may improve long term diabetes control. At present, the standard of treatment in patients
      with type 2 diabetes is that all medication is stopped in the immediate postoperative period
      and only re-started if symptoms of diabetes re-emerge. Although a large proportion of
      patients with diabetes will initially go in to remission, 80% experience relapse within five
      years. This study is needed to determine whether continuing medications is not only safe but
      will improve long term outcomes for patients with diabetes.
