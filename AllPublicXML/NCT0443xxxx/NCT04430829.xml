  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will compare the clinical value of weight-bearing CT arthrography
      (WBCTa) with that for MRI in evaluating meniscal and cartilage lesions of the knee joint. The
      MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) and modified MOAKS for WBCTa will be used to compare
      findings between MRI and WBCTa of the knee.

      The study hypothesis is that meniscal and cartilage lesions may be missed by
      non-weight-bearing MRI, but detected by WBCTa.

      Study Objectives: The goal of this study is to assess the clinical value and inter-rater
      reliability of WBCTa in evaluating meniscal and cartilage lesions and compare with detection
      of these lesions on contemporaneous MRI.

      Study Type and Design: This cross-sectional, observational study will compare WBCTa with MRI
      to evaluate rate of detection of meniscal and cartilage lesions. The inter-rater reliability
      of WBCTa readings also will be assessed.

    <description>Musculoskeletal radiologists, each with greater than 10 years of experience, will assess the morphology of the menisci using the MRI Osteoarthritis of the Knee Score (MOAKS) scoring system. Meniscal damage will be scored using the original MOAKS description including radial tear, horizontal (oblique) tear, vertical tear, complex tear or displaced tear (e.g. bucket handle), partial maceration (i.e. substance loss or prior surgical partial resection), complete maceration (missing meniscal subregion either due to surgery or degeneration). This scoring system will also be used to interpret the WBCTa images. The scores will be compared by dichotomizing into lesion present/absent (primary) and also compared using the full ranges of ordinal scores.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Musculoskeletal radiologists, each with greater than 10 years of experience will assess the morphology of the medial and lateral tibiofemoral cartilage on MRI and WBCTa using the MOAKS scoring system. Area of cartilage damage per subregion will be graded according to the MOAKS classification from 0-3: 0= no cartilage damage, 1=cartilage damage involving &lt;10% of the subregion area, 2= cartilage damage involving 10%-75% of the subregion area and 3=cartilage damage involving &gt;75% of the subregion area. The scores will be compared by dichotomizing into lesion present/absent (primary) and also compared using the full ranges of ordinal scores.</description>

    <description>A 20ml mixture of 5ml 0.5% ropivacaine, 5ml preservative-free sterile saline, and 10ml of non-ionic iodinated contrast media (e.g. iohexol 240) will be instilled into the knee joint of each patient prior to WBCTa imaging of the knee (LineUp, CurveBeam, LLC).</description>

        Enrollment will be comprised of subjects, age 18 and over who, within the past 10 days,
        have undergone clinical MRI of the knee to evaluate for suspected meniscal or cartilage
        pathology, including for ligamentous injury with suspected concomitant meniscal or
        cartilage pathology. There will be no exclusions based on sex or ethnic group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female over 18 years of age with a knee MRI acquired in the previous 10 days
             to evaluate for suspected meniscal or cartilage pathology.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) â‰¤ 45 kg/m2

          -  Ability to stand with support without moving for at least 2 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  End stage kidney disease

          -  Allergic to iodinated contrast material.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Skin breakdown or rash at the knee joint which would prevent injection of the
             contrast.

          -  Any clinically significant degree of cognitive impairment or other condition, finding,
             or psychiatric illness at screening which, in the opinion of the investigator, affects
             their ability to ambulate to a sufficient degree and could compromise patient safety
             or interfere with the assessment of the safety of the study injection.
