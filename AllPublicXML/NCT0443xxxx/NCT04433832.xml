  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to establish how frequently patients with coronary artery
      disease present or develop two anxiety disorders (panic disorder and generalized anxiety
      disorder) in the two years following a medical intervention for their heart. A second
      objective is to assess the impact of these anxiety disorders on the health of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common form of cardiovascular disease, affects
      approximately 1 in 12 adults in Canada. CAD is a major public health concern and is one of
      the costliest chronic diseases in North America. Up to 90% of the CAD risk is attributable to
      nine modifiable risk factors, including psychosocial factors. Decades of research confirmed
      the importance of psychosocial factors in the development, prognosis and clinical
      presentation of CAD. One understudied but highly significant psychosocial risk factor is
      anxiety. Prevalence estimates of anxiety disorders in patients with CAD range from 10% to
      65%, with panic disorder (PD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) being the most
      prevalent. Both PD and GAD have been independently associated with a 36% to 94% increase in
      the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients with CAD. However, these findings remain
      controversial as some studies reported either an inverse or no association between PD and
      adverse events. Still, both PD and GAD are associated with the presence of multiple risk
      factors for CAD (e.g. smoking, high alcohol consumption and a sedentary lifestyle). These
      anxiety disorders are also likely to influence medication taking behaviors as well as
      adherence to cardiac rehabilitation programs. These data highlight the importance and
      prognostic significance of PD/GAD in patients with CAD. However, considering the
      contradictory data and significant methodological issues in the available studies, notably in
      terms of the validity of PD and GAD diagnoses, new, methodologically sound studies are needed
      to improve our understanding of this clinical problem and improve patient care.

      The primary aim of this study is to establish the prevalence and incidence of PD and GAD in
      the two years following a revascularization procedure for CAD. The secondary aim is to
      prospectively assess the association between these disorders and cardiac mortality, adverse
      cardiac events, adherence to recommended treatments (exercise, cardiac rehabilitation,
      pharmacotherapy),quality of life and psychological distress.

      This prospective cohort study will include 3610 patients who will be consecutively recruited
      following a revascularisation procedure for CAD at the cardiology department of the Quebec
      Heart and Lung Institute. Patients will be assessed at baseline (within a week of admission)
      as well as 3, 6, 12 and 24 months later. PD and GAD will be assessed with a standardized and
      validated semi-structured interview. The presence of adverse events, adherence to treatments,
      psychological distress and quality of life will be assessed through a review of medical
      records, questionnaires and interviews.

    <measure>Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Panic disorder (PD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) will be assessed at each time point using the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5). This standardized interview protocol is one of the recommended measures for diagnosing anxiety disorders, including PD and GAD, in the research context. The PD and GAD modules of previous versions of the ADIS have demonstrated excellent reliability for their respective diagnoses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse cardiac events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked about all potential adverse events during a structured medical interview developed by our team. All data will be confirmed by a review of medical records. With written permission from patients or next of kin (if deceased), records for admissions or consultations outside of the study hospitals will be obtained from the establishment archives. Medical data will be extracted by the research nurses using a standardized medical data extraction form known for its excellent reliability.
Adverse events are defined as: either an acute myocardial infarction, a revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass grafting), a cardiac arrest (including ventricular fibrillation) or death from a cardiovascular cause (primary cause).</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Measures of Patient Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-item general measure which assesses the patients' tendency to comply with medical recommendations and a second section which measures adherence to recommendations made by a healthcare professional (e.g., taking medication, following a diet) in the context of CAD. Total scores range from 0 to 25, higher scores indicate higher reported medication adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence Scale in Chronic Diseases</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This measure specifically assesses medication adherence and some of its potential barriers in patients with CAD or other chronic diseases. Total scores range from 0 to 32, higher scores indicate higher reported medication adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Cardiac rehabilitation participation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked if they participated in a formal rehabilitation program at each time point with two validated interview items. Attendance will be assessed by reviewing records of the 12-week cardiac rehabilitation programs. With written permission from patients or next of kin, records of attendance to programs outside of the study hospitals will be obtained from archives departments. Participation will be categorized as follows:
Non-attendance: patients who did not attend a cardiac rehabilitation program.
Level of adherence: calculated with the percentage of the prescribed sessions attended during the program.
Completion: patients who attended at least 70% of the planned sessions.
Discontinuation: patients who stopped attending cardiac rehabilitation at least 3 weeks before the end of the program.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health behaviors - Smoking status</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking status: This variable will be assessed using the validated self-report items developed by Statistics Canada to assess the current smoking status. Smoking status will be established based on the patients' self-reported smoking behaviour in the 30 days preceding each time point. Participants can be categorized as Non-Smokers, Occasional-Smokers or Regular Smokers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health behaviors - Alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol use: The patients' compliance with recommendations regarding alcohol consumption will be assessed with the first 3 items of the validated French version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Total scores range from 0 to 12, higher scores indicate higher alcohol use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health behaviors - Fruit and vegetable intake</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fruit and vegetable intake: Patients' usual consumption of fruit and vegetables will be assessed using the 6-item Fruit and Vegetable Questionnaire (FV-Q) validated questionnaire. This questionnaire generates a mean daily consumption of fruits and vegetables. A higher mean represents more servings consumed for each specific category.</description>
