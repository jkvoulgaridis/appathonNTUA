      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the prevalence of Gaucher disease and of other etiologies, in patients of 15
      years old or more presenting with unexplained splenomegaly after exclusion of first
      intention-diagnoses (e.g. portal hypertension, diagnosis or suspicion of haematological
      malignancy, haemolytic anemia) based on basic physical and biological exams (e.g. full blood
      count, liver enzymes, reticulocytes)

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe the exams and tests conducted for diagnosis purpose and the more frequent
      associations

        Participants of 15 years old or more presenting with unexplained splenomegaly after

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Participants referred for the first time for splenomegaly exploration defined as :

               -  Either a palpable mass on left upper abdominal quadrant, further confirmed by a ≥
                  13 cm craniocaudal length on abdominal Imaging

               -  Or a non palpable splenomegaly discovered on abdominal imaging and with a
                  craniocaudal length ≥ 13 cm

          -  Participants with splenomegaly (as defined above) of unknown origin

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants with obvious diagnostics based on clinical exam, patient's interview and
             the previous initial routine biological tests :

               -  Diagnosis of portal hypertension

               -  Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia

               -  Diagnosis of hematological malignancy

               -  Known diagnosis of Gaucher Disease
