      In the current study, the investigators will examine the extent of subclinical epileptic
      activity in patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Lewy body dementia as
      compared to healthy elderly controls. The participants will wear a new device called
      &quot;ear-EEG&quot;, which makes it possible to record EEG for longer periods of time while at home.
      Furthermore, the investigators want to investigate whether there is an association between
      subclinical epileptic activity and the cerebral blood flow as measured with functional MRI.

      A total of 13 mL of blood will be collected from each participant. Afterwards, the blood will
      be centrifuged and the serum, plasma and the white blood cells will be extracted. These
      samples will be stored in the Danish Dementia Biobank.

        In the first part of the study (feasibility), the investigators will include 10 patients
        with Alzheimer's disease from the memory clinics at Rigshospitalet and Zealand University
        Hospital - Roskilde. In the main study, the investigators will include an additional 40
        patients with Alzheimer's disease, 20 patients with Lewy body dementia, and 50 healthy
        controls.
