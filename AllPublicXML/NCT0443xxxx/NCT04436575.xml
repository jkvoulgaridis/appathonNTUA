  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding are a common chief complaint among Emergency Department.
      The mortality rate for Lower GI Bleeding is 3.9%. While the mortality rate can be as high as
      10% for Upper GI Bleeding. Most existing scores take into account hemodynamic parameters such
      as systolic blood pressure or heart rate. Studies have shown that hemodynamic instability
      only develops late in the course of a bleed, as evidenced by a blood depletion of 30 to 40%
      of the total blood volume. Currently, few studies have examined the value of echocardiography
      in the management of patients presenting for Acute GI Bleeding in the Emergency Department.
      The main objective of this study is to show whether simple ultrasound parameters can,
      combined with clinico biological parameters, predict in an early manner the evolution of the
      patient presenting to the Emergency Department for Acute Gastrointestinal Bleeding.

    <description>The primary outcome was to determine the correlation of echocardiography parameters to detect adverse events (AEs). Echocardiography parameters included signs of severe hypovolemia (end systolic left ventricular obliteration and/or complete inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava and/or E velocity &lt; 0.7 m/s). Adverse events were defined as blood transfusion, therapeutic intervention to control haemorrhage (endoscopic, radiologic or surgical hemostasis), rebleeding and in-hospital mortality.</description>

    <measure>Echocardiography and clinical scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation of echocardiographic signs of severe hypovolemia (end systolic left ventricular obliteration and/or complete inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava and/or E velocity &lt; 0.7 m/s) with existing clinical scores (Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score and Rockall score).
The Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score includes measurements of hemoglobin in grams per deciliter, blood urea nitrogen in millimoles per liter, initial systolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury, sex, heart rate in beats per minute, melena present, recent syncope, hepatic disease history and cardiac failure present.
The Rockall score includes measurement of age, shock present, comorbidities, diagnosis and major stigmata of recent hemorrhage.</description>

    <description>The correlation of other echocardiography parameters (visual assess of the ejection fraction (in percentage) and E/A ratio (represents the ratio of peak velocity blood flow from left ventricular relaxation in early diastole = the E velocity in meter per second, to peak velocity flow in late diastole caused by atrial contraction = the A velocity in meter per second) and E' velocity (in centimeter per seconds) and ratio E/E' (ratio between early mitral inflow velocity = the E velocity in centimeter per second and mitral annular early diastolic velocity = the E' velocity in centimeter per second) and subaortic velocity time index (VTI in centimeter) with the occurrence of adverse events.</description>
