      This study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a treatment
      program for anxiety in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is highly prevalent in individuals with ASD with lifelong impact. In this population,
      anxiety often emerges when children are very young, yet there are no evidence-based
      treatments for this age group. Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) successfully reduces
      anxiety levels in young, typically developing children and older children with ASD. This
      study pilots the DINO Strategies for Anxiety and fear of Uncertainty Reduction (DINOSAUR)
      program, which is an integrated treatment program that utilizes CBT modified for young
      children with ASD. The treatment includes heavy doses of parent training to reduce
      accommodation of the child's anxiety symptoms and interventions targeting fear of
      uncertainty, a common fear in children with ASD. The feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of this treatment program will be studied.
