  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase I study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics and anti-tumor activity of PARP
      inhibitor IMP4297 and temozolomide combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors
      and with ES-SCLC who develops disease progression after 1L platinum-based regimen.

      This study will be conducted in two parts. Part I of the study will be dose escalation
      evaluation to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of IMP4297 in combination with temozolomide. Part
      II of the study will be conducted in two RP2D expansion cohorts (sensitive ES-SCLC cohort and
      resistant ES-SCLC cohort) to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety and
      tolerability of this regimen in ES-SCLC patients.

                  standard treatment exists.

               2. In Part II: The patients must be histologically or cytologically confirmed
                  ES-SCLC with disease progression after the 1L standard platinum-based therapy.

          4. Patients have adequate organ function, as indicated by the following laboratory values
             (had not received blood transfusion, apheresis infusion, erythropoietin, granulocyte
             colony-stimulating factor, and other relevant medical support within 28 days before
             the administration of the IPs).

          5. Female patients should meet at least 1 of the following criteria before they can
