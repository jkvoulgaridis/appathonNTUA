    <textblock>
      This study will compare the pharmacokinetics of the component drugs in JULUCA, and HIV
      combination treatment pill, in HIV-negative patients who require hemodialysis with those with
      normal renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir and rilpivirine, the components of JULUCA, in patients
      with end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis have not previously been adequately
      studied. It is possible that the PK of these drugs are affected by renal failure which may
      then compromise effectiveness and safety. This trial will rigorously assess the plasma PK and
      protein-binding of these two drugs in 10 HIV-negative patients requiring hemodialysis with 10
      matched persons with normal renal function. All participants will receive JULUCA for up to 14
      days and then undergo a 24 hour intensive PK evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Negative HIV antibody testing at screening.

          2. For the ESRD requiring HD study group: ESRD requiring chronic hemodialysis at an
             established center (not home dialysis).

             NOTE: The approximate date that hemodialysis was initiated should be reported, if
             known.

             For the normal renal function group: Estimated CrCl (using the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation) at screening &gt;90mL/min.

          3. Availability of alternative venous access (not used for dialysis) for the purpose of
             PK sampling.

          4. The following laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry (obtained
             either at screening or done as part of routine clinical care):
