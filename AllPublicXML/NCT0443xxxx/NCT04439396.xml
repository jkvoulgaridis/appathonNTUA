  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether perioperative single-dose administration
      of ketorolac (Toradol) can reduce post-operative pain after breast surgery, thereby
      decreasing post-operative opioid use.

      We will perform a randomized trial of perioperative ketorolac (Toradol) on breast reduction
      and breast reconstruction procedures. Patients will be randomized into three groups: control
      (saline), low dose(15mg) or high dose (30mg). Patients will be asked to complete a diary or
      log of their average pain and pain medication use to be turned in at a 2 week follow up
      visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a double blinded, prospective randomized trial of perioperative ketorolac
      (Toradol) on breast reduction and breast reconstruction procedures. Patients will be
      randomized into three groups: group 1 will receive a perioperative dose of ketorolac
      (Toradol, 15mg), group 2 will receive ketorolac (Toradol, 30mg), and group 3 will be the
      control and receive a placebo of saline.

      The patients, surgeons, anesthesiologist will not know whether the patient received ketorolac
      (Toradol) intraoperatively. Patients' pain will be assessed using pain scores in the
      immediate post-operative period, on post-operative day 1, and at their two-week follow up
      appointment. If patients leave the same day then they will only have two pain score
      assessments; on day of surgery and at their two-week follow up. Additionally, patients will
      be asked to assess their average pain (scale of 1-10) in morning and evenings using a patient
      diary for the two week post-op period. The patient's opioid use will be measured by their
      opioid use during their hospital stay, as well as how many prescription narcotic pills the
      patient used to manage their pain at home, as documented using the patient diary.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of post-operative pain: Likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week post operation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by using a Likert scale for pain in the post-operative period before they are discharged. If patients are kept overnight then another pain assessment will be done. Additionally, patients will keep a 2-week diary of average pain in the morning and evening each day until their 2 week follow up visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of narcotic use</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post operation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by calculating the MME in the post-operative period. This will include narcotics given while in the hospital and narcotics prescribed and used at home in the patient diary. Perioperative narcotic use will also be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complication assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks to 90 days post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Assess complications including, but not limited to, hematomas, GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn), and headaches. This will be assessed by tracking any readmissions for hematoma evacuation or other complications reported at their post-op follow up visit.</description>
