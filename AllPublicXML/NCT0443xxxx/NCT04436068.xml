    <textblock>
      Participants with known or suspected hydrocephalus will receive brain scans using the
      Hyperfine, low field strength, portable, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system in addition
      to their scheduled outpatient standard of care clinical computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan.
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using the
      Hyperfine system in an outpatient setting and to compare its diagnostic performance to
      standard clinical imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) causes the fluid-filled spaces of the brain, the ventricles, to become enlarged.
      Enlarged ventricles and increased intracranial pressure can cause headaches, dizziness,
      blurred vision, cognitive impairment, gait disturbances and in severe cases even brain
      herniation or death. A tube or shunt can be inserted into the ventricles to drain the CSF
      either outside the body temporarily or into the abdominal cavity for long-term treatment.
      Sometimes such shunts need to be adjusted or replaced if fluid re-accumulates. Medical
      imaging scans, either computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used
      to diagnose hydrocephalus in adults and children.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the performance of a newly developed, portable,
      low-cost MRI machine (Hyperfine MRI) in diagnosing and following patients with hydrocephalus
      in comparison to routine clinical CT or MRI. Outpatients with known or suspected
      hydrocephalus with or without ventricular shunts will be recruited to undergo Hyperfine MRI
      in conjunction with their routine clinical imaging. We will evaluate both the feasibility and
      acceptability of using the Hyperfine unit in the outpatient setting as well as the
      performance of Hyperfine MRI images in identifying hydrocephalus and other key brain imaging
      features relative to routine CT and MRI.
