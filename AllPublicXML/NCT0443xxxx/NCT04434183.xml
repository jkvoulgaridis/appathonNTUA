    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects of home exercise program and
      isokinetic exercise program on pain, muscle strength, functionality, proprioception sensation
      and quality of life in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.

    <textblock>
      The study was designed prospectively. A total of 50 patients with subacromial impingement
      syndrome according to clinical and MRI findings with shoulder pain for at least 3 months were
      included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group
      (isokinetic exercise group, n = 25) was given isokinetic exercise. The second group(home
      exercise group, n=25) was given home exercise program. Patients were evaluated before and
      after treatment and 3 months after the end of treatment. In the evaluation, VAS, Shoulder
      Pain and Disability Index, Constant Murley Scoring, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire, Health
      Assessment Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Humic Norm II isokinetic device
      were used. At statistically evaluation of data Student T Test and Mann Whitney U tests were
      used. In qualitative datas comparison Ki-Kare Test was used. Significance was evaluated at
      the level of p&amp;lt; 0.05.

    <measure>Assessment of sense of proprioseption</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators evaluated it with isokinetic cybex dynamometer. The isokinetic cybex dynamometer assessments using angle degree for sense of position.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of shoulder pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators evaluated to pre-treatment, intermediate post-treatment, and late post-treatment for shoulder pain. The investigators used to visual analog score for pain that scored from zero to ten.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of shoulder disability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators evaluated to pre-treatment, intermediate post-treatment, and late post-treatment for shoulder disability. The investigators used to shoulder disability questionnare consisting of 16 questions that scored yes or no. Calculation; score = [Yes counts / (Yes counts + No counts)]x100. The score seems, zero point is maximal fine health and 100 points (maximal point) is poor health.</description>

    <description>The investigators evaluated to pre-treatment, intermediate post-treatment, and late post-treatment for physical health situation. The investigators used to health evaluated inventory. The inventroy consisting of 20 questions that scored from zero to three per question. Zero point is maximal fine health and 60 points are maximal poor health.</description>
