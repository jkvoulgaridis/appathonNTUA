  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effect of programs aimed at helping
      people manage chronic pain and medication treatment. The program sessions focus on
      educational information and strategies for pain and medication management. The researchers
      enroll people who have chronic pain and have recently begun buprenorphine treatment to see if
      participants could benefit from these programs. This research study will help the researchers
      learn how to improve current therapies for pain and medication management.

    <measure>Retention on buprenorphine treatment according to TimeLine Follow-Back</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Retention on buprenorphine treatment will be operationalized as time to first episode of buprenorphine treatment non-adherence. Non-adherence, or discontinuation of treatment, will be defined as a consecutive period of 7 or more calendar days without taking buprenorphine. Buprenorphine retention data will be collected as part of the TimeLine Follow-Back (TLFB) assessment, which will be administered at the baseline enrollment assessment and the 1- and 3-month follow-ups in which the participant will be asked to recall on which days they took their buprenorphine medications.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12-months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Retention on buprenorphine treatment will be operationalized as time to first episode of buprenorphine treatment non-adherence. Non-adherence, or discontinuation of treatment, will be defined as a consecutive period of 7 or more calendar days without taking buprenorphine. Buprenorphine retention data will be collected as part of the TimeLine Follow-Back (TLFB) assessment, which will be administered at the baseline enrollment assessment and the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups in which the participant will be asked to recall on which days they took their buprenorphine medications.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported level of pain intensity on the Numerical Rating Scale for Pain Intensity (NRS-I).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain level will be measured using the Numerical Rating Scale for Pain Intensity (NRS-I), an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable), which will be collected at the baseline enrollment assessment and the 1- and 3--month follow-ups. For each follow-up time point, we will subtract the baseline value to obtain a change score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported level of pain related functioning on the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related functioning will be measured using the pain interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI). For this study, an increase in pain-related functioning will be operationalized as a reduction in the pain interference scale scores over time. The BPI interference subscale measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities and will provide a current level of pain-related functioning (past 24-hours) at each follow-up (1- and 3-months). BPI pain interference will be calculated as the mean of the seven interference items. For each follow-up time point, we will subtract the baseline value to obtain a change score.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported level of pain related functioning on the Pain Interference measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related functioning will be measured using the Pain Interference measure, which encompasses questions from Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Health Systems item bank v1.1. For this study, an increase in pain-related functioning will be operationalized as a reduction in the pain interference scale scores over time. The PROMIS Pain Interference item banks assess pain functioning over the past 7 days at each follow-up (1- and 3-months) and assesses consequences of pain on variables including the extent to which pain interferes with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. This measure will be scored using an Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring metric. For each follow-up time point, we will subtract the baseline value to obtain a change score.</description>

    <measure>Percent days abstinent from substance use on the TimeLine Follow-Back</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of substance use will be measured using the TimeLine Follow-Back and will be collected at the baseline assessment and the 1- and 3-month follow-ups. During the administration, the participant will be asked to recall their alcohol and drug use utilizing a calendar-assisted structured interview that provides the participant with temporal cues to increase the accuracy of recall. At the baseline assessment, retrospective data will be collected for the 6-months prior to study enrollment. At each follow-up, data will be collected for the entire period since the previous date of data collection. Percent days abstinent from substances (e.g. alcohol and drugs) will be used as the primary measure of substance use.</description>
