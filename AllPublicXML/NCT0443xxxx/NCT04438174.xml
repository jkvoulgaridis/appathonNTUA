      A prospective randomized controlled study to determine the safety and feasibility of using
      processed amniotic fluid (pAF) to expedite healing in chronic wounds.

      The goal of our study is to assess, in an outpatient setting, the safety and the time to
      wound closure in chronic wounds treated with processed amniotic fluid (pAF). We will include
      patients with lower extremity full thickness wounds that are greater than 3 months old and
      less than 12 months old. These wounds must have been unresponsive to other therapies, such as
      debridement, novel topical dressings, moist dressing, off-loading, and edema control, and the
      wound size must be greater than 5cm2 and less than 75 cm2. We will exclude anyone that has a
      thermal-related injury (burn or frostbite, etc.) or wounds over joints, requires skin
      grafting, or wounds with sinus tracts. Our primary objectives are to determine the safety and
      feasibility of using pAF to treat patients with chronic wounds by determining a reduction in
      wound size after application of pAF compared to standard of care.

    <description>Primary dressings are variable and based on the moisture content and microorganism load. In general, wounds respond differently to various topical treatments. Through our clinical practice, we have found that wounds plateau with the same topical for greater than 4 weeks, hence changing antimicrobial topical helps to manage the bacterial overgrowth. We will start with our application of our slurry, a 1:1:1 ratio of Nystatin ointment, Mupirocin Ointment, and Bacitracin Ointment. This slurry will be applied directly to the cleansed wound, followed by silver gauze/foam product to all wounds. Types of silver product- site and comfort predict use of Restore, Mepilex-AG, or Mepitel-AG. If allergies to the above slurry occurs, we will use medical honey with or without bacitracin. If ointment related rash present with transition to silver product only or silver product plus medical honey.</description>
