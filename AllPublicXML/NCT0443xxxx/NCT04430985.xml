  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial chemotherapy regimen FOLFOX with intrahepatic administration of oxaliplatin is
      combined with immunotherapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab) for the group of patients with
      multiple liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Investigators hope to increase the
      disease-free survival after 3 years from 10 % to 30%.
