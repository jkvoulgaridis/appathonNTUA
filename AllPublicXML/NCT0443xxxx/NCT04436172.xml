  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful sex continues to be a relationship issue and can lead to marital dys-harmony. Other
      consequences include infertility, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety.Our study shows
      that spinal anesthesia is an effective last resort management option in women with
      vaginismus. As a one-off treatment spinal anesthesia provides hope for such couples and
      brings about a positive change in their relationships.

    <description>Depression was assessed by Zung's score. Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale is a twenty item likert scale with raw score that ranges from 20 to 80. There are 20 items on the scale that rate the four common characteristics of depression: the pervasive effect, the physiological equivalents, other disturbances, and psychomotor activities.
Relationaship assessment was assesed by relationship assessment score.The Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS) is a brief measure of global relationship satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The spinal anesthesia was given by a trained anesthetist in an equipped room, after all aseptic measures. A 20 gauge intravenous cannula was inserted for maintaining a peripheral line and 0.9% normal saline was used for loading the patient. The pulse and blood pressure were monitored non-invasively. The median approach was utilized and intrathecal space was accessed via 25 gauge Quiincke bevel(Becton Dickinson/Pakistan ) through L4-L5. A block was performed by using 5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine (Abocain 0.5%/Abbot) after ensuring swirling. Block height was monitored via pinprick test after every three minutes, for 20 minutes until there was no progression. The couple was left alone. The couples received prior training and were explained precautions.</description>
