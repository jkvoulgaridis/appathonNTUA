  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is a common side effect of cancer treatments, and
      dexamethasone offers a clear advantage over placebo for protection against
      chemotherapy-induced emesis in both acute and delayed phases. However, its side effects such
      as moderate to severe insomnia, hyperglycemia, dyspepsia, upper abdominal discomfort,
      irritability, increased appetite, weight gain and acne are gathering increasing concerns.
      Several clinical trials have shown that olanzapine plays an important role in treating
      delayed, refractory, breakthrough nausea and vomiting. Its side effects mainly include
      sedation and weight gaining. At present, the NCCN guidelines have recommended
      olanzapine-containing three-drug regimen for Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) and
      moderate emetic chemotherapy (MEC) to prevent vomiting, but its data in the Chinese
      population is limited. Hence, we initiated this prospective, multi-center, phase III study to
      validate the dexamethasone-free protocol: applying olanzapine to prevent CINV instead of
      dexamethasone.
