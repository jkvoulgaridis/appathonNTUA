  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a phase II, multicenter, open-label study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of a novel BTK inhibitor, ICP-022, in approximately 85 subjects with R/R
      DLBCL. There will be no control group in this study. Each subject will receive treatment
      orally every day in 28-day cycles. Each cycle starts immediately after the previously
      completed cycle without a break between cycles.
