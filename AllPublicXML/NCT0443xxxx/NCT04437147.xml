  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction:

      Functional constipation is a symptom-based gastrointestinal disorder without an organic
      origin (eg, bowel obstruction). It has a prevalence of 14% in adults.

      Objective:

      The objective of trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different probiotic blends in
      adults healthy subjects with functional constipation.

      Methods:

      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted for up to two years to
      evaluate the effectiveness of two different probiotic mixtures: (Mixture1) Lactobacillus
      acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (3 billion CFU); (Mixture 2)
      Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus
      paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus defensis,
      Bifidobacterium animallis (8 billion CFU).

    <textblock>
      The study involve 150 healthy volunteers with functional constipation.The sample size was
      based on literature reviews of the probiotics' effect comparing the differences between
      means.

      After confirmation of eligibility and obtaining written informed consent, the patients will
      be given a unique subject number by the research doctor. The randomization (stratified for
      lot) will be performed by the probiotic company and the patients and doctor at the primary
      care center will be blinded to the treatment received. The eligible patients will be
      allocated (1:1:1) to treatment for 4 weeks with either the probiotics supplement one or two
      or placebo. Subjects will be instructed to:

        -  Ingest one sachet before breakfast , by mixing the powder in water and drinking it.

        -  The sachets will be stored at room temperature.

      Data handling and record keeping Case report forms (CRF) will be used to record data for all
      participants, and will be completed by the research doctor, who will also enter the data into
      an electronic database.

      Study schedule and location After inclusion, all further treatments will be managed at the
      primary care center where the subject was recruited . A research doctor and a research
      pharmacist will be responsible for all contacts with patients.

      Local of study development Recruitment of patients to this study will be made possible by
      collaboration with the Gastroenterolgy Clinic at Avenue Dr Armando Sales de Oliveira 371,
      Trujilo, Sorocaba, State of São Paulo, Brazil from March 2020 to April 2020. Sorocaba is a
      Brazilian municipality in the interior of the state of São Paulo. It is the fourth most
      populous in the interior of São Paulo in the Southeast of the country, and the most populous
      in the southern region of São Paulo, with a population of 671,186 inhabitants, estimated by
      IBGE for July 1, 2018.

      For comparison of three groups, an independent t-test will be applied for continuous
      variables and Mann-Whitney for non-continuous variables. Analysis of adverse events (if any)
      will be performed using Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact test following assumptions of
      randomness, independence and size. Significance will be set at P &lt; 0.05.

    <intervention_model_description>Interventions In particular, subjects were divided into 3 groups: 50 subjects in the group A received placebo, 50 subjetcs in the B received mixed L. acidophilus LA 02 ID 1688, B. bifidum BB 01 ID 1722 and L. rhamnosus LR 04 ID 1132 (1 x 10⁹ colony-forming units/d of each strain) and 50 subjects em the group C received L. acidophilus LA 02 ID 1688, B. bifidum BB 01 ID 1722, L. rhamnosus LR 04 ID 1132, L. paracasei LPC 00 ID 1076, B. longum BL 03 ID 1152, B. lactis BS 01 ID 1195, L. casei LC 03 ID 1872, B. animalis LMG 10508 (1 x 10⁹ colony-forming units/d of each strain) for 30 days. At the beginning of the interventional study, the healthy status of volunteers was evaluated by a complete, laboratory and by the clinical evaluation by the doctor using as reference ROMA IV for intestinal constipation. Exclusion criteria were items of gastrointestinal diseases , pregnant and antibiotic intake.</intervention_model_description>
