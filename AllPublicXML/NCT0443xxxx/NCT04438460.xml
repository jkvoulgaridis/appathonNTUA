  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) is defined by the association of at least two failures of
      vital organs, with various etiologies (septic shock, polytrauma, acute respiratory distress
      syndrome, etc.). Associated mortality remains high in children (between 20 and 50%).

      In septic shock, one of the main causes of MOD, induced immunosuppression can occur, with
      immune alterations affecting all cells of immunity. This induced immunosuppression is
      associated with an additional risk of secondary acquired infections and death in adults.
      Among all the cells and all the markers studied, the expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen -
      DR isotype (HLA-DR) on the surface of the monocyte (mHLA-DR, expressed in number of sites per
      cell) appeared as one of the best biomarkers of this induced immunosuppression. Decreased
      expression of monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype (mHLA-DR) in adults is linked to
      an increased risk of developing secondary infection and death.

      These results were confirmed by team in the context of pediatric septic shock, with an attack
      of innate immunity in the foreground. Persistent lowering of mHLA-DR for more than 3 days
      after onset of shock was associated with the occurrence of secondary acquired infections: 50%
      of children had mHLA-DR of less than 8000 sites / cells on D3, of which 60 % developed
      secondary infection within 30 days. No child with mHLA-DR greater than 8000 sites / cells had
      secondary infection.

      Such immune alterations appear to be non-specific for septic shock, as they have also been
      described after multiple trauma or severe respiratory infections.

      The hypothesize is that multi-systemic aggression leading to multi-visceral failure syndrome
      could also lead to significant immunosuppression, regardless of the etiology of this MOD.

      At present, the proportion of persistent immunosuppression induced by MOD, all etiologies
      combined, is poorly documented in pediatrics. Estimating this proportion in a large pediatric
      cohort, while exploring as fully as possible the associated immune alterations and acquired
      secondary infections, would improve the pathophysiological understanding and pediatric
      specificities of this phenomenon.
