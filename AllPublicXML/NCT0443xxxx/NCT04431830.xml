  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial of a psychosocial pain management intervention
      called, Meaning-Centered Pain Coping Skills Training (MCPC). Patients with advanced solid
      tumor cancer and at least moderate pain will be randomized to MCPC or an education and
      support intervention. Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 5- and
      10-week follow-ups. The first aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a
      randomized clinical trial to test MCPC. The second aim is to characterize MCPC's effects on
      patient-reported outcomes of pain severity, pain interference, meaning in life, self-efficacy
      for pain management, and psychological distress. The third aim is to describe participants'
      experiences of MCPC and the education and support intervention using semi-structured
      qualitative interviews. The risk and safety issues in this trial are low and limited to those
      common to a psychosocial intervention (e.g., loss of confidentiality).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with advanced cancer describe pain as their most feared and distressing
      symptom. In this population, higher pain levels often predict worse physical, emotional, and
      existential/spiritual well-being. Psychosocial interventions show promise for improving
      cancer-related pain; however, no interventions address existential concerns (e.g., a loss of
      meaning in life) that are common among those facing pain from advanced illness. To address
      this need, an intervention called Meaning-Centered Pain Coping Skills Training (MCPC) was
      developed. MCPC seeks to teach patients cognitive and behavioral skills for managing pain
      (e.g., guided imagery) in order to help them engage with what gives their life a sense of
      meaning, purpose, and significance.

      This pilot study is being conducted to prepare for a large-scale clinical trial that will
      test the efficacy of MCPC for improving patients' pain and pain-related outcomes.

    <measure>Change in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), and 10-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). The BPI-SF consists of 4 items assessing pain severity, including worst, least, average, and current pain. The minimum value on this scale is 0 and the maximum value is 10. Higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), and 10-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference will be measured using the 6-item PROMIS Pain Interference-Short Form. This measure assesses the degree to which pain has impacted patients' enjoyment of life and engagement in social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities.The minimum value on this scale is 6 and the maximum value is 30. Higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Meaning in life (i.e., purpose, coherence, and significance) and overall spiritual well-being will be measured using the 12-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being scale (FACIT-Sp).The minimum value on each subscale is 0 and the maximum value is 4. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Self-efficacy for pain management will be measured using the Self-efficacy for Pain Management subscale of the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale. The subscale includes 5 items assessing patients' confidence regarding pain management, managing pain during daily activities, keeping pain from interfering with sleep, and confidence in their ability to reduce pain using methods other than taking additional medication.The minimum value on this scale is 10 and the maximum value is 100. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>
