      This study will investigate how maternal emotional state following a controlled stress
      exposure in pregnancy influences blood glucose and insulin levels after eating a standardized
      meal, and whether the effects of emotional state on blood glucose and insulin is different
      after eating a healthy meal (low GI) compared to a less healthy meal (high GI).

    <textblock>
      Maternal glucose-insulin homeostasis in pregnancy represents one of the most important
      physiological processes for maternal and child health outcomes. Although maternal diet is a
      key regulator of this process, its effects vary widely across individuals. Maternal stress
      could represent a moderator of considerable importance in this regard, yet little is known
      about the effects of stress on glycemic control in pregnancy and whether the effects of
      stress may vary as a function of diet quality. This project will investigate the effects of
      acute psychosocial stress exposure on the postprandial metabolic response to a meal of
      varying glycemic index (GI) among women with overweight/obesity in mid-pregnancy.
