      Background and Rationale:

      Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo, affecting
      2.4% of the general population and 30% of those over 70 years old. The main symptom is the
      perceived sensation of movement of the surrounding or self, without actual such movement,
      triggered by changes in position (positional vertigo). It can be dangerous as repetitive
      symptoms can lead to falls and depression, particularly in the elderly. Additionally, at
      least half of those with initial symptoms of BPPV will have ongoing symptoms if not treated.
      The Epley maneuver is a particle-repositioning maneuver that is used to treat posterior
      semicircular canal BPPV, the most common type of BPPV, after a diagnosis has been made on
      physical examination. In-office administration of the Epley maneuver by a specialist yields a
      90% success rate at treating the condition; however, at-home administration is much less
      successful. In a previous paper we demonstrated the development and face validation of a
      Virtual Reality Epley Maneuver System (VREMS) for performing the Epley maneuver correctly. In
      this study we aim to apply VREMS treatment in patients who have been diagnosed with BPPV.

      Research Question and Objectives:

      PICO (Patient/Population Intervention Compare Outcome): In adult patients diagnosed with
      posterior canal BPPV by a specialist, does VREMS, as compared to self-performed Epley
      maneuver using an instructional handout (IH) result in improved or resolved symptoms?

      Methods:

      Vertigo patients referred to the Neurovestibular Clinic will be evaluated by an Ear, Nose and
      Throat (ENT) specialist. Those who are diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV after history and
      physical examination including the Dix-Hallpike test will be approached to be recruited into
      the study. Patients who consent to participating in the study will be allocated to either the
      VREMS cohort or the control cohort. Those in the control cohort will be provided an
      instructional handout (IH) to help them perform the Epley maneuver. Patients in the VREMS
      cohort will be provided with the VREMS device, which will help guide them through the Epley
      maneuver in a virtual reality environment. All participants will be asked to rate the
      severity of their symptoms before undergoing the Epley maneuver. Subsequently, patients will
      be supervised as they perform the Epley maneuver - VREMS assisted or based on reading the IH.
      In both groups, once the patient has performed the Epley maneuver (whether with VREMS
      assistance or with the IH), they will be asked to rate their symptom severity after
      undergoing the Epley maneuver. All patients will also be asked to complete the NASA Task Load
      Index (NASA-TLX) to gauge their perceived mental workload. They will also be given an
      opportunity to give free-text feedback. For any patient with residual BPPV symptoms following
      Epley maneuver with VREMS or IH, the ENT specialist/vestibular physiotherapist will perform
      the Epley maneuver to ensure resolution of symptoms if possible prior to discharge from the
      clinic. The primary outcome of the study will be the improvement in and resolution of BPPV
      symptoms with VREMS use as compared to IH. Secondary outcome will be mental workload in each
      of the study arms.
