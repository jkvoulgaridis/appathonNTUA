  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Golf is becoming increasingly popular in Germany. However, the biomechanical and motor
      challenge of golf should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, only very few amateur golfers
      carry out serious preparation and conditioning as part of a strength/stabilization program.
      The main argument for this limitation is the aspect of &quot;limited time resources&quot;. A solution
      to this problem could therefore be the time-effective and highly individualizable whole-body
      electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) technology.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 16 weeks of WB-EMS
      application on trunk stability and clubhead speed in male amateur golfers in a (randomized)
      controlled setting.
