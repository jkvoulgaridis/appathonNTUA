  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a semi-experimental clinical trial that 20 patients (40 eyes) with PDR
      underwent PRP with ARC with a spot number of 1,200 to 1,500 per eye and spot size 500 micron
      with a duration of 200 ms. The variables of contrast sensitivity, macula thickness under
      fovea , BCVA, the width of thyroid under fovea , RNFL thickness in the four areas around the
      disc, and the quality of life questionnaire of all patients were recorded at the beginning of
      the study.Retinal and choroid under fovea thickness and RNFL thickness were assessed in four
      areas, one week and one month after the end of treatment, and all the variables mentioned
      earlier were evaluated three months after PRP surgery.

      This study is single group that the outcomes are compared before and after the intervention
