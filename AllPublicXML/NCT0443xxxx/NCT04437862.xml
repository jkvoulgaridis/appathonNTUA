        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Pre-stroke independent functional status in activities of daily living with mRS 0-1.

          -  A disabling stroke defined as NIHSS ≥ 6

          -  In USA thrombolytic therapy (IV tPA) received within 3 hours of onset/ last known
             well, in Europe treatment with IV tPA received within 4.5 hours from onset/ last known
             well OR ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy

          -  Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated &lt; 8 hours from onset of symptoms or
             last known well time

          -  Confirmed symptomatic large vessel occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid
             artery, middle cerebral artery, M1, M2, basilar or intracerebral vertebral artery by
             baseline neuroimaging CTA/MRA and angiographic imaging with a mTICI Score 0-1

          -  For strokes in the anterior circulation the following imaging criteria should also be
             met: MRI criterion of volume of diffusion restriction visually assessed ≤50 mL OR CT
             criterion of ASPECTS 6 to 10 on baseline CT or CTA-source images or, significantly
             lowered cerebral blood volume (CBV) ≤50 mL

          -  For strokes in the basilar or vertebral artery, the following imaging criterion should
             also be met: pc-ASPECTS score 8 to 10 on baseline CT, CTA-source images, or MRI

          -  Signed informed consent from subject, acceptable person responsible (e.g. LAR) and/or
             according to County specific regulatory requirements and local ethical committee or
             review board requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CT or MRI evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on presentation

          -  CT or MRI showing mass effect or intracranial tumor (meningioma &gt; 2 cm in diameter).

          -  Previous stroke within the past 3 months

          -  Rapidly improving neurological status as determined by Investigator/Neurologist

          -  Renal failure/insufficiency with &gt;3.0 mg/dL creatinine prior to procedure

          -  Severe, sustained hypertension resistant to treatment (SBP &gt;185 mmHg or DBP &gt;110 mmHg)

          -  Use of warfarin anticoagulation with International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 3.0 at the
             time of the procedure or any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency

          -  For patients who have received a direct thrombin inhibitor within the last 48 hours;
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; 2.0 times the normal prior to procedure

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000 mm3

          -  Cerebral vasculitis or evidence of active systemic infection

          -  Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus, or suspicion of bacterial
             endocarditis

          -  Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular
             territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation)

          -  Seizure due to stroke

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast

          -  Presence of a carotid artery stenosis or occlusion requiring balloon angioplasty or
             stenting at time of the procedure

          -  Difficult endovascular access or difficult aortic arch or severe neurovascular
             tortuosity that will result in an inability to deliver endovascular therapy

          -  Evidence of dissection in the carotid or target artery for treatment

          -  Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial
             occlusion is chronic

          -  Active participation in another study involving an investigational drug or device

          -  A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that
             will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient

          -  Unwillingness to complete follow up visits
