  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The material cost for robotic groin hernia repair is higher than for conventional
      laparoscopic surgery. In this study, this amount will be quantified and possible differences
      in early postoperative course, hospital stay and readmission rate that could influence the
      cost/benefit ratio for robotic groin hernia surgery will be analyzed.

    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted groin hernia repair has been introduced in AZ Maria Middelares hospital since
      September 2016. In these procedures, the daVinci robot is being used to perform minimal
      invasive repair of these hernias. At the moment, this technique is frequently being used for
      groin hernia repair. Literature shows a clear benefit of robot-assisted versus open repair.
      Hospital stay decreases and complications are less frequently observed in patients who
      underwent minimal invasive repair (Henriksen NA et al., 2018).

      On the other hand, the benefits of robot-assisted repair are less obvious compared to
      conventional laparoscopy. Many robot-trained surgeons are in favor of robot-assisted repair,
      but current literature is still inconclusive about the economic feasibility of robot-assisted
      groin hernia repair as standard of care.

      This retrospective observational study is primarily designed to analyze the additional cost
      of robot-assisted groin hernia repair compared to conventional laparoscopic repair. A
      cost-benefit analysis will be carried out for groin hernia repairs performed by the same
      surgeon (Dr. Filip Muysoms) in the period 2016-2019.

      As primary endpoint, direct costs related to the introduction of robot-assisted groin hernia
      repair will be analyzed. These are: material costs, costs related to hospital stay, honoraria
      and costs related to intrahospital complications. A comparison will be made between
      conventional laparoscopic and robot-assisted groin hernia repair.

      As secondary endpoint, indirect costs will be compared between both groups. These include
      costs related to late complications and readmissions related to the index operation.
