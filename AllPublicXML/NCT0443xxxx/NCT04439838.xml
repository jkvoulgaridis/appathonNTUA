        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (inclusive)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

          -  Male subjects who meet any of the following criteria from at least 30 days before the
             first administration of trial medication until 30 days after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. use of condom (male subjects) plus any of the
                  following methods (female partners): intrauterine device, hormonal contraception
                  (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that
                  started at least 2 months prior to first drug administration to the male subject,
                  or barrier method (e.g. diaphragm with spermicide), or surgically sterilised
                  (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy), or
                  postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea

               -  Sexually abstinent

               -  Vasectomised (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment) in combination with a
                  barrier method (e.g. condom)

          -  Unprotected sexual intercourse with a pregnant female partner and sperm donation is
             not allowed throughout the study and until 30 days after trial completion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
