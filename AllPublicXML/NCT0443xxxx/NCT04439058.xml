  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of SGB on the cardiovascular system remain controversial since the cardiac
      sympathetic nerves pass through the stellate ganglion. SGB is expected to have an
      ameliorative effect on impaired coronary circulation and cardiac function and thus to be well
      suited to the treatment of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction

      investigators chose left SGB being safer with regards conductivity changes when compared to
      right SGB, in the present study investigators are trying to examine and compare whether
      coronary reperfusion in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who were subject
      to ultrasound guided left Stellate ganglion block (SGB ) performed in the induction of
      anesthesia could decrease post cardiopulmonary bypass ischemic changes, pulmonary
      hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction leading to enhanced recovery.

      Place of work: Ain shams university hospitals cardiovascular surgery academy, Cairo, Egypt.

      Number and selection of participants:

      40 participants, 20 in each group (2 groups).

    <description>Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) has several established clinical indications Under complete aseptic precautions an ultrasound guided left stellate ganglion block was performed. (paratracheal technique ) ( ) The patient was placed in the supine position with the head in the neutral position and slightly extended. An initial scanning was done with the ultrasound to identify the structures in this area.
The US probe was placed at the level of the cricoid cartilage. The transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra was identified by its prominent anterior tubercle. Also, the longus colli muscle and its overlying prevertebral fascia were sought anterior to the C6 vertebral body and deep to the carotid artery. After skin infiltration with local anesthetic, the needle was inserted from lateral to medial using the in-plane technique.
