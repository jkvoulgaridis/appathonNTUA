  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of a 12-week Functional Power Training (FPT) program in pre-frail
      and frail community-dwelling older adults in Singapore for the management of physical
      frailty. The proposed study will provide information on the benefits of FPT on physical
      performances of older adults and help to shape future exercise recommendations to slow or
      reverse the onset and severity of physical frailty.
