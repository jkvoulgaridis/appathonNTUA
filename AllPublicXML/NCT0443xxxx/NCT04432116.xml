  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with bipolar disorders report an acceleration or slowing of time flow, and patients
      with schizophrenic spectrum disorders a time fragmentation. These disorders would be linked
      to disorders of the sense of self. Assessing these time-related disorders could help to
      better predict psychotic conversion in vulnerable subjects. In this protocol, the
      investigators wish to develop playful methods for the evaluation of alterations in the
      passage of time, based on the use of virtual reality. The protocol will be tested in
      stabilized but chronic bipolar or schizophrenic patients, vs. healthy subjects matched on
      age, sex, and study level. The protocol will include two experimental sessions. It will begin
      with a waiting room-like session, at the end of which the subject will be asked to
      retrospectively estimate the time that will have passed. The games that will follow will all
      be based on the principle of temporal waiting. A first signal will indicate the start of the
      trial, and a target will be presented at varying times after this first signal. The later the
      target is presented, the more the subject expects and prepare for the target, and the faster
      he or she is. This time delay is measured by the subject's response (response time, error
      rate, eye fixation), but also by electrical signals measured by electroencephalography (EEG).
      The two experimental sessions will include several temporal manipulations during these tasks,
      intended to highlight alterations in the time flow in patients compared to controls. In one
      of the sessions, a starfield will be presented and the speed of the stars in the starfield
      will be manipulated, as a proxy for the speed of the environment. In one condition, the speed
      of the object will be average, and in the other the speed will be self-adjusted by the
      subject. In a control condition, the speed of the object will be zero. In the other
      experimental session, distractors will be presented during the waiting phase of the target.
      They will be presented either simultaneously or asynchronously. In one control condition the
      distractors will be absent. In both sessions it will be examined how the behavioral and EEG
      cues are affected by the manipulations. A double dissociation is expected, with greater
      disturbance in patients with bipolar disorder when standard movement is used, whereas
      patients with schizophrenia should be disturbed mainly when asynchronous distractors are
      presented.
