    <textblock>
      This study is a parallel-group, single blinded controlled clinical trial. The general
      objective of this multicomponent physical exercise program (MPEP) is to decrease the risk of
      falls and fractures through the improvement of the bone health and physical functions of
      people with Alzheimer Disease.

      Patients allocated to the intervention group will perform a MPEP during 6 months, with a
      frequency of 3 sessions per week, and approximately 45-50 minutes of duration each session.

      During the study, 4 evaluations will be carried out to assess the effects of the
      interventions on bone mineral density, gait, balance, and fall risk: ((1) Baseline
      (pre-intervention); 2) 1st post-intervention after 1 month; 3) 2nd post-intervention after 3
      months; 4) Final, 3rd post-intervention after 6 months

    <description>Tinetti's Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA-T) will be used (points). the original POMA-T 28-point version. It consists of a balance scale (Balance performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA-B) can score 16 points) and a gait scale (Gait performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA-G) can score 12 points )</description>

    <measure>Change in gait and balance 2</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months. 4 time points: 1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) 1st post-intervention (1 month); 3) 2nd post-intervention (3 months); 4) Final, 3rd post-intervention (6 months)]</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and go test (TUG) will be used (s). IT measures the time in seconds for the subjects to get up from a standard armchair, walk 3 metres, turn, walk back to the chair and sit down. The cut-off point for normal mobility is 12 seconds and values &gt; 30 s indicate a high level of dependence. (a time &lt;10s it is considered normal; &lt;20s mobility difficulties and low or moderate risk of falls; &gt; 20 mobility problems with need of help and high risk of falls)</description>

    <description>Bone health status will be assessed by ultrasound calcaneus densitometry/sonometry. As primary outcome we will assess the T-Score. A T-score shows how much the BMD is higher or lower than the BMD of a healthy 30-year old adult. (-1.0 or above normal BMD; From -1.0 to -2.5 low BMD or osteopenia; -2.5 or below very low BMD and diagnosis of osteoporosis.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months. 4 time points: 1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) 1st post-intervention (1 month); 3) 2nd post-intervention (3 months); 4) Final, 3rd post-intervention (6 months)]</time_frame>
    <description>Bone health status will be assessed by ultrasound calcaneus densitometry/sonometry. As secondary outcome we will assess the Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) (dB/MHz). It is a measurement of the differential attenuation of sound waves transmitted through the calcaneus.</description>

    <description>Bone health status will be assessed by ultrasound calcaneus densitometry/sonometry. As secondary outcomes we will assess the SOS through the calcaneus bone (m/s). It is calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled by the impulse and the time taken by the signal to travel that distance</description>

    <description>Bone health status will be assessed by ultrasound calcaneus densitometry/sonometry. As secondary outcomes we will assess the Quantitative ultrasound index. To improve precision we will calculate de QUI, a variable derived from the mathematical combination of both SoS and BUA [0.41 × (BUA + SoS) − 571] (19), expressed as percent.</description>
