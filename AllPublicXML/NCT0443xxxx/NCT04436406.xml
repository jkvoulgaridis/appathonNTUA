      Measurement of PDL1 expression in cancer to monitor treatment response.

      A prospective single centre non-randomised exploratory observational study.

      To determine the baseline level and variability within and between patients and tumour types
      of PDL1 expression in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer in immunotherapy naïve patients
      using [99mTc]-anti-PDL1 SPECT and immunohistochemistry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using [99mTc]-labeled anti-PDL1 single-domain antibody, this study aims to prospectively
      measure changes in PD-L1 expression determined with SPECT imaging and correlate these changes
      with response to anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy.
