  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with coronary artery disease, dual antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid and
      a P2Y12-receptor antagonist) is a commonly used method because of its excellent
      antithrombotic effect. In particular, in patients with acute myocardial infarction, who
      receive coronary angiography as an emergency, the dual antiplatelet is used immediately
      before the test to prevent and test further clot formation, regardless of whether or not the
      patient had previously taken dual antiplatelet.

      Ticagrelor, a direct-acting and reversible ADP receptor antagonist, was introduced in Denmark
      in 2013 and is now the most commonly used ADP receptor antagonist in the treatment of ACS.
      Compared to its predecessor clopidogrel, the pharmacokinetic proÔ¨Ål of ticagrelor is more
      predictable, demonstrating a faster onset of action and a more consistent platelet
      inhibition. However, because of the excellent antithrombotic effect and increased bleeding
      potential, it is recommended that major bleeding, such as OPCAB or CABG surgery, be expected
      with a high probability, and in case of fatal surgery, the drug should be discontinued for 5
      days.

      Most patients who receive emergency coronary heart surgery after undergoing coronary
      angiography as an emergency due to an acute myocardial infarction, it take approximately
      24-48 hours to undergo surgery after examination. In fact, there have been reports of
      large-scale cross-country studies that do not increase bleeding risk compared to 5 days until
      3 days after ticagrelor is stopped. Therefore, this study aimed to retrospectively analyze
      the bleeding tendency by analyzing the records of patients using clopidogrel or ticagrelor in
      preoperative coronary angiography for patients undergoing emergency CABG surgery from 2016 to
      September 2019.
