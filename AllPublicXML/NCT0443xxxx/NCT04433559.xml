  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind Phase III study with two arms
      to determine the efficacy and safety of the use of an IPDE in women with FSIAD.

      Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will
      enter the study and receive active product or placebo for 14 weeks.

      Patients will be assigned to each treatment group in a randomized and parallel manner. In
      addition, all volunteers participating in the study will receive medical advice during the
      study.

      The study will have a duration of minimum of 18 weeks and will consist of 3 periods.
