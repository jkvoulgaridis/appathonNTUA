      This study aimed to get the information about the effectiveness of preemptive oral gabapentin
      600 mg in reducing morphine requirement after non obstetric lower abdominal surgery

    <textblock>
      Sixty-eight subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study and randomized
      into two groups; gabapentin and placebo. Two hours before the incision, patients were given
      preemptive analgesia, either gabapentin or placebo. Non-invasive blood pressure monitor,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and pulse oxymetry were set on the subjects in the operating room.
      General anesthesia induction was done by fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg. Endotracheal
      tube (ETT) intubation was facilitated with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg as muscle relaxant.
      Maintenance was done by sevoflurane, oxygen, and compressed air. After surgery, patients were
      extubated until fully conscious. Patients will be transported to recovery room
      postoperatively. Besides paracetamol as the postoperative analgesia, we also attached patient
      controlled analgesia (PCA) system to patients' intravenous line using continuous ambulatory
      delivery device (CADD) contained morphine 1 mg/ml with settings 1 mg per requirement,
      interval limit within 5 minutes, maximum dose 6 mg/hour intravenously. Cumulative morphine
      requirement, mean visual analogue scale, and time interval after surgery to the first
      administration of morphine will be assessed in this study.
