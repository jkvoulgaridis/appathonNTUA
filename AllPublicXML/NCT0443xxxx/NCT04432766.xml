  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-Label, randomized study to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      BAT2020 in Hospitalized Patients Infected With COVID-19. This study is composed of two Parts:
      single ascending dose (Part 1) and multiple ascending dose escalation or treatment period
      with a double-blind, placebo-controlled design (Part 2).

      Part 1. Single ascending dose (SAD) SAD: The patients will receive a single IV infusion of
      BAT2020 on day 1, and will be followed for up to 28 days. Safety, efficacy and PK information
      will be collected during this period. A total of 24 subjects, 3 cohorts of 8 subjects each,
      will be enrolled in this study. Screening for the study will begin 3 days prior to the actual
      dosing.

      Treatment cohorts are planned as following:

      Cohort 1: BAT2020 1 mg/kg (n=6) + Placebo (n=2) Cohort 2: BAT2020 3 mg/kg (n=6) + Placebo
      (n=2) Cohort 3: BAT2020 10 mg/kg (n=6) + Placebo (n=2) After a cohort completes the study on
      Day 28, data on safety and tolerability for each cohort will be evaluated by the Safety
      Monitoring Committee (SMC). Administration of the next higher dose to a new dosing cohort
      will be permitted only if adequate safety and tolerability have been demonstrated. If
      encouraging clinical benefit is observed at a certain dose level, the study may proceed to a
      to Part 2 based on emerging data.

      Part 2. Treatment Period (double-blind, Placebo-controlled study) The SMC will review safety,
      PK, PD, and efficacy data of each cohort prior to Part 2. Part 2 is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 2-like study in hospitalized adult patients with
      laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 100~150 patients will be enrolled a
      2-arm (1:1 randomization of BAT2020 vs. standard supportive care) or a 3-arm (1:1:1 two
      dosing regimens of BAT2020 vs. standard supportive care) trial with 50 patients in each arm
      (the sample size and statistical analysis may be amended based on emerging data from Part 1).
      An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to
      allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. Patients will be assessed daily while
      hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 28. All
      subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments.
