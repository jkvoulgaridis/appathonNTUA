  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a chronic degenerative disease of the optic nerve. It is the second cause of
      blindness worldwide and a frequent cause of irreversible blindness. In 2020, epidemic health
      authorities have predicted about 80 million glaucoma patients. Glaucoma can be treated by
      topical treatment (eye drops), laser or surgery. A premature diagnosis of glaucoma is very
      important to prevent irreversible blindness. Pachymetry, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
      and visual fields exams are fundamental for the development of the glaucoma diagnosis. The
      severity of glaucoma is defined with Hodapp-Parrish-Andersen visual field criteria. According
      to these criteria, glaucoma can be classified as early (with average visual field deviation,
      MD, of 0 to -6 dB), moderate (MD of -6 to -12 dB) and severe (MD worse than -12 dB). The
      progression of glaucoma is being identified by the visual fields tests, and also by the
      progression of alterations in the optic nerve head. The visual fields tests are long and
      difficult (30 minutes). It is therefore important to create additional tests and anticipate
      the diagnosis, in order to avoid the irreversibility of glaucoma.

      The OCT Angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive technology, marketed since 2014, that uses OCT
      with infrared light, with no radiation nor side effects, to evaluate within seconds the
      vascularization of the fundus, retina and optic nerve head, which may be useful for the
      glaucoma diagnosis. A recent meta-analysis has shown a decrease of the vascular density (DV)
      in glaucoma, so that OCTA may be useful in the advanced diagnosis of glaucoma. However, the
      VD values obtained were different depending on the device. In addition, no studies with the
      OCT Triton (Topcon®) device were considered in the analysis. The authors suggested the
      development of dedicated software, which would allow the evaluation of VD with different
      devices for a more independent and valid assessment. On the other hand, recent studies show
      that the diagnostic capacity of OCTA may be superior to that of OCT, and that OCTA may be
      more useful in determining the severity of glaucoma than OCT. It is therefore necessary to
      evaluate the additional diagnostic tests whether they are non-invasive and whether it allow
      us to give a faster diagnosis.

      This study is aimed at comparing the diagnostic utility of OCTA with standard complementary
      glaucoma examinations (OCT and CV).

papilla excavation&gt; 5/10 with altered ISNT rule, or neuro-retinal rhyme characteristic of glaucoma, or fiber alterations characteristic of glaucoma.

The assignment to the &quot;Cas&quot; group will be carried out by an ophthalmologist specializing in glaucoma according to the following criteria:
- The intraocular pressure must be increased before the start of treatment (21 mmHg or more), except in cases of normal pressure glaucoma.
The additional examination corresponds to an OCTA alone leading to an extension of the duration of the consultation by 5 minutes.</description>
