    <textblock>
      Develop time-to-event prediction and plaque phenotype classification models using plaque
      morphology and composition assessment of CTA which has been validated by histology, applied
      to representative cohort of patients. Generalizability of models is enhanced by using
      validated rather than only raw image inputs. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data is
      collected for enrolled patients as well as last known well dates.

    <description>Develop time-to-event model for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) prediction on large retrospective cohort (and enable a prospective collection subsequent to this study). Consistent with this primary endpoint is the evaluation of all imaging-derived data that has a bearing on the diagnosis and prognosis of the subject.</description>
