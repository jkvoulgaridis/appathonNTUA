      The proposed clinical trial is a phase I/II open-label study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of a novel tissue engineered airway product, consisting of expanded autologous Bone
      Marrow (BM) derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) seeded on to a decellularised allogeneic
      patch of an airway scaffold in subjects with clinically significant bronchopleural fistula.
      It is a phase I/II open-label study, which is an uncontrolled pilot in 5 subjects.

          -  BPF which involves the tracheobronchial junction or proximal bronchus.

          -  Subjects who have failed primary repair.

          -  Subjects who have no evidence of any primary or recurrent cancer (not limited to the
             surgical site) at the time of pre-operative screening as evidenced by CT and/or
             targeted biopsy (except for controlled or controllable basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Subjects who have signed and dated written informed consent to participate in the

             or investigational product administration or in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant renal and liver impairment.

          -  Subjects undergoing an immunosuppression regimen or suffering from a primary
             immunodeficiency syndrome.

          -  Subjects with any known hypersensitivity to the culture and transport media compounds.

             action or disposition of the investigational product, or clinical or laboratory
             assessments.

             required study visits or procedures, including follow-up visits, or comply with the
             study requirements for participation

          -  Subjects with any medical condition, that in the investigator's judgement, is likely
             to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of study treatment.

          -  Subject who is pregnant.

          -  Subjects with cancer (except for controlled or controllable basal cell carcinoma).
