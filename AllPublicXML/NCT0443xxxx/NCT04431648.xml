      This study is to demonstrate the feasibility of novel MRI-guided ultrasound stimulated
      microbubble treatment to enhance radiation effects in humans receiving external beam
      radiotherapy delivered using a LINAC (linear accelerator) radiation therapy device. The
      investigators have previously demonstrated that ultrasound and microbubble mediated
      endothelial cell perturbation can significantly enhance the effectiveness of radiation. It
      enhances tumour response to radiation significantly by synergistically destroying tumour
      blood vessels. The technique is targeted spatially and achieves tumour specificity by
      confining the low-power ultrasonic fields that stimulate microbubbles to the tumour location
      only. By perturbing the tumour vasculature and activating specific genetic pathways, the
      technique sensitizes the targeted tissues to the subsequent therapeutic application of
      radiation, resulting in significantly enhanced cell killing. The primary aim of this research
      is to evaluate the safety profile of MRI-guided ultrasound stimulated microbubble treatment
      and radiation in patients with head and neck cancer. The secondary aim is to evaluate tumor
      (primary and/or nodal) response to MRg-FU + MB and radiation, as measured radiologically
      within the treated therapeutic regions.
