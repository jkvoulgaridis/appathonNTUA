  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are spread by mosquitos. These diseases have a major impact on
      public health. This is especially true in in Southeast Asia. Non-human primates (such as
      macaques) could play an essential role in spreading these diseases. Researchers want to
      further understand the relationship between humans and these primates. They want to see how
      this affects how mosquito-borne viruses are spread in Southeast Asia.

      Objective:

      To describe the prevalence of Zika virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus in the blood of
      people who live close to long-tailed macaques in Thailand and Cambodia.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people aged 18-55 who have lived or worked within approximately 10 kilometers of the
      Wat Amphae Phnom monkey habitat in Kampong Speu, Cambodia, for a minimum of 2 years

      Design:

      Participation will last 1 day.

      Participants will be screened in person through an interview. Their medical history will be
      reviewed.

      Participants will give information about themselves. This will include sex, age, and
      behaviors related to the spread of mosquito-borne disease. For example, they will be asked
      about the number of water containers at their home. They will be asked about recent travel.
      They will be asked about the extent of their contact with the macaques.

      Participants will give a blood sample....

    <textblock>
      Arboviral epidemics continue to emerge suddenly and spread of disease is unpredictable. The
      2015-16 Zika epidemic resulted in a high case number in Thailand, but not in neighboring
      Cambodia. It is known that nonhuman primates (NHPs) are important reservoirs of arboviruses,
      but the importance of their epidemiological role in the transmission of arboviruses is not
      clearly understood. While transmission dynamics are complex and require consideration of many
      variables, primate reservoirs are not routinely sampled, particularly in Southeast Asia,
      because of the level of operational complexity and skill required.

      Here, we propose a serological survey for evidence of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV),
      and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exposure in long-tailed macaques and human adults who live or
      work in close proximity to these monkeys in Thailand and Cambodia. We hypothesize that ZIKV
      seroprevalence in both humans and macaques will be higher in Thailand than Cambodia. With the
      current rise of arboviral diseases around the world, we hope the results of this study
      contribute to better understanding of the epidemiology and burden of arboviral diseases in
      this region.
