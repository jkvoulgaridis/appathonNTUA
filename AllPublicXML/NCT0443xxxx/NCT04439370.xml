  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study in which the investigators will determine the impact of
      premature/early menopause on MSNA, BP and baroreflex sensitivity in younger (≤45 yr old) and
      older (≥55 yr old) women. Specifically, aim one will determine mechanisms driving autonomic
      dysregulation of BP in premature and early menopausal women and aim two will determine
      mechanisms driving autonomic dysregulation of BP in older menopausal women. The study design
      outlined below will permit testing of aim one and aim two.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim One: Determine mechanisms driving autonomic dysregulation of blood pressure (BP) in
      premature and early menopausal women. Because sympathetic activity and baroreflex function
      are important contributors for autonomic support of BP regulation, these two mechanisms will
      be assessed in premature and early menopausal women who are ≤45 yr old. To specifically
      identify the influence of menopause, these women will be compared to age-matched
      premenopausal women. The primary hypothesis is that there is greater resting sympathetic
      activity and blunted baroreflex function in premature and early menopausal women compared
      with age-matched premenopausal women. The secondary hypothesis is that BP and sympathetic
      reactivity will be greater in premature and early menopausal compared with age-matched
      premenopausal women when the sympathetic nervous system is challenged with a stressor.

      Aim Two: Determine mechanisms driving autonomic dysregulation of BP in older menopausal
      women. Because older age contributes to risk of CVD, it is imperative to assess the long-term
      effects of premature and early menopause in older (&gt;55 yr) women. To determine the impact of
      the premature loss of sex hormones on cardiovascular physiology, women whom have lived
      without functioning ovaries for &gt;10 yr will be compared to age-matched women who entered
      menopause at a typical age. The primary hypothesis is that resting sympathetic activity is
      greater and baroreflex function is attenuated in women who experience premature or early
      menopause compared with typically-aged menopausal women. The secondary hypothesis is that BP
      and sympathetic reactivity will be greater in premature and early compared with
      typically-aged menopausal women when the sympathetic nervous system is challenged with a
      stressor.

        Two scenarios of recruiting and enrolling premature/early menopausal females have been
        determined. 1) Enroll participants prior to starting MHT and/or 2) for patients already
        taking prescribed MHT, a standard protocol has been developed with Dr. Torkelson on
        guidelines for enrolling these participants. This includes a baseline estradiol (E2) blood
        draw, then in coordination with the participant and their physician, the participant will
        stop taking MHT. Estradiol will be tested every two weeks, up to 3 times (6 weeks). When
        estradiol is &lt;30 pg/ml for two weeks, participants will be enrolled in the study and can
        commence MHT immediately upon completion of study visit.
