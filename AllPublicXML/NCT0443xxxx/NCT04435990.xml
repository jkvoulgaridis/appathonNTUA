      A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicenter randomized of 2 active
      treatment groups, compared to 1 placebo group, for the determination of the efficacy and
      safety of immunotherapy in patients with rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with mild to moderate
      asthma, sensitised to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus y Dermatophagoides farinae.

    <masking_description>During the trial, both the investigator and the included subjects will be unaware of the treatment each subject is receiving.
The person in charge of data analysis will also not know the treatment assigned to each subject until the database has been closed.
So that neither the subject nor the investigator knows what treatment each subject is receiving, all the trial medication is identical in terms of outer packaging and appearance.</masking_description>

             sources and whose determination does not exceed 1 year prior to the inclusion visit.
