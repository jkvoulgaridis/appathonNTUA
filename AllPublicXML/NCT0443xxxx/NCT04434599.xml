  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation is a first-line treatment for patients with cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)
      dependent atrial flutter (AFL; also known as typical AFL), a common arrhythmia. This is done
      using radiofrequency (RF) catheters and single-procedure success is approximately 95%.
      Ablation is often done using one of three methods:

        1. fluoroscopically, using X-rays to guide the operator to visualise catheter position
           within the heart. This method involves the most radiation exposure to patient and
           operator. Ablation is generally performed for a set time-period (eg. 30-60secs) to
           ensure each ablation lesion is successful.

        2. using a 3-dimensional mapping system which allows the catheters to be magnetically
           located and visualised on a monitor without X-rays, and using &quot;contact force&quot; (CF)
           sensing catheters. This requires minimal X-ray use, and by ensuring a minimum degree of
           force between catheter tip and the heart before applying RF for a set time-period (eg.
           30 seconds), operators can be more confident of successful lesions.

        3. using an ultra-high density mapping system which uses magnetic tracking as above, but
           allows higher resolution visualisation of the cardiac electrical system with potential
           for improving procedure success; this has not yet been formally evaluated for AFL.
           Catheters using this method use &quot;local impedance&quot; (LI) instead of CF. This is a direct
           measure of heart tissue impedance with real-time changes during ablation. A minimum drop
           or plateau in the LI value during ablation allows confidence of lesion success, without
           the need to ablate for a pre-defined time-period. This could potentially reduce ablation
           time and subsequent complications, but has also not yet been formally compared to the
           above for this indication.

      This prospective randomised study aims to compare these three standard of care procedures to
      determine if differences in ablation metrics, efficacy and safety exist.
