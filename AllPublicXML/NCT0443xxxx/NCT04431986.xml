  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults' health and functional status are heterogeneous because of the various
      cumulative effects of chronic diseases and physiologic decline, contributing to a vicious
      cycle of increased frailty 1-4. Thanks to advances in medicine and hygiene, a growing number
      of older adults spend more years with a greater range of chronic diseases causing disability
      but not mortality 5. Health systems need to face this new challenge 4,5. Quantification of
      frailty and its association with the occurrence of incident adverse health events (i.e.,
      functional decline, unplanned hospitalizations) is crucial to understand how health systems
      may efficiently respond to this situation 6. This study aims to examine the association of
      the ER2 tool score and its stratification in three levels for incident adverse health events
      in older community dwellers and to compare this association with three validity frailty
      indexes which are the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty index, Study of Osteoporotic
      Fracture (SOF) index and Rockwood frailty index.
