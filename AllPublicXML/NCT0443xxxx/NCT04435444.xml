    <description>This intervention uses teachings, discussions, and exercises about personal experiences that focus on specific topics related to meaning and cancer. For example, we may discuss what is meaningful in your life, how you identify yourself before and after cancer, and your hopes for the future. The Masterful intervention is available in both English and Arabic, and it will be delivered by a trained bilingual member of the study team. It includes 3 weekly 1-hour sessions with a member of the study team.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years of age

          -  identify, either as self-report or on the MSKCC EMR, as Muslim

          -  are in treatment for a confirmed diagnosis of stage III or IV cancer (solid or liquid)
             as per clinician or pathology report

          -  have an estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months, as determined by their primary
             oncologist

          -  are cognitively intact (oncologist's clinical impression)

          -  able to speak and read English or Arabic (self-reported preference or on the MSKCC EMR
             system).

          -  To assess English proficiency, participants will be asked two questions: (1) the
             Census limited English proficient item &quot;How well do you speak English?&quot; with response
             options &quot;Not at all, Not well, Well, or Very well&quot; and (2) &quot;What is your preferred
             language for healthcare?&quot;

          -  Participants who are eligible for the study and are fluent in English will be
             identified by the response &quot;Very well&quot; to the 1st question and a response indicating
             English as the preferred language for healthcare.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major psychiatric illness or cognitive impairment that in the judgment of the study
             investigators or study staff would preclude study participation

          -  patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors as per clinician report, as they may have
             difficulty completing the intervention and answering the questionnaires

          -  undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as per clinican report or
             the EMR

          -  currently in psychotherapeutic treatment. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are
             common among patients with stage III or IV cancer. Antidepressants, anxiolytics, and
             other psychotropic medications do not diminish the effects of psychotherapy; thus we
             will not exclude patients who are being treated with these medications, as long as
             they are not in psychotherapy.
