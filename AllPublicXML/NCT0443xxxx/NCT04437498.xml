  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are important
      conditions for the Veterans Administration (VA) that frequently occur together in combat
      Veterans from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. In many Veterans these become chronic,
      raising the risk the burden of neurotrauma can worsen over time. This study will examine a
      new intervention called non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) and its effects on memory
      and symptoms of PTSD and mTBI as well as brain and physiology in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD.

      This projects will assess the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on
      neurobiology and cognition in combat Veterans with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and
      co-morbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the performance of stressful tasks
      (traumatic scripts, mental arithmetic) and verbal declarative memory tasks using measurement
      of memory performance, peripheral inflammatory markers in blood (IL6) and cardiovascular
      responses using wearable gated sensing devices and electro- and seismocardiography, as well
      as brain response (anterior cingulate, hippocampus) measured with High Resolution Positron
      Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabelled water (15O[H2O]). The investigators
      hypothesize that nVNS but not sham control will result in enhanced memory, and hippocampal
      activation with memory encoding, and reduced cardiovascular, sympathetic, and inflammatory
      responses to stress. The investigators will also assess the effects of nVNS and sham on
      memory retention when applied to the encoding phase of a declarative memory learning task
      repeated daily over a four day period and on ratings of PTSD and pain in Veterans with mTBI
      and co-morbid PTSD and repeat assessments after three months of twice daily treatments.

    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS) is a measure of PTSD symptoms with a range of 0-80 and higher score indicating more severe PTSD symptoms. We will compare change from baseline to post treatment with active vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) or sham stimulation twice daily.</description>

    <measure>insula</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow in the insula is measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and radiolabelled water during the performance of stress tasks. We compare blood flow in the insula to whole brain blood flow ratio during stress tasks (listening to personalized traumatic scripts) versus control tasks in the VNS versus sham groups with hypothesis of blocked insula blood flow with VNS</description>

    <measure>HVLT-R % retention</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline versus three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) is a test of declarative memory learning that involves the learning of 12 nouns, four from each of three semantic categories, learned over three learning trials, followed 20 minutes later by a delayed free recall trial and recognition trial composed of 24 words with 12 false positives. The percent (%) retention is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3. HLVT-R % retention has a range of 0-100 with 100 being best and 0 worst performance. Baseline and three months post treatment paired with sham or active stimulation are compared.</description>

    <measure>Change in IL6 Concentration in Blood with Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 120 minutes after stress</time_frame>
    <description>Interleukin-6 (IL6) response to stress paired with active or sham stimulation. IL6 is an inflammatory biomarker measured in blood. We compare IL6 response to stress in VNS versus sham treated groups.</description>

    <measure>hippocampal activation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow in the hippocampus is measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and radiolabelled water during the performance of declarative memory tasks. We compare blood flow in the hippocampus to whole brain blood flow ratio during memory tasks versus control tasks in the VNS versus sham groups with hypothesis of increased hippocampal blood flow with VNS</description>

    <measure>PPG amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 seconds after the termination of stimulation paired with stress</time_frame>
    <description>Photoplethysmography (PPG) amplitude is a measure of peripheral vasoconstriction which is a marker of sympathetic response to stress with active or sham. PPG amplitude is the diameter of the blood vessel in the finger, we measure change from baseline to post active vagal nerve stimulation versus sham stimulation with stress.</description>
