    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an integrated mental health care
      and vocational rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of depression,
      stress, anxiety, personality- and functional disorders in Denmark

  <detailed_description>

      Background:

      Mental illness has an estimated financial burden on the Danish economy of 3.4 % of Gross
      National Product every year due to lost productivity, social benefits and healthcare costs
      and approximately 50 % of people receiving long-term sickness benefits have a common mental
      illness. Furthermore, a significant treatment gap exists where less than 30% were treated for
      their mental illness.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of the randomized trial is to examine whether people on sick leave with
      a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, stress, personality disorders or functional disorders,
      return to work faster and have a higher job retention if they receive an integrated and
      optimized vocational rehabilitation and mental health care intervention, compared to people
      who receive the standard mental health care and vocational rehabilitation service.

      Method:

      The trial is designed as an randomized, two-group parallel, assessor-blinded, multisite
      trial. A total of 800 participants with a common mental illness will randomly be assigned
      into two groups 1) IBBIS II, consisting of an integrated mental health care and vocational
      rehabilitation; or 2) Service as usual, at two sites in Denmark. The primary outcome is
      difference between the two groups in time to return to work at 12 months.

      Results/discussion:

      This study will contribute with new knowledge on vocational recovery and integrated
      vocational and health care interventions in a Scandinavian context.

    <description>The IBBIS-II service consists of:
Mental health assessment.
Planned integrated service. The participant has the same employment specialists and care manager throughout the intervention. A joint plan is made with shared decisions between the participant, the employment specialist and the care manager. There is a focus on disclosure (openness about illness) and involvement of relatives and significant others.
Vocational rehabilitation. Focus on return to work with ongoing assessment of job goals, competencies and need of support. Participants receive help in contacting existing employers (employed) and potential employers (unemployed). Unemployed participants are offered an individualized job search effort. The focus is on competitive jobs within the community.
Treatment consists of stepped care with structured treatment guidelines.
When the participant has obtained work the team continues to offer support.</description>
