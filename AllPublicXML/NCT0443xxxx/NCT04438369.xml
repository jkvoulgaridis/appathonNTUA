  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventral hernia repair is associated with significant postoperative pain, and regional
      anesthetic techniques are of potential benefit.

      The postoperative mobility and training is of utmost importance in this patient group, and
      could be increased using local anesthetics instead of opioids.

      Inadequate post-operative pain control can lead to adverse consequences for patients, such as
      the development of chronic pain, immunosuppression, poorer healing of surgical wounds, as
      well as adrenergic activation and its consequences in the form of coronary incidents or
      gastrointestinal obstruction and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Moreover, lack of
      mobility can result in thrombosis and embolism. These complications affect hospital
      functioning, which leads to decreased patient satisfaction, a worse reputation for the
      hospital, longer stays in the recovery room, prolonged hospitalizations, higher incidence of
      re-surgeries and re-admissions, and higher costs for care and treatment.

      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is the latest of the truncal blocks and was first described
      in 2016. The efficacy of bilateral ESPB at the T7 level has been described in a study of 4
      cases, moreover effective analgesia with ESPB after bariatric surgery has been described in a
      study of 3 cases. When performed at the level of the T7 transverse process, studies show the
      potential to block both supra-umbilical and infra-umbilical dermatomes. So far there are
      mostly case studies done in this field of study, and internationally there is a call for
      research into the effect of this technique and randomized controlled trials.

      The objective of this study is to compare ESPB to multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing
      ventral hernia repair.

      Hypothesis, aims and objectives

      The postulated nullhypothesis and alternativ hypothesis is:

      H0= there is no difference in opioid consumption postoperatively between multimodal analgesia
      and ESPB. HA= there is a difference between opioid consumption postoperatively between
      standard multimodal analgesia and ESPB.

      The primary outcome measure is the opiate consumption measured after 1 hour.

      Secondary outcome measures are;

        -  Opiate consummation after 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days. As patients receive
           different types of opiates, opiate consumption will be measured as oral morphine
           equivalents for ease of comparison. Oksykodon iv is converted by a factor of 1:1,5 to
           oral morphine.

        -  Time to first mobilization

        -  Time to first analgesic requirement

        -  Pain measuring tool used in this project is the validated numerical rating scale (NRS),
           which is a 11- point scale from 0-10, where no pain is NRS=0, mild pain is NRS 1-3,
           moderate pain NRS 4-6 and severe pain 7-10. NRS will be measured at rest and with
           activity at the time points 1, 2 and 3 hours.

        -  Sedation is measured by the validated Pasero opioid-induced sedation scale (POSS). The
           POSS measures normal sleep as S and then the degree of sedation on a numerical scale
           from 1-4. Will be measured at 1, 2 and 3 hours.

        -  Nausea and vomiting is measured by the validated PONV impact scale. This is a tool that
           entails two questions about nausea and vomiting, and each question gets rated on a
           numeric scale from 0-4. Will be measured at 1, 2 and 3 hours.

      After the operation the patients will be asked to answer the QoR-15, which consist of 15
      questions distributed on two dimensions: &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;mental&quot; well-being, where the
      patients report their experiences on a scale from 0 (=not at all) to 10 (=all the time). As a
      complementing measure to the QoR-15 the patients will also be asked the EQ-5D questionnaire.
      The EQ-5D questionnaire is an outcome measure of patient health after operation. The EQ-5D-5L
      is comprised of two different measures; the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual
      analogue scale (EQ VAS). Both QoR-15 and EQ-5D will be measured at 48 hours and 7 days.

      The objective is to gain knowledge to support anesthesiologists when deciding analgesic
      approach, as well as in shared decision-making with patients (including the patient
      perspective). All results are expected to be presented during the project period.

    <masking_description>The randomization was a block-radomization done through a computer-generated block randomization process (randomization.com) to reduce bias. The total patients randomized were 50 patients to account for a change in sample size after the interim analysis. A study nurse prepared and placed the notes of study allocation covered with aluminum foil into opaque envelopes. The envelopes were numbered from 1- 50. When the total estimated sample size was calculated, the total included patients were rounded up to the next rounded number (for example would 34 calculated total sample size be rounded up to 40 total included patients) to balance the number of patients included in each group.
This is a study where all parties are blinded for the allocation.</masking_description>

    <description>Group ESPB: Multimodal analgesia comprising of preoperative paracetamol adjusted for weight (2000 milligrams (mg) &gt;70 kilograms (kg) &lt;70 years, 1500 mg &lt;70 kg &gt;70 years, 1000 mg &lt;50 kg) and diclofenac adjusted for weight (100 mg &gt;70 kg &lt;70 years, 50 mg &lt;70 kg &gt;70 years). After the operation they receive paracetamol 1000 mg x4 and diclofenac 50 mg x3 a day.
Preoperatively positioned bilateral catheters at level T7 injected with ropivacaine 2,5 mg/ml, 30 ml on each side. Postoperative maintenance treatment with injection of 2 mg/ml ropivacaine 30 ml on each side every 6 hours postoperatively. Maximum allowed bolus preoperative ropivacaine dose is 3 mg/kg body weight (BW), while the maximum 24 hour dose postoperatively is 11 mg/kg to avoid local anesthesia systemic toxicity (LAST). The catheter will be discontinued 24 hours after the original procedure. The container with ropivacaine will be masked for blinding of the personnel on the ward.</description>
