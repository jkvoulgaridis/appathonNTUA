  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to confirm that the therapeutic effect of EMDR is associated with changes
      in the interaction between cognitive function and emotional stimuli in PTSD patients compared
      to a controlled therapy in a randomized, single-blind study.On the other hand, this study
      aims to observe neuronal and cognitive correlates related to EMDR therapy compared to a
      control therapy.

      This investigation would improve the understanding of the mechanisms of action of the EMDR,
      still unknown to date.

    <description>The PCL-5 is a self-assessment consisting of 20 items that measures the 20 PTSD symptoms of the DSM-5. The wording of the PCL-5 items reflects both changes in existing symptoms and the addition of new symptoms in the DSM-5.
The objectives of PCL-5 are numerous, such as monitoring changes in symptoms during and after treatment, screening individuals with PTSD, making an interim diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.</description>

    <description>The Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing therapy uses bi-alternating (right-left) sensory stimulation through eye movements. The patient follows the therapist's fingers from right to left in front of his eyes and also by auditory stimuli. The patient wears a helmet that alternately makes him hear a sound to the right, then to the left or touch the patient holds in his hands buzzers that alternately vibrate from right to left, or alternatively the therapist taps the patient's knees or the back of his hands.</description>

    <description>A CBT is a short, scientifically validated therapy that focuses on the interactions between thoughts, emotions and behaviours. These therapies focus on the current problems of the person, while taking into account their historical causes. They help gradually overcome disabling symptoms and aim to strengthen adaptive behaviours. A CBT relies on different techniques that help the patient to identify the mechanisms at the origin of his difficulties, to experiment with new behaviors and thus to gradually come out of vicious circles that perpetuate and aggravate the psychic suffering.</description>
