  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many doctors believe that breast cancer patients scheduled for pre-operative chemotherapy
      whose cancer has spread to the axilla (determined by palpation plus ultrasound) should not
      receive sentinel node biopsy after chemotherapy, but proceed directly to removal of all the
      axillary lymph nodes.

      In this study, breast cancer patients with operable medium-size cancer (T2) scheduled for
      pre-operative chemotherapy, and a disease-free or a metastatic axilla, are prospectively
      assigned to receive sentinel node biopsy as part of their post-chemotherapy surgical
      treatment (whose main aim is to remove the cancer in the breast).

      Irrespective of whether the axilla is disease-free or metastatic before chemotherapy, if the
      removed sentinel nodes are disease-free on histological examination (pN0) after chemotherapy,
      then no further axillary treatment is given. If however the sentinel nodes contain cancer,
      then the other axillary lymph nodes will be removed surgically.

      The study hypothesis is that, irrespective of whether the axilla is disease-free or
      metastatic before chemotherapy, patients with negative axillary sentinel nodes on
      histological examination (pN0) after chemotherapy, and who are no given further axillary
      treatment, will do as well as pN1 patients whose axillary lymph nodes are completely removed
      (a more aggressive treatment).

    <description>DFS and OS are reckoned from date of surgery. DFS is time to recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. OS is time to death for any cause. Time is censored for living patients who are event-free at most recent follow up. OS and DFS curves are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. To compare DFS and OS in the SNB only and SNB + AD groups, propensity scores are estimated to account for bias due to non-random assignment to SNB vs SNB + AD</description>

    <description>cT2 patients scheduled for primary chemotherapy (with or without a clinically involved axilla - cN0/1) who have disease-free sentinel nodes (pN0) after primary chemotherapy, are directed to &quot;SNB only&quot;: i.e. no further treatment to the axilla.</description>

    <description>cT2 patients scheduled for primary chemotherapy (with or without a clinically involved axilla - cN0/1) who have metastatic sentinel nodes (pN1) on sentinel node biopsy (SNB) will undergo axillary dissection (AD) i.e. surgical removal of most axillary lymph nodes.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Sentinel Node Biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>Colloidal radiotracer (99Tc) is injected into the breast near the cancer. The radiotracer moves in the lymph ducts to accumulate in the first lymph nodes (almost always in the axilla) to receive lymph from the breast area containing the cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy is used to check for the presence of radioactivity in the axilla. Some hours later, during breast surgery, a radioactivity-detecting probe is used to identify &quot;hot&quot; lymph nodes (sentinel nodes) and aid their surgical removal from the axilla. These nodes are examined histologically (intraoperatively) for the presence of cancer. If they are disease-free the axilla will be left intact (no further axillary treatment given); if they contain cancer most lymph nodes in the axilla will be removed surgically (axillary dissection).</description>

    <description>Axillary dissection is the surgical removal of all Berg level I and II lymph nodes present in the axilla. The operation is carried out, at our Institute, during the surgery to treat the cancer in the breast (either breast-conserving surgery - quadrantectomy, or mastectomy).</description>
