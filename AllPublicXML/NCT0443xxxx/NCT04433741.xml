  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of participants that will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of oxytocin
      (naturally occurring hormone that is made in the brain).

      In this study healthy volunteers are recruited. Each study participant will have an IV
      catheter placed. After placement of the IV catheter oxytocin will be given by IV infusion of
      oxytocin or placebo (inactive solution). We will perform some tests to evaluate how oxytocin
      changes perceptions on the skin. We will study a painful perception by placing a probe on the
      skin and heating it to 116.6 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 seconds and a vibratory stimulus will
      be applied to the forearm with vibration begun at a 1 kHz frequency and decreased at a rate
      of 25 Hz/sec until the subject first perceives the vibration. Each study participant will
      score any pain that is experienced on a 0 to 10 scale and will report when the vibration is
      detected. Each participant will receive oxytocin and placebo in a random order and will be
      blinded to group they are receiving.

      We aim to create pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models for oxytocin action at
      peripheral sites and at central sites as they relate to sensory transmission and pain. This
      is the last of 4 studies to accomplish generation, validation, and application of a PK/PD
      model for oxytocin in the periphery. Its goal is to apply the PK/PD model generated in
      previous protocols and Validate a pharmacodynamic model of oxytocin for peripheral analgesic
      effects to a more complex sensory stimulus that stimulates nerve fibers which result in pain
      from a heat stimulus and those which reduce pain from vibration, similar to brushing or
      rubbing an area of pain. We do this because oxytocin in animals affects these nerve fibers in
      the periphery in different ways - it increases the activity of the vibration/rubbing
      sensitive fibers and decreases the activity of the pain fibers. As such, we expect that the
      effect of oxytocin on pain from this mixed stimulus of heat and vibration will be much more
      pronounced than that seen with the purely painful stimulus used in previous studies in this
      series.

      This is a double-blind, crossover study in which oxytocin or placebo is infused. In this
      study healthy people are recruited for a 2 day double-blind, crossover study. They will come
      to the Clinical Research Unit and one intravenous catheter (IV) inserted in the forearm for
      oxytocin or placebo infusion. Participants will be given a steady rate intravenous infusion
      of oxytocin at a targeted dose or placebo for 30 minutes. At 5, 15, and 30 minutes after
      starting the infusion, pain report to the 47°Celsius, 30-second stimulus alone or with ½ VT
      vibration (randomized order) will be obtained. Participants will return at least 24 hours
      later and receive the opposite infusion and testing.
