  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      Temsirolimus Perivascular Injection 0.1 mg/mL on the incidence of ischemia-driven major
      amputation, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and clinically relevant target
      lesion occlusion after revascularization of lesions below the knee in patients with
      symptomatic Rutherford 3-5 peripheral artery disease. The primary safety endpoint will be
      gathered at 1-month post-index procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint will be gathered at 6
      months post-index procedure. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years post-index
      procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After completion of revascularization therapy and any decision to place stents, participants
      will be qualified for final enrollment in the study and will be randomized 1:1 and treated
      with the investigational drug or placebo. Any stents will be placed only after randomization,
      assignment, and adventitial drug therapy, although any stenting decisions (other than for
      treatment of AEs) must be made prior to randomization and adventitial drug delivery in order
      to avoid bias toward or against stenting.
