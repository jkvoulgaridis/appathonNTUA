  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of Albumin in prevention and Treatment of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in patients with
      Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) who are at high risk of AKI development has been
      clearly defined , which decreases the morbidity and mortality. But the role of Albumin in
      patient with SBP who are at low risk of AKI development (Serum Bilirubin &lt;4mg/dl, Creatinine
      &lt;1mg/dl at the time of presentation) has been controversial and there are no placebo
      controlled trials. We propose that Albumin at the standard doses is beneficial in preventing
      development of AKI in patients with SBP who are at low risk of AKI development.

      1. Aim- To compare the efficacy of albumin when compared to placebo in the development or
           progression of AKI in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis who
           are at low risk for AKI development (i.e Serum Bilirubin &lt;4 mg/dL and serum creatinine &lt;
           1 mg/dl at presentation)

             -  Primary objective: To evaluate the Proportion of patients developing AKI by day 7

             -  Secondary objectives:

             -  To compare the resolution of SBP by day 2 and day 5 in both the groups

             -  To measure the Changes in PRA, TNF-α, IL-6 at day 7

             -  To measure the Changes in renal resistive index at day 7

             -  To compare Mortality by day 7 and 28 in both the groups

        2. Methodology:

             1. Dose and duration of albumin/placebo infusion in both the limbs: -The dose of
                albumin was 1.5 g/kg of body weight given within 6 h of SBP being diagnosed over a
                period of 12hrs, followed by an additional infusion of 1.0 g/kg on day 3 over a
                period of 12 hrs. Other arm receives a similar quantity of isotonic fluid like
                normal saline or plasmalyte

             2. Renal resistive index will be done with the help of a) high frequency probe(5Mhz)
                together with the use of color or power Doppler to help vessel localization.,
                sampling for RRI should be done at the level of the arcuate or interlobar arteries,
                adjacent to medullary pyramids. Measurements will be repeated in different parts of
                both organs (superior, median, and lower) when at least three reproducible
                waveforms have been obtained. An RRI will be calculated with the following formula:
                (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity, and the
                mean value of three measurements at each kidney will be considered. An RRI value
                0.60 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD) is usually taken as normal with a value of 0.70 being
                considered the upper normal threshold by most authors. In order to maximize
                waveform size, care will be taken in using the lowest pulse repetition frequency
                without aliasing, the highest possible gain without noise and the lowest wall
                filter. Patient will undergo RRI on day 0 and day 7.

             3. PRA, TNF-A and IL-6: - Measurement at day 0 and day 7 PRA is measured by generating
                AngI (angiotensin I) from endogenous angiotensinogen, followed by measurement by
                RIA of the generated AngI. Although PRA measurement is convenient for estimating
                the biological activity of the renin system, it may not necessarily reflect the
                real concentration of active renin. Il-6 is measured with the help of IL-6 ELISA
                kits. TNF- alpha is measured using flow cytometry.

             4. Antibiotics to be used in the SBP: - The gold standard treatment consists of
                third-generation cephalosporins, especially cefotaxime/ceftriaxone, given
                intravenously at a dose of 4-8 g/d for a minimum duration of 5 d. (AASLD
                guidelines). If patient does not respond then switch over to carbapenem (meropenem)
                with or without tigecycline. if patient still does not respond then GM-CSF will be
                given.

             5. Blood samples and Ascitic fluid samples will be collected and stored for
                measurement of Neutrophilic activity (CD66+/CD66-, CD11b) and Macrophage activity
                (CD 14+, CD 16+, IL-6, TNF-α)

             6. Serum Cystatin C and Urinary NGAL, markers and predictors of renal injury will be
                measured in both the limbs.

                Management of the complications: -

                  -  The patients who develop sepsis (presence of SIRS; positive blood cultures);
                     worsening of hepatic encephalopathy &gt;2 grades, variceal bleed or deterioration
                     of the clinical condition; worsening of AKI and volume overload will be
                     managed according to standard protocols,

                  -  Definitions: -

                  -  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: - SBP was diagnosed when the ascitic fluid
                     polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count was &gt; 250 cells/mm3.

                  -  Resolution of Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: - A repeat diagnostic
                     paracentesis to document the response by a greater-than 25% decrease in
                     ascitic fluid neutrophil count at 48 h after initiation of antibiotics is
                     recommended

                Study population: Patients with Cirrhosis of Liver who presents with Spontaneous
                Bacterial Peritonitis with baseline creatinine &lt;1mg/dl and Serum Bilirubin &lt;4mg/dl
