  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers that provide an early indicator of kidney stress could be useful in clinical
      practice to detect silent episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) or for early identification
      of subjects at risk of AKI. Two urinary biomarkers have been identified as early indicators
      of AKI. The NephroCheck® test is a commercially available test that uses these biomarkers,
      and this study assesses the use of these in reducing negative clinical outcomes for patients
      with sepsis-associated AKI. The study will enroll subjects diagnosed with sepsis, including
      septic shock, who will be randomly assigned to either receive NephroCheck®-guided
      kidney-sparing and fast-tracking interventions; or to receive current Standard of Care
      assessment and treatment.

          -  Terminally ill (defined as expectation of death within 6 months), has a do not

          -  Subjects already included in an observational study can be co-enrolled in LAPIS.
             Subjects already included in an interventional study may be enrolled with pre-approval
             of the sponsor according to the following rules:

               1. Co-enrollment in LAPIS will not be allowed with investigational drug and device
                  studies;

               2. Studies may be allowed if AKI or kidney function is not an endpoint with
                  pre-approval of the LAPIS sponsor;

               3. Co-enrollment in LAPIS will not be allowed if co-enrollment is an exclusion
                  criterion in the other study.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
