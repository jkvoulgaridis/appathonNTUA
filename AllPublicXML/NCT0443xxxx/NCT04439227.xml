    <textblock>
      This phase II MATCH treatment trial identifiesay block the protein tyrosine kinase WEE1 the
      effects of AZD1775 in patients whose cancer has a genetic change called BRCA mutation.
      AZD1775 may block a protein called WEE1, which may be needed for growth of cancer cells that
      express BRCA mutations. Researchers hope to learn if AZD1775 will shrink this type of cancer
      or stop its growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple
      myeloma.

      II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. III. To identify potential
      predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or
      resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and
      imaging-based assessment platforms.

      IV. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes
      from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free
      survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and
      targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive adavosertib (AZD1775) orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12 of
      each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months if less than 2
      years from study entry, and then every 6 months for an additional year from study entry.

    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor assessments occurred at baseline, then every 3 cycles until disease progression, up to 3 years post registration</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial response to treatment among eligible and treated patients. Objective response rate is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, the Cheson (2014) criteria for lymphoma patients, and the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for glioblastoma patients. For each treatment arm, 90% two-sided binomial exact confidence interval will be calculated for ORR.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 3 months for =&lt; 2 years and every 6 months for year 3</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as time from treatment start date to date of death from any cause. Patients alive at the time of analysis are censored at last contact date. OS will be evaluated specifically for each drug (or step) using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, then every 3 cycles until disease progression, up to 3 years post registration</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as time from treatment start date to date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have met applicable eligibility criteria in the Master MATCH Protocol
             prior to registration to treatment subprotocol

          -  Patients must have mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene in the tumor, or another
             aberration, as determined via the MATCH Master Protocol. Patients with tumor carrying
             mutations defined as variants of uncertain significance will not qualify

          -  Patients with ovarian cancer or HER2 negative, metastatic breast cancer must have
             received a PARP inhibitor as part of or as one of their prior lines of therapy

          -  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 8 weeks prior to treatment
             assignment and must have no clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction
             or morphology of resting ECG (e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree
             heart block)

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP3A4, or CYP3A4 substrates need to be reviewed by the study investigator.
