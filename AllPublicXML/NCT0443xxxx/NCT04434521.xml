  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combatant is likely to carry out missions any time, any place, day or night. The very
      strong degradation of natural vision performance in these conditions justifies the use of
      visual replacement means, based on optronic sensors whose sensitivity is more adapted to
      these luminous environments than that of the human eye.

      The duration and repetition of missions carried out with night vision sensors lead to visual
      complaints from users.

      The literature on night vision binoculars adjustment states that a binocular adjustment of
      the equipment provides more convex settings. The latter would then limit the strain on the
      accommodative component, which is one of the possible sources of operator visual fatigue. In
      order to allow a more appropriate adjustment, it is proposed to rely on a measurement of the
      refraction (optical defect of the eye) of each operator. Like binocular adjustments,
      binocular refractive methods would limit accommodative stimulation and thus visual fatigue.
      However, these methods are little used in favour of conventional methods. It is therefore
      necessary to evaluate the interest of binocular refraction for the adjustment of night vision
      binoculars.

      The purpose of this study is to compare refraction measurements by procedure in adult
      subjects free of ophthalmological disorders.
