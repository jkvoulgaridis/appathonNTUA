  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As an ancient, popular Chinese exercise, Baduanjin is characterized by symmetrical posture,
      deep breathing and meditation and easy to learn. Previous studies showed immediate effect of
      Baduanjin on cognition in patients with schizophrenia.The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the immediate effect and chronic effect of Baduanjin exercise on physical
      fitness, cognition and daily functions in middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia.

      A single-blind, 2-arm randomized controlled trial investigating the benefits of Baduanjin
      exercise on middle-aged and older patients with schizophrenia. A total of 36 participants
      will be assigned to either 12 weeks of 60-minute two sessions per week Baduanjin exercise
      group or a treatment as usual group. Primary outcomes are physical fitness and cognition
      functions. Secondary outcomes are dual task performance and daily functions. Evaluation will
      be completed at baseline, immediately after treatment and 4-week follow up.
