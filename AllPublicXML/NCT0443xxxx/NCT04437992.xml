  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is promoted by the Emilia Romagna Region which identified in the Bologna AUSL the
      coordinating center (Unit√† Operativa Complessa Laboratorio Unico Metropolitano, LUM, Maggiore
      Hospital). The medical genetics centers, participating in the technical-scientific
      coordination group of assessment (resolution No. 1894, 4/11/2019), the family counseling
      centers and the region prenatal hospital clinics are involved as collaborative experimental
      centers.

      Currently, 14,400 combined tests are carried out in the Emilia Romagna Region every year.

      As a result offering the new non-invasive NIPT test, it is estimated that the number of
      participants in the screening program will increase by up to 20,000/year.

      The study will collect data on the women who will access the combined test in the first 9
      months of the protocol and join the enrollment.
