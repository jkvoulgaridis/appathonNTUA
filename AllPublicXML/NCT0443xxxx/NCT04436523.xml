  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate post-operative outcomes after meniscus surgery in
      participants undergoing blood flow restriction training as a rehabilitative adjunct compared
      to those with standard rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a double-blinded, single-institution, randomized controlled
      trial to compare patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscus repair with post-operative
      rehabilitation protocol as (1) a standard-of-care rehabilitative protocol with a
      non-occlusive blood pressure cuff (inflated to 20-30 mm Hg) applied to the operative
      extremity versus (2) blood flow restriction training with cuff occlusion applied to the
      operative extremity. Patients will be enrolled prospectively and pre-operatively at their
      initial clinic visit after meniscus injury.

      Rehabilitative exercises would be advanced per the physical therapists' discretion with
      similar exercises for patients in both groups for direct comparison. These exercises are part
      of an already-established post-operative protocol that is in place, with the only difference
      being the addition of the blood flow restriction protocol in the intervention group. All
      patients would undergo their supervised post-operative rehabilitation at our institution.
