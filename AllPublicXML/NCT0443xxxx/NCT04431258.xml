    <textblock>
      Phase I: This is an open label Phase I to determine the RP2D of ABTL0812 in combination with
      FOLFIRINOX. All patients will receive ABTL0812 in combination with FOLFIRINOX.

      A dose de-escalation phase will be performed in which up to 3 different ABTL0812 dose levels
      will be tested in combination with FOLFIRINOX. ABTL0812 doses are: 1300 mg tid (starting
      dose), followed (if necessary) by 975 mg tid and 650 mg tid. Patient intra-escalation is not
      allowed.

      Phase II: This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II multicenter study
      to evaluate ABTL0812 in combination with FOLFIRINOX for first-line treatment of metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: arm A) receiving
      ABTL0812 in addition to FOLFIRINOX and arm B) receiving FOLFIRINOX plus placebo.

      Arm A) ABTL0812 + FOLFIRINOX Arm B) PLACEBO + FOLFIRINOX

    <description>FOLFIRINOX will be dosed according to the standard following regimen:
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, administered as 2-hour iv infusion, followed by
irinotecan 180 mg/m2, administered as 1.5-hour iv infusion, followed by
fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2, administered as 46-hour iv infusion every 2 weeks (=1 cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.
ABTL0812 will be administered daily at its RP2D. ABTL0812 will be administered as single agent during a run-in period of one week before starting the first cycle of FOLFIRINOX, then daily during chemotherapy cycles. Also, ABTL0812 will be maintained once chemotherapy is discontinued, if ABTL0812 is tolerated and if the patient is in response or stable disease.</description>
