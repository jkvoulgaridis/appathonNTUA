  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of sudden death in Europe and the
      United States. Mortality is currently close to 40% among those patients who had been
      successfully resuscitated after OHCA associated with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless
      ventricular tachycardia . Coronary artery disease is observed in up to 70% of patients with
      OHCA and immediate coronary angiography . Current European and American guidelines recommend
      immediate coronary angiography with primary angioplasty in OHCA patients with ST-segment
      elevation on ECG after successful resuscitation . Furthermore, the identification of the
      culprit lesion by coronary angiography among patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
      and no OHCA is challenging. In a recent cardiac magnetic resonance study, Heitner et al.
      found that in almost half of the patients with non-ST segment elevation ACS, the culprit
      lesion was not properly detected or identified by coronary angiography. In the Coronary
      Angiography after cardiac arrest (COACT) trial, a randomized controlled trial comparing
      immediate versus delayed coronary angiography after OHCA in patients without ST segment
      elevation on ECG, some degree of coronary artery disease was found in 64.5% of the patients
      in the immediate angiography group and an unstable coronary lesion was identified in only
      13.6% of the patients. However, in survivors of OHCA without ST segment elevation on ECG, the
      use of intra coronary optical computerized tomography (OCT) led to identification of plaque
      rupture (27%), plaque erosion (36%) and coronary thrombosis (59%) undetected on angiography.
      There is hence a clear need to improve causality diagnosis among patients resuscitated after
      OHCA and without ST segment elevation on ECG, and, in the case of coronary artery disease
      detection, to better identify the culprit vessel/lesion ultimately leading to a targeted
      treatment. These are the reasons why we have designed a prospective, multi-centre, single
      cohort, diagnostic accuracy study: to better explore the incidence of a true ACS among OHCA
      survivors and to evaluate the accuracy of angiography to detect the culprit lesion when
      compared to OCT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of misclassification of at least one unstable coronary artery lesion per patient, between core lab angiography and core lab OCT assessments.</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra operative, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The core lab OCT analysis is considered as the gold standard for unstable coronary lesion detection.
Detection of unstable coronary lesion by OCT includes atherosclerosis plaque rupture/erosion and thrombosis, calcified noduli with apposed thrombus, and spontaneous coronary dissection.
Angiographically, unstable coronary lesions are defined as coronary lesions with at least &gt;50% stenosis and the presence of characteristics of plaque disruption, including irregularity, dissection, haziness, or thrombus.
A misclassification is either an unstable lesion detected by core lab OCT and misdiagnosed or undiagnosed on core lab angiography, or an unstable lesion as defined on core lab angiography but without plaque rupture/erosion and thrombosis, calcified noduli with apposed thrombus, and spontaneous coronary dissection on core lab OCT.</description>

    <description>This endpoint represents a comparison between the management of the culprit lesion identified by the investigator after coronary angiography (and strictly captured in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) before OCT) and management of the culprit lesion as identified after OCT. Change in interventional management will include patients in whom an initially planned PCI was hold off after OCT and, vice versa, those declined a PCI in whom a PCI was finally decided after OCT. A patient for whom angiography and OCT-based diagnosis would lead to PCI of an additional but distinct coronary segment within the same vessel will be considered as a change in PCI plan.</description>

    <description>OCT (DragonFly, Abbott Vascular) will be performed after angiography. OCT images will be acquired using the 6F guide catheter compatible DragonFly System (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, USA). The catheter will be introduced into the first coronary artery via a standard 0.014-inch angioplasty wire, after prior injection of an intracoronary bolus of nitro-glycerine (according to the hemodynamic conditions of the patient). To remove all blood adequately from the imaging site, nonocclusive flushing will be performed using continuously inject via an automated power injector, and the OCT catheter will be pulled back at a speed of 18 mm/second to guarantee sufficient time to acquire images of a 54 mm long segment (frame density: 10 frames/mm).</description>

    <description>Based on coronary angiography and OCT analyses by the investigators, PCI will be performed, preferentially for the identified culprit lesion(s) only. The guiding catheters, guidewires, pre-dilatation, atherectomy devices, and post dilatation are left to physician discretion. The use of semi- or non-compliant balloons number and diameter of drug eluting stent(s) will also be left to the physician discretion, but post dilation will be strongly recommended in case of PCI. OCT can eventually be performed after stent implantation to guide, post dilation strategy.</description>
