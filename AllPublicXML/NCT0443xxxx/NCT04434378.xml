  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of tamsulosin on the development of post-operative urinary
      retention (PUR) after elective laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). This will be
      accomplished by administering a pre-operative dose of tamsulosin. The primary outcome is the
      rate of urinary retention necessitating straight catheterization or insertion of foley
      catheter prior to discharge.

      Patients who are scheduled for elective laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair will be consented
      in the office by the attending physician. An order will be placed during surgery scheduling
      for tamsulosin with instruction to administer one dose in the preoperative holding area on
      the day of surgery. The Jewish hospital pharmacy will be responsible for providing
      randomization and placebo medications for double blinding effect. PUR will be tracked on the
      basis of urinary catheterization performed prior to hospital discharge. Criteria for
      catheterization include: i) Inability to urinate within 6 hours post-operatively, and bladder
      scan showing &gt;400 mL. ii) Inability to urinate at any time postoperatively with symptoms of
      urinary retention (i.e. urgency, bladder discomfort). Women of childbearing age will need to
      have a confirmed negative urine or serum pregnancy test prior to surgery. This will be
      completed on arrival to the preoperative holding area.

      To detect the difference between the treated group and control group with a significant alpha
      (0.5) and power (80%), at least 178 patients will be needed in each group. This was generated
      using the Pearson Chi-square test for Two proportions.

      This study will be conducted in the hospital setting at a single institution. Patients will
      be consented for the study in the pre-admission holding area and followed until discharged
      from the post anesthesia care unit.

    <description>Patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair will be assessed for postoperative urinary retention in the post anesthesia care unit. Postoperative urinary retention will be tracked on the basis of urinary catheterization performed prior to hospital discharge.

    <description>Retrospective chart review will be utilized to asses the incidence of risk factors of postoperative urinary retention in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Risk factors including age &gt;60, total IV fluids, length of procedure, opioid use, bilateral vs unilateral repair, BMI &gt;30, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia will be assessed. These risk factors will then undergo statistical analysis to determine if they are associated with postoperative urinary retention.</description>
