  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of AN0025 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with locally
      advanced/metastatic tumors. It will include a dose-limiting toxicity observation phase
      followed by an expansion phase. All enrolled patients will be treated with AN0025 and
      Pembrolizumab until the patient experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdraws consent, or for a maximum of 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). The dose of
      pembrolizumab will remain constant at 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for each dose level of
      AN0025 and in each cohort.
