  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of imaging agent 64Cu-SARTATE in
      participants with known or suspected Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) Neuroendocrine Tumors
      (NETs) as a potential new way to help diagnose NETs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 63 participants will be recruited in this study and who are confirmed or suspected
      to have NETs based on biochemical evidence or that of conventional anatomical or molecular
      imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent;

          2. Age at diagnosis ≥ 18 years;

          3. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks;

          4. Known diagnosis of GEP NET or suspicion of GEP NET based on axial imaging (e.g. on CT
             and/or MRI and/or FDG) and/or biochemical evidence of NET;

          5. Adequate recovery from acute toxic effects of any prior therapy;

          6. Adequate renal function (eGFR &gt;30 ml/min);

          7. Pre-study 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan performed within 4 weeks, but not closer than 6
             hours prior to the administration of 64Cu-SARTATE;

          8. A diagnostic CT scan and/or MRI scan skull to mid-thigh within 4 weeks prior to the
             administration of 64Cu-SARTATE is available.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to tolerate a
             PET/CT scan, as deemed by the investigator;

          2. Female participant who are pregnant or lactating;

          3. Male or female participant of childbearing potential not willing to practice an
             effective method of birth control while participating on the study to avoid possible
             damage to the foetus. Abstinence is considered acceptable;

          4. Participant has received any treatment for their NET in the interval between
             68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and 64Cu SARTATE PET/CT scan;

          5. Any serious medical condition or extenuating circumstance which the investigator
             believes may interfere with the procedures or evaluations of the study;

          6. History of other active malignancy within the last 2 years the exception of adequately
             treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or other non-melanomatous skin
             cancer, in-situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix, or prostate cancer that is controlled
             by hormone therapy (patients may continue hormone therapy while on study).
