      Comparision of Exposed Factors of Preoperative Hypertension and Intraoperative Controlled
      Hypotension on Postoperative Delirium in the Elderly under Radical Resection of Head, Neck
      and Maxillofacial Tumor

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium has a higher incidence in elderly patients after general
      anesthesia，and It is closely related to the type of surgery, the length of surgery, and the
      patient's physique.Because head and neck maxillofacial radical surgery requires free flap
      transplantation and longer duration,and hemorrhage is more when the primary focus is
      removed，Intraoperative blood pressure reduction is needed to reduce bleeding，therefore,
      hypoperfusion of craniocerebral blood flow will occur.Low cerebral perfusion is closely
      related to the occurrence of postoperative delirium.Patients undergoing this type of surgery
      have more preoperative complications，hypertension is particularly common.Therefore, this
      study mainly studied the correlation between the preoperative blood pressure level and the
      controlled hypotension level in patients with radical head and neck and maxillofacial tumors
      and the incidence of postoperative delirium.

        The subject was a patient undergoing radical surgery for general anesthesia for mandibular
        and facial malignant tumors. The patients who had just been admitted to the hospital were
        preoperatively visited 2-3 days before the operation. According to whether the patient had
        a history of hypertension and the blood pressure value in the calm state after three
        admissions, Patients were divided into hypertensive group and non-hypertensive group.
