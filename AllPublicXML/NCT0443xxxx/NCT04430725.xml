  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the outcomes and safety of two standard treatment options called
      microwave ablation and surgical wedge resection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,
      sarcoma and colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).
      Microwave ablation is designed to kill tumor cells by heating the tumor until the tumor cells
      die. A wedge resection is a procedure that involves the surgical removal of a small,
      wedge-shaped piece of lung tissue to remove a small tumor or to diagnose lung cancer.
      Comparing these two treatment options may help researchers learn which method works better
      for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic sarcoma, and metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate the 2-year local recurrence rate for microwave ablation within a basket.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for safety when compared to
      wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical
      patient population.

      II. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for efficacy when compared
      to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical
      patient population.

      III. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for changes in patient
      reported outcomes when compared to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database
      consisting of a commensurate surgical patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard care microwave ablation or wedge resection followed by
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Patients
      also complete questionnaires over 10-15 minutes at baseline up to 9 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to local recurrence per treated nodule</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years post-ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured from the first date of treatment and characterized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and/or biopsy. The local recurrence of each subtype will be adjusted according to the method proposed by Fine and Gray. Will evaluate each basket individually and allow patients to contribute multiple nodules. Therefore, the Bayesian piecewise constant frailty model will be used to account for interdependence in the failure duration of nodules arising from the same patient. Additional posterior summaries will be reported, such as median failure duration. Additionally, will report plots of the full time-to-failure distribution with pointwise 95% Bayesian credible intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of clinically significant adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of significant adverse events will be recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) published by the National Institutes of Health. Grade III or above adverse events within the following categories: cardiac disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, injury, poisoning and procedural complications, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. 30-day mortality will also be recorded. Patient adverse events will be tabulated by symptom grade and categories.</description>
