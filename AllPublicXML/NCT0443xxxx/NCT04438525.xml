  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insect venom allergy is the major cause for severe allergic reactions in Europe. Wasps and
      honeybees are responsible for the majority of these allergic reactions. Symptoms range from
      generalized skin symptoms (wheals, swellings) to respiratory or cardiovascular problems such
      as asthma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or cardiac arrest. The regular administration of
      insect venom ('venom immunotherapy') over up to 5 years is a well-established therapy,
      providing long-term protection from further systemic sting reactions in the majority of
      patients. However, there is no laboratory test which is able to identify patients who will
      still react to an insect sting. The only reliable method available is stinging patients with
      living insects ('sting challenges'). The key issue is that only few centers in Europe perform
      sting challenges and many patients have no access to these tests. Therefore, it is of utmost
      importance to find a method which is able to identify patients who are still at risk for
      future allergic sting reactions.

      The inhibition of the basophil activation test (BAT) could be a potential method to monitor
      the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Basophils are cells which are activated in acute allergic
      reactions. The basophil activation of blood donors with vespid venom allergy can be measured
      after adding sera from allergic patients undergoing immunotherapy. In a preliminary study we
      found that the activation of basophils could be inhibited in all patients treated with vespid
      venom, however, results must be confirmed in a larger study.

      In this study, a total of 219 patients with vespid venom allergy will be included. Those
      patients who are receiving or who have already finished venom immunotherapy will be sting
      challenged and blood samples will be taken to perform BAT inhibition experiments. At the same
      time, donors with confirmed vespid venom allergy, who have not undergone immunotherapy, will
      be recruited for a blood donation, which is necessary for the BAT inhibition tests.

      If results of the preliminary study could be confirmed, the BAT inhibition will facilitate
      monitoring the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy and patients would benefit from an early
      detection of lacking tolerance and consequently from the increased venom dose preventing
      future life threatening systemic sting reactions.

    <description>The primary endpoint for the study is the inhibition of the CD63 basophil response (BAT inhibition at a concentration of 11ng/ml) in vespid venom allergic patients. A minimum activation of 25% is required to see sufficient inhibition of basophil activity. Immunotherapy will be considered successful if the BAT inhibition (with added serum) is reduced by at least 80% compared to 'no serum'.</description>
