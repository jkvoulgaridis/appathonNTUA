  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to support the clinical development of acalabrutinib in
      patients who are unable to swallow capsule and require nasogastric (NG) tube placement.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, 3-period, crossover study of acalabrutinib
      suspension administered via NG tube in healthy subjects to evaluate the relative
      bioavailability and proton-pump inhibitor (rabeprazole) effect.

      The study is divided in 3 periods.

      Period 1 of the study is designed to investigate the effect of proton-pump inhibitor on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of acalabrutinib suspension. Period 2 and 3 of the study are designed
      to investigate the bioavailability of acalabrutinib suspension relative to an oral capsule
      formulation.

             ability to participate in the study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion

             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.

         10. History of a disorder which would make NG tube placement contraindicated, eg,
             esophageal strictures, esophageal varices, or bleeding diathesis.

         11. Evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (including upper
             respiratory tract infections). Subjects with localized cutaneous fungal infections are
