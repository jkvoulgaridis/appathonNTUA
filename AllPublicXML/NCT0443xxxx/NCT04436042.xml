  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to further develop and test the hardware and software components of
      the MyHand device based on user feedback and results from our pilot study. The goal is to
      refine the device so that is more effective and easier for stroke patients to use to increase
      their hand function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From previous experimentation with the MyHand device, the investigators have determined that
      the device can improve the grasping ability of stroke patients. The investigators now aim to
      make the controls more intuitive and accurate for the users, to enable subjects to grasp a
      wider array of objects, to make the donning and doffing of the device easier, and to continue
      to assess the MyHand as it helps subjects in functional tasks.

    <measure>Device Usability and Utility Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year at study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will provide feedback about their perceptions of the device's usability and utility for post-stroke upper extremity recovery. Four questions will be rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree. Five questions will be rated on a 5-point reverse Likert scale (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree.
The 9 question survey has a score range of 9-45 with higher scores indicating higher levels of device usability and utility.</description>
