  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm, Phase II study to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-9545 versus anastrozole (in the
      window-of-opportunity phase) and GDC-9545 plus palbociclib compared with anastrozole plus
      palbociclib (in the neoadjuvant phase) in postmenopausal women with untreated, estrogen
      receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative, early
      breast cancer.

      The study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, a window-of-opportunity phase for
      14 days, followed by a neoadjuvant treatment phase for 16 weeks (four 28-day cycles),
      surgery, and an end of study visit (28 days after the final dose of study treatment).
