  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to identify impaired cognitive control in opioid use
      disorder (OUD) and subsequently to examine the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) on reward processing, as measured by the reward positivity (an electrophysiological
      signal) in people with OUD. To this end, the investigators will adopt a randomized
      sham-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Ri-TMS on cognitive control in OUD.

      The investigators hypothesize that Ri-TMS will be successful in modulating the reward
      positivity in opioid users in the active TMS condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is primarily a randomized control-trial design, comparing the effects of placebo
      (sham) and active TMS stimulation on reward processing across two groups of participants -
      healthy controls and opioid users.

      Participants will be asked to engage in a virtual T-maze task, a reward-based choice task
      that elicits robust reward positivities. During this task participants will receive
      simultaneous EEG/TMS, while they engage in the virtual T-maze decision making task, used in
      our previous reward positivity studies on SUDs. ERPs will be recorded throughout the T-Maze
      task, and the reward positivity will be measured as the difference in maximum amplitude
      between reward and no-reward feedback conditions.

      The TMS coil will be positioned using a an Adept Viper s850 robotic arm (SmartMove, ANT
      Neuro, Enschede, The Netherlands), providing precise targeting of the predetermined left
      dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) coordinate (&lt; 10 mm from the scalp, orientated at a 45ยบ
      angle). Participants in the active TMS condition will receive rTMS pulses throughout the
      duration of the T-Maze task, with a maximum of 2000 pulses delivered to each participant.
      Identical parameters will be applied to the SHAM group with the exception that the TMS coil
      will be flipped 180ยบ to mimic auditory stimulation.

    <description>The reward positivity is an event-related brain potential, sensitive to reward feedback. The reward positivity will be measured during the t-maze task, where participants will receive feedback on choices (Reward, No-reward). Reward positivity amplitude will be determined by identifying the maximum absolute amplitude of the difference wave within a 200- to 400-ms window following feedback onset. The reward positivity will be evaluated along front-central electrodes (Fz, FCz, Cz).</description>

    <description>Sham TMS will be used to mimic the auditory sensation of the Active rTMS condition.
