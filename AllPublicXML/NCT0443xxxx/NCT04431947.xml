    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of the hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery systems on sleep
      in youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents. Activity watches, surveys and device
      downloads are used to evaluate sleep in these participants.

    <textblock>
      Sleep is important for everyone, including youth with type 1 diabetes. New technology has
      shown improvements in glycemic variability, especially overnight. This study evaluates the
      impact of advanced hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery systems on sleep for both youth with
      type 1 diabetes and their parents. Study measures include wearing an actigraphy watch and
      completing a sleep diary for 7 days and taking surveys on sleep and psychosocial measures.
      Study measures occur prior to starting the hybrid closed-loop system, immediately after
      starting the system and at 3 and 6 months after starting the system.
