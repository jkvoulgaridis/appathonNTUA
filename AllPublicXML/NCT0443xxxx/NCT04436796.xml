      The investigators aim to compare the efficacy and safety of an AID system using an adaptive
      MPC algorithm versus SAP (which may or may not include PLGS; to be referred to as SAP) in
      people with type 1 diabetes.

      A randomized crossover trial will compare the efficacy and safety of an automated insulin
      delivery (AID) study system using an adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm versus
      SAP (which may or may not include PLGS; to be referred to as SAP) therapy in people with type
      1 diabetes for 13 weeks in each arm of the study. A Pilot Phase using the study system for
      10-14 days will be conducted prior to the crossover trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis, based on investigator assessment, of type 1 diabetes for at least
             one year and using insulin for at least 1 year

          -  Using an insulin pump for at least 3 months (which may include use of automated
             features)

          -  Familiarity and use of a carbohydrate ratio for meal boluses

          -  Age ≥18.0 years old

          -  For females, not currently known to be pregnant. If female and sexually active, must
             agree to use a form of contraception to prevent pregnancy while a participant in the
             study. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test will be required for all females of
             child-bearing potential. Participants who become pregnant will be discontinued from
             the study. Also, participants who during the study develop and express the intention
             to become pregnant within the timespan of the study will be discontinued.

          -  If using a personal CGM, willingness to use a Dexcom G6 CGM and discontinue personal
             CGM use during the study

          -  Willing not to begin use of, or not to continue use of if currently using, a personal
             AID (closed loop control) system during the study; note if the system offers an
             open-loop mode or can be switched to a PLGS mode that is compatible with the Dexcom
             G6, the system may be used during the study in these modes only

          -  Willingness to switch to lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) if not using already,
             and to use no other insulin besides lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) during the
             study

          -  Willingness not to start any new non-insulin glucose-lowering agent during the course
             of the trial, and not to use Afrezza during the trial

          -  Investigator believes that the participant can successfully and safely operate all
             study devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of Afrezza or any non-insulin glucose-lowering agent other than metformin
             (including GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas) unless
             participant is willing to discontinue during the trial.

          -  Two or more episodes of DKA requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization in
             the past 6 months

          -  Two or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia with seizure or loss of consciousness in
             the last 6 months

          -  Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder

          -  A medical or other condition that in the opinion of the investigator could create a
             safety concern for the participant or put the study at risk. History of frequent
             severe hypoglycemia or history of frequent severe hyperglycemia and/or ketosis,
             without emergency room visit or hospitalization, due to poor diabetes self-management
             may be disqualifying per investigator judgment

          -  Participation in another pharmaceutical or device trial at the time of enrollment or
             during the study

    <ipd_description>NIH's Data Sharing Policy on sharing research resources for research purposes to the scientific community will be followed. Data will be stored in a Data Archive Database includes CGM-insulin delivery time series &amp; boluses, will be deidentified &amp; retrievable only by subject ID number. Individual patterns of demographic &amp; insulin treatment parameters leave open a remote possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, data will be made available only under a Data-Sharing Agreement that includes: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes &amp; not to identify participants; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; &amp; (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
