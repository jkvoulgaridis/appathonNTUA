  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 50%) and are accompanied by dyslipidemia
      (LDL ≥ 100 mg / dl) will be enrolled.

      Only patients who do not meet the exclusion criteria should be enrolled in the study.

      Once the patient is selected, the patient is informed of the study and receives the consent
      form.

      Patients who are eligible for all of the criteria and who do not qualify as exclusion
      criteria should be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned in a 1: 1 dose of
      rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10mg once daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily. Patients who
      previously used statins have a wash-out period of 4 weeks or more.

      Patients will visit outpatient clinic at 12 weeks and 24 weeks after initiation of treatment.
      Physical examination, blood test, and 6 minute working test will be performed. For fasting
      blood tests, patients visit on an empty stomach. Drug adverse events and changes in vital
      signs or body weight will be checked.

      After 48 weeks of treatment, the patients will visit outpatient clinic for efficacy
      evaluation; physical examination, blood test, transthoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary
      exercise test, central blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity. Drug adverse events and
      medication compliance will be checked.

      The primary endpoint is change of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and secondary endpoint
      is improvement of diastolic dysfunction, VAC index, peak VO2, distance of 6 minute working
      test, and clinical outcomes including death, readmission rate.
