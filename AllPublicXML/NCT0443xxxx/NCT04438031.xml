  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the implementation and impact of a new,
      community-wide prevention program, &quot;Navigation&quot;, on maternal and infant health and
      well-being. This program recruits mothers at the OB/GYN (prenatally) or pediatrician's office
      (at 12, 24, and 36 months old), provides up to three visits to assess family needs,
      establishes connections between the family and primary health care or other community
      providers, and then follows up one month later to confirm these referrals.

    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the rate of enrollment in the Navigation program.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants in the Navigation group who agree to schedule a Navigation visit, which will be collected from enrollment logs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the rate of completion of the Navigation program.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be collected from case report forms completed by the navigators (i.e., whether they completed the Navigation visit with the participant).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the fidelity of implementation of the Navigation manual by Navigators.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>For 10-20% of the Navigation visits, a second Navigator will accompany and observe the primary Navigator. The second Navigator will check using a list of program elements from the program manual to assess whether the primary Navigator adheres to each program element. In addition, the second Navigator will score the family on each of the Navigation domains. Fidelity of implementation will be measure by the percent adherence to the program manual and the inter-rater reliability on the domain scores using Cohen's kappa statistic.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the proportion of families receiving screening scores that indicate risk for negative child and/or family outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be collected from case report forms completed by the Navigators. For each intervention domain of interest, Navigators will rate family needs on a 1-4 scale with scores of 3 and 4 indicating a need for referral to community resources. This outcome will be measured as the proportion of families receiving at least one score of 3 or 4.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the proportion of families referred to community resources.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be collected from case report forms completed by the Navigators. On the CRFs, Navigators will indicate any community resources to which they refer families. This outcome will be measured as the proportion of families that are referred to one or more community resources by the Navigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the proportion of families that initiate community services.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be collected from case report forms completed by the Navigators. On the CRFs, Navigators will indicate whether families initiated participation in the community services to which they were referred, if any. This outcome will be measured as the proportion of families referred to community services that initiate participation in at lease one community service.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the implementation by the families' satisfaction with the Navigation program.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured via participant self-reports as the percentage of families that rate themselves as satisfied or very satisfied with their Navigation experience and the percentage of families that would recommend the program to other families.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of the Navigation program by reviewing child maltreatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured through Child Protective Services records via a comparison of the Navigation group and control group in their likelihood of having a substantiated or &quot;services needed&quot; case of maltreatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of the Navigation program by reviewing maternal health.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of the Navigation program by reviewing parent and parent-child relationshups.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured from participant self-reports via a comparison of Navigation and control groups' mean scores on ratings of their knowledge of child development, parenting self-efficacy, parenting stress, parent discipline behavior, and parent attributions of child behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of the Navigation program by reviewing family service receipt and children's connection to medical home.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Family services receipt will be measured from parent reports via a comparison of the Navigation and control groups' mean number of community services they have accessed since receiving Navigation/the control intervention. Connection to a medical home will be measured from parent report via a comparison of the Navigation and control groups' likelihood of having a primary care physician for their child.</description>

    <description>This program recruits mothers in OB/GYN (prenatal) offices, provides up to three Navigation visits, establishes connections between the family and primary health care or other community providers, and then follows up one month later to confirm these referrals. Navigators will assess and support family needs across multiple developmentally-appropriate domains at each age. Prenatally, the domains include support for (1) health and access to healthcare, (2) adjustments to pregnancy, (3) household and material needs, and (4) family safety. At 12, 24, and 36 months, the domains include support for (1) child basic needs, (2) parenting and child behavior, (3) child health and development, and (4) parent health and well-being.</description>
