  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence suggesting that Aloe vera and Crocus (saffron) may have a
      positive impact on conditions involving cognitive deficits, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment
      (MCI) and AD. More specifically, aloe vera gel contains powerful antioxidants, which belong
      to a large family of substances known as polyphenols. Aloe has also been proven to possess
      cholinergic and cognitive enhancing capabilities. Crocus is deeper studied and it shows
      promising results in neuroprotection against AD through various suggested mechanisms, such as
      the enhancement of amyloid-beta clearance in the brain and the inhibition of neurofibrillary
      tangles formation. For this reason, it would be interesting to study the effects of
      combination of Aloe Vera and Crocus . The aim of the study is to evaluate the beneficial
      effect of Aloe Vera and Crocus (saffron) in comparison with Aloe (simple)on patients
      diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment MCI.

      OBJECTIVES OF THE TRIAL

      The objectives of this study are:

      To investigate the efficacy of Aloe Vera and Crocus as a disease course modifying treatment
      for MCI in a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled study.

      To investigate the effects in objective measurements in patients with MCI.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a Greek, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study group of
      compared Aloe Vera and Crocus with placebo. Qualifying patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive 45 mL of Aloe Vera and Crocus or placebo (ALOE) or mediterranean dietary protocol on
      a daily basis for 24 months. Patients undergo assessments at baseline,12 and 24 months +/- 7
      days after beginning of the treatment.

      Duration The total study duration will be 36 months. Patients will receive study medication
      for 24 months.The recruitment will be about 6 months and the statistics and the preparation
      of the paper other 6 months.

      Number of Subjects One hundred fifty (150) subjects total will be enrolled. ; Fifty (50) in
      the experimental group (Aloe Vera with Crocus); Fifty (50) in the Control Group 1(Aloe) and
      fifty (50) in control Group 2(same dietary habits-mediterranean dietary protocol).

      Patient Eligibility Screening Form (ESF)

      An eligibility form documenting the patient's fulfilment of the entry criteria will be
      completed by the assessor. The following information will be included in the ESF:

      Patient identification: Initials (First initial of first name and First initial of surname),
      date of birth and Patient Identification Number.

      Eligibility Screening; Checklist of inclusion and exclusion criteria Eligibility Statement;
      for patients found to be ineligible, the reason for ineligibility must be stated Written
      informed consent will be obtained from the subject . The informed consent form must be
      co-signed by the physician. The nature of the study and the potential risks associated with
      the trial will be explained to all subject candidates and their responsible informants.

      Signature and date: the ESF may be completed by an assessor but it is required that the
      principal investigator/study clinician sign and date the ESF to verify eligibility of the
      patient for inclusion.
