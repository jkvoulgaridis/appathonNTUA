      This is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, open-label, single arm study in which
      we will gather data and physician input for the assessment and further development of the
      KODEX - EPD functions for assessing tissue pressure, tissue thickness, lesion transmurality.

      This is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, open-label, single arm study in which
      we will gather data and physician input for the assessment and further development of the
      KODEX - EPD functions for assessing tissue pressure, tissue thickness, lesion transmurality.
      The study will include up to 30 subjects. We will enroll patients with atrial flutter and
      patients with atrial fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo RF ablation of the
      cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI). Both male and female subjects who meet all eligibility criteria
      and give written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. We will be assessing the
      feasibility of the KODEX-EPD tissue pressure (TP), tissue thickness and lesion transmurality
      applications.

    <description>• will be evaluated based on comparison with qualitative assessment of catheter contact by the physician during the procedure.

    <description>thickness values will be evaluated by checking whether they are in the range of what can be expected based on feedback from the physician upon review after the treatment (measured in mm)
reproducibility of thickness assessment with KODEX-EPD will be calculated from repeat assessments of the same line (measured in mm)
relative thickness values will be compared against relative thickness values measured with ICE (measured in mm)
relative thickness values will be compared against relative thickness values derived from pre-procedural CT (measured in mm)</description>

             index procedure.

          2. Subject is enrolled in another drug or device study protocol that has not reached its
