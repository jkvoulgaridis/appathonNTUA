      he objective of this study is to examine the influence of additional axial load abd body
      position on cervical motor control in young healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor control of the cervical spine is impotent for responsible for maintaining balance
      during daily living activities and to withstand external loads. Stabilization-aspects of the
      cervical spine is very complex, passive (ligaments, joint capsule and the skin and active
      (muscles), and neurological subsystems are involved. Mostly proprioceptive testing and
      exercises like head and neck position sense testing and re-training have been an integral
      part of rehabilitation. Another method to evaluate spinal motor control is the assessment of
      spinal stiffness. The main objective of this study is to explore the effects of additional
      axial loading on motion control in healthy individuals. Does the motor control of the
      cervical spine in healthy subjects change with additional axial load or body position? A
      better understanding of spinal stiffness and neck position sense leads to novel insights into
      spinal cervical stabilization mechanisms.

    <description>The device measures tissue compliance according to the concept of impulse-response. A force of exact 20 Newton will be applied from the device to the process spinous. The expected impulse-response (result) will be between 20 Newton and 40 Newton. The change of spinal stiffness due sitting position and loading will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain during measuring</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale will be used to quantify pain, if any of the measurements is painful. The participant is asked to rate his pain intensity on a straight line (100mm) with two endpoints.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-administered neck mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered neck mobility questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire that uses visual analog scales to measure pain-free active rage of motion for all neck movements. The patient is asked to place a mark on a 100 mm line (0 mm = &quot;no movement possible&quot; and 100 mm = &quot;as far as possible&quot;). The total score is the sum of the individual scores (min. score (600) = no restrictions and max. score (0) = total restriction)</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index is a self-report questionnaire with 10-items: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, work, headaches, concentration, sleeping, driving, reading, and recreation. The response to each item is rated on a 6-point scale from 0 (no disability) to 5 (complete disability). The numeric responses for each item are summed for a total score ranging between 0 and 50.</description>

    <description>The participant is asked to move the head in 6 directions in a sitting position and 30° leaning backward sitting position; lateral flexion (left / right), flexion, extension, and rotation (left / right). Results are to be taken for each direction and random at each axial load-level (0 kg, 1kg, 2 kg, and 3 kg). In total 24 measurements.
The duration of all measurement will be 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>The participant is asked to move the head in 4 directions; flexion, extension, and rotation (left / right). Joint-Position Error measurements will be executed in neutral sitting position. Additionally, stiffness will be measured in neutral sitting position and neutral sitting position with 45° cervical flexion. All measurements will be performed with 0 kg and 3 kg axal loading. In total 18 measurements.The duration of all measurement will be 60 minutes.</description>
