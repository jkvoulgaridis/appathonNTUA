    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), defined as infusion of feces from healthy donors to
      affected subjects, is a method to restore a balanced gut microbiota and has attracted great
      interest in recent years due to its efficacy and ease of use.

      FMT is now recommended as the most effective therapy for CDI not responding to standard
      therapies1.Recent studies have suggested that dysbiosis is associated with a variety of
      disorders, and that FMT could be a useful treatment. Randomized controlled trial has been
      conducted in a number of disorders including ulcerative colitis (UC). Our study is aims to
      Fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, the role of
      selection of the Dai ethnic group as donor source in terms of treatment efficacy and
      pathogenic mechanisms.

             week so that subjects would be steroid-free by week 8.

        Prohibited medications:

        The following drugs for are prohibited for the noted time:

          -  Rectal therapies including corticosteroid, 5-aminosalicylate (for 2 weeks before first

          -  Antibiotics, antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, probiotic or prebiotic preparations
             (for 4 weeks before first FMT and during study period)

          -  Rectal therapies including corticosteroid, 5-aminosalicylate (for 2 weeks before first
             FMT and during study period)

          -  Biological therapies or calcineurin inhibitors (for 12 weeks before first FMT and
