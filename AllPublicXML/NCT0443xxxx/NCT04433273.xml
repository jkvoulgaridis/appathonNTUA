  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vestibular system which is responsible for balance and equilibrium constitutes our sixth
      sense. Metabolic Syndrome is a constellation of metabolic abnormalities characterized by
      obesity, insulin resistance (diabetes mellitus), hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It is
      generally agreed that a combination of three or more of the following components must be
      present: large waist circumference, elevated triglyceride, decreased high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL) cholesterol raised blood pressure, and elevated fasting blood sugar (FBS). Sirtuin 1
      (SIRT1) is one of seven mammalian orthologs of the yeast protein silent information
      regulator. It is a conserved NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that decreases in cells that
      have high insulin resistance. In vivo, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were
      associated with low SIRT1 gene and protein expression. SIRT1 plays an important role to
      stimulate AMPK in improving mitochondrial function both in-vitro and in-vivo. Adenosine
      5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key factor in regulating energy
      metabolism, placing it at the center stage in studies of diabetes and related metabolic
      disorders like metabolic syndrome. It was reported that over a period of 6 weeks regular
      vestibular rehabilitation exercises caused an increase in the expression of SIRT1. The sleep
      inducing effects of vestibular stimulation is well known. Earlier studies reported
      improvement in the scores of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS) followed by the vestibular stimulation. Hence, we hypothesize that vestibular
      stimulation will lead to up-regulation of both SIRT1 and AMPK.

    <ipd_description>Data will be transferred in an encrypted PDF format. Trial staff will be given direction on how to share the trial data and given access to one specific section of a controlled cloud service which is controlled via role based access. Once they have authenticated with the service and the service verifies that they have the correct role to access the system they will be directed to a single webpage within the application where they will be able to upload the encrypted PDF. This PDF is generated on the fly and is therefore not stored in another location that could become compromised. Generating the PDF on the fly means that the source data is extracted from the database, processed and delivered in the context of a single request. These data will be transferred for each subject when they complete participation in the study.</ipd_description>
