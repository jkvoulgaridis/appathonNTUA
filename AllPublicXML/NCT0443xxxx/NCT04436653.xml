  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LuX-Valve transcatheter tricuspid
      valve and delivery system which are intended to use in symptomatic patients with severe
      tricuspid regurgitation and high surgical risk.

    <textblock>
      The TRAVEL study is a prospective multi-center single-arm trial for transcatheter tricuspid
      valve replacement with LuX-Valve. A series of physical, imaging and laboratory exams will be
      performed to determine whether a subject has severe tricuspid regurgitation with high
      surgical risk. Subjects who meet the criteria will then receive LuX-Valve implantation if an
      informed consent is obtained.

             excursion (TAPSE) &lt; 10mm or right ventricle fractional area change (FAC) &lt; 20%).

          5. Subjects with aortic stenosis (mean ΔP≥ 40mmHg or aortic valve area ≤ 1 cm2), aortic
             regurgitation (≥ 3+), mitral stenosis (mitral valve area ≤1.5 cm2) or mitral
             regurgitation (≥ 3+).

          6. Subjects with active endocarditis or other infectious diseases.

          7. Subjects with untreated severe coronary artery disease.

          8. Subjects with percutaneous coronary intervention, cerebrovascular accident or surgical
             intervention within 3 months of the date of the procedure.

          9. Subjects with coagulation disorders.
