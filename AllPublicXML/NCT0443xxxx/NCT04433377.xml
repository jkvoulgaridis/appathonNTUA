  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiplegic shoulder pain is the most common poststroke painful condition. Hemiplegic shoulder
      pain reduces range of motion (ROM) and hand function, resulting in limited daily life
      activity and decreased quality of life.

      In the literature, the effectiveness of suprascapular nerve block and subacromial injection
      in hemiplegia patients with shoulder pain has been previously evaluated, but these injection
      treatments have not been compared.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of suprascapular nerve block
      and subacromial injection on pain, shoulder (ROM), function and quality of life in hemiplegia
      patients with shoulder pain.

      Patients will be randomly assigned Subacromial injection group or Suprascapular nerve block
      group

      In the suprascapular nerve block group, suprascapular nerve block will be performed with a
      MyLab60 model a high resolution 7-12-MHz linear probe ultrasonography device. After the
      suprascapular fossa will be observed by ultrasonography, a betamethasone dipropionate plus
      betamethasone sodium phosphate solution (6.43 mg / mL + 2.63 mg / mL; 1 mL), 0.5 %
      bupivacaine (2 mL) and physiological serum (2 mL) will be injected with an in-plane technique
      using a 22 gauge 90-mm injector.

      In the subacromial injection group, subacromial injection will be performed with a MyLab60
      model a high resolution 7-12-MHz linear probe ultrasonography device. After the subacromial
      bursa will be observed by ultrasonography, a betamethasone dipropionate plus betamethasone
      sodium phosphate solution (6.43 mg/mL + 2.63 mg/mL; 1 mL), 2% lidocaine (2 mL) and
      physiological serum (2 mL) will be injected with an in-plane technique using a 21 gauge 38-mm
      injector.

      A home exercise program will be given both groups. The exercise program consisted of passive
      and active-assistive ROM exercises (3 sets daily, 20 times in each set).

    <description>Self-reported neck pain intensity will be evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients will be asked about the average pain intensity that they had felt in the past week (&quot;0&quot; defines &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; defines &quot;unbearable pain'').</description>

    <description>Functional independence measure (FIM) will be used to evaluate independence for the activities of daily living. It was developed to measure the results of the rehabilitation on the patient. The higher scores in FIM are interpreted as better functional independence</description>
