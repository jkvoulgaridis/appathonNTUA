      the study aim to protect patients received anthracyclines containing chemotherapy from
      cardiotoxcity induced by anthracyclines derivatives. by using L-carnitine and Silymarin for
      protection the heart from anthracyclines toxicities, and in addition its a comparitive study
      between L-carnitine and Silymarin.

      Aim: Anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity is the most common constrains of its use in
      treatment of various types of cancer. This study aimed to investigate benefits from adding
      L-carnitine and Silymarin compared to anthracycline chemotherapy alone in patients with
      cancer.

      Methods: 83 patients were recruited from Clinical Oncology Department, Tanta University,
      Egypt, then prospectively randomized to receive their anthracycline containing therapeutic
      regimen, control group (n=33) or anthracycline plus L-carnitine, L-carnitine group (n=25), or
      anthracycline plus Silymarin, Silymarin group (n= 25). Blood samples were collected at
      begging and after 6 months to measure LDH, CK-MB, cTn I, Anticardiolipin IgG, Fe, ferritin
      and TIBC and % of saturation. % EF was documented. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA
      and paired t test. P &lt;0.05 was statistically significant.

    <description>eighty-three eligible patients were recruited 33, 25, and 25 patients in the control group, L-carnitine group, and, Silymarin group respectively, completed the study
without cardioprotective agents in a dose of 50 mg/m2. L-carnitine group received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in a dose of 50 mg/m2 plus L-carnitine 3 gm L-carnitine® capsules obtained from (MEPACO) was taken PO one day before chemotherapeutic cycle and 1gm /day during the following 21 days. Silymarin group received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in a dose of 50 mg/m2 plus Silymarin as cardioprotective agent.140 mg (Legalon ® 140 mg capsule obtained from (MEDA). Silymarin was taken PO once daily after meals during the chemotherapeutic cycle. The treatment period was 6 months.</description>
