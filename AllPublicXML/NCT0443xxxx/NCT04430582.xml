  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between recurrent
      hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and cognition (thinking) in individuals who have a history of
      hypoglycemia, but do not have pre-diabetes or diabetes.

      This study will analyze whether recurrent hypoglycemia is associated with differences in
      cognition (thinking), and if individuals with a history of hypoglycemia perform less well on
      cognitive assessments compared to individuals without known hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that recurrent hypoglycemia is associated with
      differences in cognition (thinking), by analyzing results of cognitive testing in individuals
      with a history of hypoglycemia as compared with those without known hypoglycemia.

      This pilot study will identify cognitive domains of interest in participants with
      hypoglycemia, as well as inform the development of a future battery of assessments, which
      could be replicated in a larger sample. Cognitive domains which will be assessed include:
      memory, language, executive function, and psychomotor speed.
