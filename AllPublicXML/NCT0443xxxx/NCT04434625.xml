  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of adequate bowel preparation is one of important quality indicators of colonoscopy.
      Inadequate bowel preparation negatively affects the outcomes of colonoscopy. If patients with
      inadequate bowel preparation were identified before the procedure, enhanced strategy could be
      offered to achieve better bowel cleaning. Currently, there were three predicting models of
      inadequate bowel preparation established based on patient-related factors. So far, none of
      predictive models have been tested in other than their validation cohort populations, and no
      study has attempted to apply a different regimen to patients presenting with risk factors for
      inadequate colon cleanliness. In previous studies, we established a prediction model based on
      procedure-related factors, which has better accuracy and can better predict the quality of
      bowel preparation.

      The aim of this study is to compare the quality of bowel preparation by using a predictive
      model based on procedure-related factors versus the criterion group in unsedation patients

    <description>Before colonoscopy, patient-related and procedure-related parameters were collected by one investigator in each center. In MI group, a procedure-based score, used for predicting inadequate bowel preparation, was calculated for each patients. Patients with score ≥3 were asked to taking another dose of PEG (1.5L) within 1-2 hours. Colonoscopy was performed in afternoon (about 4h after drinking PEG). Patients with score&lt;3 in IM group and those in the control group underwent colonoscopy directly</description>
