  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to evaluate the transition from acute to chronic pain that sometimes
      occurs following CXL in keratoconus patients. This study will determine whether these changes
      can be structurally and functionally quantified using functional neuroimaging and in vivo
      corneal microscopy (IVCM), and whether they can be predicted based on predisposing biological
      and psychological factors. Our central hypothesis is that CXL produces acute pain through
      activation of trigeminal afferents, and that post-operative chronic pain outcomes are related
      to neuroplastic changes in trigeminal circuitry, corneal afferent regeneration, and
      psychological factors.

        The population under study are patients with keratoconus who are undergoing a corneal
        cross-linking (CXL) procedure. Keratoconus is an eye condition where the cornea
        progressively develops abnormally into a cone shape, which can lead to distorted vision and
        irreversible vision loss The CXL procedure is designed to restore and maintain the shape of
        the cornea to avoid these complications.
