  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of digital life coaching (DLC) to engage patients during the peri-HCT
      period that is punctuated by intensive life changes. DLC may circumvent these limitations by
      combining the integrative cross-dimensional nature of life coaching with the advantages of
      mobile health technology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ongoing
      participant engagement with a DLC platform is feasible for multiple myeloma (MM) patients
      actively undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

    <textblock>
      Participants will receive unlimited access to Pack Health's DLC platform during a 16-week
      period encompassing pre-HCT conditioning chemotherapy, post-HCT recovery, and 100-day
      follow-up. Participants will engage with Pack Health's DLC platform and complete quality of
      life assessments for 16 weeks beginning from enrollment. At the conclusion of the treatment
      period, participants will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the DLC platform

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the rate of ongoing participant engagement with a DLC platform during the study
      period

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess quality of life among participants during the study period

        -  To assess psychosocial distress among participants during the study period

        -  To assess sleep disturbances among participants during the study period

        -  To assess participant satisfaction with the DLC platform at the end of the study period

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To assess benzodiazepine and zolpidem-class drug usage for anxiety or insomnia among
           participants during the study period

        -  To assess communications with treatment teams among participants during the study period

        -  To assess 100-day clinical outcomes among participants at the end of the study period

    <measure>Median PRO Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health (GH) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS GH instrument v1.2 will be used to assess quality of life. This 10-item inventory with scores ranging from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating a a greater quality of life. Raw PROMIS scores will subsequently be transformed to T-score metrics as per the scoring manual to reflect a population mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Among cancer patients, a T-score change of 5 points on any PROMIS inventory is generally considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer (DT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NCCN DT will be used to assess psychosocial distress. This single-item inventory uses a graphic of a thermometer to allow patients to assess their overall distress on a scale of 0=No Distress to 10= Extreme distress. The NCCN considers a cutoff score of 4 to differentiate clinically significant distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (SD) Short Form (SF) 4a Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS SD SF 4a inventory will be used to measure overall sleep disturbance in past 7 days. This assessment consists of 4 items which measure sleep quality and sleep disturbances using a 5 point likert scale ranging in value from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater sleep quality. Raw PROMIS scores will subsequently be transformed to T-score metrics as per the scoring manual to reflect a population mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Among cancer patients, a T-score change of 5 points on any PROMIS inventory is generally considered to be clinically meaningful</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Participant Satisfaction Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to provide a response, on a scale from 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (extremely likely), to the following single question: &quot;How likely are you to recommend this life coaching tool to other patients undergoing stem cell transplantation?&quot;</description>
