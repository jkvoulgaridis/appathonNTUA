      Objective: The research was conducted to determine the effect of music and nutrition played
      together with motivational video on non-stress test (NST) result and mother's anxiety level.

      Method: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled clinical trial. The sample of the
      study consisted of 360 pregnant women, two experimental and one control group (120 pregnant
      women in each). In the study, pregnant women in the first experimental group were provided to
      consume cake and fruit juice 30 minutes before the NST procedure. The second experimental
      group was provided to eat fruit juice and cake before NST, and the video created with a
      similar content was given about the developments and changes occurring in the mother and
      fetus during pregnancy, and was watched for about 15-20 minutes during the NST procedure
      accompanied by music that provided relaxation. The data of the study were collected by using
      the Participant Presentation Form, NST evaluation form and State Anxiety Inventory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non Stress Test (NST) has been used frequently in fetal health assessment in recent years due
      to its easy application, cheapness, reliability and rapid assessment. False negativity rates
      of NST also cause an increase in cesarean rates. Studies in recent years show that there are
      methods and factors that increase fetal movements and shorten NST application time. It was
      observed that nutrient intake, music playing, fetal acoustic vibration application and
      halogen light applications before NST increased fetal movements and shortened NST time.

    <description>questionnaire NST Findings Registration Form
As Reactive NST; The test result was accepted as reactive NST in the presence of at least two accelerations, which lasted at least 15 seconds within the 20-minute period when the electronic fetal heartbeat traces were printed and was 15 beats / minute more than the baseline beat.
As nonreactive NST; The absence of at least two accelerations, which lasted at least 15 seconds within the 20-minute period when the electronic fetal heartbeat traces were printed, was 15 beats / minute more than the baseline beat, or 160 beats / minute and above continuous fetal tachycardia in the presence of severe variable decelerations and late decelerations. In case of development, the result was evaluated as nonreactive NST.</description>

    <description>scale State Anxiety Scale The state anxiety part of the scale consisting of two parts was used. Answer options on both scales consisting of twenty questions can get points from 1 to 4.
There are direct and inverted expressions in the scales. Direct expressions express negative emotions, and reversed expressions express positive emotions. There are ten reversed expressions in the WHO and these are items 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19 and 20. The total score value obtained from the scale varies between 20 and 80. The increase in the score obtained from the scale indicates that the level of anxiety is high.</description>

During this waiting period, the researchers were informed about the development and changes in the body and the fetus specific to the gestational week and NST. Later, NST was applied, and during the procedure, the pregnant women were watched with music that provides relaxation with the video regarding the fetal development appropriate for the gestational week and changes in the mother.</description>
