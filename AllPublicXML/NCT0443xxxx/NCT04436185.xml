      Aim: This study was conducted to determine and compare the effectiveness of different
      non-pharmacological methods in pain management during vaccination.

      Methods: This randomized experimental study with placebo and control groups was conducted
      with 175 infants assigned to the ShotBlocker® (n = 35), ShotBlocker®-placebo (n = 35),
      sucrose (n = 35), sucrose-placebo (n = 35) and control (n = 35) groups. The pain levels of
      the infants were determined by blind assessors (nurses, parents, and observer) using the
      Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) before and during vaccination.

    <masking_description>In the study, a multi-stage randomization method was used as follows: 1) random selection of the family health centres in the city in which the research was conducted; 2) selection of the mothers and infants to be included in the study at each centre; and 3) selection of the groups to which the participants were assigned using a computer-based block randomization method (https://www.randomizer.org). The infants, randomized via a computer system, were assigned to the ShotBlocker® group (n= 35), ShotBlocker®-placebo group (n = 35), sucrose group (n = 35), sucrose-placebo group (n = 35), or the control group (n=35).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>NIPS is a valid behavioural instrument that can be used to assess infants' response to pain. NIPS includes six behavioural responses to pain: facial expression, crying, breathing patterns, arms, legs, and state of wakefulness. The total pain scores range from 0 to 7. While the internal consistency of the original NIPS is within the range of .87 to .95, the internal consistency of the Turkish version is .83</description>
