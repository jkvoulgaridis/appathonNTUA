  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase I, open-label, multicenter, global, dose-escalation study
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RO7297089 and make a
      preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity in patients with R/R MM for whom no established
      therapy for MM is appropriate and available or who are intolerant to those established
      therapies.
