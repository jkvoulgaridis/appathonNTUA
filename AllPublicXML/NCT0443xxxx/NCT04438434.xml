      A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a mouthwash containing Hydrogen
      Peroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate and Glycine in the healing of post-extraction sites of wisdom
      teeth by film forming action.

      57 subjects, with an indication for a third molar extraction, will be enrolled in the study.
      Participants selection will take place at the IRCCS &quot;Ca&quot; Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico
      of Milan - UOC Surgery Maxillo Facial and Dentistry where the internship activity of the
      Degree Course in Dentistry and Dental Prosthetics, Dental Hygiene and the School of
      Specialization in Orthodontics of the University of Milan is held.

      Subsequently, subjects will be equally divided and randomly assigned into the test or control
      groups. Assessment of outcomes will be carried out at a distance of 7 days.

    <masking_description>The products will be packaged in such a way that they are not recognizable either by the operator or by the patient. Each package will be assigned a number that in turn will refer to the type of the product. The association between the number and type of the product will be collected by another operator on the basis of the association carried out by a dedicated software. The operator who will deliver the product will be informed about the type only at the end of the treatment.
The data will be collected in pseudonymised form and inserted into a dedicated database in order to carry out the statistical analysis provided.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>For evaluation of healing, the Laundry-Turnbull and Howley index will be used, considering the changes made by Pippi and coll. in 2015. In particular, seven parameters will be evaluated; a value of 1 or 0 will be assigned to each of these parameters; the sum of the values will indicate the degree of healing to be subsequently compared between the different groups.
In particular, seven parameters will be assessed, to each of which a value of 1 or 0 will be assigned. The sum of the values will indicate the degree of healing to be compared between the different groups.
These seven parameters are: redness of mucosa, granulation tissue, suppuration, swelling, re-epithelialization, bleeding, pain on palpation.
Higher score means worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The enrolled subjects will be examined and treated by specialized medical personnel.
The extraction will be carried out by an experienced operator and will follow the standard guidelines for the extraction of impacted teeth. Once the tooth has been removed, a suture with detached stitches using silk thread 3/0 will be applied.
From a pharmacological point of view, the patient will be prescribed antibiotic therapy (Amoxicillin 1g) to be administered twice daily for seven days, analgesic/anti-inflammatory therapy with NSAIDs (e.g. Synflex 550 mg/Brufen 800 mg) are to be used for a maximum of twice daily.
The treatment to be evaluated involves mouth rinsing with 10 ml of BMG0703 three times daily, after meals and after normal oral hygiene procedures, for one week (date of the follow-up visit).
Patients with allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to the product will be advised to discontinue its use, and seek medical advice.</description>
