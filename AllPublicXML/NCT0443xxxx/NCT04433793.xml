  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients suffer from severe exhaustion and tiredness that is disproportionate to
      previous efforts and that cannot be completely reduced by sleep. The effectiveness of an 8
      week yoga therapy (one hour a week) in patients with different cancer types on self-reported
      fatigue will be tested.

      Almost 90% of cancer patients suffer from symptoms of fatigue during treatment. Supporting
      treatments are increasingly used to alleviate the burden of fatigue. This study examines the
      short-term effects of yoga on fatigue, depression and quality of life. The aim of this study
      will evaluate the efficacy of yoga for cancer patients with mixed diagnoses reporting
      fatigue. We will randomly allocate 124 patients to an intervention group (N=62) receiving
      yoga and a wait-list control group (N=62) receiving yoga 9 weeks later. The yoga therapy will
      be performed in weekly sessions of 60 minutes each for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be
      self-reported fatigue symptoms. Secondary outcome will be depression and Quality of life
