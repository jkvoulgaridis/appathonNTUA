  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effect of treadmill walking training with and without random
      speed changes in persons in the chronic stage of stroke. It was hypothesized that random
      speed change group will show less attention and balance demands for speed change in level
      walking.

    <textblock>
      This study includes chronic stroke patients who will be randomly assigned to blocked or
      random walking speed change group to receive 30 min per session, 3 sessions per week for 2
      weeks' walking training on a treadmill. The outcome measures include gait characteristics
      under 3 tasks x 3 speed conditions x 2 attention conditions on an obstacle-free walk way. The
      three tasks are normal walking, narrow based walking and obstacle crossing. The three speed
      conditions are constant (preferred) speed, speeding up (preferred to maximum speed), and
      slowing down (maximum to preferred speed). The two attention conditions are none and serial
      subtraction of 3 during walking. Clinical sensorimotor function assessment, including hand
      grip strength, plantar sensitivity, stroke rehabilitation assessment of movement and
      Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor scale will be conducted for subject characterization.

    <description>Participants were asked to walk in different gait speed randomly on the treadmill (80%, 90%, 100%, 110% and 120% of preferred speed). The training speed would be changed in every 15 seconds in 2-minutes-section. 2 minutes/ section, 10 sections/ day, 3 days/ week, 2 weeks. 1 minute rest time would be held between sections.</description>
