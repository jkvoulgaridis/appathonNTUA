  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      QBS10072S in patients with advanced or metastatic cancers with high LAT1 expression. The MTD
      of QBS10072S will be confirmed in patients with relapsed or refractory grade 4 astrocytoma.
