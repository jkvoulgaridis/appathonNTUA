      Gastric Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (G-POEM) is a procedure for the Treatment of
      Gastroparesis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a disease of the stomach where there is significant delay in gastric
      emptying of contents to the intestines. This disease results in a multitude of symptoms
      including nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and malnutrition.

      Current treatments for gastroparesis include dietary changes, oral medications (prokinetic
      agents to enhance gastric motility, acid reducers, anti-emetics to reduce nausea and
      vomiting), gastric stimulators and rarely surgery.

      G-POEM (Gastric Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy-creating a cut in the muscle that controls
      gastric emptying), an incision-less (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic
      procedure, is increasingly being performed to assist in the management of certain groups of
      patients with gastroparesis.

      This data will be used for research purposes only to determine the clinical impact of
      endoscopic treatments on gastroparesis. The physicians will also be able to better understand
      the patient's condition and disease process that may lead to improved standard of care and
      improved patient management.

    <measure>Assessment of Change in Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) from baseline to post G-POEM</measure>
    <time_frame>60 months span: baseline and assess change at 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 12 month, 24 month, 36 month, 48 month &amp; 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) is used for assessing severity of symptoms associated with gastroparesis. Patients are to score each of the 9 symptom criteria on 0 (None) to 5 (Very Severe) Likert Scale. The higher the score the more symptomatic from gastroparesis the patient is.
Nausea or Vomiting (score 0-5 for each of the following 3 criteria)
Nausea
Retching
Vomiting Postprandial fullness or early satiety (score 0-5 for each of the following 4 criteria)
Stomach Fullness
Not able to finish a normal-sized meal
Feeling excessively full after meals
Loss of appetite Bloating (score 0-5 for each of the following 2 criteria)
Bloating
Stomach visibly larger</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Change in Patient Assessment of gastrointestinal disorders-symptom severity index (PAGI-SYM) score from baseline to post G-POEM</measure>
    <time_frame>60 months span: baseline and assess change at 1,3,6,12,24, 36,48 &amp; 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PAGI-Sym score: The PAGI-SYM is composed of 20 items and 6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation (7 items), nausea/vomiting (3 items), postprandial fullness/early satiety (4 items), bloating (2 items), upper abdominal pain (2 items), and lower abdominal pain (2 items). Subscale scores are calculated by averaging across items comprising the subscale; scores vary from 0 (none or absent) to 5 (very severe)</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Change in G-POEM SF-36 Health Survey score from baseline to post G-POEM</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and assess change at 1,3,6,12,24,36,48 &amp; 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in health belief questionnaire (SF-36) score: Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability and the higher scores indicate better health</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; and assess change at 6, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>we will track change in GES at 6 months and 24 months post G-POEM and compare to baseline. Normal GES should have under 5% at 4 hours</description>
