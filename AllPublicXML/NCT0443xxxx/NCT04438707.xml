      Introduction: An inappropriate posture in children for a while kept playing some instrument
      of the group of the rubbed string, can cause pain and alterations of the spine, as it
      continues to consolidate.

      Objective: To study the benefits acquired during the application of the Pilates Method
      combined with therapeutic exercise against the Therapeutic Exercise to reduce alterations of
      the vertebral rachis in children from 10 to 14 years old who play instruments of rubbed
      strings.

      Material and methods: A pilot study designed by a randomized controlled trial in two parallel
      intervention groups was carried out; 9 children performed the combination of the Pilates
      Method and Therapeutic Exercise (experimental) and 7 children performed the Therapeutic
      Exercise (control). At the beginning and at the end of the study, pain measurements have been
      made through the Visual Analogue Scale (EVA), and the Kinovea programme for the alignment of
      shoulder, scapula and hip postures.
