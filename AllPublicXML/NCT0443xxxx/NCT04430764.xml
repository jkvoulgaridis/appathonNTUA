    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of smoking and non-surgical periodontal treatment
      on gingival crevicular fluid CyPA and EMMPRIN levels in patients with periodontitis.
      Twenty-eight patients with periodontitis (14 non-smoker and 14 smoker) and 30 control
      subjects (15 non-smoker and 15 smoker) were included into the study. Non-surgical periodontal
      treatment was applied to all periodontitis patients. Periodontal parameters and GCF CyPA and
      EMMPRIN levels were evaluated during 3 months following non-surgical periodontal treatment.
      GCF CyPA and EMMPRIN levels were analyzed by ELISA.

    <description>Non-surgical periodontal treatment program was as following: First, motivation and oral hygiene instructions were given to all participants with periodontitis. The modified-Bass tooth brushing technique with a given dentifrice and toothbrush twice a day, and dental flossing/ interdental brushing once a day was advised to all patients with periodontitis. Second, scaling using an ultrasonic device and root planning by hand instruments under local anesthesia was performed.</description>
