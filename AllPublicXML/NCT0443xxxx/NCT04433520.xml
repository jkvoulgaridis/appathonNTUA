        This clinical study will enroll male and female adults and children with a PFO (adults
        only), ASD or VSD who are indicated for transcatheter closure. Patients must meet all
        general eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent prior to sites conducting
        any study-specific procedures not considered standard of care.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient is indicated for implantation with the Amplatzer Septal Occluder for occlusion
             of a secundum atrial septal defect (Note: This does not include the indication for
             closure of a fenestration following a fenestrated Fontan procedure) OR subject is
             indicated for implantation with the Amplatzer PFO Occluder OR subject is indicated for
             implantation with the Amplatzer Muscular VSD Occluder OR subject is indicated for
             implantation with the Amplatzer Post-Infarct Muscular VSD Occluder

          2. Patient is of legal age and has provided his/her own written, informed consent

        OR

        Patient is a minor and has provided verbal and/or written informed consent or assent per
        local EC requirements, and his/her legally authorized representative, or representatives,
        have provided written informed consent on behalf of the minor according to local EC
        requirements

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Presence of anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or
             psychological conditions that, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, could limit
             the subject's ability to participate in the clinical study or to comply with follow-up
             requirements.

          2. Exclusion Criteria for Patients Undergoing ASD Closure with the Amplatzer ASO or
             Amplatzer ASD-MF Occluder

               -  Patients known to have extensive congenital cardiac anomaly that can only be
                  adequately repaired by cardiac surgery

               -  Patients known to have sepsis within 1 month prior to implantation, or any
                  systemic infection that cannot be successfully treated prior to device placement

               -  Patients known to have demonstrated intracardiac thrombus on echocardiography
                  (especially left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombi)

               -  Patients whose size or condition (e.g., too small for transesophageal
                  echocardiography [TEE] probe, catheter size, vasculature size, active infection)
                  would cause the patient to be a poor candidate for cardiac catheterization

               -  Patients with defect margins less than 5 mm to the coronary sinus, inferior vena
                  cava rim, an atrioventricular valve, or the right upper lobe pulmonary vein

          3. Exclusion Criteria for Patients Undergoing PFO Closure

               -  Presence of thrombus at the intended site of implant, or documented evidence of
                  venous thrombus in the vessels through which access to the defect is gained.
                  Thrombus must be ruled out prior to introducing the delivery system.

               -  Active endocarditis or other infections producing bacteremia

               -  Patients whose vasculature, through which access to the defect is gained, is
                  inadequate to accommodate the appropriate sheath size

               -  Anatomy in which the Amplatzer™ PFO device size required would interfere with
                  other intra-cardiac or intravascular structures, such as valves or pulmonary
                  veins

               -  Patients with known hypercoagulable states

               -  Patients with intra-cardiac mass or vegetation, thrombus, or tumor

          4. Exclusion Criteria for Patients Undergoing VSD Closure with the Amplatzer Muscular VSD
             Occluder or Amplatzer Post-Infarct Muscular VSD Occluder

               -  Body weight &lt;8 kg

               -  Tetralogy of Fallot

               -  Intracardiac thrombi on echocardiography
