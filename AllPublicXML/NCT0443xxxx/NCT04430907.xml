  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptability of HPV vaccination in postpartum
      women in Central Pennsylvania. Participants will be recruited while inpatient in the
      postpartum unit. Participants will complete a survey asking about knowledge, attitudes, and
      beliefs around vaccination, including HPV vaccination, as well as breastfeeding intentions.
      After survey completion, the participant will have the option to receive the HPV vaccine,
      Gardasil 9, prior to discharge from the hospital. All participants will then be contacted 1-
      week later for the follow-up survey.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if postpartum women serve as a potential
      population to target in order to increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Central
      Pennsylvania.

      Despite being available for almost a decade, uptake of the HPV vaccine in the US remains
      below other countries, including England, Scotland, and Australia. In fact, in 2017, only 67%
      of US girls aged 13-17 had obtained even one dose of the HPV vaccine series. Due to low rates
      of HPV vaccination in the United States and Central Pennsylvania, effective interventions are
      needed to help increase these rates.

      While vaccination is recommended at a younger age, it is effective among women 18-25 years
      old. Based on clinical trial data, giving the vaccine to this age group has resulted in
      reduced abnormal Pap test findings, referral for colposcopy, and treatment related to
      abnormal cervical cytology. However, the HPV vaccine is not usually discussed during prenatal
      care or routinely administered during pregnancy. Previous studies have shown that offering
      other vaccines postpartum (e.g. tetanus or pertussis) has been successful.

      By offering the vaccine to this demographic group, the investigators could potentially
      discover an untapped target population to help increase rates of HPV vaccination.

    <description>After consent, participants will complete an intake survey confirming eligibility. Participants will also complete a survey asking about knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs around vaccination, including HPV vaccination, as well as breastfeeding intentions.
After survey completion, the participant will be asked if they would like to be administered the HPV vaccine, Gardasil 9. If participants do not agree, they will be contacted 1-week later for the follow-up survey. If participants do agree, the project coordinator will notify the study physician, who will place an order for the vaccine. The vaccine will be administered to the patient prior to discharge from the hospital. Participants will be contacted 1-week later for the follow-up survey.</description>
