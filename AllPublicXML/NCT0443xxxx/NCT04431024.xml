  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      A germline mutation is a change to a person s genes that is carried through their DNA. These
      mutations can be passed on from parents to their offspring. Germline mutations in a gene
      called BAP1 are linked to the development of mesothelioma and other cancers. Researchers want
      to follow people with these mutations to learn more.

      Objective:

      To see if researchers can improve how people who have or are suspected to have a BAP1
      mutation are monitored over time.

      Eligibility:

      People age 30 and older who are suspected to have a BAP1 germline mutation.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a personal and family medical history. Their medical
      records may be reviewed. They will give a blood or saliva sample to test for a BAP1 mutation.
      They will get genetic counseling.

      To take part in this study, participants will enroll on 2 to 3 other protocols.

      Participants will have a physical exam. They may have a tumor biopsy. They will give blood
      and urine samples. They will have skin and eye exams.

      Some participants will have video-assisted thoracoscopy to examine the chest and lungs and
      diagnose suspicious areas. For this, a small camera is inserted into the chest through a
      small incision.

      Some participants will have laparoscopy to examine the organs inside the abdomen. For this, a
      small camera is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision.

      Participants will have imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have brain
      scans.

      Participants will visit the NIH once a year for follow-up exams.

      Participation lasts indefinitely.

      Background:

        -  Mutations involving BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear deubiquitinase involved
           in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular energetics, have
           emerged as one of the most common somatic mutations in malignant mesotheliomas.

        -  Germline mutations involving BAP1 predispose individuals to mesothelioma as well as a
           variety of other malignancies including lung, melanoma, renal, gastric, and breast
           cholangiocarcinoma.

        -  The cancer penetrance of BAP1 is nearly 100%.

        -  Presently there are no established guidelines for surveillance of cancer patients with
           germline BAP1 mutations or of cancer-free individuals with germline BAP1 mutations.

      Objectives:

      To prospectively gather information related to the use of high-resolution computed
      tomographic imaging (HRCT), together with minimally invasive surgical surveillance for early
      detection of pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma in patients with BAP1 tumor predisposition
      syndrome (TPDS)

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals with a history of any malignancy with known or suspected germline mutation
           involving BAP1.

        -  First- or second-degree relatives of patients with documented germline BAP1 mutations,
           who are also found to carry similar germline mutations.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 30

      Design:

        -  Individuals with suspected hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes will undergo
           germline evaluation using CLIA-certified next-gen sequencing (NGS).

        -  First- and second-degree relatives of patients with germline BAP1 mutations will be
           offered similar NGS evaluation.

        -  Subjects with germline mutations in BAP1, will undergo periodic high-resolution CT
           (HRCT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) will be
           assessed at similar intervals, and minimally invasive surveillance procedures (i.e.,
           video- assisted thoracoscopy and laparoscopy) will be performed periodically to detect
           early, subclinical malignancies that may be amenable to potentially curative local
           interventions.
