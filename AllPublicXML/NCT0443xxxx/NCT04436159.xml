      Short-term follow up after surgery of para-esophageal hernia comparing two different types of
      fundoplication

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic para-esophageal hernia (PEH) repair has been established as a safe and effective
      treatment for symptomatic patients. Today, most surgeons agree that a fundoplication should
      be included in the hiatal reconstruction in order to reduce the risk of postoperative
      gastroesophageal reflux and hernia recurrence. However, what type of wrap that should be
      recommend is yet to be determined.

      One might argue that the overall durability and effectiveness of a partial fundoplication in
      the control of reflux might be less reliable than a total wrap, but on the contrary, the
      latter carries the risk of inducing a pseudoachalasia similar situation in PEH patients.

      We therefore designed a double blind randomized clinical trial in which patients with
      symptomatic paraesophageal hernia to receive either a posterior partial (Toupet) or total
      (Nissen) fundoplication after hernia reduction and crural repair.

      Six months follow up with questionnaires and 24-hour pH monitoring after surgery of
      para-esophageal hernia with addition of total fundoplication vs posterial partial
      fundoplication.

      Dysphagia Scores; Ogilvie dysphagia score and Watson dysphagia score. Quality of Life; SF-36:
      physical and mental component scores.

      Time points: 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery

    <description>The Ogilvie dysphagia score is a 5-graded scale 0-4 defined as follows: '0', ability to eat ordinary diet; '1', ability to swallow solid food; '2', ability to swallow semisolids; '3', ability to swallow liquids; '4', total inability to swallow .</description>

    <description>Watson dysphagia score is a validated instrument for benign dysphagia where the patient is asked whether he/she always, sometimes or never has difficulty swallowing nine different groups of liquid and food items.
This gives a score ranging from zero to 45, where 45 represents the worst possible dysphagia.</description>

    <description>A total fundoplication was constructed in which the right and left part of the wrap was brought together in front of, and slightly to the right of the esophagus, and sutured with three interrupted stitches of 2-0 unabsorbable sutures from the GEJ and cranially to attain a length between the top and bottom sutures of at the most 2 cm. At least one wrap suture included the esophageal muscle-wall.</description>

    <description>The wrap was pulled dorsally around the distal part of the esophagus and GEJ, which was encircled approximately 180-200 degrees. First, the wrap was anchored with Gore-tex sutures, dorsally to the left crus with 3 sutures and then to the right crus with another 3 sutures.
Finally, the wrap was completed with 3-4 sutures, between the edges of the wrap and the right and left side of the esophageal wall, respectively.</description>
