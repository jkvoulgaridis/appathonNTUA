  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the efficacy of two probiotic interventions as prophylaxes of
      fibromyalgia symptoms in individuals diagnosed.

      The primary outcome measure will be the progression and treatment of fibromyalgia, defined as
      a decrease in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score, other otucomes will be the
      effect on the symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with fibromyalgia, defined as a
      decrease in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) score; perception of pain by
      scoring on a Visual Analogical Pain Scale (VAS), and differences in the patient's usual
      medical treatment. Finally adverse effects will be evaluated.

      The study will have two arms: one arm including a probiotic preparation and a placebo arm.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogical Pain Scale (VAS) Score. It is a unidimensional continuous measure of pain intensity. It comprises a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pain intensity, the scale is anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100‐mm scale]). in weeks 12</description>
