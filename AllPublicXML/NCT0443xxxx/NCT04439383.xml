  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE) is one of the leading preventable causes of
      in-hospital mortality, but prevention of VTE in hospitalized medical patients remains
      challenging, as preventive measures such as pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (TPX) need to
      be tailored to individual thrombotic risk.

      The broad objective of this project is to improve VTE prevention strategies in hospitalized
      medical patients by prospectively examining VTE risk factors (including mobility) and
      comparing existing risk assessment models.
