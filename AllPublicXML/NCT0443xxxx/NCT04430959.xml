      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of Candesartan when used in patients with
      Bipolar Disorder, in addition to their medication treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological options for the treatment of Bipolar disorder (BD) are limited and a large
      proportion of patients does not show adequate response to treatment, especially in the case
      of bipolar depression. It has been hypothesized that dysfunctions in the renin-angiotensin
      system (RAS) may be involved in the pathophysiology of BD. We propose a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, proof-of-concept trial to investigate the effects
      of candesartan, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist capable to cross the blood-brain
      barrier, as an adjunctive agent in the treatment of bipolar depression. Bipolar patients on a
      depressive episode will be randomly assigned to undergo two consecutive 4-week treatment
      periods with either candesartan (4 mg daily) or placebo in a crossover study. At the
      beginning of each treatment period, participants will complete a resting-state functional MRI
      scan, to be performed 1.5 hours after the first dose of the study medication. Subjects will
      be followed weekly and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be adopted
      as the primary outcome measure. Response will be defined as a decrease equal or higher than
      50% in the MADRS score from the time of study entry to the 4th week of each treatment period.
      Possible associations between changes in brain connectivity (measured through resting state
      functional MRI) and subsequent response to treatment will also be analyzed.

    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at the end of each treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items, based on the patient's subjective report and observations made during the clinical interview. Higher scores indicate a greater severity of manic symptoms. Given the cyclic nature of BD, the YMRS will be utilized to monitor patients as for the possibility of a manic switch over each four-week treatment period.</description>
