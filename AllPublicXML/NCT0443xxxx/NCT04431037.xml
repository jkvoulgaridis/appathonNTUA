      ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been widely
      studied in elective abdominal surgeries and have shown better outcomes. However the utility
      of these protocols in emergency abdominal surgeries has not been widely investigated.

      OBJECTIVE: To study the outcomes of application of ERAS protocols in patients undergoing
      perforated duodenal ulcers repairs in emergency abdominal surgeries.

      METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Surgical Unit 1 BBH from August
      2018 to December 2019 with a total sample size of 36 patients with the diagnosis of
      perforated duodenal ulcer. Patients were randomly divided in two groups. Group A consisted of
      early oral feeding group and group B consisted of traditional postoperative care group.
      Outcome results studied were the length of hospital stay, duodenal repair site leak, severity
      of pain (VAS score) and duration of post-operative ileus. Results were analysed on SPSS
      version 20 and chi-square and independent t-test were applied.
