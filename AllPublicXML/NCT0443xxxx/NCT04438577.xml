  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 15%-30% of patients receiving breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for invasive breast
      carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) need a reoperation due to tumor-positive margins
      at final histopathology. Currently available modalities used for intraoperative surgical
      margin assessment all have specific limitations. In order to improve intraoperative tumor
      localization and surgical margin assessment in BCS, we developed a fluorescent tracer, the
      Lidocaine mucilage-ICG tracer, which could be locally injected and detected by fluorescent
      camera systems during operation. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of Lidocaine
      mucilage-ICG as an agent for intraoperative tumor delineation.
