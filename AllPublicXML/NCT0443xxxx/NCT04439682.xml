    <textblock>
      Background: RA may progress with articular and non-articular involvement.Depression
      prevelance is found to increase for RA patients according to healthy population and to be
      correlated with pain, decreased quality of life, fatigue and physical disability.BDNF level
      was found significantly lower in RA patients with depression. Aim of this study is to
      investigate the variation of BDNF, VEGF, TNF- α, IL-6, IL-1β, irisin and α- Klotho levels
      following acute exercise.

      Methods: This study included 45 RA patients and 45 age and sex matched healthy controls.
      Blood samples from all subjects were taken and centrifuged before and immediately after the
      exercise intervention.
