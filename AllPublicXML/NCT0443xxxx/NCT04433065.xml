      The objective of this early feasibility study is to gain early clinical insight into the
      performance of the Intrepid transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) system intended
      for transfemoral access to deliver a self-expanding bioprosthetic valve within the tricuspid
      valve.
