    <textblock>
      CC-99282-CLL-001 study is a Phase IB dose escalation and expansion clinical study of CC-99282
      administered in combination with Obinutuzumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible subjects must be relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy,
      one of which must have included an inhibitor of B-cell receptor signaling (approved Bruton's
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor [BTKi] or Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor [PI3Ki]) or
      venetoclax. The dose escalation (Part A) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of
      escalating doses of CC-99282 given in combination with intravenous obinutuzumab to determine
      the MTD and RP2D of CC-99282 when given in combination with obinutuzumab.The dose expansion
      (Part B) may occur at the MTD established in the dose escalation phase, or at an alternative
      tolerable dosing schedule, based on review of safety, PK and PD data from Part A.
