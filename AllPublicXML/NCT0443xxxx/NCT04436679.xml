  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is particularly innovative as it will accurately analyze the microscopic
      characteristics of the stroma, tumor budding and mucin expression in adenocarcinomas of the
      pancreas, using a comparative approach of long-survivor/short-survival patients.

    <time_frame>at 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Immunohistochemistry tissue analysis. It will allow the evaluation of newly described histological markers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which could have a prognostic impact such as the immunophenotype of the inflammatory infiltrate, the expression of the mucins MUC1, MUC5AC, MUC4, MUC16, mesothelin, p53, Ki67 (MIB1) and markers of aggressive subtypes identified by transcriptome studies, in particular the basal-like molecular subtype.</description>
