  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home dialysis modalities, including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and home hemodialysis (HHD),
      represent alternatives to conventional in-center hemodialysis (HD) that for some patients may
      be better aligned with preferences regarding the integration of dialysis treatments into
      their lives. Assessment of patient experience and satisfaction with care among individuals
      undergoing maintenance dialysis in the United States is a national health care priority and
      mandated by Congress. While validated instruments (ICH CAHPS) are in use to assess patient
      experience with in-center HD, currently no validated instruments are available to measure
      patient-reported experience in home dialysis.

      This Home Patient Experience Survey Validation Study is an in-house research study conducted
      in partnership with the University of Washington.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of patient experience and satisfaction with care among individuals undergoing
      maintenance dialysis in the United States is a national health care priority and mandated by
      Congress. No validated instruments are available to measure the patient-reported experience
      of care in-home dialysis patients. Such tools are needed as more patients are expected to
      choose home dialysis therapies in the future. This study aims to validate a home patient
      experience survey instrument.

      This is a cross-sectional validation to determine the measurement properties of a new home
      dialysis patient experience survey instrument. Satellite Healthcare home dialysis patients
      will be approached by mail or by phone to complete the survey.

      The aim of this study is to perform field testing for this newly developed instrument for the
      purposes of instrument validation and to determine survey instrument measurement properties.
      This will include the evaluation of any multi-item scales as well as an overall score.
