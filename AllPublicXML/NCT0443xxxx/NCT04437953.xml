  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether avatrombopag is an effective treatment for thrombocytopenia in
      people who have both cancer and a liver disease (such as cirrhosis, cholangitis, or
      hepatitis). Researchers will look at whether giving participants avatrombopag for 3 weeks can
      raise their platelet levels enough for them to begin chemotherapy. The study will also test
      whether avatrombopag can continue to be effective against thrombocytopenia while participants
      are on chemotherapy for 12 weeks or longer. In addition, researchers will determine how safe
      the study drug is in participants.

    <description>Patients will receive an initial dose of Avatrombopag 60 mg on Day 1. Starting on Day 2, the dose will be Avatrombopag 20 mg daily. Once a patient has reached a platelet target of &gt; 100,000/mcL patients can initiate chemotherapy. Avatrombopag will be continued as maintenance (subscript &quot;m&quot;) and titrated weekly with a goal to maintain a platelet count of ≥ 100,000/mcL during administration of chemotherapy. Duration of maintenance therapy will be at least 12 weeks (indicated by Week 1m, Week 2m, … 12m) starting from time of platelet correction and resumption of chemotherapy. End of Treatment (EOT) is up to 15 weeks on study Week 12m.</description>

                  foam, cream, or gel), or male partner sterilization, consistent with local
                  regulations regarding use of birth control methods for subjects participating in

                  utilize a highly effective method of birth control if they become heterosexually
                  active during their participation in the study.

               2. If a man, must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed
