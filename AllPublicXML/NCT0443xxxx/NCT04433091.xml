  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed studies will test this hypothesis by randomizing patients with AF to 2-HOBA or
      placebo 7 days prior to AF ablation to allow 2-HOBA to reach steady-state levels. We
      hypothesize that tissue injury from AF ablation causes a large release of ROS that react with
      lipids to generate IsoLGs (Figure 2). In the absence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will react within
      seconds to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of
      AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will rapidly react to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts
      in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLG will
      preferentially bind to and therefore be inactivated by 2-HOBA thereby sparing injury to the
      atrial tissue caused by oxidative stress and its contribution to early recurrence of AF.
      Early recurrence of AF will be measured by ECGs that are recorded once per day by a
      smartwatch (Apple Watch, Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) with additional ECGs recorded by the
      participant if they experience symptoms of AF, or if the smartwatch alerts the participant of
      a possible AF episode via its auto-detection AF monitoring algorithm. The Apple Watch's AF
      algorithm is based on sampling of heart rate and variability and will give an audible alarm
      if those parameters indicate a possible episode of AF. The smartwatch records a single-lead
      ECG if the participant touches the watch with their contralateral hand. The day and time of
      the episode is also stored by the smartwatch. At the end of the 28-day follow-up period,
      study personnel will review the stored ECGs. Blood will be drawn prior to ablation and on
      post-procedure Day 1 for measurement of IsoLG-adduct levels. DNA will be extracted to explore
      a pharmacogenomic interaction with haplotypes at the chromosome 4q25 AF risk locus, which: 1)
      is strongly associated with the development of AF and the early recurrence of AF after
      ablation27; and 2) has been reported to be a regulator of an anti-oxidant gene program in
      response to cardiac injury.

      The proposed double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 2-HOBA in patients
      undergoing AF ablation is designed to address the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that treatment with 2-HOBA reduces early recurrence of
      AF (clinical endpoint)

      Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that treatment with 2-HOBA reduces circulating levels
      of IsoLG-adducts (biochemical endpoint)

      Specific Aim 3: To explore the idea that genetic variation at the 4q25 (PITX2) AF
      susceptibility locus modulates the clinical and biochemical response to 2-HOBA

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a double-blind, randomized study. Eligible subjects will be randomized according to a permuted block scheme with a block size of balancing interval, varying randomly according to the outcome of a computer-generated random number. This ensures that the cumulative number of assignments to each treatment (2-HOBA or placebo) will be in balance after each block of assignments had been made. A statistician will design the randomization table and enable the randomization tool within REDCap. After a patient enrolls for the study, the study nurse will determine the treatment assignment using the randomization tool in REDCap.</intervention_model_description>
