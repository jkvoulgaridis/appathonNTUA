  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a common care study. A study for evaluating the quality of balloon inflation and
      stent application will be performed in 2D angiography alone in the control group and then by
      2D and OCT angiography for the experimental group. The benefit could be an improvement in the
      results of revascularization of femoropopliteal lesions thanks to OCT which allows a 3D
      visualization of the arterial lumen.
