    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled,
      dose-escalating, parallel-group study, evaluating the effects and change of endothelial
      function and gut microbiota after berberine administration in patients with stable coronary
      artery disease who are at &gt; 8 but ≤ 40 weeks after elective percutaneous coronary
      intervention

    <textblock>
      In the present study, about 48 patients with stable coronary artery disease who are at &gt; 8
      but ≤ 40 weeks after elective percutaneous coronary intervention. The total study duration is
      expected to be approximately 14 weeks per patient, including a screening period, a 12±1 week
      treatment period, Randomization was computer generated. After screening, eligible subjects
      will be randomly assigned into one of the following two groups: Berberine+therapy Arm or
      Standard therapy Arm. The primary objective is to determine whether a combination of
      berberine and coronary artery disease standard therapy is preferable to either berberine
      alone or standard therapy alone.

      The visit schedule will be as follows:

      Visit 1: Day -7 to Day -1, Screening/Enrolment; Visit 2: Day 1, Randomization/First dose;
      Visit 3: Week 4±1, Dose adjustment 1, BBR (100mg, tid); Visit 4: Week 8±1, Dose adjustment 2,
      BBR (200mg, tid); Visit 5: Week 12±1, End of Treatment (EOT) /Last dose, BBR (300mg, tid);
      Safety visit.

      We perform cross-sectional comparisons between the two arms and longitudinal comparisons
      within each arm to evaluate the indicators as follows:

        1. . Endothelial function, as measured by Flow mediated dilation (FMD) from baseline to
           12-week follow-up;

        2. . Gut microbiota, as sequenced by metagenomic sequencing from baseline to 12-week
           follow-up.

      Blood and feces samples will be collected before and after treatment. Flow mediated dilation
      (FMD), HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipids and cholesterol level, inflammatory
      factors, amino acids, bile acids and other metabolic related components and parameters will
      be measured. Furthermore, the change of gut microbiota will be evaluated too.

    <intervention_model_description>On the first day of the treatment period (Visit 1), eligible patients will be randomized into the Berberine Arm and the Control Arm.
In the Berberine Arm, patients will receive berberine 200 mg twice daily for 4±1 weeks (Stage 1); then, 300 mg twice daily for 4±1 weeks (Stage 2); then, 400 mg twice daily for 4±1 weeks (Stage 3) in addition to standard treatment, including aspirin 100 mg once daily and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 12±1 weeks.
In the Control Arm, patients will receive standard treatment, including aspirin 100 mg once daily and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 12±1 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Flow-mediated vasodilation measurement in the brachial artery was performed with subjects in the supine position for the evaluation of endothelial function. All imaging was performed by a single, highly skilled sonographer who was unaware of the study assignment.brachial artery diameter was imaged with a 5-12-MHz linear array transducer ultrasound system at a location 3 to 7 cm above the right elbow. The brachial artery diameters at baseline (D0) and after reactive hyperemia (D1) and sublingual nitroglycerine (D2) were recorded. The flow-mediated vasodilation [(D1−D0)/D0×100%] was used as a measure of endothelium-dependent vasodilation.</description>

    <description>At baseline, we evaluate the bacterial diversity, different species, different genes, and different metabolic pathways in the BBR+Standard therapy group and the Standard therapy group . In addition, we mainly focused on α and β diversity variation in the remaining 3 visits of BBR+Standard therapy subjucts. Taxonomy alteration and bacterial metabolic pathways after BBR treatment were also observed.</description>
