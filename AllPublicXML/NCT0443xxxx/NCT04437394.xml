  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study was to determine whether changes that occurred over time had an impact on the
      swallowing and voice functions depend of Ankylosing spondylitis patients.

      This study was carried out at the University of Health Sciences Okmeydani Training and
      Research Hospital, Department of Otorhinolaryngology. Study was performed on 30 patients and
      30 healthy subjects (Group 2) who were diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis using modified
      New York criterion. The patients were asked to fill the EAT-10 and flexible endoscopic
      swallowing evaluation was performed. Voice recordings were taken from the patients to
      evaluate the voice disturbance and acoustic evaluation was taken with PRAAT program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of swallowing was assessed by Eating Assessment Tool inventory consisting in 10 questions that scores from 0 to 40. Low score is better, higher score is worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Values of aspiration</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aspiration was assessed by aspiration penetration scale during swallowing with flexible endoscopy. The scale consisting in 8 degree that scored from 1 to 8. Higher score is worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Voice analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Voice recordings were analyzed by PRAAT computer software. The investigator measured to shimmer, jitter and HNR voice values. The values are variation of frequency and amplitude of the sound wave. Higher value shows healthy voice for HNR parameters, lower value shows healthy voice for shimmer and jitter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical spine situation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical spine was assessed with modify stoke ankylosing spondylitis spine score that scored from 0 to 3. Low score is better and high score is worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator measured to disease activity with bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index consisting in 6 questions that scored from 0 to 10 and morning rigidity times. Low scores are better and high scores are worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic values</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
