    <textblock>
      Participants are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Shih-Chiao
      Tseng, PT, Ph.D. at Texas Woman's University. This research study is to determine whether
      low-intensive brain stimulation can enhance learning of a leg movement task. The
      investigators also want to know if brain stimulation can improve the nerve function and
      walking performance. Our goal is to understand any relationship between brain stimulation and
      overall movement control improvement. Participants have been invited to join this research if
      they have had a stroke before or they are healthy adults aged 21 years or older. Research
      evidence shows stroke can induce permanent brain damage and therefore may cause a person to
      have trouble learning a new task. This in turn may significantly impact the recovery of motor
      function in stroke survivors. In addition, the investigators also want to know how a healthy
      person learns this new leg task and see if her/his learning pattern differs from a stroke
      survivor.

      This study comprises two phases: Phase I study investigates short-term effects of brain
      stimulation on leg skill learning and only requires two visits to TWU. The total time
      commitment for Phase I study will be about 6.5 hours, 3.5 hours on the first visit and three
      hours on the second visit; Phase II study is an expanded version of Phase I study to
      investigate long-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and requires to
      complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a four-week period
      and additional one visit for follow-up test. The total time commitment for Phase II study
      will be about 20 hours, a total of 18 hours for 12 exercise training sessions and two hours
      for a follow-up test. The investigators hypothesize that people with chronic stroke will show
      a slower rate of acquiring this leg skill as compared to healthy adults. The investigators
      also hypothesize that co-applying brain stimulation with 12 sessions of exercise training
      will enhance skill learning of this leg task for people with chronic stroke and this
      12-session exercise program may exert beneficial influences on the nerve function and leg
      muscle activation, and consequentially improve motor control for walking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will take place at Texas Woman's University (TWU)-Houston campus and include two
      phases: Phase I involves a single-intervention study and Phase II involves a four-week
      intervention study. After enrolling to the study, participants can choose to only participate
      in the Phase I study or choose to participate in both Phase I and Phase II studies.

      Phase I Study - participants will be asked to complete two visits, 1-14 days apart. It will
      take about a total of 6.5 hours of their time to complete all tests (3.5 hours for the first
      visit and 3 hours for the second visit, two visits). Participants will need to wear
      short-sleeve t-shirt, shorts, and a pair of sneakers for testing. During the first visit, the
      investigators will measure how well the nervous system works and how well the individual
      walks (see details as follows). If participants have had a stroke before, on the first visit
      the investigators will do some tests on to make sure participants have good feeling, balance,
      and motor responses in their legs. If all tests are good, participants will fill out a form
      asking about their medical history. If participants have not had a stroke, the investigators
      will ask a few questions to make sure participants do not have any medical issues.

      Next, the investigators will ask participants to learn a leg movement task at each visit. The
      task is to control and move a computer cursor from a start location to one of three targets
      displayed on the computer monitor. Participants will need to make forward, rightward or
      leftward foot movements to guide the cursor to one of the targets. The task itself is similar
      to the daily computer task performed by a hand mouse. In each visit, it will take
      approximately a total of 45 minutes to complete a set of leg reaching task. Several
      one-minute rest breaks will be provided as needed during test. Participants will then be
      asked to come back for the second visit within 1-14 days later to repeat the same task.
      Throughout practice, participants will learn how to control the cursor using their feet. So
      the investigators can compare the learning capacity over two visits to best indicate the
      change in the learning capacity over time.

      The investigators also want to know if participants can learn this motor skill faster with
      cutaneous brain stimulation. Participants will receive weak electrical brain stimulation for
      20 minutes during leg skill learning. The brain stimulation device that the investigators
      used is similar to the commercial product seen in the TV/magazine, called &quot;transcutaneous
      electrical Nerve stimulation&quot; in which electrical current is delivered by electrodes for pain
      relief and muscle stimulation. In this study, two electrodes, one placed on the top of the
      scalp and one placed on the forehead, will deliver weak electrical current for 20 minutes.
      Because the investigators set the current intensity at a very low level, it will not cause
      any muscle twitches and participants may only feel little tingling sensation in the first 10
      seconds. Most of the time, participants likely become accustomed to the stimulation and no
      longer feel the stimulation throughout the rest of the session.

      Phase II Study - This study is an expanded version of Phase I study. Participants will be
      asked to complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a
      four-week period. It will take about a total of 18 hours of the time to complete all training
      sessions (1.5 hour for each visit/training for a total of 12 visits). Participants will need
      to wear short-sleeve t-shirt, shorts, and a pair of sneakers for training. Before and after
      four-week training, the investigators will measure how well the nervous system works and how
      well the participant walks (see details as follows). One week after completion of four-week
      training, participants will be asked to come back to repeat the same tests. The investigators
      will compare changes in the learning capacity and motor function before and after four-week
      training, and at one week after completion of training to best indicate permanent changes in
      the learning capacity and motor function over time.

      During each visit, the investigators will ask participants to continue learning a leg
      movement task same as the Phase I study. The investigators will also ask participants to
      learn a similar leg task, call stepping task during standing. This stepping task is very
      similar to the leg task in the Phase I study, but is a more advanced task that requires a
      good standing balance. The task is to control a computerized marker attached to the foot and
      move a computer cursor from a start location to one of three targets displayed on the
      computer monitor. Participants will need to make forward, rightward or leftward stepping
      movements to guide the cursor to one of the targets. The task itself is similar to stepping
      motion during walking. In each visit, it will take approximately a total of 1.5 hour to
      complete two sets of leg task training during sitting and standing. Same brain stimulation
      used in the Phase I study (see above) will be delivered during the middle of the exercise
      training. Several one-minute rest breaks will be provided as needed during training.
      Participants will then be asked to come to the laboratory three times per week for four weeks
      in order to complete 12 training sessions.

      Outcome measures - For the measurement of brain activity, the investigators will put a
      recording electrode on the calf muscle in one leg. Five low-intensity brain stimulation will
      be delivered to the scalp to trigger the motor responses. Most of the time, participants will
      feel single muscle twitch due to the stimulation. It would take a total of 10 minutes to
      finish data collection. For the measurement of nerve activity, the investigators will put a
      recording electrode on the calf muscle in one leg. Low-intensity electrical stimulation will
      be delivered to a nerve behind the knee to trigger motor responses. A series of small tendon
      vibration stimuli will be delivered during electrical stimulation to determine the
      sensitivity of the nerve. Most of the time, participants will feel nothing or just light
      tingling sensation in the stimulated area. It would take a total of 40 minutes to finish data
      collection. Several one-minute rest breaks will be provided as needed during test. For the
      measurement of walking, the investigators will put sticky markers on both legs and ask
      participants to walk normally across a 10-meter walkway for five trials. It would take
      approximately a total of 30 minutes to finish data collection. Several one-minute rest breaks
      will be provided as needed during test. For the stepping reaction time test, subjects will
      stand on the force plates and will be instructed to step forward onto a target marked on the
      floor as soon as they sense electrical stimulation delivered to the posterior of the leg. It
      would take approximately a total of 40 minutes to finish data collection. Several one-minute
      rest breaks will be provided as needed during test.

    <description>To examine the degree of stimulation-induced improvements in learning capacity between three groups: stroke group, healthy young group, and healthy older group. Up to date, most studies have investigated the effects of brain stimulation on hand skill improvements in healthy young adults; little is known about stimulation-induced improvement in the &quot;leg&quot; skill improvement in stroke survivors as well as in older healthy adults. The investigators will answer the question: &quot;Do stroke survivors improve leg skill learning at a comparable rate as healthy young and older adults after brain stimulation &quot;transcranial direct current stimulation&quot; (tDCS)?&quot;</description>

    <description>To determine the effect of brain stimulation (tDCS) on functional improvements in stroke survivors. Specifically, the investigators will compare stepping reaction time, cortical neuronal activity, peripheral nerve activity, and walking function in the stroke survivors before and after tDCS, and also compared these findings with results from healthy adults. The investigators will answer the question: &quot;Do stroke survivors shorten stepping reaction time and improve leg muscle activation and gait performance after tDCS, and these improvements are at a similar rate as compared to data collected from healthy young and older adults?&quot;</description>
