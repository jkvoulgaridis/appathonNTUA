      The investigators will record 120 patients who received general anesthesia, their EEG data
      recorded from Bispectral Index (BIS) machine for emperical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis,
      the investigators decomposed EEG signal to different oscillations and tried to observe the
      differences between hypnotic medications through EEG analysis.

      The electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive medical technique for monitoring and
      recording the electrical activity of brain. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was proposed to
      decompose EEG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) which can obtain instantaneous
      frequency data and work well for data that is nonstationary and nonlinear.

      The relationship between frontal EEG patterns and hypnotics remain poorly understood. The
      investigators only can tell the increase in frontal EEG power and shift power to lower
      frequencies during general anesthesia from publications. The investigators are going to
      decompose EEG with HHT and find the energy shift during general anesthesia, compare with
      different anesthetics.
