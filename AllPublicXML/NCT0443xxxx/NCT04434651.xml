      This study aims to investigate the effect of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block on ICP and
      arterio- jugular venous oxygen difference (AJVDO2) and jugular bulb oxygen saturation
      (SjVO2). Throughout this study, the efficacy of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block as scalp block
      in craniotomy operation will be assessed, and the effect of SPGB on cerebral hemostasis
      during craniotomy will be evaluated by monitoring of both ICP, AJVDO2 and SjVO2.

      This study was performed in the Neurosurgical operating room and included 20 patients
      allocated into two groups: the treatment group (block group) and the control group (non-block
      group). 10 patients enrolled in block group and 10 patients in non-block group.

      Intraoperative ICP monitoring by subdural ICP monitors will be done every 20 minutes in both
      block and non- block groups until craniotomy has been occurred, then at the time of closure
      of the dura . Arterio- jugular venous oxygen difference and Jugular venous bulb oxygen
      saturation changes will be recorded every 20 minutes in block and non- block groups
      throughout time of the surgery.

    <description>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block using 4% lidocaine Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block is performed by a hollow culture swab that is connected with a 21-gauge syringe filled with three ml 4% lidocaine, inserted parallel to the floor of the nose until resistance is felt. The swab is at the posterior pharyngeal wall superior to the middle turbinate. The applicator was kept in the nostril for five to ten mins. The same procedure is done also in the second nostril</description>
