    <textblock>
      Background:

      Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major public health problem worldwide, notably due to
      excess mortality and an increase in the length of hospital stay. Antibiotics that can be used
      to treat these infections are limited. Daptomycin is one of the most widely used antibiotics
      for the treatment of infections with gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, it is only administered intravenously (IV). It is
      therefore interesting to find new routes of administration in order to widen the
      possibilities of using daptomycin, especially in people who have difficulties with the venous
      approach.

      Methods/design:

      In a randomized, single blinded, crossover, noninferiority study in the CHU of Caen, the
      investigators aim to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence between the subcutaneous
      and the intravenous route of daptomycin in healthy volunteers. They will conclude the
      bioequivalence if the confidence interval of the area under the curve obtained is entirely
      within the interval [80% - 125%].

      Discussion:

      This clinical trial could, if bioequivalence is demonstrated, lead to the completion of a
      clinical trial in infected patients in order to assess the efficacy and safety of daptomycin
      by the subcutaneous route.
