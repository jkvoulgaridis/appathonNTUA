  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of an audio recording containing positive
      suggestion as a means to provide needed psychological support to critically ill patients in a
      feasible and reliable manner.

    <textblock>
      Following screening and consenting processes, patients will be randomized to enroll in
      interventional or control groups. The interventional group will listen to an audio recording
      of psychological support based on positive suggestion for about 30 min each day via
      headphones. At the time of ICU discharge, patients will be administered validated
      questionnaires to screen for symptoms of anxiety/depression (HADS), PTSD (IES-r), cognitive
      dysfunction (MOCA-blind), as well as evaluation of health status (EQ-5D). Six months post ICU
      discharge, patients will again be contacted and repeat the assessment with above
      questionnaires. Scores on the questionnaires will be compared between the groups at the two
      times points. Patient demographic data will also be obtained and assessed to contextualize
      study findings.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized 1:1 to intervention vs standard care. Using data from our prior observational study, mean (SD) HADS-Anxiety subscale was 7.3 (4.1) among these subjects (coefficient of variation = 4.1/7.3 = 0.56). A sample size of 25 per arm provides 90% power to detect a 40% decrease in mean HADS-A, assuming a two-sided t-test with unequal variances at alpha level 0.05 and conservatively assuming a coefficient of variation of 0.6. A total 62 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to allow for 20% mortality and dropout.
The analysis will compare 6 month HADS-A by treatment arms using ANCOVA. The analysis will be conducted under a modified intention to treat principle, with subjects analyzed according to randomized arm, but excluding patients who die before follow up. Additional outcomes including HADS-D, MoCA-blind, and EQ-5D will be analyzed similarly using ANCOVA, and IES-R subscore&gt;1.6 will be analyzed by Chi-square test.</intervention_model_description>
