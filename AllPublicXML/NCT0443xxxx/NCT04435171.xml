  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to investigate the quality of life in patients with end-stage renal
      disease who underwent open or robot-assisted renal transplantation. Also, the investigators
      sought to determine the parameters which can affect the quality of life in these patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent open or robot-assisted renal transplantation at Bakirkoy Sadi Konuk
      Training and Research Hospital between June 2016 and December 2018 constituted the target
      population of this study. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the
      patient group was divided into two groups as per the surgical technique (i.e., open vs.
      robot-assisted). Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative data of all patients were
      collected prospectively. The quality of life of the patients was assessed preoperatively and
      on the postoperative 30th day
