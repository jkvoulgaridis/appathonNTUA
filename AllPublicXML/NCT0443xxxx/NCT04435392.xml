      This study includes a dose escalation part and a dose extension part.

      In the dose-increasing part, a multicenter, dose-increasing, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-parallel control design was adopted. Subjects were enrolled into different dose
      groups in sequence according to the inclusion sequence, and each group was scheduled to give
      the drug for 8 weeks.Subjects in each group were observed for 4 weeks after administration.
      When the number of ≥2 grade drug-related adverse events (cases) was less than 50%, subjects
      in the next group could be enrolled.Otherwise, IDMC will decide whether to continue the next
      set of tests.Subjects in each group were randomly assigned to receive either Jackatinib cream
      (6 cases) or placebo (2 cases) in a ratio of 3 to 1.A total of 32 subjects are expected to be
      enrolled in 6 centers.

      The dose expansion was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-parallel control
      design in which subjects were randomly assigned to 3 groups (1 placebo group and 2
      experimental drugs group).It is estimated that a total of 60 subjects will be enrolled in
      about 15 centers. This part is divided into two stages.Stage 2 test (9 ~ 16 weeks) :
      Extension test.
