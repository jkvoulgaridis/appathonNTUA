      In this multicenter cohort study, the stability of non-displaced Lisfranc injuries as well as
      their outcomes will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the tarsometatarsal joints (&quot;Lisfranc injuries&quot;) that are non-displaced on
      non-weightbearing radiographs and CT are common injuries. To refer these injuries to the
      right treatment, evaluating their stability is essential. For this purpose, both
      weightbearing radiographs and stress fluoroscopy have been proposed. However, there is no
      consensus concerning both the use and interpretation of weightbearing radiographs and no
      standardized technique and interpretation of stress fluoroscopy in non-displaced Lisfranc
      injuries.

      In the current study, participants will be assigned to non-operative or operative treatment
      based on Lisfranc joint stability evaluation by weightbearing radiographs.

      All Patients with negative weightbearing radiographs will be treated conservatively. In
      addition, their injured feet will be evaluated by manual stress fluoroscopy. Depending on the
      result of the stress fluoroscopy (positive/negative), the conservatively treated patients
      will be assigned to 2 cohorts, whose outcomes will be compared.

      Patients with positive weightbearing radiographs will be treated operatively by minimally
      invasive stabilization of the midfoot (eg. isolated &quot;homerun screw&quot;). The operatively treated
      patients will be followed up as an independent cohort.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are evaluated by weightbearing radiographs. Patients with no signs of dislocation on the weightbearing radiographs will undergo stress fluoroscopy. Patients with negative stress fluoroscopy are allocated to Cohort 1, patients with positive stress fluoroscopy are allocated to Cohort 2.
The study design is a non-inferiority study, proving to show that the outcomes of Cohort 2 are non-inferior compared to Cohort 1.
Patients with positive weightbearing radiographs (interval between medial cuneiform and base of second metatarsal increased by &gt; 2 mm compared to the contralateral side) will be operated with minimally invasive stabilization (eg. isolated &quot;homerun screw&quot;) and followed up prospectively as a single cohort (Cohort 3).</intervention_model_description>
