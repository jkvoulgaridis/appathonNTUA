  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of an
      implanted wireless sensory enabled highly intuitive controlled prosthetic device.

      The study involves a surgical implant of cuff electrodes on the residual nerves in the
      amputated limb, and muscle recording electrodes in muscles. These will be connected to an
      implanted stimulator. The stimulator will connect wirelessly to an advanced prosthesis. This
      may allow the user to move the prosthetic hand intuitively and feel what the prosthesis is
      touching.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is designed as a randomized clinical trial in a small population of subjects to answer the primary question of whether use of a sensory-enabled, high degree-of-freedom (SE-ihDOF) prosthesis with the iSens system improves the subject's quality of life compared to use of their prescribed state-of-art (SOA) prosthesis</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Consists of 23 items related to perceived limitations due to the prosthesis, restrictions in abilities, the attitudes or reactions of others, activity interference due to emotional problems, and various aspects of the participant's emotional state. Score is the sum of the scores for the 23 items (0 - 92). A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
