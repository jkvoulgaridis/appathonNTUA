  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the routine clinical care of patients who have been
      diagnosed with breast cancer and have undergone Guardant360 testing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and have undergone Guardant360 testing
      will be approached regarding participation in the study. After being informed about the study
      and potential risks, all patients providing informed consent and access to their medical
      records, will provide a list of their health care providers related to their cancer
      treatment. Data related to their routine clinical care will be abstracted from medical
      records.

    <description>The Primary Outcome measure is a composite endpoint of: overall survival, progression events, and subjects lost-to-follow-up
Overall Survival is the length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive.</description>

    <measure>Progression Events</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months post Guardant360 testing</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Outcome measure is a composite endpoint of: overall survival, progression events, and subjects lost-to-follow-up
Progression events (or progression-free survival) is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse.</description>

The length of time from date of study consent to date subject exited study prematurely due being considered lost-to-follow-up (ex. lack of response following consent)</description>
