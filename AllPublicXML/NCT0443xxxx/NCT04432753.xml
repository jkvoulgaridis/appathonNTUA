  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This online randomized controlled trial seeks to determine if inclusion of incidental
      findings information in a lung cancer screening decision aid affects screening intent among
      screening-eligible individuals. Participants will view either a decision aid with incidental
      findings information or without and indicate their intent to pursue lung cancer screening.

      Hypothesis: Inclusion of incidental findings in a decision aid will decrease intent to screen
      among participants.

    <measure>Percentage of individuals who plan to pursue lung cancer screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by a survey item where participants indicate their response to a statement of whether they plan to pursue lung cancer screening, with answer choices being strongly agree, agree, disagree and strongly disagree.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score on scale of lung cancer screening knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Lung cancer screening knowledge tested by 6 multiple choice questions on facts of the benefit and harms of screening. The questions will be answered before and after participants watch a lung cancer screening decision aid. Scores will be determined by the number of correct answers for questions.</description>

    <measure>Mean rating of benefit and harms of screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate (Likert 1-5 scale with 1 being less important and 5 being more important) 6 lung cancer screening benefits and harms on importance to them.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Time Lung Cancer Screening Benefit and Harms are ranked first</measure>
