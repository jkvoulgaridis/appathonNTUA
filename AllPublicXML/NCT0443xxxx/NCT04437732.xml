  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, you will wear an invesetigational contact lens, Apioc-P or Apioc-PT, the way
      you wear your current contact lenses for approximately one month (no more than 35 days).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apioc-P and Apioc-PT is an investigational contact lens, which means it has not been approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although the contact lens material, called
      Definitive 74, is already approved and marketed for contact lenses that are similar to
      Apioc-P and Apioc-PT. In this study, participants will wear an Apioc-P and Apioc-PT contact
      lens the way they wear their current contact lenses for approximately one month (no more than
      35 days).

      Participation in this study will include a minimum of four study visits. The first will last
      up to 90 minutes, the second will last up to 45 minutes, the third will last up to 45
      minutes, and the final visit will be up to 90 minutes. If the lens does not appear to be
      fitting properly at the second visit, then another lens will be ordered for participants and
      they will be asked to return for an additional visit for up to 45 minutes. Up to 60 subjects
      will participate in this study.

          3. At least 40 years of age and no more than 70 years of age.

          4. ≤ 4.00 D of corneal astigmatism.

          5. ≤ 4.00 D of refractive astigmatism.

          6. Refractive error range +20.00 DS to -20.00 DS

          7. Keratometry readings within 40 to 50D.

          8. Clear, healthy corneas with no irregular astigmatism.

          9. Normal, healthy conjunctiva in both eyes.

         10. Free of active ocular disease. Refractive error and presbyopia are permitted.

         11. Be a current or former (within the last 12 months) contact lens wearer.

         12. Best-corrected near and distance visual acuity better than or equal to 20/25.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Irregular corneal astigmatism.

          2. Corneal scarring unless off line-of-site and well healed.

          3. Pinguecula, pterygium, or other conjunctival thickness abnormalities that would
             interfere with soft contact lens wear.

          4. Recent use of any ocular pharmaceutical treatments, including daily artificial tears,
             in the two weeks prior to the examination. Use of artificial tears less than 3 times

          7. History of strabismus or eye movement disorder, including exophoria at near that is 4D
             or greater than at far, and a receded near point of convergence break that is 6 cm or
             greater.

          8. Active allergies that may inhibit contact lens wear.

          9. Upper eyelid margin at or above the superior limbus.
