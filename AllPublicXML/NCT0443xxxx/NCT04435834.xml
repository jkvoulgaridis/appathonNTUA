  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial in patients who require clinical anesthesia. The main
      purpose of this study is to understand whether there are differences in the cerebral blood
      flow, and oxygen metabolism affected by two types of anesthesia: propofol or sevoflurane.
      Subjects who require clinical anesthesia for a clinical MRI and for whom the use of propofol
      and sevoflurane are in clinical equipoise will be offered to have the anesthesia they will
      receive during their MRI randomized. All eligible subjects will be asked to provide informed
      consent before participating in the study.

      This is a randomized controlled trial in patients who require clinical anesthesia. The main
      purpose of this study is to understand whether there are differences in the cerebral blood
      flow, and oxygen metabolism affected by two types of anesthesia: propofol or sevoflurane.
      Subjects who require clinical anesthesia for a clinical MRI and for whom the use of propofol
      and sevoflurane are in clinical equipoise will be offered to have the anesthesia they will
      receive during their MRI randomized. All eligible subjects will be asked to provide informed
      consent before participating in the study.

      Treatment:

      All patients will be screened to ensure propofol and sevoflurane are in clinical equipoise.
      Those who meet eligibility criteria, and who undergo the informed consent, will be randomize
      to receive propofol or sevoflurane during their MRI. Standard-of-care anesthesia safety, dose
      and monitoring will not be changed. During their MRI, additional images will be acquired that
      measure the cerebral blood flow and cerebral venous oxygenation. These additional images will
      take up-to 10 extra minutes to acquire. This will increase the duration each subject spends
      under anesthesia, and in the MRI scanner by up-to a total of 10 extra minutes.

      Safety Assessment:

      To ensure that either propofol or sevoflurane are in clinical equipoise, all patients will be
      screened by an anesthesiologist. The experiment will occur in the standard-of-care clinical
      MRI environment. All patient safety and monitoring will remain in place. Throughout the
      induction, maintenance and recovery from anesthesia, all procedures will occur in the
      standard of care environment and will be overseen by trained clinical personnel.

      Efficacy Assessment:

      Cerebral blood flow and metabolism MRIs will be collected from all subjects.
