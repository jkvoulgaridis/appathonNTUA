  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the effects of trunk exercise on unstable surfaces on trunk control and
      balance for persons in the sub-acute stage of stroke. The hypothesis was that, compared to
      upper limb exercises in well supported sitting position, this exercise would lead to better
      trunk control and sitting and standing balance. The results supported the hypothesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inpatients in the sub-acute stage of stroke were randomly assigned to receive upper limb
      range of motion exercises in well supported sitting position or trunk exercises on unstable
      surfaces in supine and sitting, 30 min per session, 2 sessions per week for 6 weeks, in
      addition to their daily conventional stroke rehabilitation. Sensorimotor functions, including
      hand grip strength, plantar sensitivity, stroke rehabilitation assessment of movement and
      Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor scale, and clinical outcome assessments, including Trunk
      Impairment Scale and 6-meter walk test, were conducted by a blinded assessor. Biomechanical
      outcome measures included center of pressure area while maintaining static posture and peak
      displacement while leaning forward, and the average speed of the unaffected arm raising (to
      represent the ability to provide a stable foundation for focal movement). These measures were
      taken in sitting without foot support, sitting with foot support and standing to reflect
      trunk control, sitting balance and standing balance, respectively.

    <description>Participants would receive exercises on unstable surface. Started from supine position, participants had abdominal drawer-in maneuver with soft foam under the pelvic. Lower trunk rotation, bridging and abdominal muscles isometric contraction exercises were also used in this exercise during supine position, with different unstable surfaces used. Including soft foam under the feet, then progressed to BOSU ball under the feet, then progressed to the a BOSU ball under the feet combined with pelvic on soft foam. During sitting, BOSU ball and Swiss ball were used as unstable surface. Pelvic anterior-posterior tilt, lateral tilting, rotation, lifting, and stepping with arm swing were used in this position.</description>
