  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often have narrowed microbial diversity and
      altered composition and function of the gut microbiome. We anticipate the anti-inflammatory
      diet, when compared with the usual diet, to produce favorable changes in these multi-omics
      profiles. These findings will provide insight into the interactions between diet and host
      biology, while providing clues on the mechanisms of diet therapy's effect and CD
      pathogenesis.

      A randomized controlled trial of the anti-inflammatory whole food diet versus usual diet for
      the induction of remission in 104 adults with mild-to-moderate Crohn's Disease (CD). The
      anti-inflammatory whole food diet will be compared to participants usual diet for
      understanding its effects on achieving clinical remission, clinical response, reduction in
      serological and fecal markers of inflammation, and improvement in patient-reported outcomes,
      such as physical activity, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, social
      satisfaction, and quality of life. The study will involve collection of blood and fecal
      specimens to evaluate the effects of the anti-inflammatory diet on the gut microbiome,
      bacterial metabolome, innate immune markers, and fecal microRNA profiles. The participants
      will be placed on anti-inflammatory diet for 8 weeks and assessed every 2 weeks for
      adherence.

    <description>Included food items will include a defined minimum diversity of fruits, vegetables, and nuts based on complementary phytonutrient contents, particularly those rich in phenolic compounds such as ellagitannins and sulforaphanes. Selected herbs (e.g., curcumin), fermented foods, fats (e.g., avocado), and oils (e.g., olive oil) will be permitted or encouraged. Recommended portions of complex carbohydrates (50% - 60%) and lean proteins (20% - 30%) will form the basis of weight-based caloric needs. The goal is to have 5 servings of vegetables, 2 fruits per day, and 5 vegetable color groups per week. Vegetables with high insoluble fiber content will be cooked instead of eaten raw.</description>
