  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study intends to use a mixed method approach(both qualitative and quantitative)
      to describe and analyse the levels, patterns, and correlates of physical activity((PA),
      sedentary behaviour(SB), and physical fitness(PF) profiles of primary school children in
      Lagos state, Nigeria. The study is in four phases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase1 is a scoping review of literature of the level of compliance of all the countries in
      sub-saharan Africa to the Global observatory on physical activity(GOPA) recommendation on the
      minimum level of daily physical activity to reduce incidence of non communicable chronic
      diseases e.g. hypertension, diabetes, obesity etc.

      Phase2 is a concurrent mixed method which will explore parents and other stakeholders
      awareness, understanding and perspectives on PA,SB, and PF among primary school children in
      Lagos, Nigeria.

      Phase 3 is a cross sectional study which will investigate levels, patterns and correlates
      among physical activity, sedentary behaviour and physical fitness profile of primary school
      children in Lagos, Nigeria.

      Phase 4 is development of physical activity guideline for primary school children in Lagos,
      Nigeria.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Youth activity profile(YAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>About 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self reported questionnaire. It is a physical activity assessment tool designed to assess children and adolescents' physical activity. it is for children between 10-12 years. Three indices are being measured from YAP. These are physical activity at school index(PASI), Physical activity at home index(PAHI) and Sedentary behaviour index(SBI).It consists of 15 total items each scored on a 5- point scale. A higher overall activity score is reflective of a higher level of physical activity(or a greater amount of sedentary behaviour in the case of the SBI. It is on a 5 point scale with 1 being the minimum and 5 maximum to assess physical activity at school.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Children physical activity questionnaire(CPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>for activities over the past seven days.</time_frame>
    <description>It assess mode, frequency and duration of physical activity and sedentary activities. The no of activities run from 1 to 5. 1 being the minimum while 5 is maximum no of days. throughout all domains over the past 7 days. The more the activities participated in each domain the higher the level of physical activity and the lower the sedentary behaviour.</description>
