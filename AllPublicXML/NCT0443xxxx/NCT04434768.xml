  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human assessment of safety of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
      cells (UCMSCs) in patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke via a combination of intra arterial
      (IA) and intravenous (IV) stem cell administration. The novelty of the current UMSC01
      treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via
      IA and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not
      predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be
      minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and
      concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive
      patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion.

      Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke in the United
      States.Stroke is a leading cause of death, along with cancer and coronary heart disease, and
      the most common cause of physical disability in adults. Moreover, stroke causes a greater
      loss of healthy life years, as measured in disability adjusted life years, than other
      diseases.

      This product is a new cell therapy product for treating Stroke and produced by Ever Supreme
      Bio Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its
      effectiveness for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke. The UMSC01 has been
      demonstrated its effective effect in the animal models of stroke in the current studies. The
      acute stroke rats receiving intracerebral UMSC01 transplantation showed significantly
      improved neurological function compared to vehicle-treated control rats.
