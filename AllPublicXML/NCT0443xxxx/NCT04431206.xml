  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of participants that will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of oxytocin
      (naturally occurring hormone that is made in the brain).

      In this study healthy volunteers and people with knee arthritis so severe that they may need
      joint replacement are recruited for a one day study. Each study participant will have an IV
      catheter placed. After placement of the IV catheter oxytocin will be given by IV infusion.
      Investigators will perform some tests to evaluate how oxytocin changes perceptions on the
      skin. Investigators will study a painful perception by placing a probe on the skin and
      heating it to 113 degrees Fahrenheit (F) for 5 minutes. Each study participant will score any
      pain that is experienced on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find that pain rises during the
      5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0 to 10 scale.

      The main goal of the study is to determine the effect of oxytocin during and after a fixed
      rate intravenous infusion on reduction in pain to a sustained heat stimulus in order to
      generate a model for peripheral analgesia.

      In this study healthy people or those with knee arthritis so severe that they may need joint
      replacement are recruited for a one day study. Study participants will come to the Clinical
      Research Unit (CRU) and one intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted in the forearm for
      oxytocin infusion. Participants in this study will receive oxytocin at a steady rate for 30
      minutes. This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in the
      Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Core part of this application. Mathematics will be
      utilized to calculate how quickly oxytocin moves from the blood to where it reduces pain.

      Investigators will also do a pain test to determine how much oxytocin reduces pain. For this
      Investigators will place a probe on the skin and heat it to 113 degrees for 5 minutes. Study
      participants will score any pain they feel on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find that pain
      rises during the 5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0 to 10
      scale.

          2. Generally in good health as determined by the Principal Investigator based on prior
             medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1, 2, or 3.

          3. For healthy volunteers, normal blood pressure (systolic 90-140 mmHg; diastolic 50-90
             mmHg) resting heart rate 45-100 beats per minute) without medication. For knee
             arthritis subjects, normal blood pressure or, for those with hypertension, pressure
             controlled with anti-hypertensives and with a resting heart rate 45-100 beats per
             minute.

          4. Female subjects of child-bearing potential and those &lt; 1 year post-menopausal, must be
             practicing highly effective methods of birth control such as hormonal methods (e.g.,
             combined oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives), double barrier
             methods (e.g., condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring plus spermicidal jellies or
             cream), or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse for a minimum of 1 full
             cycle before study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypersensitivity, allergy, or significant reaction to any ingredient of Pitocin®

          2. Any disease, diagnosis, or condition (medical or surgical) that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk (active gynecologic
             disease in which increased tone would be detrimental e.g., uterine fibroids with
             ongoing bleeding), compromise the subject's compliance with study procedures, or
             compromise the quality of the data

          3. Women who are pregnant (positive result for serum pregnancy test at screening visit),
             women who are currently nursing or lactating, women that have been pregnant within 2
             years

          4. Subjects with neuropathy, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus, or taking benzodiazepines
             or pain medications on a daily basis.
