      The Westlake Gut Microbiome Project (WeGut) is a prospective cohort study initiated by the
      Laboratory of Human Nutrition and Epidemiology, Westlake University. This project aims to
      characterize the gut microbiome among Chinese populations from different regions of China,
      and explore the relationships between gut microbiota and human health. Human fecal samples
      will be collected from the participants and muli-omics detection and analysis will be
      performed.

      In the first phase of the WeGut (also a pilot study), the investigators will create a
      longitudinal datasets from a students-based cohort in Westlake University. Information about
      demography, life style, diet, medical history, physical activity will be recorded, clinical
      examinations such as blood glucose, body composition and electroencephalogram will be
      examined, and biological samples including blood, saliva, urine and feces, will be collected.

      In the second phase, the investigators will expand to include eligible participants from at
      least 10 provinces of China, which are located in different regions. Similar to the
      procedures in phase 1 stage, information about demography, life style, diet, medical history,
      physical activity will be recorded, clinical examinations will be performed, and biological
      samples will be collected.
