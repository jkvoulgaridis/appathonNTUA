  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stillbirth (SB) is a devastating complication of pregnancy and contributes to over 2 million
      deaths globally every year. Over 20 million infants are born every year with low birth weight
      (LBW), which is associated with a twenty times increased risk of death in the first year of
      life and high rates of short- and long-term illnesses. Sleeping on one's back during
      pregnancy has recently emerged as a potential risk factor for LBW and SB in the medical
      literature. In high-income countries, SB rates have mostly remained the same in the past two
      decades and targeting modifiable risk factors could help reduce the number of SB and LBW in
      the population.

      When a pregnant woman sleeps on her back, her body position compresses underlying blood
      vessels and reduces blood flow to the developing baby. This body position could cause
      unpleasant symptoms for the mother and result in LBW or SB of her baby. Lying on her side or
      with a slight lateral tilt helps relieve this compression. One way to keep people off their
      back while sleeping is by using positional therapy (PT). It is a simple, safe, inexpensive
      and effective intervention for preventing people who snore or people who's breathing pauses
      during sleep from sleeping on their back. Reducing the amount of time pregnant women sleep on
      their back could help reduce SB and LBW rates. The investigators developed a PT device
      (PrenaBelt) and tested it in three clinical trials, which demonstrated that it significantly
      decreases the number of time women spend sleeping on their back. Using feedback from our
      previous research, the investigators developed five additional devices that will be tested in
      this study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the new PrenaBelt (PB2) prototypes' ability to
      reduce the amount of time pregnant women sleep on their backs in the third trimester of
      pregnancy, validate the Ajuvia Sleep Monitor, and collect feedback on the devices.

      Demonstrating that the sleeping position of pregnant women can be modified through the use of
      a simple, inexpensive PT intervention may be one of the keys to achieving significant
      reductions in LBW and late SB rates in Australia and worldwide.

    <textblock>
      The ability of the PB2 prototypes to reduce the amount of time pregnant women spend sleeping
      on their backs at night in the home setting in the third trimester of pregnancy will be
      evaluated via a consecutive, six-night, in-home, controlled, cross-over sleep study in third
      trimester pregnant women where the Ajuvia Sleep Monitor is validated against infrared video
      on the first night.

      Six nights: one control night with infrared video recording where only the sleep monitor is
      worn in passive mode to collect data on the participant's body position and five nights with
      the five different prototypes including one night where Ajuvia is in 'active' mode.

      Randomization: The order in which the five different devices will be worn in the latter 5
      nights will be determined by simple randomization. This will minimize the potential impact of
      changes to sleep across the nights resulting from familiarization with the equipment as the
      sleep tests proceed through the five non-control nights, which could bias the results.

      Cross-over: After the control (first) night, on each of the subsequent nights, the
      participants will &quot;cross over&quot; to a different PB2 device (depending on their randomization
      order) to allow each participant to act as her own control for comparison of treatment effect
      on outcomes.

      In home: conducting this study in the home setting will allow for a more accurate
      representation of sleep patterns as the participants will be in the comfort of their own bed.

      Sleep test: The maternal pelvis position will be recorded while the participants are sleeping
      using the Ajuvia device. Going to bed- and wake-times, as well as experience with each device
      will be recorded daily in a sleep diary.
