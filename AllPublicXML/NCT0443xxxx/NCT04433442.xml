  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plaque Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which skin cells build up and develop
      scaly red and white patches on the skin. It is caused by an overactive immune system where
      the body attacks healthy tissue by mistake. This study will evaluate how safe risankizumab is
      for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and to assess change in disease symptoms.

      Risankizumab is an approved drug for the treatment of psoriasis. Around 3000 adult
      participants with a moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had been prescribed risankizumab
      by their doctor will be enrolled in this study in multiple sites across Korea. The sample
      size for this study is a requirement by local authorities.

      Participants will receive risankizumab prefilled syringe for injection for 52 weeks as
      prescribed by their physician.

      There is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this study. All study visits
      will occur during routine clinical practice and participants will be followed for 52 weeks.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug.</description>
