  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Precise medicine&quot; is also called &quot;personal medicine&quot;. With the development of big data
      database, genetic testing and artificial intelligence, the concept of precision medicine has
      been applied to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of different diseases. Traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) has traditionally emphasis on personalized medicine, according to each
      person's body constitution, through discriminatory treatment and personalized treatment
      methods. Chinese medicine doctors collect patients' information to distinguish the type of
      TCM pattern, and then according to the different types of diagnosis of traditional Chinese
      medicine to decide of using herbs, acupuncture, massage and other treatment strategies.
      However, lacking of objective data of traditional Chinese medicine, the current research on
      precision medicine in Chinese medicine is still limited. The aim of this study is to
      establish a big database of traditional Chinese precision medicine, and use the patients with
      hypertension as the population to conduct research on precision medicine in Chinese
      medicine.This study will combine the TCM body constitutional questionnaire, tongue diagnosis,
      pulse diagnosis, Chinese medicine immunoassay and genetic testing. In addition, the
      information providing by the medical electronic medical record system of China Medical
      University Hospital will be connected, which include modern medical diagnosis, treatment,
      blood and biochemical analysis and imaging. We will combine the big data analysis and
      artificial intelligence interpretation technology to explore the correlation between
      different TCM syndrome types and gene variations in patients with hypertension and establish
      a database of TCM precision medicine. We will also conduct the education training and
      symposium to train TCM precision medical talents and promote public understanding of TCM
      precision medicine. This project will establish a database of traditional Chinese medicine
      precision medicine to provide the correlation between different TCM pattern types of patients
      with hypertension, the reaction to different herbal medicine, and gene mutation, and provide
      reference for TCM clinicians.
