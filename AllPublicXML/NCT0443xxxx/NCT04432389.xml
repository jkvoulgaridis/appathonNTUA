  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the majority of tibial fractures heal normally, some fractures may not heal within
      the usual time frame and is known as delayed bone healing within 4 to 6 months and absence of
      bone healing within 9 to 12 months in the most severe case of. Several factors can increase
      the risks of delayed healing complications like, for example, smoking, violent shocks (for
      example, due to a road accident) or even the type of fracture (an open fracture). The
      location of the fracture is also an important factor: among the bones of the arms and legs,
      the tibia is known for being the most at risk for complications. At tibial fracture with
      several risk factors could lead to delayed complications and interfere with patient daily
      life and reduce the quality of life.

      The study drug, ALLOB®, is constituted of bone cells produced from the bone marrow of healthy
      adult donors. Preclinical studies have shown that ALLOB® cells are capable of forming bone
      and repairing fractures. When directly injected into a fracture, ALLOB® should therefore
      promote the healing of the fracture by re-establishing a healthy environment and stimulating
      bone production. To date, there is no treatment for fractures considered at risk of delayed
      complications. The current practice on diagnosis of complications is to wait at least 6-12
      months before considering alternative interventions to promote fracture healing. The
      injection of ALLOB® quickly after the fracture should stimulate bone healing, reduce healing
      time, reduce complications, and improve the quality of life for the patient. ALLOB® has
      already shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness in the treatment of delayed bone healing
      fractures (ALLOB-DU1 clinical trial), including tibial fractures (8 patients). With this
      study, the Sponsor will evaluate whether ALLOB® promotes the healing of tibial fractures
      compared with placebo.
