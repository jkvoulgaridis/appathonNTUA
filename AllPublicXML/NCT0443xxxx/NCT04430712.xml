  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators plan to test whether Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) treatment
      leads to an accelerated progression of atherosclerosis in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer. Atherosclerosis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease and these same checkpoints
      being targeted for cancer are critical negative regulators of atherosclerosis in animal and
      cellular models. Aortic plaque progression will be compared between cases (on ICI) and
      controls from pre-ICI to post-ICI among patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Groups will
      be matched for age, cancer type and stage and cardiovascular risk factors. Traditional
      markers of cardiovascular (CVD) risk and cancer-specific factors (ICI mono- and combination
      therapy, number of cycles, occurrence of immune-related adverse events, chest radiation,
      steroid use) will be associated with the change in aortic plaque volume.
