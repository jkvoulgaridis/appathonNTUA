  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project focuses on embedding the participants' own diabetes data into state-of-the-art
      technology platforms to constitute a novel educational simulation interface for
      decision-support in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) — the Web-based Simulation Tool (WST).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Web-based Simulation Tool (WST) allows patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) to not only
      visualize their data, but also to explore changes to their meals and insulin parameters, and
      easily estimate their potential clinical impact. WST is an educational tool, and as such, it
      does not have prescriptive power. This platform collects glucose, insulin and meal data from
      the participants' insulin pump, and generates personalized models of their glucose
      metabolism. Both data collection and model personalization are backend processes, that is,
      without user intervention.

      Participants can interact with WST through a user interface (UI) that is equipped with a
      dashboard page, where they can:

      (i) select a particular date range using a calendar to visualize their historical glucose
      control, such as glucose traces, and time in range;

      (ii) control the amount of information on the screen — users can show/hide more details, such
      as glucose variability;

      (iii) select different insulin therapy parameters: basal rate, insulin sensitivity factor,
      and carbohydrate ratio;

      (iv) change their values by moving a slider;

      (v) select informed meals within the selected date range, and modify their time and size by
      moving a slider;

      (vi) run a simulation with the modified insulin therapy parameters and meals by tapping a
      button;

      (vii) save the insulin and meal settings of the simulations to compare multiple
      configurations; and

      (viii) generate a report from the selected simulation, comparing both original and simulated
      or replay data.

    <measure>Technology Expectation and Technology Acceptance Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Technology Expectation (TE) and Technology Acceptance (TA) questionnaires are based on the Bionic Pancreas User Opinion Survey. They were tailored on WST and are made of 27 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The items in each questionnaire are almost identical; however, TE questions are in the future tense while TA questions are in the past tense. Participants will be asked to provide their expectation and evaluation regarding ease of use, trustworthy and usefulness of the system. The items in each questionnaire yield to two scores (burdens and benefits), each one is computed as the mean item score converted into a percentage. The TA questionnaire also includes four items that are not part of the standard questionnaire, but will investigate the participants' interaction with WST from a time perspective and assess if they modified their insulin therapy using WST as a source of information.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Distress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) is a 17-item scale that yields a total diabetes distress score plus 4 subscale scores: Emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress and physician distress. To score, the participants' responses to the appropriate items are summed and divided by the number of items in that scale. A mean item score &lt;2.0 is considered little or no distress, 2.0 - 2.9 is considered moderate distress, and &gt;3.0 is considered high distress.</description>

    <measure>Potential Correlation Between System Use and Changes in Treatment Satisfaction and Glucose Control</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly glucose metrics from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data will be computed as per current consensus guidelines, and used along with the scores of the questionnaires in regression analysis to infer the impact of the duration and frequency of participants' interaction with the application (predictor variables) on variations in metabolic control and treatment satisfaction (response variables).</description>
