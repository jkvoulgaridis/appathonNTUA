  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You were detected during the neonatal period for phenylketonuria and you benefited from the
      diagnosis of an adapted dietetic care, and this for a variable duration according to the
      recommendations followed at that time.

      The recommendations for the management of phenylketonuria have evolved considerably over
      time, lengthening the duration, rigor of the diet and target rates. However, few studies have
      been able to determinate the influence of metabolic balance and pediatric management on fate
      in adulthood. As you know, the current recommendations are more stringent and prolonged,
      without taking into account the pediatric data of today's adult patients.

      The objective of this study, which is aimed at all adult patients screened and followed by
      Lille University Hospital, according to the same care methods, allowing a homogeneous
      monitoring of patients, is to assess the influence of pediatric care (duration of the diet,
      metabolic balance, compliance) on the future in adulthood. This retrospective and current
      analysis work could help refine the current recommendations.
