  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe infections (sepsis) are a common cause of admission to the intensive care unit. They
      represent a significant health risk for patients in the short and medium term. They are
      particularly linked to a change in the function of immune cells. In some patients, a state of
      pseudo-dormancy of monocyte and macrophage-type immune cells, called immunosuppression of
      myeloid cells, is observed. This situation leads to a worsening of the infection, so it
      should be avoided because it represents a danger for the patient even when they ar receiving
      antibiotics. At present, these events are still very poorly understood. Research is essential
      to understand how this state of immunosuppression of myeloid cells is established in order to
      adapt existing treatments or find new ones.

      Laboratory studies on animal models of septicaemia have shown that this state of
      immunosuppression of myeloid cells is closely linked to a change in the production of energy
      by myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages). The functioning of the mitochondria (&quot;energy
      factory&quot; of the cells) in these cells is impaired. Thus, restoring mitochondrial function in
      myeloid cells could be a therapeutic solution against the immunosuppression of myeloid cells
      during severe septicaemia.

      The objective of this study is to verify whether alterations in mitochondrial function in
      myeloid cells also occur in patients with bacterial infection compared to patients without
      bacterial infection.
