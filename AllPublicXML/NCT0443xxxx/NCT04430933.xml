          -  Men and women aged 18 or older.

          -  Willingness to provide written informed consent for the study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1.

          -  Have a life expectancy of at least 6 months

             to resection with curative intent.

          -  Disease progression after receipt of a prior systemic immunotherapy such as monoclonal
             antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 or other immune modulators with or without
             chemotherapy.

          -  Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions - situated in a
             previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are
             not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the
             lesion.

          -  After dose escalation, subject must be willing to undergo pretreatment and
             on-treatment tumor biopsies (core or excisional). Note: A baseline biopsy obtained for
             other purposes (i.e., not an NC318-02 study procedure) before signing consent may be
             utilized if the subject has not had any intervening systemic therapy from the time of
             the biopsy to the start of treatment with the medical monitor's approval.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (defined as women who have not undergone
             surgical sterilization with a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and are not
             postmenopausal, defined as ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea) must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at screening. All female and male subjects of childbearing potential
             must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy or fathering children
             (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through 60 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to comprehend or unwilling to sign the Informed Consent Form.

          -  Received more than 1 prior line of systemic anti-cancer therapy for Stage IIIB/IIIc/IV
             or recurrent NSCLC disease (does not include adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatments).

               6. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN unless conjugated bilirubin ≤ ULN (conjugated
                  bilirubin only needs to be tested if total bilirubin exceeds ULN). If there is no
                  institutional ULN, then direct bilirubin must be &lt; 40% of total bilirubin.

               7. International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) &gt; 1.5 × ULN

             administration of colony-stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating
             factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or recombinant
             erythropoietin) within 14 days before the first administration of study drug.

          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following
             intervals before the first administration of study drug:

               -  ≤ 21 days for chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Subjects must also not require
                  chronic use of corticosteroids and must not have had radiation pneumonitis
                  because of a treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation to
                  non-central nervous system (CNS) disease with medical monitor approval. Note:
                  Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted medications.

               -  ≤ 7 days for immune-suppressive-based treatment for any reason. Note: Use of
                  inhaled or topical steroids or corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures is
                  permitted. Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be
                  approved after consultation with the medical monitor.

               -  ≤ 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) for prior ICI.

          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 from toxic effects of prior therapy (including prior
             immunotherapy) and/or complications from prior surgical intervention before starting
             therapy. Note: Subjects with stable chronic conditions (≤ Grade 2) not expected to
             resolve (such as neuropathy and alopecia) are exceptions and may enroll. Note:
             Subjects with a history of any grade immune-related ocular AE (e.g., episcleritis,
             scleritis, uveitis) will be excluded. Note: Subjects with a history of a Grade 3 or
             higher immune-related AE from prior immunotherapies are excluded.

          -  History of recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis attributed to prior treatment with immune
             checkpoint inhibitor therapy

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:

             mumps, rubella, chicken pox/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin,
             and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed
             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,
             FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past (i.e., with use
             of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Subjects
             who have not required systemic treatment in the past 2 years may be eligible with
             approval of the medical monitor. Note: Subjects with hyper/ hypothyroidism are
             eligible to participate. Note: Replacement and symptomatic therapies (e.g.,
             levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal
             or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) are not considered a form of systemic immune
             suppressive therapy and are allowed.

          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Note: Subjects with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least 28 days before the first dose of study
             drug and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new
             or enlarging brain metastases or CNS edema, and have not required steroids for at
             least 7 days before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Known concurrent malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or
             history of other malignancy within 2 years of study entry apart from cured basal cell
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, prostate
             intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other noninvasive or
             indolent malignancy, or cancers from which the subject has been disease-free for &gt; 1
             year, after treatment with curative intent.

          -  Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung disease.

             for HBV-DNA, HCV-RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, or anti-hepatitis B core antibody.
             Note: Subjects with no prior history of hepatitis B infection who have been vaccinated
             against hepatitis B and who have a positive antibody against hepatitis B surface
             antigen test as the only evidence of prior exposure may participate in the study.

          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1 or HIV 2 antibodies).

          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of study drug or formulation components.
