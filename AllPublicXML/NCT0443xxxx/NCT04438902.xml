  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation accounts for approximately 60% of acquired resistance to the
      first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI treatment. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, has
      become the standard therapy for NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR T790M mutation. However,
      acquired resistance to osimertinib is still inevitable and there is no established targetable
      agent currently. Thus, treatment strategy for patients with acquire resistance to osimertinib
      remains an urgent issue. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib
      combined with anlotinib in acquired EGFR T790M mutated NSCLC patients with gradual
      progression on osimertinib treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In current clinical practice, acquired resistance to osimertinib can be divided into three
      clinical modes: dramatic progression, gradual progression and local progression. For patients
      with gradual progression,there are various clinical explorations，including the continuation
      of osimertinib with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, osimertinib combined with antiangiogenic
      agents. In preclinical studies, an overactive vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) pathway and tumour angiogenesis plays a
      crucial role in the resistance to EGFR-TKIs, and the dual targeting of both the VEGF and EGFR
      pathways may prevent resistance.

      Anlotinib (AL3818) is an inhibitor targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases involved in
      tumour progression, especially VEGFR 2/3, PDGFRα/β and c-Kit. We suppose that the combination
      treatment of osimertinib and anlotinib may ameliorate acquired resistance to osimertinib.This
      is a multi-center, open, single-arm, exploratory phase 2 trial evaluating osimertinib
      combined with anlotinib in acquired EGFR T790M mutated NSCLC patients with gradual
      progression on osimertinib treatment.
