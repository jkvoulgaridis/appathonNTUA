      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TY-302
      single and the combination with Tamoxifen in dose-escalation and dose-expansion study.The
      drugs involved in this study are:

        -  TY-302

        -  Tamoxifen

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I trial. The purpose of this study is to :

        -  Test a safe and tolerable dose of TY-302 single and the combination with Tamoxifen

        -  Determine the response rate of the combination

        -  Further evaluate the safety and side effect profile for the combination of TY-302 and
           Tamoxifen.
