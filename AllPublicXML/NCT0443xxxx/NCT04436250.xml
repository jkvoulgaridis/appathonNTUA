  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a cause of chronic pain, classified by the Internal Classification of
      Diseases (ICD) as a primary chronic pain with specific diagnostic criteria established by the
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR). No treatment to its complete cure is available at
      this time, all treatments having as purpose pain relief and an improvement of quality of life
      by combining pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. One of the mechanisms proposed in
      fibromyalgia is the central sensitisation phenomenon, by which the central nervous system
      becomes &quot;hypersensitive&quot; to nociceptive or non-nociceptive stimuli. The receptor involved in
      this phenomenon is the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor to which ketamine binds. Ketamine has
      therefore been proposed as a co-treatment in chronic pain with central sensitization
      phenomena, such as fibromyalgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is a drug used for anesthesia since the 1970s, acting as an antagonist to the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor located in the central nervous system. It has two stereoisomers
      : R +ketamine and S - ketamine, the latter being about two to four times more potent.
      S-ketamine also has the advantages of producing less psychotropic effects, less tiredness and
      a lower temporary cognitive impairment than the racemic mixture at equianalgesic doses. Being
      first used as an anesthetic, in the last twenty years, ketamine's indications expanded to
      other domains, such as treatment of depression or off label use for chronic pain relief.
      Chronic pain is a multidimensional syndrome that touches 17-44% of the population of western
      countries. Fibromyalgia is a cause of chronic pain, classified by the Internal Classification
      of Diseases (ICD) as a primary chronic pain with specific diagnostic criteria established by
      the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). No treatment to its complete cure is available at
      this time, all treatments having as purpose pain relief and an improvement of quality of life
      by combining pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments (as given by the European League
      Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines). One of the mechanisms proposed in fibromyalgia is the
      central sensitisation phenomenon, by which the central nervous system becomes
      &quot;hypersensitive&quot; to nociceptive or non-nociceptive stimuli. The receptor involved in this
      phenomenon is the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor to which ketamine binds. Ketamine has
      therefore been proposed as a co-treatment in chronic pain with central sensitization
      phenomena, such as fibromyalgia.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (S-ketamine : placebo) into the first 2 groups, one with placebo and one with first dose of S-Ketamine Low Dose (0.2mg/kg).
A second group will receive S-Ketamine High Dose (0.4 mg/kg) with the same randomized ratio (2:1).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The research pharmacist prepares the syringe with a placebo or active drug (group 1 with 0.2mg/kg or group 2 with 0.4 mg/kg of S-Ketamine) and anonymizes it before giving it to care provider.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome is twofold, aiming on one side pain relief and on the other the improvement of the patient's functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief will be considered as a two point decrease on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain severity index at twelve weeks follow-up. (Two points being established as the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for fibromyalgic patients).
The functional status will be evaluated by the BPI Interference scale. An improvement will be considered as a one point reduction on this index (as established by the MCID).
The primary outcome is to determine whether the association of S-ketamine to the analgesic treatment will increase the number of patients showing a clinically significant improvement of pain and/or functional status.</description>
