      Introduction: Person-centred care is based on the assumption that every person has resources
      that should be used in the care situation. In order for this to happen the patient has to be
      able to effectively communicate his/her symptoms. This protocol describes the analysis of a
      digital picture-based tool for communication support for children with cancer aged 5-17
      years, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatment. The advantage of a non-linguistic based
      platform, beside the expected clinical outcomes, is that it can be used in multiple national
      studies with minimal translation.

      Methods and analysis: Two studies will be conducted in a hybrid design, i.e., a crossover
      design will be used for the intervention (effects), and a mixed-methods design will be used
      for the process evaluation. Qualitative interviews will be carried out with children with
      cancer, their legal guardians and case-related healthcare professionals as part of the
      process evaluation.

      The interviews will address the experiences of the intervention and frequency of use from the
      child's perspective. Interview transcripts will be analyzed qualitative descriptively. The
      digital communication tool will collect child self-reports of symptoms/emotions. The children
      will be monitored for biomarkers of stress and pain (neuropeptides, neurosteroids and
      peripheral steroids) in venous blood samples, in-app estimation levels for the children, drug
      consumption. Person-centeredness will be evaluated with the questionnaire Visual CARE
      Measure.

      Ethics: Ethical approval was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (ref
      2019-02392; 2020-02601).

      BACKGROUND Failure in symptom relief in children with cancer leads to physical and emotional
      distress. Success in symptom relief is assumed to decrease distress. To initiate a
      person-centred approach to child-centred care means to elucidate, listen to and affirm the
      child´s story. Assessments of distress and symptoms are essential in symptom relief for
      children with cancer. However, the exclusive assessment of pain intensity can be considered a
      restrictive description of the experience. Novel assessment tools that give a broader
      description of symptoms are needed. Self-reports of symptoms are the gold standard for
      measuring symptoms, and strategies to achieve symptom relief to represent a dynamic and
      interactive process. A complex intervention has been chosen, and the project follows the
      Medical Research Council´s key principles and actions for consideration in the developing of
      the intervention.

      AIM This project aims to investigate whether a person-centred communication intervention
      employing a new digital communication tool for children undergoing cancer treatment decrease
      the children's self-reported distress

      Research questions:

      Does adding a digital reporting and communication tool, decrease distress in children with
      cancer, aged 5-17 years, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatment?

      Does the adding of a digital reporting and communication tool, increase person-centredness in
      children with cancer, aged 5-17 years, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatment?

      Hypothesis: (i) Person-centred communication with children undergoing cancer treatment,
      applying a digital reporting and communication tool, will lead to reduced self-reported
      distress on an analogue assessment tool (paper sheet) (primary outcome), a decrease in
      neuropeptides, neurosteroids and peripheral steroids for stress and pain in blood, and an
      increased person-centeredness (secondary outcomes) (effect).

      (ii) The person-centred communication is performed in child-centred ways to proactively
      assess children's symptoms (process) and will be evaluated with frequency of use and
      feasibility.

      METHODS/DESIGN Study design The children will participate in a cross-over design where they
      are their own controls. This is a hybrid design, which evaluates both the effects and the
      implementation (process).

      The participant is given a code in a predetermined order; the code shows whether he or she
      should start either with intervention (application) or with the control conditions.
      Randomization of the codes occurs in advance at randomizer.org, and the researcher always
      picks the codes in a predetermined order without knowing if it is intervention or control.
      This is revealed when the participant has agreed to participate in the study. Participating
      children participate twice, once as a control and once with e-health support Pictorial
      support in Person-centered care for children (PicPecc).

    <description>Phase A: The child has the protocol for methotrexate treatment, the healthcare professionals have one workshop that containing person-centred care, universal design, distress, symptom management and the digital reporting and communication tool.
Phase B: The child has everything in phase A. In addition, the child use the digital reporting and communication tool that has a thermometer (graded from zero (green) to ten (red)). The result of the assessment is visualized as a face (mimic and colour represents the intensity of the symptom and/or emotion (i.e., anxiety, appetite, fear/worries, how I´m feeling today, nausea, pain, sleep, and tiredness)). The digital reporting and communication tool has a body figure for location of pain, pictures for the type of pain, and an open question. There is an avatar and a gamification part, e.g., the child gets a pet after assessing the symptoms/emotions. The child reports in the app, and the child decides the frequency of assessments.</description>
