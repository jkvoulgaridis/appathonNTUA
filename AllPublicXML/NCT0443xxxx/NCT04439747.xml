    <textblock>
      Methods of diagnostic and treatment of hormonal disorders in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) will be developed and implemented in real clinical practice. As a result of the
      project, new scientific data will be obtained on the relationship of hyperprolactinemia and
      impaired functioning of the pituitary-gonadal axis, changes in functioning of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system will be revealed, and the characteristics of the thyroid
      and parathyroid status in patients with CKD will be determined, including receiving renal
      replacement therapy (RRT) and after kidney transplantation, which will improve the efficiency
      of diagnosis and treatment of hormonal disorders in the early stages of the disease, reduce
      the direct financial costs of the diagnostic and treatment process primarily due to the
      optimization of hormonal studies and treatment of the revealed disorders, as well as will
      prevent the progression of CKD and the severity of the condition of this category of patients
      due to the development of hormonal dysfunctions.

      1. Assessment of prevalence, clinical manifestations and pathological significance in a
           cohort of patients with CKD:

             -  hyperprolactinemia, hormonal disorders of a pituitary -gonad axis ;

             -  disorders of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system;

             -  pathology of the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

        2. Analysis of CKD impact on the development of structural changes in the thyroid gland and
           parathyroid glands according to the results of ultrasound examination.

        3. Assessment of relationship of hormonal dysfunctions in patients with CKD and
           adipocytokines, markers of renal impairment.

        4. To study the effect of renal replacement therapy on thyroid hormones clearance .

        5. Investigate hormonal status in patients with CKD after kidney transplantation.
