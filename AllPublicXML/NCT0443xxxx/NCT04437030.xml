  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multispectral photoacoustic imaging enables the measurement of the optical absorption of
      various tissue components or exogenous contrast agents in vivo. The dominant, near infrared
      absorbing chromophores in human tissue are oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin followed by collagen,
      melanin and lipids. The multispectral measurement of the absorption of hemoglobin shows
      changes in blood oxygen saturation and blood volume. The high resolution of photoacoustic
      imaging also enables the vascular structure to be displayed. The aim of this exploratory
      study is to generate hypotheses by applying photoacoustic imaging to the field of head and
      neck tumor therapy. The next step is to investigate whether and how photoacoustic imaging can
      help improve diagnostics and better planning of treatments in the future. In particular, the
      differences between normal and tumor tissue and the changes in the tissue due to radiation
      therapy using photoacoustic imaging are examined. In the quantitative analysis of the images,
      measured chromophores, primarily oxygen saturation, blood volume and collagen concentrations
      at different measuring points are used in the course of the therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multispectral photoacoustics enable non-invasive, inexpensive and dose-free real-time imaging
      of light-absorbing molecules (absorbers), e.g. Deoxyhemoglobin and oxygenated hemoglobin in
      human tissue. This allows blood oxygen saturation (sO2) to be determined at depths of up to
      several centimeters. Measurements of correlates to blood volume and collagen concentration
      are also made possible. In photoacoustic imaging, the tissue to be examined is irradiated
      with nanosecond short, near-infrared (650 - 1300nm) laser pulses. If laser light is locally
      absorbed by a tissue structure, it expands thermoelastically, which triggers an ultrasonic
      pressure wave, which is measured with the aid of an ultrasonic head. The initial pressure
      distribution and thus the absorption in the tissue can then be reconstructed. Since different
      molecules show distinct absorption behavior depending on the wavelength in the near infrared,
      by acquiring several wavelengths it is possible to estimate which absorbers are in which
      concentration in a tissue structure. The effectiveness and tolerability of modern
      high-precision radiation therapy for head and neck tumors largely depends on the quality of
      the imaging. The potential diagnostic benefits of photoacoustics in the radiotherapy of
      patients with head and neck tumors principally concern the target volume definition, the
      implementation of image-guided, adaptive radiotherapy and imaging tumor follow-up as well as
      the early detection of tumors.

      Multispectral photoacoustics primarily enable the analysis of tumor hypoxia, which has been
      associated several times with increased radio resistance and an unfavorable prognosis. In
      addition, other factors, e.g. the blood volume and the collagen content in the tissue are
      analyzed.
