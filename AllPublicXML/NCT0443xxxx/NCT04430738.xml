  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies tucatinib to find out if it is safe when given with trastuzumab and other
      anti-cancer drugs (FOLFOX). It will look at what side effects happen when participants take
      this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything the drug does other than treating
      cancer.

      The participants in this trial have HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer in their gut, stomach,
      intestines, or gallbladder (gastrointestinal cancer).
