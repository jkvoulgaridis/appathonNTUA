  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and devastating symptom in advanced stage Parkinson's
      disease (PD), which contributes to falls and disability. Unfortunately, there is no effective
      pharmacological treatment for FOG. It is suggested that the cortex-basal ganglia circuit,
      especially the frontal lobe, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of FOG. Repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) effects over the cortex and affects the subcortical
      neural circuits. Previous studies have demonstrated that rTMS can improve FOG for PD
      patients. In the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) study, the invastigators aim to
      investigate the efficiency of rTMS over different motor regions of frontal lobe. The efficacy
      of treatment is evaluated by the score of FOG questionnaire and FOG provoking test, and the
      changing of neural network shown by functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). Then the
      effects of rTMS over different brain regions will be compared for choosing a better target.
      The study will provide the evidence for non-invasive neuro-modulation of Parkinson's disease
      with freezing of gait (PD-FOG).
