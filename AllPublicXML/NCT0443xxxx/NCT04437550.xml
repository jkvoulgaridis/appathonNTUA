  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interval exercise involves short bouts of high intensity exercise interspersed with periods
      of lower intensity exercise. The benefit is that a shorter total duration of exercise may be
      required to achieve cardiovascular benefits similar to or even superior to traditional longer
      bouts of steady state endurance exercise. However how this type of exercise affects appetite
      and energy intake, particularly in overweight and obese females is not well known.

      This study involves two trials of exercise, one at high intensity and one at low intensity,
      followed by a buffet lunch, in overweight and obese females.
