  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MDL-SHPVP will be developed and a clustered randomised controlled trial will be conducted
      to evaluate the effects of the MDL-SHPVP and to examine whether the effect of the MDL-SHPVP
      on the rate of HPV vaccine uptake 1 year after intervention is mediated by
      parents'/guardians' and female adolescents' HPV knowledge, attitudes and beliefs,
      adolescents' intention to receive HPV vaccination and vaccine acceptance among their
      parents/guardians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2520 adolescents and their parents or guardians from 18 local secondary day schools will be
      recruited. Multicomponent interventions will be offered to the intervention schools. To build
      and strengthen the community capacity in health promotion, a team of volunteers will be
      established to raise awareness of HPV, cervical cancer and HPV vaccine.

      Data will be collected at baseline, 1 month and 1 year after intervention. The mixed-effects
      model will be used to compare the differential changes for each of the primary and secondary
      outcomes across time between the two groups.

      The project is expected to instil a more accurate understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination
      and support the decision to undergo vaccination.
