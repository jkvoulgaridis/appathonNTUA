  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a
      combination low dose chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients who have sarcoma that is
      relapsed or late staged. Another goal of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of
      the therapy that combines multiple CAR T cells followed by sarcoma vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with late staged and/or recurrent sarcoma have poor prognosis despite complex
      multimodal therapy. Therefore, innovative interventions are needed. Sarcoma is known to
      express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted by CAR-T cells. In
      addition, studies have shown that low dose chemotherapy such as doxorubicin may modulate
      surface PD-L1 level and enhance immunotherapy effects. This study will combine multiple CAR T
      cells with low dose chemotherapy to treat sarcoma, and followed by maintenance sarcoma
      vaccines. The purpose of this clinical trial will assess the feasibility, safety, efficacy
      and side effects of this combination therapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or
      late staged.
