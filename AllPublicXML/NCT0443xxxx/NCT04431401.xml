  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disease in which language function
      is gradually and progressively impaired. Patients will eventually be disabled in
      communication and have cognition deficits, which put a heavy burden not only on their
      families but also on the whole society. However, no effective treatment for PPA has been
      explored so far. The current clinical randomized trial is to study the safety and efficacy of
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of PPA. Also,
      multi-modality of neuroimaging techniques, such as functional MRI and PET will be used to
      investigate brain network changing in this procedure.

    <measure>functional connectivity map (FC map)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Connectivity was examined using a seed-based voxel-wise correlation approach. The language related brain areas, such as Broca Area and Wernicke Area, were defined as the regions of interest (ROI). Pearson's correlation analysis between the time course of the ROI and that of every voxel in the whole brain was computed for a map of correlation coefficients, which were Fisher's z-transformed and called as z-FC maps. This outcome measurement, the z-FC map, is not numeric data. Z-FC map is a radiographic imaging measurement.</description>
