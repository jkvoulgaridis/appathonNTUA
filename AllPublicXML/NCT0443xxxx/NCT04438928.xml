      The aim of this study is to collect information how adding a soft gel preparation of
      micronutrients such as vitamins, dietary minerals plus omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic
      acid, DHA) to the diet of pregnant women during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy
      effects the nutritional state of the mother and infants at delivery.

    <description>In order to assess the beneficial effects of supplementation with micronutrients and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) during 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, the red blood cell (RBC) DHA weight percent of total fatty acids (DHA wt% TFA) will be measured compared to baseline as primary maternal variable.
Gestational age is a measure of the age of a pregnancy which is taken from the beginning of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Such methods include adding 14 days to a known duration since fertilization (as is possible in in vitro fertilization), or by obstetric ultrasonography. The popularity of using such a definition of gestational age is that menstrual periods are essentially always noticed, while there is usually a lack of a convenient way to discern when fertilization occurred.</description>

    <description>Glutathione exists in reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) states. Reduced glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in aerobic cells and participates in the detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide exerted by glutathione peroxidases. When cells are exposes to increased oxidative stress levels, GSSG accumulates and the GSH/GSSG ratio decreases.</description>
