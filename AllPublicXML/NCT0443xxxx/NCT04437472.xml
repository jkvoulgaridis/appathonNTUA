  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CareSignal has developed an application that allows for remote collection of patient-reported
      data such as symptoms or outcomes on any device compatible with the short message service
      (SMS), otherwise known as &quot;text messaging&quot;. The software can be configured to complete
      symptom monitoring by surveying patients about toxicity using the PRO-CTCAE tools. PRO-CTCAE
      is the patient reported outcomes version of the CTCAE that was designed by the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) for use in clinical trials.

    <description>-Participants will undergo a single training session on how to use the CareSignal software no more than 4 weeks before starting standard of care therapy. After the training session, patients will be encouraged by the treatment team to complete the baseline symptom report once they receive the questions via SMS prior to starting any therapy and to complete the weekly reports during therapy and in follow up.</description>

    <description>The CareSignal software will be programmed to automatically ask a subset of the NCI-PRO-CTCAE questions using SMS depending on patient group as designated by the treating physician: (1) thoracic radiation with chemotherapy, (2) thoracic radiation alone, (3) extremity/body wall sarcoma, and (4) other.</description>
