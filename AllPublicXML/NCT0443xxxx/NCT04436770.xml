      Application of Virtual Reality therapy and occupational therapy versus and standard
      physiotherapy and occupational therapy to patients with post-stroke sequelae, using
      specifical assessment tools, standard physiotherapy and occupational therapy programs.

      1. Initial and final clinical and functional evaluation of patients with post-stroke
           sequelae, storage and use of data obtained.

        2. Collection and access of demographic and clinical data of patients included in the study
           (respecting the principle of confidentiality and non-publication of personal data) only
           by staff involved in the research project and working in the Clinical Hospital of
           Psychiatry and Neurology in Brasov.

        3. Application of Virtual Reality therapy and occupational therapy versus and standard
           physiotherapy and occupational therapy to patients who meet the criteria for inclusion
           in the study (scapulohumeral flexion and abduction of at least 20 degrees, elbow flexion
           of at least 20 degrees, hip and knee flexion of at least 20 degrees, without severe
           aphasia or severe behavioural/cognitive disorders).

        4. Use of data obtained from the application of Virtual Reality therapy at home, through
           Telerehabilitation, if patients procure alone or through sponsorship/donation the
           equipment necessary to continue the Virtual Reality therapy program at home, taking into
           account that the technology purchased through the project allows this.

    <measure>The number of patients for whom tailored Virtual Reality therapy is more efficient than standard tailored physiotherapy in the recovery of post-stroke sequelae.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year since the beginning of the research</time_frame>
    <description>Determining the factors and parameters that influence or enhance post-stroke recovery capacity using new recovery methods, such as non-immersive virtual reality.
The assessment tools are: the Fugl-Meyer assessment for the upper extremity (FMUE), Fugl-Meyer assessment for the lower extremity (FMLE), the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Active Range of Motion (AROM), the Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the Functional Reach Test (FRT), and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG).
The patients are assessed by recovery medical doctors (physiatrists) regarding FIM, MAS and MRS. While FMUE, FMLE, AROM, MMT, FRT, TUG are assessed by trained physiotherapists, with at least 5 years of experience in stroke sequelae physiotherapy and evaluation.</description>

    <measure>The number of patients for whom heart disease and other elderly condition, age or gender are influencing the capacity to the recovery of post-stroke patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year since the beginning of the research</time_frame>
    <description>Collecting data related to age, gender, time after stroke, other conditions present (such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, ischemic coronary disease, etc.) and determining the links between post-stroke recovery capacity and these factors using statistical software programs and analysis.</description>

    <description>Non-immersive Virtual Reality (VR) therapy exercises, based on assessment, and occupational therapy exercises, for upper extremity or lower extremity.
For the upper extremity, daily, from 20-40 to minutes of VR therapy plus 20-40 minutes of occupational therapy exercises, according to the patient's capacity of VR training, as entire therapy for upper extremity don't exceed 60 minutes.
For the lower extremity, from 20-40 to minutes of VR therapy plus 20-40 minutes of occupational therapy exercises, according to the patient's capacity of VR training, as entire therapy for the lower extremity don't exceed 60 minutes.
The protocol for occupational therapy exercises for the hand included the use of the Canadian plate, thick and thin grip training, lateral and palmar pinch as well as wrist extensor strengthening tasks.
For the ankle and foot, analytical and dexterity exercises using Mirror therapy and alone were used.</description>
