  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent pilot study, GLIMPSE (NCT02690168), was recently completed which demonstrated that
      the rate of glial acetate metabolism (GAM) is closely associated with susceptibility to
      fasting-induced hypoglycemia in healthy adults. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a common
      complication of diabetes treatment and is a major barrier to the maintenance of healthy
      glucose levels in individuals with diabetes. The primary purpose of the study is to test the
      proof-of-concept that there is an association between the rate of GAM and susceptibility to
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In order to observe such a relationship the rate of GAM will be
      measured in a patient population known to frequently experience hypoglycemia, i.e.,
      individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
