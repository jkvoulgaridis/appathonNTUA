  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective registry was designed as an observational study to ascertain how
      commercially available NanoBone Bone Graft is being used by surgeons performing spinal fusion
      as well as determining relevant patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter prospective patient registry was developed with the aim of documenting how
      spine and neurosurgeons are utilizing the NanoBone products along with relevant patient
      outcomes. These outcomes include radiographic measures such as fusion outcome,
      instrumentation integrity, and clinical outcomes (symptom and function improvement) based on
      investigator and patient-based outcome assessments.

      The primary objective of this study is to document and analyze the use of NanoBone products
      in spine fusion surgery (as a stand-alone bone graft, or in combination with local bone only,
      no other BGS or biologic product used) and determine both radiographic success and clinical
      outcomes. All product related adverse events will be documented, tabulated, and summarized.

Patients will be candidates for spinal fusion surgery after having failed conservative treatment or will have had spinal fusion surgery but have not completed their standard of care follow-up as determined by the surgeon's practice.

    <description>Synthetic, biodegradable bone grafting material that is composed of non-sintered nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) which is embedded in a silica gel matrix (amorphous SiO2). The ratio of HA/SiO2 has been chosen to optimize the rate of biodegradation for treatment of osseous defects in human bone. NanoBone does not contain any components of animal or human origin, eliminating the possibility of transmission of infection or disease.</description>

        All patients in the study will be drawn from the individual surgeons' practice. Patients
        will be candidates for spinal fusion surgery after having failed conservative treatment or
        will have had spinal fusion surgery but have not completed their standard of care follow-up
        as determined by the surgeon's practice. In addition, the surgeon has determined that the
        use of a NanoBone product is or was clinically necessary for the patient. The choice of a
        NanoBone product is or was independent of this research project. Only patients who have had
        NanoBone implanted and consent to participate and meet the inclusion-exclusion criteria
        will be included in the registry.
