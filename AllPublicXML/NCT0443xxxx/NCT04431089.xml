    <description>The FACT-Lym questionnaire is a validated instrument for assessing the impact of lymphoma on health related quality of life(HRQL) and contains 42 questions covering HRQL and common lymphoma symptoms and treatment side-effects. It begins with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), which contains 27 questions covering four core subscales: Physical Wellbeing (7 items), Social/Family Wellbeing (7), Emotional Wellbeing (6), and Functional Wellbeing (7). The FACT-Lym also includes an Additional Concerns subscale (15 questions) used to assess non-Hodgkins lymphoma(NHL) related symptoms and concerns. All questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much&quot; (4). Higher scores are associated with a better quality of life.</description>
