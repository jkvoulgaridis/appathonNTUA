  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HERMES intervention was developed in a Danish setting after a comprehensive investigation
      on caregivers' needs. The intervention consists of: 1) a systematic identification of the
      caregiver's unmet information needs and 2) a subsequent consultation with a nurse providing
      the lacking information. The evaluation carried out in a randomized trial at Herlev Hospital
      showed positive results. It reduced the unmet information needs and improved the caregivers'
      evaluation of the information from and communication with the health care professionals and
      the perception of being seen and acknowledged as a caregiver. However, although research
      projects may show a positive effect, this does not mean that the intervention will be easily
      implemented in the health care system. Nor does it guarantee that the intervention will show
      the expected results once implemented in a busy clinical routine.

      Therefore, the present project will adapt the HERMES intervention to be implemented in Danish
      departments of oncology and haematology by (in the first part of the project):

        1. Elucidating how the HERMES intervention is best implemented in the clinical setting
           according to the clinical staff.

        2. Elucidating how the HERMES intervention is best implemented in the treatment and
           follow-up period according to the patients and their caregivers.

        3. Developing a technological solution (an app) for the HERMES intervention in which the
           responses given by the caregivers will form the basis for a subsequent consultation with
           the health care staff.

        4. Revising the HERMES intervention based on the outcomes of a-c.

        5. Testing the revised HERMES intervention in a pilot study.

      In the second part of the project, the revised HERMES intervention will be tested in a large
      scale trial with the purpose to:

        1. Implement the revised HERMES intervention in the departments of oncology/haematology.

        2. Test the effect of the revised HERMES intervention.

        3. Evaluate the feasibility of the revised HERMES intervention in a large scale.

        4. Elucidate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the intervention and assess
           possibilities and potential needs for further adaptation in order to secure the future
           applicability in the Danish Health Care System.

      Thus, the overall aim is that by the end of the study, an evidence based and practical
      implementable method to (continous) use of the HERMES intervention in the Danish health care
      system is available.
