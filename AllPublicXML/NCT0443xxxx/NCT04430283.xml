  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      FDY-5301 compared to placebo in trauma patients at risk of intensive care unit acquired
      weakness (ICUAW).

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of FDY-5301 compared to
      placebo in trauma ICU patients at risk of ICUAW.

      Muscle wasting occurs rapidly after major trauma and is often associated with multi-organ
      failure lasting from a few weeks to a long term disability. It is believed that FDY-5301 may
      help prevent or treat muscle weakness and organ dysfunction in major trauma patients.

      Approximately 252 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive up to 7 daily bolus IV doses
      of FDY-5301 at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, or volume-matched placebo. To ensure equal representation
      in each group, the randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of any pelvic
      or lower limb fractures.

      All subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three
      treatment groups (FDY-5301 low dose, FDY-5301 high dose, or placebo).

      All subjects will be followed in-hospital until Day 28 or discharge, whichever occurs first,
      at Day 28 if discharged earlier, and then by telephone visits at Month 3 and Month 6.

      This study will be conducted at approximately 11 centers in the US and UK.
