  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness profile of guselkumab used in a
      real-life setting in participants with moderate facial and/or genital psoriasis.
      Effectiveness will be evaluated using the static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA) for the
      facial region and the sPGA for the genital region.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Dermatology Quality of life Index (DLQI) Total Score for the Facial Region</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 28, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participants' quality of life. Each question is evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate greater impact on quality of life. The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 0 to 30 where 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate greater impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 28, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a tool to assess and grade the severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In the PASI, the body is divided into four areas: the head, trunk, upper extremities and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of surface area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for degree of erythema, scaling and induration/thickness, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status. A PASI 100 response is defined as 100 percent (%) improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>
