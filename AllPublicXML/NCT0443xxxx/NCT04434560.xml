  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of neoadjuvant
      immunotherapy in patients with previously untreated, surgically-resectable, solid tumor brain
      metastases. The primary objectives of this study are to 1) assess the feasibility of
      neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment before surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) in patients with solid tumor brain metastases as measured by the proportion of patients
      who have their surgery delayed or surgery never occurs, and 2) demonstrate that neoadjuvant
      immunotherapy will increase proliferation of circulating T-cells compared to baseline
      measurements. Exploratory objectives include describing patient progression free survival and
      overall survival, time to local and distant intracranial progression, the rate of radiation
      necrosis, and differences in immune expression profiles between patient arms.

  <detailed_description>

      Forty patients planned for standard of care resection of at least one solid tumor brain
      metastasis will be enrolled onto the study after providing informed consent. Primary tumor
      histology types are restricted to those known to extracranially respond to immunotherapy, and
      will include, but not be limited to, squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      non-squamous NSCLC that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+), epidermal growth
      factor receptor positive (EGFR+), and ROS negative, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), melanoma that
      is v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 negative (BRAF -), and triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) that is programmed death-ligand 1 positive (PD-L1 +). Participants will
      be randomized 1:1 (20 participants per arm) to either the neoadjuvant immunotherapy (arm 1)
      or standard of care (no neoadjuvant immunotherapy; arm 2). Patients in arm 1 will receive a
      single infusion of nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg 7 days
      (±3 days) prior to surgical resection of their metastases. Approximately three weeks after
      resection, patients in both arms will then receive SRS per standard of care guidelines. After
      SRS, patients will continue on a maintenance treatment with an immunotherapy regimen at the
      discretion of the treating physician. Patients will be followed for up to 18 months after
      initiating study treatment.

          -  1. Patients must have 1 to 3 previously untreated, solid tumor brain metastases that
             are ≤4 cm in the largest direction. At least one of the metastases must be surgically
             resectable. All metastases must be planned for treatment with SRS. Primary tumor
             histology must be one of the following:

               1. Squamous NSCLC

               2. Non-squamous NSCLC that is ALK, EGFR, and ROS negative

               3. RCC

                  there are plans to proceed onto a maintenance regimen including a standard of
                  care regimen with immunotherapy

          -  2. Patient must be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, requiring the equivalent of
             ≤ 4 mg dexamethasone daily for at least 7 days prior to enrollment

          -  3. Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:

               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e. not sexually active, physiologically incapable
                  of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically
                  sterile, or any male who has had a vasectomy). Surgically sterile females are
                  defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or
                  tubal ligation. Postmenopausal for purposes of this study is defined as 1 year
                  without menses.; or

               2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the following methods of birth
                  control: approved hormonal contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills, patches,
                  implants, or infusions), an intrauterine device, or a barrier method of
                  contraception (e.g. a condom or diaphragm) used with spermicide.

          -  4. Age ≥ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study

          -  5. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70

          -  6. Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x normal prior to resection

          -  8. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl prior to resection

          -  9. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage during resection, platelet count
             ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo resection, which can be attained
             with the help of platelet transfusion

          -  10. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN prior to resection

          -  11. A signed informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
             will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read
             and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent
             indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study

          -  12. Ability to undergo MRI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  2. Patients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on

               1. Patients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an
                  unexplained febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F/37.5°C)

               2. Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known uncontrolled human
                  immunodeficiency virus infection

               3. Patients with unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe
                  heart disease (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4)

          -  4. Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo- and/or
             radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific

          -  5. Patients must not have received immunotherapy within 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  6. Patients on the equivalent of &gt; 4 mg of dexamethasone ≤ 7 days before receiving

             of ipilimumab

          -  10. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunomodulatory
             treatment within the past 3 months.

          -  11. History and/or confirmed pneumonitis, or extensive bilateral lung disease on high
             resolution/spiral CT scan.
