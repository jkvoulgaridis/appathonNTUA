  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are one of the few dietary items causally linked to the
      development of obesity and chronic disease. SSB consumption among young adults are
      particularly concerning, because of the high levels of consumption and the influence of
      disease risk in later life. College students, particularly freshmen, are a captive audience
      when it comes to dietary consumption because many of them consume their meals in residential
      dining halls. We are currently working with Michigan Dining to implement warning labels on
      SSB fountain dispensers to examine whether carefully tailored signage could alter beverage
      choices of college students. The current study aims to assess changes in dietary intake
      before and after the labels are posted, in a representative sample of University of Michigan
      students who eat at residential dining halls.
