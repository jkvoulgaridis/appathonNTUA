    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well infliximab and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy work
      in treating patients with pneumonitis that does not respond to steroid treatment.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as, infliximab, may induce changes in body's
      immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may improve pneumonitis. It is not yet known whether
      giving infliximab and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy will work better in treating
      patients with pneumonitis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess pneumonitis response to additional immunosuppression (infliximab or intravenous
      immunoglobulin therapy [IVIG]) in patients with steroid-refractory pneumonitis at 28-days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess functional parameters of steroid-refractory pneumonitis at day 1, 14-days and
      28-days after day 1 of receipt of additional immunosuppression (infliximab or IVIG).

      II. To assess radiologic parameters of steroid-refractory pneumonitis at day 1, 14-days and
      28-days after day 1 of receipt of additional immunosuppression (infliximab or IVIG).

      III. To assess patient-reported outcomes of steroid-refractory pneumonitis at day 1, 14-days
      and 28-days after day 1 of receipt of additional immunosuppression (infliximab or IVIG).

      IV. To assess death after additional immunosuppression. V. To assess the rate of infections
      in the 28-day period after additional immunosuppression.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serial blood samples in patients
      who develop steroid-refractory pneumonitis.

      II. To examine associations between BAL phenotypes and pneumonitis response, functional and
      radiologic parameters of pneumonitis.

      III. To evaluate associations between pneumonitis and autoantibodies, T-cell expansion, and
      baseline cytokines in the blood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive infliximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 followed by prednisone taper
      IV or orally (PO) for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may receive an additional dose of infliximab IV on day 14 at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      ARM B: Patients receive intravenous immunoglobulin therapy IV over 2-5 days per institutional
      guidelines followed by prednisone taper IV or PO for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28, 42 and 56 days.

    <measure>Pneumonitis response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Pneumonitis response will be defined as an improvement in partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of &gt;= 20% measured by PaO2 and recording of the FiO2 received by the patient at the time of the arterial blood gas assessment, on day 28 compared with day 1. Response rate will be reported with a proportion and its 90% confidence interval for each treatment arm. A comparison on the pneumonitis response rate between the two arms (infliximab vs. intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG]) will be performed using Fisher's exact test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiologic parameters of steroid-refractory pneumonitis</measure>
    <time_frame>At days 1, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Radiologic features of steroid-refractory pneumonitis will be assessed by percentage lung parenchyma involved, percentage of ground-glass opacity in lung parenchyma, and lung volume on computed tomography. The pneumonitis and lung volume will be graded &quot;Definitely decreased&quot;, &quot;Probably decreased&quot;, &quot;No significant change&quot;, &quot;Probably increased&quot; and &quot;Definitely increased&quot;. Response to study therapy will be defined by combining the categories &quot;Definitely decreased&quot; and &quot;Probably decreased&quot;. The response rate will be compared between the arms using Fisher's exact test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional parameters of steroid-refractory pneumonitis by spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>At days 1, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Functional features of pneumonitis will be assessed by spirometry (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second). These quantitative measures will be reported descriptively (by median, mean, and range) by timepoints and treatment arms. Pneumonitis improvement (from day 1 to day 14 and from day 1 to day 28) by each measure will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, by arm, without statistical adjustments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional parameters of steroid-refractory pneumonitis by diffusion capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>At days 1, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Functional features of pneumonitis will be assessed by diffusion capacity of the lung. These quantitative measures will be reported descriptively (by median, mean, and range) by timepoints and treatment arms. Pneumonitis improvement (from day 1 to day 14 and from day 1 to day 28) by each measure will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, by arm, without statistical adjustments.</description>

These quantitative measures will be reported descriptively (by median, mean, and range) by timepoints and treatment arms. Pneumonitis improvement (from day 1 to day 14 and from day 1 to day 28) by each measure will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, by arm, without statistical adjustments.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes of steroid-refractory pneumonitis</measure>
    <time_frame>At days 1, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported outcomes of steroid-refractory pneumonitis will be measured by questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung version 4) and the Borg scale). Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung consists of 5 subscales and each subscale score will be computed separately. These quantitative measures will be reported descriptively (by median, mean, and range) by timepoints and treatment arms. Pneumonitis improvement (from day 1 to day 14 and from day 1 to day 28) by each measure will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, by arm, without statistical adjustments.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of features and phenotypic parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Biospecimens from lung tissue and bronchoscopy will be collected to describe individual features and phenotypes from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue, respectively, using summary statistics (median/range or frequency/proportion where appropriate).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>On days 1, 14, and 28 post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Potential blood/serum biomarkers for pneumonitis will be assessed from serially collected blood/serum in accrued patients and controls, whose blood/serum will be obtained as part of a parallel tissue-collection protocol. Autoantibodies, T-cell expansions (negative/positive), and cytokine levels (e.g., IFN-gamma, IL-17, and VEG-F) will be summarized descriptively in patients with pneumonitis vs. controls, by time point and treatment arm (when appropriate). Fisher's exact test will be used to evaluate associations of pneumonitis (yes/no) with autoantibodies, T-cell expansions (negative/positive), and baseline cytokines (dichotomized by the median of each cytokine). The association of BAL phenotype with pneumonitis response (yes/no), functional and radiologic parameters of pneumonitis will be evaluated using Fisher's exact test or logistic regressions, where appropriate.</description>
