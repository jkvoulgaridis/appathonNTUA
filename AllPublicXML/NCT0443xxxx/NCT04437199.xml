  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study of
      tricaprilin as AC-SD-03 compared with placebo for the reduction of migraine in participants
      with frequent migraine.

      Part 1 is a pilot study design to provide the preliminary assessments of clinical activity in
      migraine subjects. Based on the data of Part 1, a decision to proceed to Part 2 (enrolment of
      additional participants) will be taken.

          3. Participants must have 4-24 migraine headaches days per month, as confirmed by the
             baseline measurement period.

          4. Use of one allowed migraine prophylactic is permitted if the participant has been on a
             stable dose for at least 2 months prior to the screening.

          5. Participants must have failed (no therapeutic response) 1-4 migraine prophylactic
             treatments.

          6. The participant is able to tolerate a 12.5g dose of AC-SD-03 (containing 5g of
             tricaprilin) as per sentinel dose challenge at the Baseline Visit.

          7. From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (baseline measurement period), the participant has sufficient
             compliance (at least 80%) with daily eDiary headache entries.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. In the opinion of the Investigator, has presence or history of an advanced, severe,
             progressive, or unstable disease of any type that could interfere with efficacy and
             safety assessments, or put the participant at risk.

          2. Use of barbiturates (and/or butalbital-containing analgesics) or opioids (and/or
             opioid-containing analgesics) for migraine acute treatment ≥ 4 days per month on
             average and/or in the last month prior to Screening Visit.

          3. Use in the last 3 months prior to Screening Visit of CGRP agents, Botox injections,
             TENS, cranial nerve blocks, trigger-point injections, acupuncture, CBD-containing
             products, infusion therapy.

          4. Current use, or use within 3 months of Visit 2 (baseline), of Axona® or other
             MCT-containing products (such as coconut oil). Use of MCT-containing products is not
             allowed at any time during trial participation.

          5. Current use, or use within 3 months prior to Screening, of a ketogenic diet, low-carb
             diet, intermittent fasting (including the 5:2 diet). Ketogenic diets, low-carb diet,
