      Forty women aged between 18 and 75 years-old with a BMI&gt; 30kg/m2 are recruited to participate
      in the evaluation of their medical management. They participate in an 8-week protocol as part
      of hospital medical treatment for weight loss at the Oxford Polyclinic in Cannes (IPOCA). The
      effects of 2 independent variables will be studied: (1) an adapted physical activity program
      and (2) nutritional supplementation with R-α-Lipoic acid (2x300mg/d) versus placebo
      (double-blind). The volunteers are randomly assigned to the different groups: Placebo with or
      without exercise groups and ALA with or without exercise groups. At the start of the protocol
      (T0), at 4 weeks (T4) and at 8 weeks (T8), various measurements are carried out (physical
      capacities, nutritional status, body composition, distribution of adipose mass by CT-scan). A
      venous sample taken for all participants is done at T0, T4 and T8 to investigate the immune
      profile of circulating T lymphocytes.

      This project is part of a translational research project to assess current care and to
      investigate the immunometabolic effects of a non-drug medical care of obesity (adapted
      physical activities, nutritional supplementation with α-lipoic acid, quality of food intake).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity-related inflammation is central to the development of type 2 diabetes and potentiated
      by advancing age, inactive behavior and sedentary lifestyle. Metabolism and immunity are
      entangled in their respective effects: the pathways of inflammation are involved in
      metabolism and the metabolic state plays a predominant role in immune function. Physical
      activity and calorie restriction are first-line, non-drug strategies recommended in reducing
      obesity and insulin resistance and then prevent type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of their
      combined effects on circulating immune cells or those residing in adipose tissue and skeletal
      muscle, remains insufficiently understood to allow a nutritional prescription (i.e., quality
      of nutritional intake and efficient doses of physical activity) favorable to preventive
      medical care, individualized, and effective. If the risk associated with an increase in
      visceral fat mass is linked to a change in the pro/anti-inflammatory status, it is essential
      to reduce this risk by acting on its cause, regardless of the weight loss. In a context of
      low-grade inflammation, these effects could lead to an anti-inflammatory profile of T cells,
      specifically regulatory T cells (Treg) whose metabolism is extremely &quot;flexible&quot; at the
      periphery and into visceral adipose tissue (directly involved in inflammation of obesity).

      ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) is known to play a pivotal role in cellular redox status and energy
      metabolism by modulating inflammatory and metabolic signaling pathways such as those of
      NF-kB, JNK, PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK, AMPK or PPARβ/δ. As ALA is a possible metabolic modulator, it
      would affect the metabolism of T cells. And therefore ALA could be a complementary measure to
      non-drug strategies by potentiating the correction of the inflammatory state linked to
      obesity.

    <measure>Variation in the prevalence of regulatory T cells from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) drawn from whole blood at the beginning (T0), mid-course (T4) and the end of the course (T8).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cells were gently washed twice and resuspended in PBS. Stained cell preparations were analyzed using a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer. The staining and gating strategy were used for traited human PBMCs by utilizing CD3+, CD4+, CD25+ and FoxP3+ antibodies. We have discriminated CD3+CD4+ versus CD3+CD4-. Finally, at this stage CD25+FoxP3+ (Regulatory T cells) cells were gated as part of the CD3+CD4+ population.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total mRNA was extracted with Trizol reagent and the relative amount of CPT1a mRNA was calculated using the comparative ΔΔCT method after quantitative RT-PCR analysis.</description>

    <description>A computed-tomography scan (CT-scan) which allowed to discriminate the area of subcutaneous adipose tissue from visceral fatty area (VFA) was calculated from x-ray performed at the third lumbar level. Visceral abdominal adipose tissue was estimated by subtracting total abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissues areas.</description>
