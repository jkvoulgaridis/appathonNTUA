  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, two-arm, parallel group, single-dose study to demonstrate
      pharmacokinetic, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity similarity of biosimilar candidate
      TUR01 to EU-sourced Humira® in healthy participants after administration of adalimumab.
