  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial of ultra-early, minimally invasive, hematoma evacuation versus
      standard care within 8 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients presenting to the
      emergency department with stroke due to supratentorial, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage
      &gt;20mL volume will be assessed to determine their eligibility for randomization into the
      trial. If the patient gives informed consent they will be randomized 50:50 using central
      computerized allocation to minimally invasive hematoma evacuation using the Aurora surgiscope
      and evacuator (Integra Lifesciences) versus standard medical therapy. The trial is
      prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) design with seamless phase 2b-3
      transition if the intermediate endpoint (successful hematoma evacuation) is met in analysis
      of the first 52 patients. Adaptive sample size re-estimation (Mehta and Pocock) will be
      performed when 160 patients have completed 6 month follow-up (minimum sample size 240,
      maximum sample size 434).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with an acute supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) ≥20mL in volume

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. Surgery can commence within 8 hours of symptom onset (the time the patient was last
             known to be well) or, in patients with wake-up onset, within 8 hours of the time the
             patient awoke with symptoms. Patients presenting with small ICH (volume &lt;20mL) with
             clinical deterioration judged due to ICH hematoma expansion meeting volume criteria
             may be randomized if surgery can commence within 8 hours of clinical deterioration

          4. Moderate neurological deficit (NIHSS≥6)

          5. Pre-stroke mRS ≤3 (independent function or requiring only minor domestic assistance
             and able to manage alone for at least 1 week).

          6. CTA or MRA is performed and does not show an underlying vascular lesion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Brainstem ICH

          2. ICH secondary to trauma, where brain injury is judged more likely to be due to the
             broad effects of trauma rather than the focal ICH.

          3. Hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis or coagulation factor deficiency (in
             liver disease, INR&gt;1.4).

          4. Platelet count &lt;75,000

          5. Unreversible heparinization or anticoagulation. If reversing warfarin, INR should be
             ≤1.4 before procedure commences. Reversal of heparin by protamine, dabigatran by
             idarucizumab and rivaroxaban, apixaban and enoxaparin by andexanet (where available)
             is permitted. Unreversed anticoagulation with a last dose within 48 hours is an
             exclusion.

          6. Recent (&lt;12 hours) parenteral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist.

          7. Recent (&lt;1 hour) thrombolysis. If the ICH has occurred between 1 and 12 hours
             following thrombolysis, cryoprecipitate (1U per 10kg) and tranexamic acid must be
             administered prior to treatment.

          8. Participation in any investigational study in the last 30 days

          9. Pregnant women (clinically evident)

         10. Co-morbidities or advance care directive preventing general anaesthesia for the
             procedure.

         11. Known terminal illness such that the patients would not be expected to survive a year.

         12. Planned withdrawal of care or comfort care measures.

         13. Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator could impose hazards to the
             patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in
             the study.
