      Serious side effects occurs with disease and treatments in survival after lung cancer. For
      this reason, functional capacity, cognitive status, pain perception and respiratory functions
      may be affected in lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate respiratory
      function, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, functional capacity, pain, cognitive
      status level, and physical activity in lung cancer patients and compare with the findings of
      healthy subjects

      This study was participated lung cancer patients survivors. Patients' pulmonary function
      test, functional capacity, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, pain and cognitive
      status was assessed and recorded.

      Pulmonary function testing (PFT), mouth pressure measurement (MIP- maximal inspiratory
      pressure and MEP- maximal expiratory pressure), respiratory muscle endurance test, six minute
      walk test (6MWT) and pain threshold and tolerance test were used. In addition to
      physiological measurements, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale was used to
      evaluate cognitive status, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used
      to determine the level of physical activity.

    <description>Pressure time unit: A constant load test was used to evaluate respiratory muscle endurance. Using a PowerBreathe device (HaB International Ltd., Southam, UK), the participants were asked to breathe maintaining a constant threshold (60% of MIP) until task failure, and the test duration was recorded. Results were obtained by multiplying the set pressure by the test duration</description>
