  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hernia pathology is one of the leading causes of surgery worldwide. For asymptomatic
      patients, surgery remains questionable. Although there are new European recommendations, the
      practice of digestive surgeons regarding the management of asymptomatic hernias is unknown.
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the practices of a large population of digestive
      surgeons with asymptomatic hernia.
