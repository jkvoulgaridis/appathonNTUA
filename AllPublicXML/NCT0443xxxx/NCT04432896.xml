  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Nickel is a silvery metal widely used in nature and contained in many foods.
      Exposure to nickel is responsible for two different types of adverse reactions: Allergic
      Contact Dermatitis (DAC) and Systemic Nickel Allergy Syndrome (SNAS). The latter is
      characterized by the presence of extra-cutaneous manifestations, in addition to the skin
      lesions of the DAC, related to the introduction of nickel-containing foods. Therefore, a
      nutritional intervention is essential to reduce the symptoms of SNAS. Currently in the
      literature there are no nutritional guidelines on the treatment and management of patients
      suffering from SNAS and often the indications provided to patients involve the exclusion of
      groups of foods for prolonged periods, with the consequent risk of developing nutritional
      deficiencies and malnutrition.

      Objectives: to evaluate the efficacy of dietary indications, developed on the most recent
      scientific evidence, useful for the management of the symptoms associated with adverse
      reactions to Nickel. Provide practical indications to specialist staff in multidisciplinary
      patient management and make the patient aware of his problem and help him understand how to
      manage it independently.

      Target population: subjects over the age of 18, female, belonging to the U.O. Occupational
      Medicine Allergology Section at ICS Maugeri of Pavia, with previous diagnosis of Nickel
      allergy (patch test) and with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms related to allergy.

      The primary objective of this intervention study is the evaluation of the efficacy of dietary
      indications, developed on the most recent scientific evidence, useful for the management of
      the symptoms associated with adverse reactions to nickel.

      The secondary objective is to:

        -  verify the correlation between the consumption of a specific food and the onset of
           gastroenteric symptoms;

        -  provide a practical indication to the dietician who acts in concert with the figure of
           the dietician and allergist in the multidisciplinary management of the patient in order
           to manage and contain the symptoms;

        -  make the patient aware of his problem and help him understand how to manage it
           autonomously, from a food point of view, thus promoting a diet as complete and balanced
           as possible and at the same time reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as
           deficits of minerals and vitamins, and the consequent impact on the state of health.

      In this experimental study, each patient will be assessed at the baseline time (T0) in which
      the pathological and physiological history and anthropometric data (weight, height, waist
      circumference, BMI) will be collected.The patients of the intervention group will be given
      dietetic indications by the reference dietitian, which must be followed for 8 weeks. In
      short, the indications provide for an exclusion period (4 weeks). At the end of this phase
      (T1) one group of foods per week will be reintroduced on the basis of their nickel
      content.The reintroduction will begin with the group of foods with a lower nickel content and
      will proceed gradually for a period of 4 weeks (T1a, T1b, T1c, T2). In order to monitor the
      trend of gastroenteric symptoms, a diary of symptoms will be administered at baseline time
      (T0) which must be completed for the duration of the study (T1a, T1b, T1c, T2) and which will
      be delivered and evaluated by the dietician and the reference clinician. To ensure adequate
      patient support and to monitor compliance with the indications provided, the referring
      dietitian will have to contact individual patients once a week by telephone or e-mail.

Throughout the study: therefore during the first phase in which a nickel free diet is followed and during the second phase of gradual reintegration of food containing nickel, patients must fill in a diary of what they eat weekly. The efficacy of dietary indications is evaluated using the visual analog scale. Both the symptoms related to the gastro intestinal system (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, bloating of the intestine), and those extra intestinal such as headache, itching are evaluated.</description>
