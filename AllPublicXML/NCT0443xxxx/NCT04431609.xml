  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid Web located at the bulb level is a rare condition and is often associated with severe
      cerebral infarction in the carotid territory. This condition has been described predominantly
      in the black population. However, limited data are available for the epidemiology of carotid
      web and often result from selected population studies. It has been shown that the carotid web
      is a focal intimal dysplasia. Rate of ischemic stroke recurrence is high, even in patients
      treated with antiplatelet therapy. This subtle lesion is often unknown and misdiagnosed
      including in stroke unit. We assume that the implementation of a multicentric cohort would
      allow a comprehensive analysis of the carotid web condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid web lesions associated with cerebral infarctions are a relatively rare and largely
      unknown disease. However, carotid web lesions are associated with severe infarction involving
      the functional and vital prognosis of patients. The high rate of recurrence should lead to an
      identification of the lesion at the first event in order to propose a suitable preventive
      treatment. We believe that only a multicenter cohort will be able to analyze the
      characteristics of the pathology and propose studies on critical size samples. A national
      cohort would lead quickly to a consequent collection of cases. By including overseas
      departments and communities, notions of prevalence and characteristics within different
      populations could finally be studied. Participation to the cohort constitution will probably
      lead to sensitizing the various actors of the course of stroke care to the diagnosis and
      appropriate care of the carotid web.

      Patients will be selected by the Stroke Units which take part in the cohort constitution.
      Stroke Unit investigator will fill the WEPI online entry database. Clinical, imaging and
      outcome characteristics will be informed.

      In order to guarantee the quality of the cases collected, the validation of the carotid web
      lesion will be carried out by a pair of expert Neurologist - Neuroradiologist appointed
      within an expert committee. In case of no consensus, a third expert will resolve the
      disagreement.

    <description>NIHSS scale (National Institute of Health Stroke Score) was described by T. Brott, in 1989, for used to assess patients with acute ischemic stroke. It can be used in carotid and vertebrobasilar ischemic attacks. The passing time of the scale is 6 minutes 30 on average. The NIHSS Score ranges from 0 to 42. A higher score indicates a worse clinical status.</description>

    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) is a single item overall outcome assessment scale for post-stroke patients. It is used to categorize the level of functional independence based on pre-stroke activities rather than on observing performance while performing a specific task. A higher score (range from 0 to 6) indicates a poorer outcome.</description>
