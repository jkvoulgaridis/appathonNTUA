      Describe the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who receive lenalidomide
      single drug or lenalidomide combined with rituximab (with or without other drugs), and
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide single drug or lenalidomide combined with
      rituximab (with or without other drugs) in the real-world setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective, observational real-world study, targeting patients with
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      lenalidomide single drug or lenalidomide combined with rituximab (with or without other
      drugs) in the real-world setting.

      This study will mainly focus on the following three cohorts:

      Cohort 1: patients diagnosed with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; Cohort 2:
      patients diagnosed with CD20-positive follicle lymphoma; Cohort 3: patients on maintenance
      treatment who have achieved complete remission or partial remission after induction therapy.
