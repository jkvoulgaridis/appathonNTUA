  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are going to evaluate the difference between perioperative intravenous steroid
      supplementation, perioperative periarticular steroid supplementation, and standard
      anaesthesia protocols. We'll evaluate the outcome of patients with knee osteoarthritis who
      are undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty to understand which of the three treatments give more
      benefits to the patient.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 159 patients will be needed (53 patients per arm, 3 arms in total). Dexamethasone
      (brand name: Mephameson) is the steroid drug that we perioperative administer in two
      different ways: intra-venous (IV) dexamethasone (9mg) in arm-A, intra-articular (IA)
      dexamethasone (9mg) in arm-B. No steroid supplementation will be provided in the control
      group (arm-C).

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the effect on post-operative pain of I.V.
      and I.A. perioperative dexamethasone supplementation for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      The secondary objectives of the studies will be the comparison between I.V. and I.A.
      peri-operative dexamethasone supplementation in terms of post-operative pain and function,
      opioids and analgesic drugs consumption, knee range of motion, systemic inflammatory
      response, time to mobilisation, length of stay, and patient satisfaction.

      Moreover, both I.V. and I.A. steroid supplementation protocols will be compared to routine
      analgesia protocol (no steroid supplementation group) in order to document their advantages
      over the absence of steroid supplementation.

      The safety of I.V. and I.A. peri-operative dexamethasone will be evaluated and compared
      recording all the steroid supplementation related complications. In particular, the risk of
      hyperglycaemia-related complications and post-operative infections will be documented. The
      safety of both I.V. and I.A. steroid supplementation protocols will be verified comparing
      them to the no-treatment group in terms of incidence of complications.

      Overall study duration will be 12 years: 2 years to enroll all the patients and 10 years to
      complete the last follow-up. Primary data analysis is planned after the completion of the
      1-year follow-up visits.

    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire at 2 and 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 60 and 120 months. PainDETECT consists of seven questions that address the quality of pain symptoms; it is completed by the patient and no physical examination is required. A score ≤12 indicates that pain is unlikely to have a neuropathic component (&lt; 15%), while a score of ≥19 suggests that pain is likely to have a neuropathic component (&gt; 90%). An intermediate score (≥13, ≤18) indicates a possible neuropathic component .</description>

    <measure>Post-operative opioids and analgesic drugs consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>During Hospitalization, approximately 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Medication Quantification Scale (MQS) score will be used to evaluate analgesic drug consumption.
Medication Quantification Scale (MQS) scor is calculated for each medication by taking a consensus-based detriment weight for a given pharmacologic class and multiplying it by a score for dosage.
