  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study used electroencephalogram (EEG) to predict the efficacy of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), as a relatively mature non-invasive
      neuromodulation technology, has been recommended for the treatment of patients with
      refractory OCD in multinational guidelines. However, due to the treatment setting and the
      patient's feature, nearly half of the patients have no significant changes after rTMS
      treatment.

      In order to better predict the outcome of rTMS and improve the treatment efficiency, this
      project intends to look for markers that have a predictive effect at baseline or early
      treatment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cheap and fast method that usually occurs before
      the symptoms change, thus it is possible to determine whether the patient has responded to
      the intervention.

      In this project, the supplementary motor area (SMA) is selected as the stimulation target.
      The individual head magnetic resonance image positioning and navigation and rTMS compatible
      real-time EEG acquisition technology are used to monitor the resting state of EEG and rTMS
      single pulse stimulation and changes in neural networks before and after treatment. This is a
      preliminary exploration looking for effective predictive indicators of efficacy in EEG and
      the relationship between EEG and symptoms changes. In order to lay the foundation for further
      research and guide clinical treatment.

    <measure>Change in symptom improvement assessed by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses the severity of OCD symptoms. The Y-BOCS scale ranges from 0 to 40, with 0 being no symptoms and 40 being severe.The responder on Y-BOCS is defined as a Y-BOCS decrease at least 35% from the baseline at post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>EEG biomarkers as predictors of response to rTMS</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>TMS-EEG and resting state EEG will be performed to investigate predictors of response to rTMS in OCD patients. The α, β and δ band power in resting state in each brain area of OCD patients will be recorded and analyzed. Also, in TMS treatment, event related potentials (ERPs) including motor evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude, I waves, α band power and β band power will be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 21 items and uses a 0 to 3 severity scale. Total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more severe depression symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is an inventory of anxiety symptoms with 18 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale(0 to 4). Total scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Perceived Stress Scale(PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) has 10 items to assess stress status within four weeks. Items are classified into five levels, from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Total scores range from 0 to 40. The higher the total score, the stronger the level of stress the patient feels.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions which measures seven aspects of sleep: (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbances, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (0 indicates no difficulty, while 3 indicates severe difficulty). The seven component scores are then summed to yield one global score, with a range of 0-21 points (0 indicating no difficulty, and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all the seven areas of sleep quality).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 10-item and uses 0 to 3 severity scale to rate the intensity of side effects. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe side-effect. It also assesses the relation between side-effect and the effects of rTMS using 0 to 4 scale. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher score indicating the greater relation.</description>
