      The purpose of this study is to learn more about teachers' sustainment of use of core
      components of BEST in CLASS in a follow-up study.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to help understand how to successfully implement and sustain
      evidence based programs (EBP) in the education sector. The study will look at how questions
      such as what teacher, program, and school characteristics impact sustainment of the EBP BEST
      in CLASS, what modifications to BEST in CLASS represent a sustained program, and how do
      teacher, program, and school characteristics influence sustainment of BEST in CLASS.

    <description>Change in the degree to which the teacher adheres to the BEST in CLASS treatment during observations as measure by the TREATMENT INTEGRITY INSTRUMENT FOR ELEMENTARY SETTINGS (TIES) Adherence scale. The TIES-A is an 18 item scale of BEST in CLASS practices. Teachers are rated on the presence (use) of each practice on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extensively). Scores are summed giving a range of 18 to 126. Higher scores are associated with greater adherence.</description>

    <description>Change in the degree to which the teacher adheres to the BEST in CLASS treatment during observations as measure by the TREATMENT INTEGRITY INSTRUMENT FOR ELEMENTARY SETTINGS (TIES) Competence scale. The TIES-C is an 18 item scale of BEST in CLASS practices. For all practices observed (greated than 1 on the Adherence scale) teachers are rated on the competency of their use of the practice on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extensively). Scores are summed giving a range of 0 to 126. Higher scores are associated with greater competence.</description>
