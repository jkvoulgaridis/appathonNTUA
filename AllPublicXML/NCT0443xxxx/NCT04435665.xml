  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll and treat subjects with cutaneous neurofibromas with NFX-179, a
      topical study drug. Eligible subjects will receive treatment for 28 days and be observed by a
      study doctor for approximately 56 days. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4
      treatment groups. 3 of the treatment groups will receive a specific dose NFX-179, and 1 group
      will receive placebo. The subject, study doctor, and NFlection Therapeutics will not know
      what treatment group each subject is assigned. Study participation requires at least 7 clinic
      visits, blood, urine, and tissue collection, images of the treated cutaneous neurofibromas,
      electrocardiograms, and information regarding the subject's medical and disease history.

    <description>The Subject Self-Assessment is the subject's assessment of the average overall severity of each Target cNF at a particular time point and is not a comparison with any other time point. The Subject Self-Assessment is a 5-point measuring tumor severity (0 clear/none, 1 almost clear, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe).
