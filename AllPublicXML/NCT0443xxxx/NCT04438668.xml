  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of an acoustic approach based
      on skin-contact microphones as a routine assessment of placental vascular function as
      predictor of fetal growth restriction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the safety and performance of Centaflow as routine antenatal assessment of
      placental vascular function as predictor of fetal growth restriction is performed by
      randomizing singleton pregnant women with ultrasound-based gestations for either standard
      care (SC) or SC and Centaflow (CF).

      The subjects will be randomized in ratio 1:1 in both groups and examined in pregnancy weeks
      27-29, 34-36 and 37-39.

    <description>Standard care (SC) for screening for FGR is a healthcare provider auscultating the foetal heart rate with a standard stethoscope, palpation of foetal size by hand, and measuring the size of the woman's uterus with a tape measure, and comparing the measurement to the expected measurement for the gestational age of the foetus.</description>

    <description>Centaflow uses sound-derived maternal intra-arterial turbulence as a marker of foetal growth restriction (FGR) and provides information on the foetal heart rate. Indication for use is as a screening device for FGR in women beyond 27 weeks of pregnancy with a singleton pregnancy.</description>
