  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study will analyse the transition of an Australian hospital which
      significantly increased volume of bariatric operations after introduction of a clinical
      pathway, and to assess the outcomes. Barriers to introduction of the multidisciplinary
      pathway and the means to overcome these will also be analysed and discussed. The analysis
      will also determine if there are any other areas of bariatric surgery which can be further
      investigated to optimise current practice.
