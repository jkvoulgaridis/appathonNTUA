  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the
      only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Without sufficient IOP lowering therapy, glaucoma
      induces retinal ganglion cell death and visual field loss. Pattern electroretinography (pERG)
      measurements directly correlate with retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling, providing an
      objective, repeatable, and non-invasive assessment of RGC function. The purpose of the study
      is to investigate the pERG changes associated with acute IOP reduction using the Mercury™
      Multi-Pressure Dial (MPD). 10 patients will be enrolled. These subjects will have a best
      corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in both eyes and an established diagnosis of one
      of either mild/moderate OAG (open-angle glaucoma), OHT (ocular hypertension), or glaucoma
      suspect. Both eyes will be enrolled in the study. The study eye will receive a standardized
      10 mmHg decrease in periorbital pressure via the Mercury™ Multi-Pressure Dial (MPD), and the
      fellow/control eye will receive no (zero) pressure application. Total google wear time will
      be 4.5 hours. Serial pERG measurements will be taken before, immediately after, and 2 hours
      after negative pressure application.

    <description>The Mercury™ MPD applies negative pressure to one of the two goggles inducing an IOP reduction of 10 mmHg. This is randomized for each subject in the trial.
The Mercury™ MPD consists of:
Goggles: seal against the bony orbit with straps around head. The goggles separately enclose each eye, with each eye individually connected to a pressure-modulating pump.
Programmable pump: applies negative pressure inside the goggles via clear tubing attached to a handheld device</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects capable of committing to the duration of the study and signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Subjects must be male or female and ≥ 22 years of age at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Subjects with orbital anatomy that permits a proper seal when goggles are placed over
             eyes.

          -  Subjects can tolerate ERG measurements.

          -  Subjects with a documented BCVA OU 20/40 or better AND a diagnosis of OHT, glaucoma
             suspect, or OAG in both eyes. OAG definition is inclusive of normal tension glaucoma,
             pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, and pigment dispersion. Both eyes require same diagnosis.

             any other fundus findings that may prevent accurate ERG measurements in either eye.

          -  Subjects with eyelid edema.

          -  Subjects with a history of seizure disorder.
