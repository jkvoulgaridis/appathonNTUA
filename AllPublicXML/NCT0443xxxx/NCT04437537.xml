      A Pilot Study to Determine the Impact of the Phoenix Wound Matrix速 on the Wound Microbiome in
      Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PHOENIX Wound Matrix速 (PHOENIX) is a novel, fully synthetic, fully bioabsorbable advanced
      wound care device that provides a temporary microenvironment to support endogenous wound
      healing, allowing for the regeneration of functional, native tissue in the defect space/wound
      bed. As PHOENIX degrades, the pH of the local wound environment is lowered.

      In this pilot study, the investigators will examine the microbiome of chronic diabetic foot
      ulcers from ten subjects prior to treatment with PHOENIX Wound Matrix速 (PHOENIX) and one week
      following treatment with PHOENIX.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed Consent Form is signed and dated prior to any study-related activities.

          2. 18 years of age or older.

          3. Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

          4. Negative serum pregnancy test at screening for female participants of child-bearing
             potential.

          5. At least one DFU that meet the following criteria:

               1. Ulcer was diagnosed as a partial- or full-thickness DFU that is located distal to
                  the malleolus (excluding ulcers between the toes but including those of the heel)

               2. Minimum 2-cm margin between the qualifying study ulcer and any other ulcers on
                  the specified foot (post-debridement).

               3. Wagner grade 1 or 2; or Wagner grade 3 with resolved abscess or osteomyelitis
                  (confirmed by plain x-ray, bone biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging or bone scan)
                  or resolved joint sepsis.

               4. Duration of the study ulcer is a minimum of 4 weeks at the time of the study
                  Visit 1.

               5. Study ulcer has no clinical features of infection - no elevated bacterial or
                  fungal load, nor at least 2 of the following: pain, redness, purulence, swelling,
                  warmth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of signs and symptoms of infection at the index ulcer site or affected limb,
             including but not limited to cellulitis, osteomyelitis, excessive exudate, gangrene or
             deep tissue infection.

             administered investigational study drug or treatment within 30 days of Visit 1 of this
             Study.

             healing.

          6. History of bone cancer or metastatic disease of the affected limb, radiation therapy
             to the foot, or chemotherapy within the 12 months prior to randomization.

          7. Treatment with wound dressings that include growth factors, engineered tissues, or
             skin substitutes within 30 of Study Visit 1 or scheduled to receive such treatment
             during the Study.
