  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would explore the safety and feasibility of a reversible induction strategy for
      uncertain difficult airway. This reversible induction strategy would include high flow nasal
      canular oxygenation support, short-term effect anesthetic including Propofol and Remifentanil
      for sedation and analgesia and Sugammadex would be used for reverse the muscle relaxant.
