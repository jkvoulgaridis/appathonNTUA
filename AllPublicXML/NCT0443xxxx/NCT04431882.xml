      Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) first described by De Wecker in 1872 for the treatment
      of neuroretinitis. Since then, optic nerve sheath fenestration has become well established
      procedure for treatment of papilledema in medically uncontrolled patients of idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension.

      Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) first described by De Wecker in 1872 for the treatment
      of neuroretinitis. Since then optic nerve sheath fenestration has become well established
      procedure for treatment of papilledema in medically uncontrolled patients of idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension. Indications for ONSF in cancer patients are not well established,
      but a few case reports have shown success of ONSF in patients with perineural metastasis of
      breast cancer, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema due to a brain tumor,
      leukemia and optic nerve sheath meningioma. This study is conducted to establish the role of
      optic nerve sheath Fenestration in leukemic patients mainly those suffering from acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

    <description>A standard medial transconjunctival orbitotomy was performed in all cases under general anesthesia. The medial rectus muscle was disinserted and reflected nasally with 6-0 synthetic polyester suture in typical fashion for eye muscle surgery. A traction suture was then placed through the insertion stump of the medial rectus in a baseball stitch fashion to facilitate abduction of the globe. The pupil was monitored at all times. A custom- made cupped orbital retractor was inserted along the medial scleral wall and used to retract the orbital fat and allow visualization of the optic nerve sheath. Retraction and globe abduction were relaxed if any changes in pupil size were noted. When adequate visualization was achieved, multiple dural sheath fenestrations approximately 3 mm in length. Expulsion of cerebrospinal fluid was invariably observed with the initial incision into the dural sheath.</description>
