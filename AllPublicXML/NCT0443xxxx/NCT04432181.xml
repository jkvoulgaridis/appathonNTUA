  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the records of astigmatic children were reviewed and any deviation was investigated at near
      and distance. refractive errors, stereopsis, convergence insufficiency were also evaluated.
      children were divided into two groups according to the presence of amblyopia and ocular
      deviations and other parameters were compared between groups.

      The aim of the study was to evaluate deviations in children with ≥1,75 diopter (D)
      astigmatism with or without amblyopia.

      The records of children with ≥1,75 D astigmatism were investigated. Subjects with and without
      amblyopia composed group 1 and 2, respectively. The mean age, gender, amount and type of
      deviation, presence of convergence insufficiency (CI), stereopsis, time of initial spectacle
      use and follow-up time, differences in best corrected visual acuity (VoD) and spherical
      equivalent (SE) between eyes were noted and compared between the groups. Best corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA), mean SE, astigmatism measurements were also noted and compared between
      amblyopic, fellow and non-amblyopic eyes.
