  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test if small incentives promote linkage to care and 6-month viral
      suppression among HIV-positive self-screening test kit users at selected sites within
      Johannesburg, South Africa. Individuals who obtain a reactive HIV self-screening (HIVSS) test
      result on the STAR (Self-Test Africa) programme will be randomized to receive either the
      standard of care (SOC) for linkage to care or to receive financial incentives for
      confirmatory testing, linkage to care and viral suppression.

      This study will use a randomized trial design to test the effectiveness of incentives to
      increase confirmatory testing, linkage to care and viral suppression among HIV self-screening
      (HIVSS) test recipients. The study will be implemented by Ezintsha, a sub-division of Wits
      Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (WRHI) and will leverage the existing infrastructure of
      the STAR initiative (Self-Test Africa) that is currently scaling up HIVSS in South Africa to
      key- and under-tested populations such as men and young people.

      Recipients of HIV self-screen kits who report a positive result will be randomized into two
      study arms including 1) Usual care within the STAR program and 2) Incentives and linkage
      promotion including incentives for confirmatory testing, medication pick-up and for
      demonstrating viral suppression.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will receive the standard of care (SOC) as implemented in the STAR program in various sites in Johannesburg. This will include a HIV self-screen test kit and the standard linkage officer follow-up call and an invitation to i) participate in study visit 1 to have their positive HIVSS result confirmed and complete blood collection for viral load PCR testing and to ii) participate in study visit 2 at 6 months for Viral Load PCR.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will receive the same standard HIV self-screen test kit and linkage officer follow-up call including the invitation to i) participate in study visit 1 and ii) study visit 2. In addition, they will receive a financial incentive if they complete a confirmatory HIV test at visit 1 and if they demonstrate viral suppression at study visit 2, approximately 6 months after positive HIVSS result. They will also receive monthly reminders and incentives to pick up HIV medication.</description>
