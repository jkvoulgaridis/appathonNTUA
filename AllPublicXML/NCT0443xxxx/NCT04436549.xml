    <textblock>
      Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) has a high prevalence in the general population of the western
      world. Varicose veins are the main signs of this disease that are characterized by important
      pathological vessel wall changes. There are also several symptoms that affect the quality of
      life of affected patients. The aim of this study is to correlate the main histopathological
      abnormalities with the type and the intensity of the symptoms.

      Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) of the lower limbs is a widespread chronic condition of the
      western world. There are several signs and symptoms that affect quality of life of patients
      with CVD. One of the main signs of this disease are varicose veins that are enlarged,
      swollen, and twisting superficial veins. Vessel wall of varicose veins shows a significant
      histopathological phenotype, characterized by a distortion of structural architecture:
      endothelial damage, disorganization of muscle bundles and alteration of the composition of
      the extracellular matrix (ECM). Symptoms may be different, according to disease state,
      progression and local inflammatory processes. To date, there is no study that correlate the
      type and the intensity of symptoms with histopathological phenotype.

      Aim of this study is to correlate histopathological phenotype with clinical manifestations.

      A cohort of patients with varicose veins scheduled for open surgical treatment that will
      undergo to stab avulsion of varicose veins will be recruited. Subsequently, venous tissue
      from stab avulsion will collected in order to evaluate the following biomarkers: VEGF
      (Vascular -Endothelial Growth Factor), PGP 9.5 (Protein Gene Product 9.5), Fibronectin and
      Matrix Metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP-9).

      VEGF has a key role as a regulator of angiogenesis; its expression is highly regulated by
      hypoxia, in this case induced by venous hypertension. In addition to being a marker of
      neoangiogenesis, it increases vascular permeability in inflammatory disorders. PGP 9.5 is a
      marker of the innervation of the vessel wall that plays an important role in the regulation
      of venous tone. Fibronectin and MMP-9 are direct markers of ECM remodeling and impairment and
      they have also a role in chronic inflammation.

    <description>Sample obtained from varicose veins of lower limbs of patients will be collected and immediately fixed in formalin. The tissue fragments will be taken from varicose veins. Subsequently the tissue will be embedded in paraffin and 3-to-4 mm thick sections will be prepared by a microtome. The tissue sections will be processed for histological and immunohistochemical studies of VEGF, MM9, PGP 9.5 AND FRIBRONECTIN. For antibodies the EnVision staining system (Dako EnVision™) will be used. For the analysis of the positive structures detected by immunohistochemistry, a semiquantitative evaluation method will be used.</description>
