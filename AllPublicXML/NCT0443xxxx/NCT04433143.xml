  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the hair follicles and sebaceous
           glands, characterized by acne, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. Acne often occurs
           in sebum overflow areas such as the face, chest, back and so on. It is a common skin
           lesion, which not only affects physical health, but also brings psychological disorders
           and psychosocial problems to patients. At present, the common treatment methods of acne
           include health education, topical drugs, oral drugs and medical cosmetic treatment.

        2. Intense pulsed light has been widely accepted as a non-invasive and non-serious
           treatment for acne. The M22 strong light and laser system Acne filter has a wavelength
           of 400-600/800-1200nm.

        3. Although there are many treatments for acne, the slow response and easy recurrence of
           acne are still common problems that trouble doctors and patients. We clinically use
           drugs combined with intense pulsed light treatment, and the efficacy of the patients is
           fair, but currently lack of clinical research data support. This study intends to
           evaluate the effectiveness of different methods in the treatment of moderate and severe
           acne by evaluating different bands of intense pulsed light combined with drugs, and to
           observe whether the treatment with oral tetracycline antibiotics combined with intense
           pulsed light is safe.

      The M22 strong light and laser system Acne filter has a wavelength of 400-600/800-1200nm. The
      light in the 400-600nm band is targeted at the superficial skin inflammation, while
      800-1200nm is targeted at the deep sebaceous gland inflammation. The skin can produce
      oxidation reaction to form singlet oxygen to eliminate propionibacterium acnes after
      absorption of porphyrin at 400nm. The light of 800-1200nm band can penetrate into the deep
      layer of sebaceous glands, and the thermal contraction of sebaceous glands can improve the
      anaerobic environment of bacteria, which is not conducive to the reproduction of bacteria.
      Meanwhile, when the temperature of sebaceous glands reaches 40 degrees Celsius, bacteria can
      be killed directly.
