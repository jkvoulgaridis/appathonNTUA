  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent operative treatment of an ankle fracture with or without following
      removal of the osteosynthetic material are examined by a specific ankle provocation test, a
      questionnaire and X-Rays to evaluate the clinical, functional and radiological outcome
      compared to a healthy control group
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes all patients operated from 09.12.2012 to 31.12.2020. Patients will undergo
      an X-Ray at least two years after primary surgery or at least one year after removal of the
      osteosynthetic material. The patients operated from 09.12.2012 to date are therefore a
      retrospective cohort, the patients from to date until 31.12.2020 a prospective cohort. This
      method is used to achieve the highest possible number of patients in a define period of time
      with no alteration of surgical technique.

      All patients in the retrospective cohort are contacted at least 2 years after surgery (or 1
      year after removal) via phone call or letter, informed about the study and asked to
      participate. In case of informed consent, they are invited to the study site. They are asked
      to complete the questionnaires and they undergo X-Ray of the affected and the non-affected
      ankle.

      All patients in the prospective cohort are informed about the study and asked to participate
      in the outpatient clinic. In case of informed consent, they are invited to the study site at
      least 2 years after surgery. They are asked to complete the questionnaires and they undergo
      na X-Ray of the affected and non-affected ankle.

    <description>To compare the results the investigators invite a healthy control group matching in age and gender with the intervention cohort. The control group is informed about the study and asked to participate in the outpatient clinic. In case of informed consent, the participants are invited to the study site. The participants undergo the same provocation test of the ankle, and are asked to complete the specific provocation test. In case of substantial underachievement in the provocation test (&lt;60% of maximum) an X-Ray of both ankles in a.p. and lateral projection is performed. The aim is to radiologically analyse the ankles, and to rule out any morphological reasons for the above mentioned underperformance.</description>
