  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The visual function of
      patients with advanced glaucoma is severely impaired, and the vision-related activities (e.g.
      movement, reading) are obviously restricted, which may have a negative impact on the
      patients' quality of life (QOL) and increase the burden on individuals and families. Low
      vision aids (LVAs) and other devices for vision rehabilitation (VR) are useful for patients
      with advanced glaucoma to maximize the function of residual vision and improve the QOL.
      OXSIGHT smart glasses are the latest LVAs eyeglasses that are expected to improve the QOL for
      patients with low vision (LV), such as those with glaucoma. Clinical data were collected to
      evaluate the efficacy and its influencing factors of OXSIGHT smart glasses in patients with
      advanced glaucoma, in providing theoretical basis for subsequent clinical studies.

      1. Glaucomatous low vision. Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that causes irreversible
           damage to the optic nerve and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. Low vision
           (LV) is a decrease in vision that cannot be corrected with standard glasses, contact
           lenses, medication or surgery, impairing a person's ability to perform age-appropriate
           vision-dependent tasks.

        2. Low vision rehabilitation. Low Vision Rehabilitation (LVR) is part of the continuum of
           eye care that extends from diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, designed to help
           visually impaired patients retain vision to the maximum, make activities easier to
           perform, regain independence, and improve their QOL. LVR services include comprehensive
           assessment of visual function, prescription of LVAs, rehabilitation training and
           referrals to a range of community services and psychosocial support.

        3. Research status of intelligent head-mounted devices. In recent years, video head-mounted
           devices have been gradually applied in the field of VR, with the advantages of high
           definition, diverse processing modes, adjustable magnification, contrast and brightness,
           which overcome the limitations of traditional devices, like eSight 3, NuEyes, and
           IrisVision. However, studies on the effectiveness of head-mounted electronic LVAs are
           quite limited.

        4. OXSIGHT smart glasses. OXSIGHT smart glasses, the latest generation of head-mounted
           electronic LVAs, developed by the team of Oxford University in the UK, are designed for
           LV patients with visual field defects. Based on the previous generation, OXSIGHT has the
           advantages of lighter weight, comfortable wearing, better imaging quality, multi-mode
           assisted visual recognition and so on. However, the efficacy and influencing factors of
           OXSIGHT smart glasses on advanced glaucoma patients remain unclear, and further studies
           are needed.

    <description>The Low vision Quality of Life Questionnaire (LVQOL) specifically investigates the QOL of visually impaired patients. The questionnaire consists of 25 closed items and examines four dimensions: distance vision, mobility and lighting; adjustment; reading and fine work; daily activities. As a convenient tool, LVQOL is widely used in clinical settings to evaluate effects of clinical treatment and corresponding strategies of low-vision rehabilitation. CLVQOL is the Chinese version of LVQOL.</description>

    <description>A mobility test was performed to evaluate patients' functionality in 2 scenarios: using their best-corrected visual acuity with no LVAs and using the OXSIGHT Smart Glasses. A loop-shaped obstacle course consisting of stationary obstacles from floor to head level was designed for this test.</description>
