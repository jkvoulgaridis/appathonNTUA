  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Flexitouch Plus
      with Cellular Connectivity (FT-CC) to monitor device use data to determine if reminders to
      patients impact compliance, and to identify the impact device compliance has on arm girth,
      quality of life (QOL), and symptom assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, on label, prospective, randomized, two-arm feasibility study that
      plans to enroll 30 female subjects in the United States. In an effort to reduce potential
      exposure to COVID-19, all study assessments are intended to be performed in a contactless
      manner (i.e., telephone, video conference, etc). If a subject passes the initial screening
      requirements via medical history and expresses interest in the study an informed consent form
      will be provided to them. Once consent has been obtained they will undergo a baseline visit
      where they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: PASSIVE FT-CC (text messages
      reminders will not be sent to subjects) and ACTIVE FT-CC (text messages reminders will be
      sent if subject does not use the device for 2 consecutive days). Randomization was
      incorporated into the study to determine if ACTIVE FT-CC affects device use. A total of 2
      follow-up visits will be conducted over a 60-day period.

    <description>Comparison of partially compliant and compliant quality of life in patients treated with FT-CC via Lymphedema Quality of Life Tool (LYMQOL ARM).
Lymphedema Quality of Life Tool (LYMQOL-ARM) includes sub-scores for Function (range 10-40), Appearance (range 5-20), Symptoms (range 6-24), and Emotion (range 6-24) where lower scores represent a better outcome. It also includes an Overall QOL sub-score (range 0-10) where a higher score represents a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Comparison of partially compliant and compliant quality of life in patients treated with FT-CC by via The RAND 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36).
The RAND 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item for perceived change in health. Min value: 0, Max value: 100. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms Assessment via LSIDS-A</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 30 days after device training, and 60 days after device training</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of partially compliant and compliant symptoms in patients treated with FT-CC by via The Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-ARM (LSIDS-A).
The Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey is a questionnaire used to assess intensity and distress of symptoms in patients with lymphedema of the arm. This includes sub-scores for soft tissue sensation (range 0-10), neurological sensation (0-10), function, (0-10), biobehavioral (0-10), resource (0-10), sexuality (0-10), activity (0-10). Higher score represents worse outcome.</description>
