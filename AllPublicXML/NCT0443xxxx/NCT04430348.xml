      A Phase I, First-in-Human, Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety of the Monoclonal
      Antibody PTX-35 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Refractory to Standard of Care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, first-in-human, Phase I study of intravenous
      administration of PTX-35 to patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible
      for, or who refuse available SOC. Five escalating dose levels of PTX-35 will be explored
      using a traditional 3+3 design based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) until optimal
      immunological dose (OID) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established.

                  first dose. Prophylactic treatment with antibiotics (e.g. for dental extractions)
                  is allowed.

         11. Have had major surgery (requiring general anesthesia or inpatient hospitalization)
             within four weeks before first administration of PTX-35.

         12. Have had a known tetanus/diphtheria vaccine within the past 10 years.

             least two years.

         14. Have known previously untreated or symptomatic metastases in the brain or spinal cord
             requiring steroids. Patients with treated and stable CNS metastases may be enrolled
             after approval of the sponsor and/or Medical Monitor.

         15. Have any other ongoing significant, uncontrolled medical condition in the opinion of
             the Investigator.

         16. Have known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or
             hepatitis C (except in cases of immunity after cured infection). Testing not required.

         17. Have a history of substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that
             may interfere with the patient's participation in the trial or evaluation of the trial
