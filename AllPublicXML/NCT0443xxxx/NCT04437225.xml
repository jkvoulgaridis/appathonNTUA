  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the contribution of glycolate metabolism to urinary oxalate
      excretion in healthy subjects, using carbon 13 isotope glycolate tracer technique and a
      low-oxalate controlled diet.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that glycolate, an intermediary molecule in normal metabolism, can be converted
      into oxalate. The origin of urinary oxalate is of interest as calcium oxalate is a main
      component of kidney stones. In the rare disease primary hyperoxaluria, excessive production
      of oxalate by the body results in frequent kidney stones and can cause loss of kidney
      function. Primary hyperoxaluria is caused by deficiencies in one of several enzymes involved
      in the glycolate pathway.

      This study will seek to determine how much oxalate is formed from glycolate in normal
      subjects. After consuming a controlled diet, subjects will either ingest or have an
      intravenous infusion of carbon 13 glycolate, a stable isotope of glycolate that can be
      tracked and will also label downstream metabolic products. Blood and urine samples will be
      assessed for their amounts of labeled glycolate and labeled oxalate to provide an accurate
      measure of how much oxalate is made from normal glycolate breakdown in healthy human
      subjects.

    <description>Subjects will consume a controlled diet for 5 days total. On Days 3 and 4, subjects will collect 24 hour urines. On Day 5, they will come to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) in the fasted state for a visit lasting from 7:00 am to 2:30 pm. An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a vein on the back of the hand at 8:30 am for the carbon 13 glycolate infusion which will occur at a constant rate for 6 hours, following a priming dose. From 7:30 am to 2:30 pm, urine collections will occur hourly, and from 8:30 am to 2:30 pm, IV blood collections will occur every half hour. Subjects will receive a meal at 2:30 pm, thus concluding the CRU visit. At home, subjects will collect timed urine until the next morning to be returned to the CRU.</description>

An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a vein on the back of the hand at 8:30 am for a single dose of carbon-13 glycolate to be administered. From 7:30 am to 2:30 pm, urine collections will occur hourly. At 8:30 am, IV blood samples will be taken every fifteen minutes until 9:30 am, every half hour from 9:30 am to 10:30 am, and then finally hourly from 10:30 am to 2:30 pm . Subjects will receive a meal at 2:30 pm, thus concluding the CRU visit. At home, subjects will collect timed urine until the next morning to be returned to the CRU.</description>
