  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of
      GT005 administered as a single subretinal injection in subjects with geographic atrophy
      secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, outcomes assessor-masked, multicentre, randomised study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two doses of GT005 administered as a single subretinal injection in
      subjects with GA secondary to AMD.

      The trial includes a screening period of up to 8 weeks followed by a 48-week study period.

      Subjects will be randomised to two groups; GT005 or the untreated control group.
