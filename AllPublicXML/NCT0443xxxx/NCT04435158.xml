    <textblock>
      This is a Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Dose Escalation, Placebo Parallel
      Controlled PhaseⅠClinical study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics,
      Pharmacodynamics, Immunogenicity with Multiple Subcutaneous Injections of SHR-1222 in
      Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of a range
      of subcutaneous SHR-1222 in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. Secondary objectives are to
      determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of SHR-1222 in
      postmenopausal osteoporosis patients including assessment of immunogenicity.
