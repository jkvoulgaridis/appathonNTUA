      SEMO is a multidisciplinary project (language sciences, cognitive psychology and
      neuropsychology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, speech-language pathology,
      functional neuroimaging and engineering sciences) that aims first, to test and develop a
      novel speech rehabilitation program designed for patients with non-fluent aphasia and,
      second, to better describe neural reorganization after successful recovery. To this end, the
      investigators will conduct a prospective monocentric cross-over study, including two cohorts
      of post-stroke aphasic patients and two control groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a new
      rehabilitation program, based on illustration of speech articulators, to improve speech in
      patients with non-fluent aphasia. The instigators' method is based on the reinforcement of
      the interaction between perceptual and motor representations, thanks to the innovative
      Ultraspeech device. The investigators will exploit a fundamental psycholinguistic principle,
      which postulates that speech is based both on the activation of the system controlling the
      motricity of effectors related to word articulation (action) and on the auditory or visual
      representation of words (perception). The sensory-motor interaction method that the
      investigators propose allows the patient to perceive phonemes and visualize on a computer
      screen the movements of the tongue and lips previously recorded by a healthy speaker,
      typically a speech therapist. Through repeated exercises, the patient is trained to produce
      sounds correctly, using the correct pronunciation and articulatory movements of the reference
      speaker as a model. The investigators will compare patients who will follow a classical
      speech and language therapy rehabilitation program followed by an 'enriched' rehabilitation
      program including rehabilitation based on sensory-motor interaction associated with speech
      and language therapy, and vice versa. In order to judge the favorable effect of the
      rehabilitation program including sensory-motor integration, the following measures will be
      considered: (a) language skills, (b) phonemic quality, (c) inner speech abilities and (d)
      cognitive function. Brain language networks will be evaluated with neuroimaging.

    <intervention_model_description>Two types of rehabilitation will be compared, a simple rehabilitation (S, based on conventional speech therapy) and an enriched rehabilitation (E, based on the use of sensory-motor integration in addition to conventional speech therapy). The investigators will constitute two cohorts of patients (N=18 per cohort): a cohort SE which will carry out first the simple rehabilitation protocol followed by enriched rehabilitation, and a cohort ES which will carry out first the enriched rehabilitation protocol followed by simple rehabilitation. The protocol starts at T0 (inclusion according to defined criteria) and after a first evaluation (T1), patients will then perform the first part of the rehabilitation protocol during 4 weeks. After these 4 weeks, a second evaluation will be performed (T2). Then, the second part of the rehabilitation protocol will be carried out during 4 weeks. At the end, the T3 evaluation will be performed.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The enriched rehabilitation is based on the use of sensory-motor integration in addition to conventional speech therapy. The sensory-motor integration method is based on the Ultraspeech-player software. This software allows therapists to display movements of speech articulators (tongue and lips) recorded on a reference speaker during production of vowels or consonants (isolated or combined). Sagittal movements of the tongue are recorded using ultrasound and front views of lip movements are captured through video imaging.
During rehabilitation with the Ultraspeech-player software, patients will be seated in front of a computer screen, observe articulatory movements and listen to phonemes. Then, they will be required to repeat each of them five times and move on to the next phoneme, with the agreement of the experimenter.</description>

    <description>The simple rehabilitation is based on conventional speech therapy. The conventional speech therapy will be provided by the speech therapist. Classically, the speech therapist uses word production with repetition and naming exercises. The therapist will show the patient series of pictures associated or not with written words, and the patient is required to name them and/or read aloud the word. In case of impossibility to perform the task, the therapist may can help the patient by using the indexing method or by asking the patient to repeat after him/her. According to patient's competencies and progress, the difficulty of reeducation can increase progressively.</description>
