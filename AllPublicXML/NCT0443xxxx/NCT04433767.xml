  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in cognitive control are core features of late-life depression, contributing both to
      emotion dysregulation and problems with inhibiting irrelevant information, conflict
      detection, and working memory. Clinically characterized as executive dysfunction, these
      deficits are associated with poor response to antidepressants and higher levels of
      disability. Improvement of cognitive control network (CCN) dysfunction may benefit both mood
      and cognitive performance, however no current pharmacotherapy improves CCN deficits in LLD.
      Supported by pilot data, Investigators propose that nicotine acetylcholine receptor agonists
      enhance CCN function and resultantly improve mood and cognitive performance in late-life
      depression. The objective of this initial R61-phase trial is to first determine whether
      transdermal nicotine enhances CCN neural activity in an exposure-dependent fashion during an
      emotional response inhibition task (the emotional Stroop task). Investigator's approach for
      the R61 phase is to examine in 36 older adults with Major Depressive Disorder whether
      transdermal nicotine patches enhance CCN activity over 12 weeks as measured during fMRI with
      the emotional Stroop task while measuring nicotine and nicotine metabolite levels.
      Transdermal nicotine has a mechanism of action that is distinct from current antidepressants,
      potentially making it a potentially important antidepressant augmentation agent. If
      hypotheses are correct, as patches are commercially available, this approach could be rapidly
      moved into definitive studies and may have applicability to other psychiatric disorders
      characterized by CCN dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression (LLD) is characterized both by affective symptoms and broad cognitive
      deficits. The co-occurrence of cognitive deficits in LLD, particularly executive dysfunction,
      is a clinically relevant phenotype characterized by significant disability and poor
      antidepressant response. Cognitive deficits can persist even with successful antidepressant
      treatment and increase the risk of depression relapse. Despite the clinical importance of
      cognitive deficits in LLD, there are no established treatments that specifically target
      cognition in this population. This is particularly important, as the cognitive deficits
      appear to directly contribute to disability and poor antidepressant treatment outcomes. The
      lack of clear pharmacologic targets and therapies aimed at improving cognitive deficits in
      depression is a substantial deficiency in current therapeutics.

      Modulation of the cholinergic system by nicotinic receptor stimulation may improve both mood
      and cognition in depressed elders. Clinically, transdermal nicotine improves mood in smokers
      and a placebo-controlled pilot trial in nonsmoking adults found that transdermal nicotine
      significantly improved mood. As observed in smokers, nicotine's effect to increase cognitive
      control network activity while reducing default mode network activity will reduce
      depression's characteristic bias to negatively valenced stimuli and decrease rumination.
      Supporting this theory, nicotinic receptor activity stimulates serotonin release and protects
      against worsening mood with tryptophan depletion.

      The Depressed Mind 2 Study examines whether enhancement of CCN function by nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptor agonists will improve mood and cognitive symptoms in LLD. This is
      supported by pilot data demonstrating that open-label administration of transdermal nicotine
      (TDN) patches safely improved depression severity. The investigators also observed trends
      suggesting that TDN may provide benefit for cognitive performance, specifically in domains of
      episodic memory, working memory, and attention. In other pilot data using an emotional Stroop
      task, TDN reduces the differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation
      in the cognitive control network (CCN) between Stroop conditions. Importantly, this
      activation change was associated with a corresponding reduction in depression severity. Based
      on these data, investigators hypothesize that nicotinic receptor agonists enhance CCN
      function in LLD and in turn this may improve depressive symptoms.

      Thirty-six participants will be enrolled to test for target engagement, defined as TDN
      exposure dependent effect in CCN activation. Based on pilot data, the study will test for
      enhancement of CCN function by examining the Stroop fMRI response, or the reduction in CCN
      activation between incongruent and congruent conditions of the emotional Stroop task during
      fMRI. Investigators will assess the effects of variability in nicotine exposure on target
      engagement by measuring nicotine blood levels in conjunction with repeat MRI.

      Primary aim: To test CCN engagement over 12 weeks of Open labeled Transdermal Nicotine(TDN).

      Hypothesis1A(Target Engagement): TDN will enhance CCN function, measured as a reduction in
      the M/SFG Stroop BOLD response (the activation difference between incongruent and congruent
      conditions of the emotional Stroop task). 60% or more of subjects will exhibit a M/SFG
      z-score reduction of 0.5 or greater.

      Hypothesis1B (Exposure): Higher nicotine exposure measured by patch dose or nicotine
      metabolite levels will be associated with a greater reduction in the M/SFG Stroop BOLD
      response.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>MRI scans will be performed at baseline, week 6 and week 12. MRI will measure cognitive control network function, operationalized as a reduction in the Stroop BOLD response in the middle and superior frontal gyri. The Stroop BOLD response is calculated as the activation difference between incongruent and congruent conditions of the emotional Stroop task.
The primary outcome will be change in activation difference from baseline to week 12. This will be examined as both a continuous variable and a categorical variable, operationalized as those subjects will exhibit a middle / superior frontal gyri z-score reduction in activation over time of 0.5 or greater.</description>

    <measure>Continuous Performance Task (CPT) Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Primary cognitive outcome, the CPT is a neuropsychological test that measures attention. In this 14-minute test, participants are asked to respond when any letter appears, except the non-target letter &quot;X&quot;. This test is conducted at baseline and at week 12. The specific primary outcome metric is standard error of change in the inter-stimulus hit reaction time, or variability between different trials. There is no absolute range, but lower scores indicate decreased variability across trials and overall better performance.</description>

    <ipd_description>This study will include clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data from older depressed subjects. The final dataset will include clinical information about subject psychiatric diagnoses, psychiatric and medical history, cognitive data, and response to transdermal nicotine. We will share data via the National Database for Clinical Trials related to Mental Illness (NDCT). NDCT provides a secure platform for data-sharing allowing for communication of research data, tools, and supporting documents. As required by NDCT, we will obtain a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for each participant. We will additionally follow NDCT requirements to certify and review data, as well as timeline requirements for data submission and data sharing. Sharing of neuroimaging data will also be facilitated by an XNAT system (xnat.org). XNAT is an open-source informatics software platform that assists in the management and archiving of imaging data.</ipd_description>
