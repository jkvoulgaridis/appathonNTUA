  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of rifampicin on
      pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese adult subjects after oral administration of SHR6390
      tablets. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of SHR6390 alone and
      when co-administered with rifampicin.
