    <textblock>
      Safety, tolerability evaluation, and anti-tumor effects of ICP-022 in Chinese patients with
      Recurrent/Refractory Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) and Recurrent/Refractory
      Secondary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (SCNSL) will be evaluated in approximately 39
      subjects. Pharmacokinetics of ICP-022 will be evaluated in approximately 20 subjects .
