  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sham controlled, randomized, double-blind, navigated repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (nrTMS) study for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS
      types 1 and 2). The investigators study factors that may contribute to development,
      maintenance, or treatment responses with clinical, sleep, and psychiatric questionnaires and
      clinical examinations, quantitative sensory testing and neurophysiologic recordings,
      genetics, and MRI techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      rTMS hypothetically disrupts the default networks related to chronic pain and renders the
      brain more susceptible to drugs, rehabilitation, or cognitive behavioral therapy. In
      addition, there is experimental evidence that rTMS releases factors that are involved in
      endogenous top-down modulation of pain and neural plasticity. Thus, the analgesic effect of
      rTMS may be mediated via enforcing endogenous pain control systems at the brain level, in
      addition to its effects on neuroplastic effects.

      For active, navigated stimulation targets the investigators have the parietal opercular
      cortex overlying the secondary somatosensory cortex (&quot;S2&quot;) and the primary motor cortex (M1).

      The investigators randomize participants to first receive nrTMS to the right &quot;S2&quot; or sham
      stimulation. After ten sessions the investigators follow up the participants up to three
      months. At three months, if the average pain is ≥5/10 in numeric rating scale (NRS), the
      participant is offered an active, open nrTMS treatment phase depending on which treatment the
      participant first received. If the participant benefits from the open label treatment, a
      maintenance therapy is offered (6 months with gradually reducing nrTMS treatment frequency).
      The symptoms and quality of life are followed with questionnaires and diaries. After the
      maintenance period, the RN calls a structured interview at 1, 3, and 6 months.

    <intervention_model_description>The patients are first randomized to receive either sham stimulation or right &quot;S2&quot; for three week period (10 stimulation sessions). Thereafter, a 3 month followup period (clinical checkup at a research visit at 1 month, RN structured telephone interviews at 2 and 3 months). If pain ≥5/10 at 3 month interview, the patient is offered an open label nrTMS treatment phase, in which the protocol depends on the first protocol of the RCT phase.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The participant does not know whether the stimulation is sham or active. The doctor or nurse giving the stimulation knows the target and whether the stimulation is sham or active. The RN and the clinician (conducting screening and 1 month clinical visit) do not know the stimulation type or target until month 3, when the code is opened.</masking_description>

    <description>Active nrTMS is given to &quot;S2&quot; at the right side (10 sessions in a three week period). Thereafter, a new, open label phase will start if the average pain at 3 month follow-up is ≥5/10. Then, the nrTMS will be targeted to M1 contralateral to the side of pain. After 5 stimulation sessions the response is evaluated. If pain is still ≥510, the investigators change the target to the &quot;S2&quot; on the left side for five sessions. If there is response with pain relief, a maintenance therapy with this target is offered for 6 months with gradually reducing stimulation sessions.</description>

    <description>Sham nrTMS will be targeted to the &quot;S2&quot; on the right side, but using a sham box/coil. Stimulation period is similar than for the active comparator. Similarly, thereafter, a new, open label phase will start if the average pain at 3 month follow-up is ≥5/10. Then, the nrTMS will be targeted to &quot;S2&quot; at the right side. After 5 stimulation sessions the response is evaluated. If pain is still ≥5/10, the investigators change the target to M1 on the contralateral side of the pain and furthermore to &quot;S2&quot; at the left side after 5 stimulation sessions, if pain is still ≥5/10.</description>
