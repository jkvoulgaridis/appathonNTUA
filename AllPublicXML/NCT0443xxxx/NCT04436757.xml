  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body esteem influences the physical appearance, which can be a social brake. To enhance
      the socio-professional insertion of persons with severe mental disorders, the investigators
      developed a group program about self-presentation and body esteem. The study's objective is
      to understand the body esteem impact on socio-professional insertion, and how to improve that
      with a dedicated group program, for patients in a psychosocial rehabilitation center

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that a group program centered on the image and the presentation of the
      self, with the intervention of professionals of the image of the body, such as
      socio-hairdresser, socio-beautician, allows a better socio-professional inclusion, through an
      improvement in body self-esteem. Taking care of yourself will require different approaches
      such as advice on hygiene, becoming aware of your body, experimenting with beauty treatments
      and having the means to reproduce them at home. We will compare our IPS program (Image and
      Presentation of Self), with the usual management in the care center (TAU = &quot;Treatment As
      Usual&quot;)
