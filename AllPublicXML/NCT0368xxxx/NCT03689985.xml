    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in order to validate the functionality and accuracy of the smART™
      System in a real-life ICU setting. The smART™ Feeding Tube System is a novel system with
      nasogastric tube developed by ART Medical (Healthcare) Ltd, based on sensor-lined tubes that
      transmit real-time information to an external console. The smART™ feeding tube is equipped
      with reflux sensors which alert when gastric contents regurgitating into the esophagus. In
      addition, the smART™ feeding tube is equipped with sensors designed to provide information
      about the location of the tube thus assisting in reducing the incident of misplacement during
      first positioning. The smART™ feeding tube is also automatically and in real-time stops
      feeding if the feeding tube moves out of position during ongoing use or detect gastric
      content in esophagus. Furthermore, smART™ Feeding Tube System can guide operator to correctly
      re-position the tube. Lastly the smART™ Feeding Tube System is equipped with an anti-reflux
      mechanism and automatic Gastric Residual Volume (GRV).
