  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods study to compare group medical visits (GMVs) to usual care for
      Spanish speaking Latina women with urgency urinary incontinence. Patients will be randomized
      to GMVs and to usual care. At the conclusion of each series of GMVs we will hold a focus
      group for participants.The primary outcome will be improvement in urgency urinary
      incontinence symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence, though its effects can be personally devastating, exists most often as
      a quality of life issue. As such, partnering with the patient toward shared medical decision
      making is of the utmost importance. Research suggests that Latina women with pelvic floor
      disorders are overwhelmed by the amount and speed of information presented by healthcare
      providers and respond by placing healthcare decisions within the hands of the provider.

      Group medical visits have demonstrated improved quality of life, improved healthcare
      self-efficacy and closed outcomes gaps in low income groups. We propose a mixed methods study
      to compare group medical visits (GMVs) to usual care for Spanish speaking Latinas presenting
      to gynecology clinics at LAC+USC. The study will consist of a randomized control trial of
      GMVs compared to usual care. In addition we will hold focus group for participants of the GMV
      arm to gain insight into the patient experience of GMVs and how to improve the visits. The
      primary outcome will be improvement in urgency urinary incontinence symptoms as measured by
      the OABq SF. Additionally, changes in quality of life and healthcare self-efficacy will be
      measured before and after the intervention.
