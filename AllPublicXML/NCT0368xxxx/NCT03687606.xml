  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of long term use of hCG alone or hCG plus
      hMG in the treatment of male patients with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). One
      third of the participants will receive hCG treatment alone and the other third of the
      participants will receive hCG treatment alone for six months, then the hMG will be added. And
      the last third of the participants will receive hCG and hMG treatment since the beginning of
      the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of hCG alone or hCG plus hMG in the treatment of male IHH patients was reported
      in some studies. However, these studies were mostly non-randomized controlled studies with
      small size of samples and short follow-up time. There was also no reported study which aimed
      to compare the efficacy and safety of long term use of hCG or hCG plus hMG in the treatment
      of male patients with IHH. So the difference in the efficacy and safety between long term use
      of hCG alone and hCG plus hMG in the treatment of IHH is unknown. In different reported
      studies, the hCG plus hMG treatment had two regimens: using hCG alone for six month, then hMG
      was added and using hCG plus hMG since the beginning of the treatment. The difference in the
      efficacy and safety between the above two regimes is also unknown.
