  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe mental illness characterized by repetitive
      behaviors that a person feels compelled to perform. It has been demonstrated that stimuli in
      the environment can trigger the compulsive urge, perpetuating the OCD cycle. The main goal of
      the current proposal, which is based on exciting pilot data, is to test a novel computerized
      training program to create an association between OCD-related stimuli, which typically
      trigger the compulsive urge, and the brain system responsible for stopping. The idea is that
      once this system is triggered, it will be easier for patients to stop the compulsive urge.

    <description>Clinical assessment. Semi-structured interview that assesses the presence and severity of obsessions and compulsions over the past week. The 5-item Obsession Severity and Compulsion Severity subscales are summed to produce a Total Severity score. Symptoms endorsed are rated on a scale from none (0) to extreme (5). The 5-item Obsession Severity and Compulsion Severity subscales are summed to produce a Total Severity score.</description>
