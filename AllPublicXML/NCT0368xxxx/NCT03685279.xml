    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of the Nurtured Heart Approach (NHA) to reduce inattention
      and hyperactivity and impulsivity in children ages 6 - 8 years. Participants are parents or
      guardians of children diagnosed with, or suspected of, attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). Participants are randomized into the immediate (NHA) or delayed (Control)
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends evidence-based parent and/or teacher behavioral
      therapy and/or medication to treat ADHD. A systematic review by Coates and colleagues found
      behavioral interventions decreased ADHD behaviors in children. The NHA is an intervention
      designed to teach parents a set of skills and attitudes to decrease ADHD in children. It has
      been applied in a number of settings from homes, schools, and foster care agencies both in
      several states in the U.S. and in over 16 countries. While widely accepted, the Approach has
      not been evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods.

    <time_frame>Six-week change from pre-intervention inattention to post-intervention inattention.</time_frame>
    <description>Parent reported measure called Conners-3 Parent Short Form. Raw scores are converted into standardized T-scores using age- and sex-specific conversion standards. The minimum T-score is 40 and the maximum is 90. The six content subscales are inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, learning problems, executive function, defiance/aggression, and peer relations. Higher T-scores are worse.</description>
