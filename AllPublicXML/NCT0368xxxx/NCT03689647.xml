  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand and compare the metabolic and mechanical demands placed on the
      body while walking normally and walking with the use of an apparatus that drives leg swing
      through the use of the arms. This information will help the investigators identify how arm
      swing mechanics helps minimize energy demands and to use this knowledge to design walking
      rehabilitation interventions in the future.

    <description>The investigators are testing a simple, custom built apparatus to determine if it can facilitate the use of the arms to swing the legs during walking. More specifically, the investigators will measure how this assistive apparatus affects the metabolic cost and biomechanics of walking.</description>
