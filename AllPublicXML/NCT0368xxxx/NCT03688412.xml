  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, post-market clinical study was designed to evaluate the
      outcomes of lead extraction of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED) using
      Cook catheter and lead extraction devices for any indication it is used in the commercial
      setting within the United States and Europe. The purpose of this clinical study is to collect
      data on the performance of the Cook lead extraction devices for the purpose of supporting
      publications and presentations
