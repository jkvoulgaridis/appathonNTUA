        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic pain of the trunk and/or limbs for at least 6 months with back pain greater or
             equal to leg pain.

          -  22 years of age or older at time of enrollment

          -  Able to independently read and complete all questionnaires and assessments provided in

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any pain-related diagnosis or medical/psychological condition that, in the clinician's
             best judgment, might confound reporting of study outcomes

          -  Significant cognitive impairment that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             reasonably be expected to impair the study candidate's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Breast-feeding or planning to get pregnant during the course of the study or not using
             adequate contraception

          -  Participating, or intends to participate, in another clinical trial that may influence
