      To determine if daytime bright light will promote circadian alignment and shorten or prevent
      delirium. The objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine if a
      circadian entrainment intervention, daytime bright light, will promote circadian alignment
      and reduce days of delirium

    <description>Intervention: Daytime Bright Light
Patients will be eligible if they were admitted within 30 hours of noon on enrollment day (e.g. at or after 06:00 on the prior calendar day). Enrollment will occur before noon, and the day of enrollment is termed study day 1.
Patients will undergo monitoring (light levels, circadian alignment), starting on study day 1. Patients will be exposed to bright light from 09:00 to 13:00 starting on study day 2 and continuing through study day 5 or MICU discharge whichever is longer up to 30 days. Bright light exposure will occur in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and on the floor, if the patient is transferred (prior to study day 5). Feasibility metrics will also be collected.</description>

    <description>Intervention: Usual Care
Patients will be eligible if they were admitted within 30 hours of noon on enrollment day (e.g. at or after 06:00 on the prior calendar day). Enrollment will occur before noon, and the day of enrollment is termed study day 1.
Patients will undergo monitoring (light levels, circadian alignment), but otherwise, have usual care.</description>

    <intervention_name>Daytime Bright Light</intervention_name>
    <description>Daytime Bright Light (DBL) will be delivered by a free-standing apparatus set to deliver 10,000 lux. The device will be placed at the bedside within 36 inches of the patient's head and is expected to provide at least 1,250 lux at the angle of gaze. To remain in the study, the patient must be in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) through 13:00 on day 2 (e.g., the first day of potential intervention). After day 2, DBL and other study activities will continue if the patient is transferred out of the ICU to the general medical floor.</description>

                  inability to live independently)

               -  Acute brain injury of any severity (Injury less than 30 days ago including acute
                  intracranial bleed, traumatic brain injury, central nervous system infection,
                  tumor)

               -  Documented circadian disorder or blind/disease of the optic nerve

               -  Current history of substance abuse including alcohol (use in last 30 days)

        3. Transferred from an outside hospital. 4. History of bipolar disease 5. Paralyzed (due to
        injury, disease or medications)

        Enrolled patients who do not stay in the MICU through 13:00 of Study Day 2 will be
        excluded; patients transferred from the MICU to the floor between 22:00 and 05:00 on
        subsequent study nights will continue in the study but be excluded from the primary
        analysis (estimated 10% of patients).
