    <textblock>
      NAFLD is the most prevalent liver disease in the U.S., and there is a serious need to
      understand its progression to the advanced state, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
      Previous studies has shown that elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is the unique, early event
      distinguishing patients with NAFLD from equally-obese subjects with low IHTG. The purpose of
      this study is to directly by measure DNL in human liver tissue and comparing it to liver
      histological scores from patient biopsies.

    <textblock>
      The development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses from a state of
      elevated intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTG) to liver inflammation, and ultimately, hepatic
      apoptosis and fibrosis. NAFLD is the most prevalent liver disease in the U.S., and there is a
      serious need to understand its progression to the advanced state, nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH). Elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is the unique, early event
      distinguishing patients with NAFLD from equally-obese participants with low IHTG. DNL is the
      process of liver synthesis of fatty acids (FAs) from carbohydrate. In humans, studies have
      shown that DNL significantly predicts the magnitude of IHTG, however, it is unknown whether
      the pathway plays a role in disease progression. Evidence supporting this concept includes
      the fact that the primary product of DNL is the saturated FA, palmitate, which in cell
      culture has been shown to significantly contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation.
      Recent rodent data show that upregulation of DNL through dietary supplementation of sucrose
      exacerbated the hepatotoxic effects of excess dietary FAs. A preliminary abstract presented
      by others at the 2017 Liver Meeting suggested that DNL may not be different between patients
      with low and high liver fibrosis, although these data were collected using an indirect
      measure of liver disease. Here, in the present study, the hypothesis will be tested directly
      by measuring DNL in human liver tissue and comparing it to liver histological scores (NAFLD
      Activity Score, NAS) from patient samples.

    <description>Tissue histology will be performed to obtain NAFLD activity score (NAS). A pathologist, trained in determining the NAS of histological samples, grades them for the quantity of fat present, and the levels of inflammation and fibrosis. A score of 0 is considered completely healthy (devoid of any of these three characteristics), while a score of 8 indicates severe pathology, advanced as far as cirrhosis.</description>
