  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety, tolerance and acceptability of a lifestyle modification and
      targeted nutraceuticals for balanced bowel function in generally healthy volunteers. To
      evaluate safety and tolerability, blood samples were drawn for blood counts, metabolic
      profiles, plasma lipids, and additional cardiovascular risk factors. Quality of life
      questionnaires, medical symptom questionnaire were evaluated at baseline, week 1, week 2 and
      week 4. Vitals signs, weight and body composition were monitored at each visit.
