  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Healthy Patterns Study intervention is a home-based activity intervention designed to
      improve symptoms of circadian rhythm disorders (CRD) and quality of life (QOL) in
      home-dwelling persons with dementia. We will use a randomized two-group parallel design of
      200 people with dementia and their caregivers assigned to intervention or attention control
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia, a progressive and
      fatal neurodegenerative condition, affecting close to 15 million family caregivers (CG).
      Circadian rhythm disorders (CRDs) occur in the majority of persons with dementia and include
      late afternoon/evening agitation (e.g. sundowning) and irregular sleep-wake rhythms such as
      daytime hypersomnia, frequent night awakenings, and poor sleep efficiency. CRDs can cause a
      specific cluster of neuropsychiatric symptoms that occur in over 60 percent of patients with
      dementia and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of
      life. Regulating the circadian system via different types of activity have been shown to
      alter core clock processes that drive CRD symptoms and suggests that a combination of
      cognitive, physical, and sensory-based activities, delivered at strategic times, may be an
      effective mechanism to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms, decrease sleep disruptions, and
      enhance quality of life for both the care receiver and the caregiver.

      Specific components of this brief, one-month, eight sessions, home-based intervention
      include: 1) assessing PWD health/functional status and preferences/interests; 2) educating
      caregivers on environmental cues to promote activity and sleep; and 3) training of caregivers
      in using timed morning, afternoon, and evening activities based on circadian needs across the
      day.

    <description>Person with dementia quality of life. The QOL-AD scale uses a scale of 1-4 (poor, fair, good, or excellent) to rate a variety of life domains, including the patient's physical health, mood, relationships, activities, and ability to complete tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric Behaviors The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) is an informant-based instrument that measures the presence and severity of 12 Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) in patients with dementia, as well as informant distress.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms are rated by the caregiver within a domain in terms of both frequency (1=rarely, less than once per week; 2=sometimes, about once per week; 3=often, several times per week; and 4=very often, once or more per day) and severity (1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe), thus yielding a composite symptom domain score (frequency × severity) ranging from 0 (absence of behavioral symptoms) to 144 points (maximum severity of behavioral symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Circadian Rhythm Symptoms from actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a Motionlogger actigraphy bracelet worn by CR for consecutive 24-hour periods for one whole month.
Actigraphic measures of physical activity do not rely on participant self-report and may be of particular importance for efforts to examine the health benefits of physical activity across the full spectrum of older individuals especially those with dementia, a group in which loss of motor function is particularly salient.</description>
