  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate performances of a NIPT test based onto the study of the
      maternal blood to search known genetic mutations already detected in the family and
      potentially inherited by the fetus. This test will avoid an invasive prenatal diagnosis in
      those families with a known genetic risk.

      The performance of this test will be evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity with
      an adapted statistic model.

      Secondary objectives of the protocol are

        -  To adapt NIPT to small DNA quantity (5-50 ng)

        -  To adapt bioinformatics pipeline to low rate of mosaicism

        -  To develop a tool to quantify the fetal fraction

        -  To evaluate the robustness of the method

      This test is based onto capture and high throw put sequencing adapted to cell free plasmatic
      DNA of pregnant women in order to detect point mutation present in her fetus. This approach
      has been previously described for others clinical applications such as liquid biopsy in
      cancers but not for NIPT analysis.
