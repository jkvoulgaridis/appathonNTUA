  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center exploratory imaging study involving one intravenous microdose of
      [18F]F-AraG followed by whole-body positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET-MR)
      imaging in HIV infected individuals to determine the anatomical distribution of the PET
      tracer. Participants will be enrolled if they were treated during early or late HIV
      infection. In addition, individuals not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or with HIV-1 plasma
      RNA levels &gt;5,000 copies/mL will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PET radiofluorinated imaging agent, [18F]F-AraG
      (2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine; trade name VisAcT) localizes to sites of
      immune activation and is predominantly accumulated in proliferative T cells. As a result,
      there is interest in imaging residual immune activation in the setting of both treated and
      untreated HIV-1 infection, a disease in which chronic immune activation and inflammation may
      lead to significant morbidity, despite the use of otherwise suppressive ART.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the anatomical distribution of [18F]F-AraG in
      HIV-infected individuals taking or not taking antiretroviral therapy.

      Secondary objectives are to determine if [18F]F-AraG PET-MRI is able to detect differences in
      T cell activation between patients with early versus late treated HIV infection and to
      determine if [18F]F-AraG uptake correlates with direct blood and tissue measures of HIV
      reservoir size and activity in the above cohorts/studies.

          3. HIV infection, and Initiated a combination ART regimen, or, has never received ART,

             enrollment.

             (Of note, per Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines, the protocol
             team will strongly recommend that all HIV+ participants initiate ART who not done so
             already, both for their own health and to prevent the transmission of HIV infection.)
