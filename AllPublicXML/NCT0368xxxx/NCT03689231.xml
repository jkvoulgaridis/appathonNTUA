  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50% of intestinal NETs are metastatic at the time of diagnosis, the liver being the
      main affected organ in 50-90% of cases.

      Initial liver tumor burden and slope of the tumor growth rate are two major prognostic
      factors in patients with intestinal NETs, followed by tumor grade at pathology. They are used
      in routine practice by oncologists to adapt patient treatment.

      Unlike other tumors, most NETs metastases are slow-growing tumors. Previous studies have
      shown that approximately half of the patients diagnosed with liver metastases showed no
      progression over a period of 3 to 6 months.

      The aim of this non randomised retrospective cohort study is to investigate whether the
      volumetric monitoring of the total tumor burden compared to the RECIST 1.1 criteria (used in
      routine practice by radiologists) at baseline and early follow-up (3 to 6 months) is more
      suitable for NETs, making possible to predict the prognosis at the onset of the disease, and
      also allowing a better adaptation of the treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate if the initial volume of the liver tumor is a
      prognostic factor of time to progression, to correlate the initial liver tumor volume and the
      number of liver lesions to the blood concentration of Chromogranin A (CgA), the presence of
      extra-abdominal disease and to correlate the tumor growth rate (TGR) and KI 67 (%) at
      base-line.

    <description>Depending on the available data and to be reproducible, patients will be divided into 2 sub-groups of follow-up imaging: CT only or MRI only, combined evaluation being not reliable for tumor detection
Patient follow-up at CT or MRI will be analyzed at baseline (date of discovery of hepatic metastatic disease), then 3-6 months after the start of the study, then annually.
At each assessment, a radiologist will analyze: the total volume of liver metastases (mm3), the estimated volume of the two target lesions chosen for RECIST follow-up (mm3), the number of liver lesions, and the evolution according to the RECIST criteria based on uni-dimensional measurements.
We will then correlate the following clinical data collected for patients: age, sex, presence of a carcinoid syndrome, Ki67 (%) and chromogranin A blood level (%) at diagnosis, number and location of other metastases, Octreoscan or Stereotactic Radio Surgery data if available.</description>
