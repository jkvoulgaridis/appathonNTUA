  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a bench-top knot tying simulator (KNOTI), with computer acquired
      assessment. Fifteen attending surgeons and 30 first year surgical residents were recruited to
      the study held at tertiary medical center during the years 2017-2018. The participants tied
      eight knots in different settings (Superficial vs. Deep) and techniques (One hand vs. two
      hands).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The simulator is a bench-top simulator with computer acquired assessments, designed to allow
      novices to acquire basic surgical skills in knot tying. The simulator measures the forces
      used and applied on the tissue while ligating a vessel.

      Each participant received instructions for approximately 10 minutes with a standardized and
      detailed explanation of the knot-tying technique. All knots were square knots (double-throw
      knot) using the same type of sutures (SOLFSILK 3.0). Participants were asked to tie two knots
      in four types: A superficial one hand square knot; A superficial two hand square knot; A deep
      one hand square knot; A deep two hand square knot.

      For each knot six parameters were extracted from the sensor data: maximum upward force,
      maximum downward force, total upward force, total downward force, absolute non-zero force and
      performance time. Maximum force is the highest force applied during the knot tying.

      Participants were not aware of what exact parameters the simulator was assessing. Novices
      were explained to avoid tissue rupture or loose knots. Knot integrity was evaluated by an
      investigator present during the simulation that discarded &quot;air knots&quot;. Videos were reviewed
      by an investigator at post-study analysis to verify the appropriate technique and knot
      integrity.

    <description>For the novice group, the investigators recruited 30 residents within their first year of surgical residency (Post-Graduate Year [PGY]-1) in general surgery, vascular surgery, plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, cardio-thoracic surgery, gynecology and urology.
The intervention administered was the use of a simulator by the participants.</description>
