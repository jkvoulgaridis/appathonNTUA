  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this in situ clinical study is to determine whether a toothpaste containing
      hydroxyapatite microclusters is as effective as a fluoridated kid's toothpaste in promoting
      remineralization of early caries lesions and inhibiting the development of caries lesions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that (1) both the hydroxyapatite and the fluoridated toothpaste
      promote caries remineralization that is significantly greater than zero, and (2) the two
      toothpaste formulations are equally effective with respect to post-treatment remineralization
      and inhibition of demineralization.

        -  Non-inferiority will be considered established if there is no statistically significant
           difference in percentage of remineralization between the hydroxyapatite-containing
           toothpaste and the fluoridated kid's toothpaste for any one measurement method.

        -  Superiority/inferiority will be considered established if at least 20% statistically
           significant difference is observed between the hydroxyapatite-containing toothpaste and
           the fluoridated kid's toothpaste for any one measurement method
