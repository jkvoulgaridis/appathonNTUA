  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is generally treated by surgery, followed or preceded by
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Preoperative irradiation has been shown to be effective in a
      randomized trial, and is often indicated in locally advanced Soft tissue sarcomas of the
      limbs, in order to reach R0 resection, or in case of rapid tumor growth despite first
      chemotherapy. For inoperable sarcomas, radiotherapy is an efficient palliative treatment,
      increasing local control.

      Adaptive radiotherapy is defined as the set of procedures leading to the modification of a
      treatment plan based on the individual variations observed during irradiation. The place of
      this technique is increasing since the development of image-guided-radiotherapy allowing the
      visualization of daily variations in position, shape or volume of the tumor and organs at
      risk. Its implementation in current practice however remains limited because of the
      cumbersome processes involved (new delineation, new dose calculation, or even
      re-optimization) and resources to commit, especially in human time.

      Irradiation of soft tissue sarcomas always begins with a planning CT scan, where the
      target-volumes and organ at risk are delineated, and dosimetric calculations are performed
      prior to radiotherapy initiation. During the radiotherapy, the variations leading to a
      mismatch between the planned dose and the dose delivered are multiple. These may be due to
      positioning errors or morphological changes in the patient (weight loss), or in the tumor or
      organs at risk (modifications in shape, size or position). The volume of soft tissue sarcomas
      changes also during radiotherapy (response, progression or pseudo- progression of the tumor).

      However, to date, few data are available in the literature both on the volume variation of
      soft tissue sarcomas during preoperative radiotherapy, and on the interest of adaptive
      radiotherapy in the management of these tumors. It is therefore necessary to evaluate whether
      modifications of growth or macroscopic tumor volume are observed during the treatment, and to
      evaluate dosimetric impact on the target volume coverage that could impact the results of the
      treatment.

      This a prospective multicentric phase II trial conducted to evaluate the interest of adaptive
      radiotherapy in the preoperative or exclusive management of limb sarcomas Patients will be
      treated by preoperative or definitive radiotherapy for a limb soft tissue sarcomas, using an
      intensity-modulated conformal irradiation (with a static or dynamic technic), over 5 to 7
      consecutive weeks. The total dose delivered will be of 50 Gray (preoperative radiation
      therapy), or 60 to 70 Gray (exclusive radiation therapy). The delineation of growth or
      macroscopic tumor volume,clinical target volume, and planning target volume, as well as
      healthy surrounding tissues will be carried out in each of the centers, and under the
      responsibility of the radiotherapist, on The simulation CT-scan, used for dosimetry, and 3 CT
      scan performed on day 1 of radiotherapy (d1), at a dose of 30Gy (d30Gy) and 50Gy (d50GY). The
      dosimetric re-planning according to the variations of the volume of the planning target
      volume will be done in case of significant variation of the target volume according to de
      definition mentionned in the main and secondary objectives.

      Main objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the interest of adaptive radiotherapy in
      the preoperative or exclusive management of limb sarcomas.

      This is the first prospective trial focused on the evaluation of the volume variation of soft
      tissue sarcomas during preoperative radiotherapy, and also on the interest of adaptive
      radiotherapy in the management of these tumors, whereas indications of preoperative and/or
      exclusive radiation therapy are very frequent.
