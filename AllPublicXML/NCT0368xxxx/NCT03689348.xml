  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The flavanoid and terpene phytochemicals present in wild green oat interact with multiple
      mechanisms relevant to brain function; including those which would modulate cognition and
      stress. The current study aims to test this in a group of N=128 males and females between the
      ages of 35-65yrs before and after 28 days supplementation of placebo, 300-, 600- and 900mg of
      a wild green oat extract.

      The flavanoid and terpene phytochemicals present in wild green oat interact with multiple
      mechanisms relevant to brain function; including those which would modulate cognition and
      stress. The current study aims to test this in a group of N=128 males and females between the
      ages of 35-65yrs before and after 28 days supplementation of placebo, 300-, 600- and 900mg of
      a wild green oat extract. The study is randomized (within x3 age categories also; 35-45,
      46-55, 56-65yrs), placebo controlled and counterballanced across parallel groups.
      Participants will first attend a training/screening session followed by x2 lab-based testing
      sessions, 28 days apart. In the lab-based sessions participants will complete baseline
      cognitive assessments; including whilst undergoing a stressful observed methodology (the
      observed multi-tasking stressor or 'OMS'). Here galvanic skin response and heart rate will be
      measured and before and after the OMS participants will provide a saliva sample which will be
      analysed for cortisol and alpha-amylase levels. This procedure will be repeated 120- and 240-
      minutes post-dose. Between the lab-based sessions participants will complete mood scales via
      a mobile phone application 'cognimapp'.

    <measure>Changes in mood; as assessed by the 'Profile Of Mood States' (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and post-dose on day 1 and day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be assessed with the profile of mood states questionnaire questionnaire and this will be completed at the start and end of the testing day on day 1 and day 29. To assess if the investigational product (IP) has changed mood a change score will be calculated (end of day minus start of day) and this will be compared between the x4 treatment groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be assessed with the general anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire on day 1 and then again on day 8, 15, 22 and 29 of the study intervention period. Change from baseline scores will be calculated and, at each subsequent time point, scores will be compared across the x4 treatment groups to ascertain if the IP has changed mood.</description>

    <measure>Changes in mood; as assessed by the 'General Health Questionnaire' (GHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and post-dose on day 1 and day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be assessed with the general health questionnaire and this will be completed at the start and end of the testing day on day 1 and day 29. To assess if the investigational product (IP) has changed mood a change score will be calculated (end of day minus start of day) and this will be compared between the x4 treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Changes in cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 120 minutes and 240 minutes post-dose on day 1 and day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed via several individual cognitive tasks (stroop, rapid visual information processing and corsi blocks) and will together provide indicators of accuracy and speed. This data will be collected at baseline, 120- and 240-minutes post-dose on day 1 and day 29. Change from baseline scores will be calculated and compared across the x4 treatment groups to ascertain if the IP has changed cognitive function.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 120 minutes and 240 minutes post-dose on day 1 and day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective stress will be measured via the perceived stress scale before and after each completion of the observed multitasking stressor (OMS) on day 1 and on day 29. The change in the stress response between pre- and post-OMS will be compared across the x4 treatment groups to ascertain if the IP has changed subjective perceptions of stress.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must self-assess themselves as being in good health

          -  Aged 35 to 65 years at the time of giving consent

          -  In employment and/or higher education or full time child-care

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants are not eligible to take part if they:

          -  Have any pre-existing medical condition/illness which will impact taking part in the
             study NOTE: the explicit exceptions to this are controlled (medicated) arthritis,
             asthma, hay fever, high cholesterol and reflux-related conditions. There may be other,
             unforeseen, exceptions and these will be considered on a case-by-case basis; i.e.
             participants may be allowed to progess to screening if they have a condition/illness
             which would not interact with the active treatments or impede performance.

          -  Are currently taking prescription medications NOTE: the explicit exceptions to this
             are contraceptive and hormone replacement treatments for female participants where
             symptoms are stable and treatment will not change during the course of the study,
             those medications used in the treatment of arthritis, high cholesterol and
             reflux-related conditions; and those taken 'as needed' in the treatment of asthma and
             hay fever. As above, there may be other instances of medication use which, where no
             interaction with the active treatments is likely, and which would not be expected to
             impede the participant's ability to perform the study assessments, participants may be
             able to progress to screening.

          -  Are currently participating in other clinical or nutrition intervention studies, or
             have in the past 4 weeks
