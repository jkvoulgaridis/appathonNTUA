  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this research project is to identify what factors motivate patients to seek
      assessment for early lymphedema and further, to gain insight into the signs and symptoms of
      developing lymphedema and the concurrent physical measurements.

      The second aim is to identify other sensory signs and symptoms and changes in body perception
      which may be perceived by the patient as reflective of lymphedema, and to identify to which
      degree they contribute to the patients' motivation to seek referral to lymphedema clinics.

      One of the most challenging morbidities after breast cancer treatment is lymphedema.
      Approximately 20% of women treated for breast cancer with axillary lymph node dissection will
      be diagnosed with lymphedema. Pre- and post-operatively, women are informed about changes
      suggestive of lymphedema and guided about seeking further assessment. The investigators
      presume that if symptoms occur, patients will seek assessment. However, it is unknown whether
      this is true or if those prospectively monitored present earlier for treatment, or whether
      other factors specifically drive patients to seek further assessment. Understanding the early
      experience and presentation of secondary lymphedema will improve patient education and
      detection programs.

        Two hundred women who have previously been treated for unilateral breast cancer and are
        referred for the first time to a lymphedema clinic. These patients presenting for the first
        time with breast cancer-related lymphedema will be asked to have an immediate objective
        assessment of their lymphedema and to administer additional questionnaires and clinical
        tests.
