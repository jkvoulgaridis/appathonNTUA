      A RCT study to compare the efficacy of ONS supplementation with standard dietary advice on
      nutritional outcome inHNC outpatients undergoing treatment in radiotherapy clinic. IThe study
      population are all adult HNC outpatients receiving radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy
      treatments at Radiotherapy Clinic,NCI. Selected patient will be randomized into Control Group
      and Intervention Group until each group have 20 subjects, where the total of sample will be
      40 patients (in consideration of 50% dropouts) and data will be collected at baseline (prior
      to treatment), week 2, 4, and the final data will be at week 6 or final day of cancer
      treatment. Study objectives are to determine the efficacy of ONS supplementation in
      outpatient HNC undergoing treatment in Radiotherapy Clinic, NCI, to determine nutritional
      outcome (weight loss and BMI, body composition, dietary intake, albumin and hemoglobin
      level), functional outcome (handgrip strength) and side effect outcome (nutrition impact
      symptoms) in HNC outpatients given intensive nutrition intervention with outpatients given
      routine care. This study also want to find association of Intensive nutrition intervention
      versus routine care in nutrition outcome, functional and side effect outcome in both group.
      Subjects in intervention group will received standardize ONS supplementation every day during
      treatments once daily with frequent dietary advice accordingly to the patients condition
      while control group will received standard routine care which includes frequent dietary
      advice without supplementation of ONS. Study hypothesis is there is no significant difference
      in nutritional outcome, functional outcome and side effect outcome between HNC outpatients
      receiving INI when compared to HNC outpatient receiving routine care undergoing radiotherapy
      treatment. There is also no association between these two groups in nutritional outcome,
      functional outcome and side effect outcome.
