  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerus Endovascular is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center trial to document the safety and
      performance of the Contour Neurovascular System™ (&quot;Contour&quot;).

      The purpose of the study is to document safety and performance of the Contour in treatment
      for patients with intracranial aneurysms (IA). The data from the study will be reported as a
      Pre-Market study to the Notified Body to support CE Mark approval.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients of all genders who meet all indications and contraindications will proceed to
        implantation.

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Patient's indication for treatment of unruptured aneurysm is according to the
             national/international guidelines.

          2. Age 18-80 years at screening

          3. Patients who are suitable for non-emergency endovascular embolization of saccular IAs

          4. IA located at a bifurcation in the anterior or posterior circulation with dimensions
             consistent with implant size selection guidelines included in the IFU

          5. Patient has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is willing and able to
             participate in the study for the duration of the study follow-up and is able to comply
             with study requirements

          6. Patient able to able to give their informed consent can be included in this study.
             This must be demonstrated by means of a personally signed and dated informed consent
             document indicating that the subject has been informed of and understood all pertinent
             aspects of the study.

        Exclusion criteria

        The presence of condition that may create unacceptable risk during the aneurysm
        embolization procedure, such as patients with:

          1. Ruptured aneurysm

          2. Patient anatomy or physiology considered unsuitable for endovascular treatment

          3. Contraindication for arterial access

          4. Largest measured IA equatorial diameter &gt;8.5 mm or &lt;2 mm

          5. Largest measured IA neck diameter &gt;8 mm or &lt;2 mm

          6. Target IA contains other devices/implants (e.g., coils)

          7. Known allergy to platinum, nickel or titanium

          8. Known allergy to contrast agents

          9. Contraindication to anticoagulants or platelet inhibitor medication

         10. Stenosis of the target IA's parent vessel &gt;50%

         11. Anticoagulation medications such as warfarin that cannot be discontinued

         12. Pregnant, breastfeeding or planning pregnancy in the next 2 years

         13. Acute / chronic renal failure (including dialysis); Creatinine &gt; 2.00 mg/dl or &gt; 182
             μmol/L

         14. Myocardial Infarction, Stroke or TIA within the last 6 months

         15. Any other medical issue within the brain that precludes the device implantation such
             as brain surgery, radiation in the target area of intervention, acute traumatic
             craniocerebral injury, etc.

         16. Other medical conditions that cause an inability to comply with study requirements
             and/or that could increase the risk of neurovascular procedures or death within 2
             years (e.g., liver failure, cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease, immunosuppression, neural disease, and hematologic disorders etc.)

         17. Participating in another study with investigational devices or drugs that would
             confound the effects of the study outcomes
