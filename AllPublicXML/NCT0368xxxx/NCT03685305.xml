  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than two-thirds of middle-aged and older adults are overweight, which places them at
      greater risk of disability and higher medical expenses. Lifestyle interventions which promote
      weight loss for this population are needed. However, it is not known how different weight
      loss approaches impact brain (cognitive) functions, such as memory and attention. The
      investigator's investigation aims to improve adherence to a hypocaloric diet prescription
      through improved attention and inhibitory control, reduced hunger, and increased satiety.

      The objectives of this pilot study are to: 1) determine the feasibility and establish
      proof-of-concept; 2) establish proficiency and feasibility of the proposed cognitive function
      assessments; and 3) obtain preliminary data for effect size generation.

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) survey will be used to measure hunger at baseline and after both the 4-week weight loss and weight maintenance phases. Participants make a mark on a 100 mm line that corresponds to their subjective feelings (range of score is 0-100). The line is anchored by descriptors that are polar opposites (not at all hungry to extremely hungry). The score is determined by using the place on the line where the mark is made by the participants.</description>

    <description>Participants will be prescribed a hypocaloric diet with additional instructions to promote hunger reduction. The hypocaloric diet will range 1200-1500 kcal/d, and will be based upon the 2015 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Dietary instructions will be provided by a Registered Dietitian.</description>

    <description>Participants will be counseled to consume a hypocaloric diet during the 4-week weight loss phase. Counseling will include specific instructions on a dietary manipulation which may reduce hunger, in order to facilitate dietary adherence.This will include tracking of the strategy. They will also be provided a pedometer and instructed to attain 10,000 steps per day.</description>
