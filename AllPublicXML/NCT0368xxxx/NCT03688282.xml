  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The wearable vibration device aims to consistently deliver vibrations directly to the hip and
      spine and allowing use during many everyday activities. We propose that demonstrating higher
      rates of compliance and consistent delivery of optimal force, with accelerometer feedback,
      will provide a superior alternative to whole body vibration and is plausibly more effective
      at preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women than vibration platforms in the home setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that postmenopausal women will tolerate our device,
      have high rates of compliance with the study protocol, receive consistently therapeutic
      levels of vibration and see significant effects on bone turnover based on plasma markers of
      bone anabolism and catabolism.

      The anticipated outcomes from serum draws are an improvement in two bone turnover markers
      after a 9-30 minute treatment with the WVD.
