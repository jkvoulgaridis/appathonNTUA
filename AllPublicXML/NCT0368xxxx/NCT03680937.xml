  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decades, there was an improvement of the cancer treatments of the woman and
      the teenagers. Therefore higher survival rate is described. However, cancer treatments can
      alter the reproduction functions and reduce considerably the window of the fertility to the
      adulthood. Therefore, it is recommended to proceed to a fertility preservation by oocytes
      vitrification when it is possible. The vitrification is a freezing technique allowing high
      survival rate and similar results by assisted reproductive technologies compared with the use
      of fresh oocytes. An innovative method of automated vitrification was recently developed. The
      usual protocol consist to vitrify mature oocytes. However, this strategy cannot be used for
      hormone -sensitive cancer or when ovarian stimulation is not possible. In these situations,
      immature oocytes can be collected. It is also necessary to realize an in vitro maturation
      step for a use by assisted reproductive technology.

      According to the recent data of the literature, it remains unclear whether the vitrification
      of ovocytes must be performed before or after in vitro maturation (IVM). Therefore the aim of
      this study is to study the impact on structure and functions of ovocytes when vitrification
      is performed before or after IVM. The vitrification will be performed by a semi-automatic
      method which is an innovative method.

      To perform this study, investigator will compare three groups. Group 1: immature ovocytes
      vitrified before IVM; Group 2: immature oocytes vitrified after IVM; Group3: fresh immature
      oocytes treated by IVM (without vitrification, control group).

      The immature oocytes provide from ICSI patients. In routine these oocytes (germinal vesicle)
      are normally destroyed because they cannot be used for injection. The women will give an
      informed and written consent. Inclusion criteria are women less 37 years without
      dysovulation.

      The vitrification will be performed with the semi-automatic method (Gavi, Merck). The kinetic
      and maturation rate will be analysed by time lapse (Primovision, Vitrolife) In the mature
      oocytes, the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton, the spindle organization and the cortical
      granules will be studied by immunofluorescence and 3D confocal microscopy. The expression of
      maternal factors transcription will be analyzed by RT-PCR. The ploidy will be analysed by
      multiFISH and/or CGH array.

    <description>Metaphase-II stage oocytes will be used for Immuno-Fluorescence experiments to stain actin, tubulin and chromosomes. Oocytes will be imaged using confocal microscope to perform high resolution imaging and quantitative image analysis. The length, position and orientation of the second meiotic spindle will be analysed. The actin network and chromosomes will be analysed quantitatively.
