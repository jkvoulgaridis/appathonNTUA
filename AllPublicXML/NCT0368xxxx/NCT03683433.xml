  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well enasidenib and azacitidine work in treating patients
      with IDH2 gene mutation and acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or does not
      respond to treatment (refractory). Enasidenib and azacitidine may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of enasidenib mesylate (AG221, IDHIFA) in combination
      with azacitidine (AZA) for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia is
      measured by overall response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine duration of response, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the safety of enasidenib in combination with azacitidine in patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate occurrence of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status by IDH2 mutation
      analysis and flow cytometry.

      II. To investigate possible relationships between baseline protein and gene expression
      signatures and mutation profile and clinical response to the combination.

      III. To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of IDH-inhibitor related differentiation
      syndrome (IDH-DS) with combination therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days 1-7 and enasidenib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 5 years.
