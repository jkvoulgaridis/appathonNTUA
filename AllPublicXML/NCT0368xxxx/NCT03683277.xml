  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Multicenter, Open-label, Phase II study of ixazomib, plus Pomalidomide and
      Dexamethasone regimen (IPD) in RRMM with adverse Genomic Abnormalities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no escalation dose study, the maximum tolerated dose has already been determined in
      previous phase 1 escalation dose studies. The proposed dose of dexamethasone is considered
      standard. Patients will receive the IPd regimen until progression.

      The hypothesis is that this IPd regimen based combination will eventually improve time to
      disease progression, with no additional toxicity, as compared to other available regimens, in
      this subgroup of patients with myeloma characterized with a very adverse prognosis.

      Study design. This trial will study the efficacy and safety of IPd regimen in Relapsed and
      Refractory Multiple Myeloma with adverse Genomic Abnormalities until progression in 2
      separate phases.

        -  Induction phase: 17 cycles - 21-days cycles Ixazomib 3 mg D1, D4, D8 and D11
           Pomalidomide 4mg D1 to D14 Dexamethasone 40 mg/d D1, D8 and D15 if patient aged &lt;75
           years Dexamethasone 20 mg/d D1, D8 and D15 if patient aged ≥ 75 years

        -  Maintenance phase: until progression - 28-days cycles Ixazomib 4mg D1, D8 and D15
           Pomalidomide 4mg D1 to D21

        -  It is not planned for the patients to receive autologous stem-cell transplantation as
           part of the study trial
