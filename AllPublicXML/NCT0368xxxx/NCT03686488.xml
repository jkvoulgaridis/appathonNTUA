          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) 1.1. Stage IV or recurrent disease is required. An irradiated lesion is
             considered evaluable only if it has shown enlargement since the completion of last
             radiation.

          -  Participants must have received and progressed with prior therapy. Prior therapy with
             ramucirumab is not allowed. Participants must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             the previous anti-cancer chemotherapy (with the exception of alopecia).

             Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000/mm3 independent of
             growth factor support, Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper
             limits of normal (ULN) unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of
             non-hepatic origin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and
             Alkaline Phosphatase ≤2.5 times the ULN ( ≤5 x ULN for patients with liver
             involvement), Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min.

          -  Participants must not have had chemotherapy,major surgery, monoclonal antibody therapy
             or experimental therapy within the 28 days prior to the start of TAS 102
             administration.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to the start of study drug. Post-menopausal women (defined as no

             undergo a pregnancy test.

          -  Participants (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception beginning at the signing of the informed consent form until at least 4
             months for both females and males after the last dose of study drug. The definition of
             adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or
             a designated associate.

          -  Participants must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed
             consent form. A signed informed consent form must be appropriately obtained prior to
             the conduct of any trial-specific procedure. Subjects must be willing and able to
             comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory testing, and other study
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with active Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases are excluded. If CNS
             metastases are treated and participants are at neurologic baseline for at least 2
