  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant
      females, 18-64 years of age. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic 2017 monovalent inactivated influenza
      A/H7N9 virus vaccine (2017 H7N9 IIV) manufactured by Seqirus Inc (Seqirus) administered at
      different dosages (3.75 microgram mcg, 7.5 mcg and 15 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose)
      given with MF59(R) adjuvant manufactured by Seqirus Inc., or without adjuvant (15 mcg of HA
      per dose). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluent manufactured by Patheon Manufacturing
      Services LLC will be used to achieve certain targeted doses. Approximately 371 subjects who
      are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized into one of 4 study
      groups. The study will be conducted at up to 7 Vaccine and Treatment Unit (VTEU) sites and
      will last approximately 17 months, with subject participation duration of approximately 13
      months. The Primary Objectives of the study are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity
      following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered intramuscularly (IM) at
      different dosages approximately 21 days apart given with or without MF59(R) adjuvant; 2) To
      assess the serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses
      approximately 21 days following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM at
      different dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without MF59(R) adjuvant.

      days following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM at different dosages
      approximately 21 days apart with or without MF59(R) adjuvant.

      The secondary Objectives are: 1) To assess all unsolicited non-serious Adverse Events (AEs)
      following receipt of two doses of a 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM at different dosages
      approximately 21 days apart with or without MF59(R) adjuvant; 2) To assess medically-attended
      adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs), potentially
      immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs), and all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) following
      receipt of two doses of a 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM at different dosages approximately 21
      days apart with or without MF59(R) adjuvant; 3) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody
      responses approximately 7 and 21 days following receipt of a single dose, and approximately 7
      days following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM at different dosages
      approximately 21 days apart with or without MF59(R) adjuvant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 18-64 years of age, inclusive.

          4. Are in good health*. *As determined by physical examination and medical history to
             evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined
             as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no
             hospitalizations, Emergency Room, or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms
             that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This
             includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result
             of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as
             determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will
             not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic
             or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator
             or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
             to study vaccination. [Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of
             inhaled corticosteroids), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted].

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degree Fahrenheit.

          6. Pulse is 47 to 100 beats per minute, inclusive.

          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 millimeters of Mercury, inclusive.

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 millimeters of Mercury, inclusive.

          9. Women of childbearing potential* must agree to practice an acceptable contraception
             method** from 30 days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study
             vaccination.

             *Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy,
             hysterectomy, or successful Essure(R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal
             sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after
             the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal.

             **Includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a
             male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been
             vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving the first study
             vaccination, barrier methods such as male or female condoms with spermicide or with
             the use of applied spermicide, intrauterine devices, NuvaRing(R), and licensed
             hormonal methods such as implants, injectables, or oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;).

         10. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have an acute illness*, as determined by the site Principal Investigatoor or
             appropriate sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

             *An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining
             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess
             safety parameters as required by the protocol.

          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site Principal
             Investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study
             participation*.

             *Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for at
             least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render
             the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the
             evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial.

          3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, a recent
             history or current use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulating disease therapy.

          4. Use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior
             to study vaccination.

          5. Have known active neoplastic disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy.
