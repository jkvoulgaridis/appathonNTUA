  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after forefoot surgery can be important and regional anesthesia plays a crucial role in
      post-operative pain control. Several techniques can be used to achieve surgical anesthesia as
      well as postoperative analgesia. Of those techniques the ankle block and sciatic nerve block
      at the popliteal fossa are the most common. The primary goal of this study is thus to compare
      the analgesic duration of these two types of blocks for patients undergoing forefoot surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for unilateral forefoot surgery, aged over 18 years old and ASA status
      I-III without any contra-indications for regional anesthesia will be enrolled.

      After a standard randomisation, patients will be allocated in either of two groups : ankle
      block or sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa. In both groups the patients will have a
      multimodal analgesic regimen followed by a patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) of morphine.

      The primary endpoint is the analgesic duration, defined by the time between the end of the
      block procedure and the first IV request of morphine from a PCA.
