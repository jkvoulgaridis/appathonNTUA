  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption (relative
      bioavailability) of seltorexant Phase 3 test formulation(s) relative to a reference Phase 2b
      tablet formulation dosed in the evening under fasted and semi-fasted conditions (3 hours
      after meal); to assess the effect of type and timing of the meal on the rate and extent of
      absorption of seltorexant Phase 3 tablet formulation (low dose and high dose strength) in
      healthy male and female participants; and to assess the pharmacokinetic of single-dose
      administration of low dose and high dose of seltorexant in healthy male and female
      participants 3 hours after meal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be healthy on the basis of medical history (screening only), physical examination,
             vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening and Day 1
             (predose)

          -  Be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  All female participants (regardless of childbearing potential), must have a negative
             serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a
             negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1 of each treatment period

          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction during the study and for at least 1 month after the last study drug
             administration

          -  A man, who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy, must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed appropriate by
             the investigator (for example, abstinence, vasectomy, barrier method, partner using
             effective contraception)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic (Child-Pugh Score greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 7)
             or renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] less than [&lt;] 60

             diet renal disease [MDRD] formula at screening only), thyroid disease, neurologic
             (including seizure disorders) or psychiatric disease (depression or anxiety disorder
             in remission is acceptable), infection, or any other illness that the investigator
             considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the

             history, or any disease/surgery that would with interfere drug absorption

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry (including
             thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] at screening only) or urinalysis at screening or at
             admission to the study site. It is expected that laboratory values will generally be
             within the normal range for the laboratory, though minor deviations, which are not
             considered to be of clinical significance to the investigator, are acceptable

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or 12-lead ECG at
             screening or at admission to the study site though minor deviations, which are not
             considered to be of clinical significance to the investigator are acceptable

          -  Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal
             supplements), except for acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, and hormonal replacement
             therapy within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug is scheduled. Or has
             used any systemic herbal medications or dietary supplements including products
             containing Hypericum perforatum (for example, St. John's Wort) from 21 days before the
             first dose of study drug is scheduled

             14 days or a period less than 5 times the drugs half-life; whichever is longer, before
             the first dose of the study drug is scheduled
