      This study is a prospective trial of 200 individuals at high risk for lung cancer who are not
      eligible for lung cancer screening under current screening guidelines. Potential subject's 6
      yr lung cancer risk must exceed 1.5% by the Tammamagi PLCO2012m calculator. Patients will
      undergo a non contrast CT chest for lung cancer screening. This cutoff should encompass in
      excess of 80% of all lung cancer cases (10). However, in patients 78-82 years old we will set
      the 6 yr lung cancer risk threshold at 4.0% as these patients will typically have other
      competing risks of death and this may potentially limit screening benefit in these older
      individuals.
