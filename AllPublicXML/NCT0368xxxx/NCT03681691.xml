      The primary aim of this study is to test whether type 2 diabetes interacts with estradiol on
      brain metabolism in vivo in humans. This will be accomplished by imaging brain metabolism
      using positron emission tomography before and after short-term administration of transdermal
      17β-estradiol in 10 postmenopausal women with diabetes and 10 non-diabetic postmenopausal
      women.

      Epidemiological studies suggest there may be an interaction between type 2 diabetes and
      estrogen in postmenopausal women, such that diabetes may interact with estrogen levels over
      time to increase risk for dementia. The mechanism for this effect is now known. However,
      animal research suggests that it may occur through estrogen's effects on cellular metabolism
      of glucose and ketone bodies. The primary aim of this study is to test whether type 2
      diabetes interacts with estradiol on brain metabolism in vivo in humans. This will be
      accomplished by imaging brain metabolism using positron emission tomography before and after
      short-term administration of transdermal 17β-estradiol in 10 postmenopausal women with
      diabetes and 10 non-diabetic postmenopausal women.

    <measure>Change in uptake of glucose and ketone bodies in whole brain and Alzheimer's disease-related regions of interest.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brain metabolism will be measured using PET tracers to examine brain glucose uptake (FDG PET) and ketone body (acetoacetate) uptake (AcAc). PET imaging data are co-registered to T1 structural MRI data to conduct region-of-interest based analyses. Absolute global and regional uptake of FDG and AcAc tracers will be quantified, as well as uptake of AcAc relative to FDG to find potential regions of compensatory ketone use</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in short-term memory and executive function composite scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A battery of cognitive tasks will be administered before and after estrogen administration. Composite z-scores will be calculated by calculating a z-score for each cognitive task and summing z-scores from -5 (low) to 5 (high) for the tasks designated as short-term memory and executive function.Higher scores denotes better outcomes.</description>
