      A prospective, multi-center, Single-Arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      endovascular treatment of the aortoiliac aneurysm or the iliac aneurysm by using Iliac
      Bifurcation Stent Graft System manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD.
      According to the requirements of the study, 64 patients preoperatively diagnosed with the
      aortoiliac aneurysm or the iliac aneurysm will be recruited and be treated by Iliac
      Bifurcation Stent Graft System under the guidance of aortic aortography. The safety of
      operations, stability of releasing stent and the accuracy of positioning will be evaluated
      intraoperatively. The safety and efficacy of aortic endovascular treatment of Iliac
      Bifurcation Stent Graft System will be observed by postoperative follow up scheduled 30 days
      and 180 days after the operation.
