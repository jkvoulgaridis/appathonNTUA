      Study will be conducted in infertility clinic,Ain Shams university maternity hospital.Study
      population comprises women with unexplained infertility aged 20-35 years with total sample
      size of 170 who willbe randomized into two groups with 85 women in each group.

      form of tablet.

      Vaginal ultrasound is done for all in day 2 to exclude presence of ovarian cyst and to
      identify normal appearance of ovaries,then folliculometry on day 9 followed by serial
      folliculometry every other day till reaching dominant follicle 18 mm or more where HCG
      intramuscular injection will be given in a dose of 10000 iu .
