      SUMMARY: (Objective, design, scope of the study, subjects of study, instrumentation, results,
      conclusions)

      Objectives: To evaluate if the physiotherapy treatment in pelvic floor dysfunctions,
      identified by transperineal ultrasound 3 / 4D, in postpartum improve the tone and
      functionality of pelvic floor.

      Design: Post-authorization, prospective, longitudinal randomized intervention study

      Scope: Full-term deliveries at the University Hospital. Subjects of study: Full-term
      primiparous and full-term pregnancies with pelvic floor lesion, identified by transperineal
      ultrasound 3 / 4D, which are randomized between the physiotherapy treatment of pelvic floor
      and the non-work.

      Variables: Primary variable: Assess the improvement in contractility / tone, evaluation by
      manometry and assess the anatomical improvement of the area of ?? the genital hiatus, stay by
      transperineal ultrasound 3 / 4D. Secondary variables: Identify the levator ani muscle injury
      rate, estimate the sonographic changes in the levator ani muscle through rehabilitation.
      Analyze the improvement of the symptoms associated with the public organic prolapse and
      evaluate the improvement of the quality of life.

      Data analysis: To detect a difference of 10% in the reduction of the size of the index
      between the study groups (not intervened / intervened) after 6 months of intervention,
      standard deviation 10%, Error-alpha 5%, Error- beta 10% (P90%) we need 23 women in each
      group. Assuming a loss of 10% in the follow-up, the final size would be 52 women, 26 per
      group.

    <description>The therapy lasted two months, at a rate of two sessions per week, with a duration of 45 minutes per session. The program consisted of pelvic floor exercises assisted by manometric biofeedback, which were performed in supine position for 20 minutes. In addition, active lumbopelvic stabilization exercises, including the contraction of pelvic floor muscles was performed in supine, plank and quadruped position.
Together with the treatment at the clinic, patients were asked to perform a series of exercises at home, consisting in: 8-12 sustained contractions of 6 seconds, with a subsequent rest period of double the work-time, followed by 3-5 fast contractions of 2 seconds with maximum intensity, resting double the work-time. Domiciliary exercises were performed in supine, siting and standing position.</description>
