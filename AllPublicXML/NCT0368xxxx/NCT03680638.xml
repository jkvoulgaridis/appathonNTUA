    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine possible mechanisms of impaired vasodilaton in obese and
      Black/African American men and women as possible links to the elevated prevalence of
      cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. The main targets in this study are sources of
      oxidative stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The integrative vascular laboratory has recently observed that the small blood vessels in the
      skin (the cutaneous microvasculature) in obese (BMI&gt;30kg/m2), but otherwise healthy
      individuals, require a greater amount of nitric oxide (NO) to achieve the same degree of
      dilation when compared to age, gender, and race matched lean (BMI&lt;25kg/m2) individuals (34).
      In addition, it is well documented that African Americans have impaired blood vessel function
      which likely contributes to the elevated risk for developing a variety of cardiovascular and
      metabolic diseases including coronary artery disease, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and
      stroke in this population. The cutaneous circulation is recognized as a surrogate vascular
      bed for assessment of mechanisms underlying systemic vascular disease (7, 20, 22). This is
      particularly important as microvascular dysfunction is emerging as a critical step in the
      atherosclerotic process and a variety of conditions including hypertension, exercise
      intolerance, and insulin resistance (25). Furthermore, impaired cutaneous microvascular
      function mirrors impaired responses in other vascular beds (7, 12, 20, 22). A primary
      advantage to utilizing the cutaneous circulation is that it provides an accessible vascular
      bed through which processes of endothelial function can be systematically and mechanistically
      investigated, with virtually no risk, through thermal stimuli and local intra-dermal drug
      infusions. Mechanisms of impaired NO bioavailability have been assessed in various at-risk
      and diseased populations including, healthy aging, hypertension, postural tachycardia
      syndrome, hypercholesteremia, and chronic kidney disease (8, 16, 19, 24, 36, 37). Using
      approaches and techniques similar to those proposed in this application (see below) the
      findings have implicated that a number of factors, including elevated oxidative stress,
      contribute to the reduced bioavailability and/or action of NO (8, 16, 19, 24, 36, 37)

      The recent findings suggest an impairment in the action of NO on the microvascular smooth
      muscle of obese young adults (34) as well as in college-aged otherwise healthy African
      Americans. Local heating is a common method to test nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation (3, 6,
      31). Therefore, the investigators propose to test the following hypotheses:

        1. Obesity results in impaired blood flow response to local heating and this will also be
           the case for African Americans.

        2. Inhibition of superoxide, a common form of oxidative stress, augments the local heating
           response in obese individuals as well as in African Americans.

        3. Inhibition of sources of superoxide, NADPH-oxidase and/or Xanthine-oxidase, augments
           skin blood flow local heating response in obese to that of their lean counterparts. This
           will also be the case for African Americans relative to their Caucasian American
           counterparts.

    <description>Assess the impact of oxidative stress on impaired vasodilation to local heating. This will be elicited using intradermal microdialysis infusions of apocynin, allopurinol, or tempol, all of which are vasoactive substances. The changes in skin blood flux will be quantified using laser Doppler fluxmetry. All changes in flux will be normalized and reported as a percentage of maximal flux.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals (ages 18-35, both genders) will be recruited from the greater Arlington
             area to participate in the study.

          -  Must self-report both parents as either African American or Caucasian American.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have donated more than 550 ml of blood within the past 8 weeks will
             not have blood drawn from them in this protocol. However, if they remain interested in
             the study, and otherwise meet the inclusion criteria, than we may still opt to proceed
             with data collection.

          -  Individuals with cardiovascular, neurological, and/or metabolic illnesses will be
             excluded from participating as well as individuals with a history of various diseases
             of the microvasculature including Reynaud's disease, cold-induced urticaria,
             cryoglobulinemia, etc.

          -  Subjects currently taking any prescription medications and individuals with a body
             mass index about 30 kg/m2) will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant subjects and children (i.e. younger than 18) will not be recruited for the
             study. Eligible females will be scheduled for days 2-7 of their menstrual cycle to
             account for hormonal effects on blood flow. A regular menstrual cycle is required to
             identify and schedule the study for the low hormone period, therefore females who lack
             a regular cycle will be excluded from the study. Females currently taking birth
             control are eligible, as long as they can be scheduled during a low-hormone &quot;placebo&quot;
             week. If their hormone do not contain a placebo week than these individuals will not
             be eligible for data collection. Females who are breast-feeding will also be eligible
             as there are no systemic or lasting effects of the proposed vasoactive agents.

          -  Given that smoking can affect the peripheral vasculature, current smokers and
             individuals who regularly smoked (&gt;1 pack per two weeks) within the prior 2 years will
             be excluded
