  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal Evoked potentials (mmEP) reflect disease course of multiple sclerosis (MS) and are
      potentially suited as a biomarker for disease progression.

      The acquisition of evoked potentials (EP) in this observatory trial is to evaluate the
      feasibility and test-retest reliability of motor and somato-sensory EP (MEP and SSEP) in an
      international multicenter setting in healthy subjects and subjects with multiple sclerosis
      (MS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal EP (mmEP) is being developed as a predictive biomarker to determine the clinical
      response to therapy. MEP and SSEP contributes significantly to the predictive value of mmEP.
      The variability of MEP and SSEP has limited its use in multicenter clinical trials. Recent
      technological advances and standardization of procedures has decreased the variability. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of MEP and SSEP and feasibility of
      performing MEP and SSEP in an international, multicenter setting. Establishment of the
      reliability and feasibility of MEP and SSEP will allow for further development of this
      predictive biomarker in future clinical trials.

    <description>The primary analysis will be a descriptive statistical summary of MEP and SSEP results at the first session, the second session and overall. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) will be calculated to assess the test-retest reliability between consecutive measurements and the interrater reliability between raters.</description>

        Patients with MS will be recruited from the outpatient clinic at the University Hospital
        Basel as consecutive ongoing recruitment through project leader and Co-workers in daily
        clinical practice.

        Healthy subjects will be recruited by bulletin on notice-boards in the hospital

        Inclusion Criteria (Healthy controls):

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (PHI) in
             accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations.

          -  Have no significant health issues, ie neuropathy or other demyelinating disorder that
             can affect testing.

        Inclusion Criteria (Patients with MS):

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (PHI) in
             accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations

          -  Diagnosis of MS (all types) with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 0.0 to 6.5

          -  Have measurable responses on both MEP and SSEP in at least one upper and one lower
             limb on visit 2. The MEP and SSEP responses do not need to be in the same limb

          -  Have no comorbid condition (ie neuropathy) that could affect testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to comply with study requirements

          -  Unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment

          -  Any diseases (e.g., non-MS demyelinating diseases), with the exception of diagnosis MS
             for the MS Cohort, that in the opinion of the Investigator, could influence evoked
             potential results (including but not limited to medullary trauma, morbid obesity, limb
             amputation, diabetes, other polyneuropathy)

          -  Conditions interfering with magnetic stimulation (including but not limited to
             epilepsy, movable metal implants in the body such as pacemakers or stents)

          -  MS relapse within 3 months of either sessions

          -  Initiation of treatment or dose adjustment within 1 month of either sessions with
