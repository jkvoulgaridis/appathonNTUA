  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries&quot; (MINOCA) occurs in 5-10% of all
      patients with AMI. There are neither any randomized clinical trials in MINOCA patients
      evaluating effects of secondary preventive treatments proven beneficial in patients with
      classic AMI, nor any treatment guidelines.

      The primary objective of this multi-national, multi-center pragmatic randomized clinical
      trial is to determine whether oral beta-blockade compared to no oral beta-blockade, and
      whether Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI/ Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB)
      compared to no ACEI/ARB, reduce the composite endpoint of death of any cause and readmission
      because of AMI, ischemic stroke or heart failure in patients discharged with myocardial
      infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) and with no clinical signs
      of heart failure and with left ventricular (LV) systolic ejection fraction ≥40%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large-scale use of acute coronary angiography has revealed a large portion of AMI without
      angiographically obstructive (defined as ≥50% diameter stenosis) coronary artery disease
      (CAD). The term &quot;myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries&quot; (MINOCA) has
      been coined for this entity. MINOCA occurs in 5-10% of all patients with AMI and these
      patients are younger and more often females compared to patients with AMI and obstructive
      CAD. The 1-year mortality after MINOCA was found to be 3.5% in the systematic review by
      Pasupathy et al.. There are no randomized clinical trials in MINOCA patients evaluating
      effects of secondary preventive treatments proven beneficial in patients with classic AMI.
      However, in an observational study with propensity score matched comparisons the risk of
      experiencing a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) was 18% lower in patients treated with
      ACEI/ARB compared to no ACEI/ARB; in patients on beta blockers compared to patients not using
      beta blockers there was a non-significant 14% reduction in MACE.

      The primary objective of this multi-national, multi-center pragmatic randomized clinical
      trial is to determine whether oral beta-blockade compared to no oral beta-blockade, and
      whether ACEI/ARB compared to no ACEI/ARB, reduce the composite endpoint of death of any cause
      and readmission because of AMI, ischemic stroke or heart failure in patients discharged with
      myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) and with no
      clinical signs of heart failure and with LV systolic ejection fraction ≥40%.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Time to death of any cause or readmission because of myocardial infarction,
      ischemic stroke or heart failure.

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:

      Time to:

        -  All-cause mortality

        -  Cardiovascular mortality

        -  Readmission because of AMI

        -  Readmission because of ischemic stroke

        -  Readmission because of heart failure

        -  Readmission because of unstable angina pectoris

        -  Readmission because of atrial fibrillation.

      Safety:

      Time to readmission because of:

        -  AV-block II-III, hypotension, syncope or need for pacemaker

        -  Acute kidney injury

        -  Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation

    <ipd_description>We will make a limited, de-identified set of data available for researchers outside the primary investigators two years after the publication of the primary results of the study. Before data are shared, a data-sharing agreement should be established documenting what data are being shared and how the data can be used. The agreement serves two purposes. First, it protects the agency providing the data, ensuring that the data will not be misused. Second, it prevents miscommunication on the part of the provider of the data and the agency receiving the data by making certain that any questions about data use are discussed. The following items should be covered in the data-sharing agreement:
Period of agreement
Intended use of the data
Constraints on use of the data
Data confidentiality
Data security
