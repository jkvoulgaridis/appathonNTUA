  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent condition that results in substantial pain and
      loss of function. The end stage treatment for knee OA is total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a
      common and safe procedure typically performed for relief of symptoms. However, an increasing
      number of patients are complaining about their TKA due to altered sensations between their
      previous joint and the implant. Although several designs have been proposed to improve these
      outcomes, the knee kinematics after TKA remains different from physiological kinematics. The
      Medial Pivot TKA design was introduced to closely mimic normal knee kinematics and create the
      natural feeling of the knee. This study is intended to evaluate the clinical effectiveness
      and ability to restore knee motion of two TKA devices: the Medial Pivot Persona TKA Zimmer
      design with the traditional Zimmer Persona Knee-PS. The investigator's hypothesis is that the
      Medial Pivot design will results in better patient outcomes and restore knee motion at
      natural parameters.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized control study comparing the TKA Zimmer
      Medial Pivot Persona design to the traditional Zimmer Persona Knee-PS. Eighty patients
      requiring a TKA will be recruited and randomized to one of the two treatment arms following
      confirmation of eligibility criteria. Forty age and sex matched healthy participants with no
      knee OA will also be recruited to provide a comparator measure of &quot;normal&quot; joint motion.

      Clinical follow-up visits and radiographic assessments will be performed pre- and
      post-operative at 6-weeks, 1-year, 2-years. Knee kinematics and self-assessment will be
      completed at the following intervals: pre-operative as baseline assessments for knee motion,
      1-year, 2-years. Measures will include joint mechanics and neuromuscular activation during
      walking and stair stepping measured with motion capture and electromyography, and
      clinical/self assessment including pain in response to physical activity. Any other adverse
      events and complications (i.e, implant failure, re-operation, infection) will be record
      throughout the study.

      Healthy participants will only be assessed once to provide normative data.

    <masking_description>The Participants and the researchers at the Constance Lethbridge Rehabilitation Centre responsible for collecting the kinematic and gait data (motion capture, questionnaires, performance measures) will be blinded.
For analysis purposes the Participants will be dummy coded (0 = one group, 1 = the other group). The blinded parties will know the dummy code but they will not know which group is assigned to each code.</masking_description>

    <measure>Knee mechanics</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative (as baseline) and at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>nee motion will be assessed using 3-dimensional optical motion capture sampled at 100 Hz, floor and step mounted force plates sampled at 2000 Hz, and wireless 16-channel electromyography (EMG) system sampled at 2000 Hz.
Knee motion trials will require participants to ambulate at self-selected speeds over 8 meters followed by complete step up/down trials on a 20 cm step. For step up, the surgical limb will be placed on the step to start while for step down, both limbs will start on the step. The order of step up and down trials will be randomized. Participants will perform 2 practice trials followed by testing. Testing will proceed until 5 successful trials of each activity are collected. They will be allowed 30 seconds of rest between trials.
The primary motion capture variables will include principal component scores that capture changes in range of motion for knee rotation and flexion angles for each activity.</description>

    <measure>Muscle activation</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative (as baseline) and at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle activation will be measured by surface electrodes placed bilaterally over the following muscles: vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris, lateral (biceps femoris) and medial (semitendinosus) hamstrings, and lateral and medial gastrocnemius. The isometric exercises will include: 1) knee extension in sitting with the knee in 45 degrees of flexion; 2) knee flexion in sitting with the knee at 55 degrees of flexion; 3) ankle plantarflexion in long sitting with the ankle in neutral; and 4) standing unilateral heel rise. Participants will perform 1 practice and 2 collection trials for each exercise. They will be allowed 30 seconds of rest between trials.</description>

    <measure>Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score (KOOS) Self-Evaluation Questionnaire for Implant Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative (as baseline) and at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the &quot;Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score (KOOS)&quot; questionnaire. The KOOS's five patient-relevant dimensions are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used, and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopedic scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L Self-Evaluation Questionnaire for Implant Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative (as baseline) and at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the &quot;EQ-5D-5L&quot; questionnaire, a measure of health-related quality of life that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GRC) Self-Evaluation Questionnaire for Implant Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative (as baseline) and at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the GRC questionnaire to rate the improvement or deterioration over time compared to the pre-operative visit. The GRC is a 15-point scale (-7=Worse, +7=Better) to assess the participant current health status, recall that status at a previous time-point, and then calculate the difference between the two. The magnitude of this difference will be scored on a numerical or visual analogue scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity to Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity to Physical Activity will quantify the pain response to standardized physical activity. Participants will be required to rate their pain before and after each Physical Function Performance Tests using a 0 (no pain) to 100 (most pain imaginable) numeric rating scale. To determine the SPA for each test, the pain before the test will be subtracted from the pain after the test.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contractions (MVIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative (as baseline) and at 1 and 2 years following TKA</time_frame>
    <description>Following gait trials, participants will complete a series of four maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) as follows: 1) knee extension in sitting with the knee in 45o of flexion; 2) knee flexion in sitting with the knee at 55o of flexion; 3) ankle plantarflexion in long sitting with the ankle in neutral; and 4) standing unilateral heel rise. MVIC exercises 1-3 will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Participants will perform 1 practice and 2 collection trials for each exercise.
