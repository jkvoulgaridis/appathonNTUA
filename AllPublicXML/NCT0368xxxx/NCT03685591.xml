      A Phase 1 dose escalation study evaluating safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      PF-06952229 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multi center, multiple dose, dose escalation and expansion,
      safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics study of PF 06952229 in previously treated
      patients with advanced or metastatic cancer that is known to have high TGFbeta signatures and
      EMT expression.

      This trial includes 2 parts. Part 1 is a a monotherapy dose escalation phase and Part 2 arms
      A and B is the dose escalation expansion phase. Part 2 Arm A combines PF-06952229 with
      palbociclib and letrozole in HR+HER advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Part 2 Arm B
      combines PF-06952229 with enzalutamide in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
