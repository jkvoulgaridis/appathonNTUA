    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the excretion balance and systemic exposure of radioactivity after oral
           administration of [14C]-sodium valproate (VPA) .

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of sodium VPA and metabolite(s) and its contribution
           to the overall exposure of radioactivity.

        -  To collect samples in order to determine the metabolic pathways of sodium VPA and
           identify the chemical structures and main excretion route of the main metabolites.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the clinical and biological tolerability of oral solution of sodium VPA.
