      This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation/dose-expansion study to
      evaluate the tolerability, safety, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib when
      given with fixed dose nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin
      lymphoma (cHL).
