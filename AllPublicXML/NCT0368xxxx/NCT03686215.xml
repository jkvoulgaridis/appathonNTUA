  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, two-arm randomized, blinded pivotal study to demonstrate the safety
      and efficacy of the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 imaging agent in conjunction with the LUM
      Imaging Device and decision software), in identifying residual cancer in the lumpectomy bed
      of female breast cancer patients undergoing breast surgery in order to assist surgeons in
      reducing the rates of positive margins.

      All enrolled subjects will be injected with LUM015 prior to surgery. Surgeons are blinded to
      whether a participant will be randomized into the device arm until after the standard of care
      lumpectomy is complete. Participants will then be randomized to receiving the device.
      Therapeutic (Lumicell guided) shaves will be removed based on the guidance of the LUM Imaging
      System. Patients will be followed until their first standard of care post-operative follow-up
      visit.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will be injected with LUM015. The injection of the study drug will occur 2-6
      hours prior to surgery at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Surgeons will complete the standard of care
      lumpectomy. Prior to removing any shaves as part of the standard of care, the surgeon will
      use the Lum System to scan and image the cavity where shaves will be obtained. The system
      will not provide guidance. The intent of the standard of care lumpectomy procedure is to
      achieve negative margins.

      Randomization of whether the patient will receive the device will be revealed after the
      completion of the standard of care lumpectomy. If the patient is randomized to the non-device
      arm, than the surgeon will complete the surgery per their standard practice. If the patient
      is randomized to the device arm, the surgeon will use the Lumicell device to scan inside the
      lumpectomy cavity to indicate areas that may contain residual tumor. If the imaging system
      identifies that there may be cancer cells remaining in the lumpectomy cavity, the surgeon
      will remove an additional piece of tissue. This process will be continued until a negative
      reading from the device is obtained or a maximum of 2 shaves of additional tissue has been
      removed in each orientation.

      Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will continue their
      enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will continue to be
      followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is required.
      Patients who have consented to completing Quality of Life Questionnaires will be in the study
      until the schedule of questionnaires is complete. Patients with adverse events that are
      determined to be possibly related to the LUM Imaging System will be followed until resolution
      or stabilization of the adverse event.
