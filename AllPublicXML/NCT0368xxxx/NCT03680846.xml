  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to document the safety, clinical effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of high-frequency SCS at 10 kHz (HF10â„¢ Therapy) delivered through the
      Senza system in subjects with chronic refractory back pain (with or without leg pain) who are
      not considered candidates for spine surgery. This study is a multi-center, prospective,
      randomized study to compare the two treatment groups.

    <description>It measures the subject's health state as assessed in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each with 5 levels. In addition there is an EQ VAS which records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single number summary called the &quot;index value&quot;.</description>
