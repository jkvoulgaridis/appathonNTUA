  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess whether intake of baked and then chilled potatoes
      over a 24-h period, compared to intake of isocaloric, carbohydrate (CHO)-matched foods low in
      fiber and resistant starch (RS), will increase insulin sensitivity, breath hydrogen and
      satiety, and decrease hunger and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in overweight or obese men and
      women at risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus.

      This randomized, two-period crossover study will include one screening/baseline visit (visit
      1) and two 24-h treatment periods (treatment period 1: visits 2 and 3 and treatment period 2:
      visits 4 and 5). A minimum 7-d washout will occur between the treatment periods.
