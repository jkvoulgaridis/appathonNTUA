    <description>Mean percent change from baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA) affected with chronic allergic contact dermatitis is assessed at Days 8, 15, 22, and 29. The overall BSA affected by allergic contact dermatitis will be evaluated (from 0% to 100%) at the specified visits before the study product application. One subject's palm with the palmar aspect of all fingers represents 1% of his or her total BSA.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 8, 15, 22 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Mean percent change from baseline in pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is measured at Days 8, 15, 22 and 29. This will be evaluated by asking subjects to assign a numerical score representing the mean intensity over the last 24 hours of their symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 10 indicating the worst imaginable symptoms.</description>

    <description>Mean percent change from baseline in modified Total Lesion Symptom Score (mTLSS) is measured at Days 8, 15, 22, and 29. The mTLSS is an assessment of the severity of each of 7 allergic contact dermatitis symptoms: erythema, scaling, lichenification/hyperkeratosis, vesiculation, edema, fissures, and puritus/pain. Each of these are rated using the 4-point severity scale. These ratings are then added to create a total score ranging from 0 (none) to 21 points (most severe).</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is measured at Days 8, 15, 22, and 29. The DLQI will be assessed through a 10-question validated questionnaire that assesses the impact of ACD on the patient's life over the previous week covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range form 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All subjects:

          1. Men and women between 18 and 70 years old, inclusive, at the time of consent.

          2. For women of childbearing potential involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead
             to pregnancy: the subject must agree to use an effective contraceptive method from at
             least 4 weeks before Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product
             application. Effective contraceptive methods include hormonal contraceptives (combined
             oral contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, injectable, or implant), intrauterine devices
             or intrauterine systems, vasectomized partner(s), tubal ligation, or a barrier method
             of contraception (male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive
             sponge) in conjunction with spermicide.

             Note: Subjects must have been on a stable dose of hormonal contraceptives for at least
             4 weeks before Day 1.

             Note: The above list of contraceptive methods does not apply to subjects who are
             abstinent for at least 4 weeks before Day 1 and will continue to be abstinent from
             penile-vaginal intercourse throughout the study. The reliability of sexual abstinence
             needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.

             Note: A woman of nonchildbearing potential is as follows:

               1. Woman who has had surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
                  or bilateral salpingectomy);

               2. Woman who has had a cessation of menses for at least 12 months without an
                  alternative medical cause, and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test
                  confirming nonchildbearing potential (refer to laboratory reference ranges for
                  confirmatory levels).

          3. For men involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy, subject must
             agree to use one of the effective contraceptive methods listed in Inclusion Criterion
             #8 from Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product application. If the
             female partner of a male subject use any of the hormonal contraceptives methods listed
             above, this contraceptive method must be used by the female partner from at least 4
             weeks before Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product application.

          4. Female of childbearing potential has had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and negative urine pregnancy test at Day 1.

          5. Subject is willing to participate and is capable of giving informed consent. Note:
             Consent must be obtained prior to any study-related procedures

          6. Subjects must be willing to comply with all study procedures and must be available for
             the duration of the study.

             HV only:

          7. Subject is in good general health, according to the investigator's judgment based on
             medical history and physical examination/laboratory/ECG/vital signs assessments.

             Subjects with allergic contact dermatitis only:

          8. Subject has at least 3-month history of allergic contact dermatitis (information
             obtained from medical chart or subject's physician, or directly from the subject).

          9. Subject has moderate to severe chronic allergic contact dermatitis, according to the
             PVA score (≥10) at Day 1.

         10. Subject has allergic contact dermatitis covering between 0.5% to 10% of the total BSA
             at Day 1.

         11. Subject has an ISGA ≥ 3 at Day 1.

         12. Subject agree to attempt to avoid the causative allergen(s) within 2 weeks prior to
             Day 1. This run-in period is not required for subjects who had already avoided the
             causative allergen(s) in the past for at least 2 weeks and their condition remained
             moderate to severe (information obtained directly from the subject).

         13. Subject has &quot;+&quot;, &quot;++&quot; or &quot;+++&quot; reaction to patch testing after application for 2 days
             for an allergen that is suspected to be involved in the current allergic contact
             dermatitis. The measure of the degree of the reaction will be determined on the basis
             of the reading 2 and 4 days post application. A positive patch test reaction at one of
             these visits must be determined to be clinically relevant by the Investigator based
             upon the subject's history and clinical skin examination. Alternatively, the subject
             has had a positive patch test to an allergen that is suspected to be involved in the
             current allergic contact dermatitis in the past 5 years (in this case, written
             documentation of patch test result is needed).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects will not be eligible for participation in the study if they meet any of the
        following criteria at the screening and Day 1 visits, unless specified otherwise:
