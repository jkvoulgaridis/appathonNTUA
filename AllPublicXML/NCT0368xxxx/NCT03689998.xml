  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of periapical pathology, the absence of kera¬tinized tissue and lack of complete
      soft tissue closure over the extraction socket have been reported a drawbacks of immediate
      implant placement .

      As mentioned before the presence of periapical pathology is one of the limitation of
      immediate implant placement, melatonin has an action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
      microorganisms with a higher efficacy on the latter; it also showed efficacy against
      different strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

      Melatonin was found to be effective in several cases as an anxiolytic and analgesic agent. It
      also reduce inflammatory pain by blocking the production of nitric oxid Also the lack of
      complete soft tissue closure over the extraction socket is one of the drawbacks of immediate
      implant placement; melatonin induces the production of interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-α and transforming growth factor (TGF). In addition, melatonin is an immunomodulator
      and a neuroendocrine hormone, and stimulates both monocyte cytokine and fibroblast
      proliferation, which influence angiogenesis and wound healing..

      As the initial implant stability is one of the criteria of implant success, Melatonin was
      found to increase new cortical bone width and length during the early stages (15 and 30
      days), and it also promoted early cell differentiation. Melatonin acted on the bone as a
      local growth factor .

      Melatonin is chemically recognized as N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine. It is a compound
      occurring naturally in plants, microbes and animals. The circulating level of the melatonin
      hormone in animals shows interesting variations, by entertainment of variable biological
      functions in a daily cycle &quot;circadian rhythm&quot;. Melatonin called hormone of night is secreted
      by the pineal gland, and its plasma levels concentration are 50 folds higher in night in
      comparison to daytime. A variety of peripheral cells play a role in production of melatonin
      such as epithelial cells, bone marrow cells, and lymphocytes. Though melatonin is a hormone,
      it does not act on a specific organ, it has several functions; stimulation of the synthesis
      of type I collagen fibers, regulation of the body temperature, sexual development,
      antioxidant scavenging and detoxifying free radicals thus inhibiting the process of bone
      resorption through interfering with the function of osteoclasts.
