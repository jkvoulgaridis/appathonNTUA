  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a highly debilitating disease that affects 202 million
      people around the world and about 7 million people in France. Morbi-mortality from
      cardiovascular events is increased in this population. Intermittent claudication is defined
      as a discomfort and/or pain in the legs during walking. It is the most common clinical
      feature of PAD.

      In claudication, primary therapeutic approach is medical treatment and advice to walk.
      Revascularisation is only proposed when medical treatment and advice to walk for at least 3
      to 6 months have failed to improve symptoms and walking ability.

      Optimal medical treatment includes Antiplatelet, Lipid Lowering Drugs, AT2 antagonists / ACE
      Inhibitors and advice to walk.

      To date, no other drug has provided consistent evidence for functional improvement in
      claudication, except for Cilostazol, a type-3 phospho-diesterase inhibitor (PDEi). This
      compound has been scarcely used in France due to cost and frequent side effect (Headache,
      Flush, Diarrhoea, etc.) and was withdrawn as a therapy in 2010.

      Sildenafil, a type 5 PDEi, is well tolerated, largely used in impotence and has interesting
      clinical delay and duration of action in the concept of a potential use in claudication.
      Preliminary data from the literature and unpublished case reports, suggest that this drug
      could efficiently improve symptoms and walking capacity in patients with stage 2
      claudication.

      Experimental design A National, Multicentre, Prospective, Randomised, Double Blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial with two parallel groups.

      Eligible patients will be randomised in two groups:

        -  Experimental group Sildenafil 100 mg/day (single morning oral dose of 100 mg) + advice
           to walk for a total duration of 6 months.

        -  Control group Placebo (single morning oral dose) + advice to walk for a total duration
           of 6 months.

      Treatment will be proposed in addition to optimal treatment (Antiplatelet + Lipid Lowering
      Drugs + AT2 antagonists / ACE Inhibitors; unless contra-indicated) + advice to walk . The
      experimental drug will be delivered for a 1 month treatment period. Phone/mail contact will
      be carried out at 7 and 14 days focusing on tolerance, compliance and eventual side effects.
      First follow up visit at month one will focus on tolerance, compliance and side effects and
      walking capacity . If no major side effect is found, the study drug will be delivered for an
      additional 2 months. Phone/mail contact will be carried out at 2 months focusing on
      tolerance, compliance and eventual side effects. Patients will be evaluated at month 3
      (second follow-up visit) for persistent or non-persistent indication for revascularisation
      and considered for revascularisation if needed. In parallel, attention will be given to
      tolerance, compliance and eventual side effects. If no major side effect is found, the study
      drug will be delivered for an additional 3 months period. Phone/mail contact will be carried
      out at 4 months and 5 months focusing on tolerance, compliance and eventual side effects
      Third and fourth follow-up visits are scheduled at month 6 (end of treatment) and month 12 (6
      months after the end of experimental drugs).

      Perspectives

        -  Improving quality of life of patients suffering a chronic debilitating disease is a
           major issue not only in vascular medicine.

        -  It is expected that the treatment may help patients change from a vicious circle (Pain &gt;
           inactivity &gt; disease progression &gt; pain &gt; increased morbi-mortality) to a virtuous
           circle (no Pain &gt; improved ability for activity &gt; collateral vessel development &gt;
           slowing of disease progression &gt; decreased morbi-mortality )

        -  We expect that half of the patients that fulfil inclusion criteria will be sufficiently
           improved not to require surgery anymore even 3 months after the end of the drug as a
           result of this virtuous circle.

    <masking_description>The preparation of the 'blinded' treatments will be undertaken by the PPRIGO hospital pharmacist's consortium (Production Pharmaceutique pour la Recherche Institutionnelle du Grand Ouest) under recommended standardised conditions. PPRIGO will provide numbered and labelled bottles each containing 33 capsules of the study drug (sildenafil or placebo) according to the randomisation order). All bottles will be identically labelled, with the study number being the only differentiating feature between different drug packs.
The un-blinding will be centralised with eCRF software in agreement with the principal investigator.</masking_description>
