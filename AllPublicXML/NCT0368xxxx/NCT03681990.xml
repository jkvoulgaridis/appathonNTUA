    <description>The primary measure of efficacy is measured as greater than or equal to a 2 Log10/cm2 reduction of skin flora in each of the 3 sampling sites, relative to pre-treatment (baseline) log10/cm2, at defined post-treatment sampling time.</description>

          -  Subjects must be in good general health,

          -  Subjects who satisfy all inclusion/exclusion criteria and will voluntarily read and
             sign the Informed Consent Form,

          -  Subjects who have good skin condition on the test sites,

          -  Subjects who are willing to report to the study facility approximately 72 hours prior
             to Screening or Treatment Day for clipping, if needed,

          -  Subjects who are willing to avoid showering and tub-bathing within 72 hours prior to
             Screening and Treatment Days, and

          -  Subjects who have Screening Day baseline counts of &gt; 3.00 log10 per cm2 in each of the
             3 sample sites (center, mid-peripheral and peripheral) in the treatment area (back
             region).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another clinical study in the past 30 days, current participation in
             another clinical study, or previous participation in this study,

          -  Any tattoos, scars, breaks in the skin, or any form of dermatitis, or other skin
             disorders (including acne) on the applicable test areas,

             disease, or any immunocompromised conditions, such as AIDS (or HIV positive),

          -  Any medical condition or use of any medications that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, should preclude participation,

          -  Topical antimicrobial exposure within 14 days prior to Screening Day and throughout
             the study. Restrictions include, but are not limited to antimicrobial soaps, medicated
             shampoos, medicated lotions, antiperspirants/deodorants, perfumes, after shaves, and
             colognes,

          -  Use of systemic or topical antibiotic medications, steroid medications, or any other
             product known to affect the normal microbial flora of the skin within 14 days prior to
             Screening Day and throughout the study,

          -  Exposure of the test areas to solvents, acids, bases, strong detergents, fabric
             softener-treated clothing, or other household chemicals within 14 days prior to

             or

          -  Subject has used moisturizers or any topical treatment (e.g. lotion, sunscreen or
             shaving cream) on the test sites in the 24-hour period prior to Screening Day and
