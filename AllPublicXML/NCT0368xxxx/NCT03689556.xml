  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim, in this study, to examine whether reduction of FLT PET derived SUV before and after
      carbon ion radiotherapy can predict the treatment response and survivals for patients with
      locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial evaluating the prognostic value of FLT PET/CT
      for patients with locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. All patients will
      receive FLT PET/CT scans before and after carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). The sensitivity and
      specificity of reduction of FLT uptake reduction in terms of predicting the treatment outcome
      evaluated by MRI at 3 months after completion of CIRT according to RECIST 1.1. Its predictive
      value of OS, LPFS, RPFS and DMFS will be examined as well.
