  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrophic ridge augmentation utilizing guided bone regeneration (GBR) has become a major
      treatment option to provide optimal bone support for osseointegrated dental implants. GBR was
      initially employed to treat simple defects, including dehiscence and fenestration defects. In
      addition, GBR has been utilized for horizontal and vertical ridge augmentations and has
      demonstrated reproducible outcomes, with high implant survival rates and low complication
      rates. The results of recent clinical and histologic studies of ridge augmentation with GBR
      indicated that autogenous bone graft may be a suitable material for staged localized ridge
      augmentation in both horizontal and vertical augmentations. The main advantages of autogenous
      grafts are their osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive capabilities. Because of
      these qualities, autogenous grafts are considered by many to be the gold standard for bone
      regeneration

      The GBR Procedure requires to place a barrier between the bone graft and the surrounding soft
      tissues. This blocks the fast-duplicating connective and epithelial cells from colonizing the
      regenerating site.

      Collagen membranes have been successfully used as a barrier membrane in clinical practice.

      They have the advantage of being resorbable and pose less post-operative complications. On
      the other hand, collagen membranes are not rigid, causing a difficulty in maintaining the
      vertical height of the particulate bone graft placed onto the ridge.

      Alternatively, titanium meshes have been used with success in clinical practice and display
      both advantages and disadvantages. They provide tenting effect thanks to their rigidity and,
      being moldable, can be easily given the shape needed to cover the defect.

      However they must be removed, not resorbable, require time-consuming shaping and pose
      complications as flap dehiscence.

      Choice of the comparator:

      Current studies have shown that using titanium mesh as a barrier to protect the bone graft
      during GBR can be considered successful in terms of vertical bone gain.

      There might be variable in other findings which could be attributed to differences in the
      methodology, such as using other membranes over the titanium mesh (collagen or PTFE
      membranes).

    <description>Autogenous Onlay ring block harvested from either mandibular ramus or chin will be placed over the defected site and fixed using titanium screws (1.6mm diameter) and then GBR using autogenous particulate will be placed around and over the blocks and covered with a resorbable bilayer collagen membrane (Bio-GideÂ®, Geistlich, USA)
Autogenous bone graft will be placed on the defected site and covered by a titanium mesh which will be fixed by titanium screws.
Flap advancement will be acquired by releasing the mylohyoid muscle attachment from the lingual flap and periosteal releasing incision for the buccal flap to provide tension free closure.
The flap will then be copiously irrigated with saline in preparation for closure.
The flap will then be closed using horizontal mattress and interrupted 4/0 polypropylene sutures.</description>
