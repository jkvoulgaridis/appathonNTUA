  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent meta-analysis involving 3753 patients treated with corticosteroids notes that the
      population with the highest prevalence of biological IS (68%) is onco-hematology. However, it
      is also the least studied population with no recent and significant prevalence study. A
      recent multicenter study including patients followed up oncology who received dexamethasone
      for antiemetic purposes at cumulative doses well below the doses used in Hematology,
      objective a prevalence of biological IS estimated at 16% at 3 months from the start of
      chemotherapy. The introduction of a substitution had led to an objective improvement in the
      quality of life estimated by EORTC QLQ-C30.

      Expected results are prevalence rate of biological adrenal insufficiency between 15 and 20%
      with improvement of the quality of life in the 2 months post-chemotherapy by Hydrocortisone
      supplementation
