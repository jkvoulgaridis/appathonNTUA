  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability of an individual to move smoothly depends on his flexibility, an attribute that
      enhances both safety and optimal physical activity. Hamstring tightness leads to hamstring
      injuries and hamstring injuries are the most common type of injury among athletes. These
      injuries are slow to recover, make high health expenditure and decrease the performance level
      of the athlete.

      The hamstring is an example of the muscle group that has a tendency to get shorten Muscle
      tightness is caused by a decrease in the ability of the muscle to deform, resulting in a
      decrease in the range of motion at the joint on which it acts. Inability to achieve greater
      than 120° of knee extension with the hip at 90° of flexion is considered as hamstring
      tightness.

      it will be a Randomized Controlled Trial with 3 group. there will be 60 patients with
      hamstring tightness divided into 3 group. Allocating by using the manual lottery system.
      Non-probability Convenience Sampling technique will be utilized. the self-structured
      questionnaire will be used to analyse the athletic condition and performance.

      Each patient in group A will be given with hot pack along with Tens for 20 mins then the
      patient will receive post facilitation stretch only, for about one months on daily basis.

      Each patient in group B will receive hot pack along with Tens for 20 mins then the patients
      will receive post isometric relaxation alone for about one months on daily basis.

      Each patient in group C will receive hot pack along with Tens for 20 mins then the patients
      will receive frictional massage alone for about one months on daily basis. Friction massage
      on hamstrings will be given for 20 mins by thrive massager by a therapist.

    <description>The Post Facilitating Stretch technique is performed as follows:
The hamstring muscle will be placed between a fully stretched and a fully relaxed state. The patient will be asked to contract the agonist using a maximum degree of effort for 5-10 seconds while the therapist resists the patients force. The patient will then be asked to relax and release the effort, whereas the therapist will apply the rapid stretch to a new barrier and will be held for 10 seconds. Then the patient will relaxes for approximately 20 seconds and the procedure will be repeated between three to five times and five times more. Instead of starting from a new barrier, the muscle will be placed between a fully stretched and a fully relaxed state before every repetition.</description>

    <description>The Post Isometric Relaxation technique is performed as follows :
The hamstring muscle will be taken to a length just short of pain, or to the point where resistance to movement is first noted. A submaximal (10-20%) contraction of the hypertonic muscle will be performed away from the barrier for between 5 and 10 seconds and the therapist applies resistance in the opposite direction. The patient should inhale during this effort. After the isometric contraction the patient will be asked to relax and exhale while doing so. Following this a gentle stretch will be applied to take up the slack till the new barrier. Starting from this new barrier, the procedure is repeated two or three times.</description>
