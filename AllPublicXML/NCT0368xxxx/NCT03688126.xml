  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if lifestyle changes can protect memory and
      thinking (cognition) as we age. A recent study in Finland found that a combination of
      physical and cognitive exercise, diet, and social activity protected cognitive function in
      healthy older adults who were at increased risk of significant memory loss. So far no
      medications can rival this positive outcome. The point of POINTER is to test if lifestyle
      change can also protect against memory loss in Americans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle interventions focused on combining healthy diet, physical activity, and social and
      intellectual challenges may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to protect brain
      health. The recent results of the population-based 2-year clinical trial, Finnish Geriatric
      Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), indicated that a
      multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional guidance, cognitive training,
      social activities, and management of heart health risk factors protected cognitive function
      in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. As yet, there are no
      pharmacological treatment options that can rival this effect. Thus, there is an urgent need
      to expand this work to test the generalizability, adaptability and sustainability of its
      findings in diverse and global populations. This pivotal U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health
      through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) will test whether a similar
      2-year intensive lifestyle intervention, adapted to American culture and delivered within the
      community, can protect cognitive function in older adults in the U.S. who are at increased
      risk for cognitive decline and dementia. If successful, the results of this study will have
      large-scale implications for public policy regarding standard of clinical care and
      prescriptive practices for a fast-growing and vulnerable population of older adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Global cognitive function will be obtained from a composite score derived from subtest scores on the POINTER modified Neuropsychological Test Battery (PmNTB) that includes: Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Story Recall, Visual Paired Associates, Number Span, Word Fluency, Trail-Making Test, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Scores from each individual test will be converted to z-scores that typically range from -3 to 3, with higher scores reflecting better performance, and averaged to form a composite. The primary outcome is the slope of these composite scores over repeated assessments (standard deviation units per year), with less negative (or positive) slopes reflecting better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Episodic Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a composite score from PmNTB subtests Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Story Recall, Visual Paired Associates; and experimental measures: Cogstate One-Card Learning, Face Name Associative Memory Exam, and Behavioral Pattern Separation of Objects, calculated in a manner parallel to how the primary composite outcome is calculated. This secondary outcome is the slope of these composite scores over time (standard deviation units per year) with less negative (or positive) slopes reflecting better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a composite score from PmNTB subtests Number Span, Word Fluency, Trail-Making Test Part B, Digit Symbol Substitution Test; and experimental measures: Cogstate One Back, and Digital Clock Drawing Test, calculated in a manner parallel to the primary composite outcome is calculated. This secondary outcome is the slope of these composite scores over time (standard deviation units per year) with less negative (or positive) slopes reflecting better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Processing Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a composite score from PmNTB subtests Trail-Making Test Part A and Digit Symbol Substitution Test; and experimental measures: Cogstate Detection and Identification, and Digital Clock Drawing Test calculated in a manner parallel to the primary composite outcome is calculated. This secondary outcome is the slope of these composite scores over time (standard deviation units per year) with less negative (or positive) slopes reflecting better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Dementia Ratingâ€”Sum of Boxes</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a clinical scale that rates the severity of dementia as absent, questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (CDR score of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively) across six domains. Scores from these domains are summed ranging from 0 to 18, with higher scores reflecting worse performance. The secondary outcome will be the change in the mean scores from baseline to 2 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Lawton-Brody IADL is a commonly used scale in clinical practice and research that assess a person's functional ability to complete tasks such as shopping, food preparation, transportation, and managing finances. Scores range from 0 to 8 for women and from 0 to 5 for men, with higher scores reflecting better performance. The secondary outcome will be the change in the mean scores from baseline to 2 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Everyday Cognition (ECog)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The ECog is a validated scale developed to assess everyday functional status. The short form of the instrument will be used in U.S. POINTER. Scores range from 0 to 4 with higher scores reflecting greater poorer function. The secondary outcome will be the change in the mean scores from baseline to 2 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digital Clock Drawing Test (DCTClock)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DCTClock assesses cognition via novel software that processes information from a commercially available digital pen. This software is able to capture nuances in cognitive performance. Many metrics can be generated with this device. The secondary outcome for U.S. POINTER will be time (in seconds) to completion of the clock drawing test, with longer times reflecting poorer processing speed. The secondary outcome will be the change in the mean scores from baseline to 2 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lifestyle Composite</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This composite score is based on self-reported Physical Activity Questionnaire, Rush Food Frequency Questionnaire, and the Cognitive Activity Questionnaire. Participants will be ordered with respect to each index, with higher scores reflecting 1) greater daily physical activity, 2) greater conformance with the MIND Diet, and 3) greater cognitive activity. Based on these orderings, participants will be assigned percentiles with respect to each measure relative to the overall group. These percentiles will range from 0 to 100. The secondary outcome will be the average of the three percentiles. The secondary outcome will be the change in the mean scores from baseline to 2 years.</description>
