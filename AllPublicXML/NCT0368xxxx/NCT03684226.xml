    <textblock>
      Stroke Observatory of Caen-Normandy Metropole provides epidemiological data in prospective
      collection. The primary objective is to determinate incidence of Stroke in this area. Several
      data sources will be crossed to allow an exhaustive identification of the cases. No
      intervention will be carried. The data collected will correspond to those obtained in current
      practice. The number of participants is estimated at 800 per year. This Observatory aims to
      become a qualified population register after three years, according to requirement of the
      french registry evaluation committee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death (the first in women in industrialized countries),
      the second cause of dementia and the third leading cause of disability. For a middle-aged
      person, the risk of developing a stroke is 1/5 in women and 1/6 in men over a lifetime.
      Moreover, stroke is a disease that can be considered chronic. Indeed, in France, the survival
      rate one month after a stroke is 80-90%. However, at least 50% of survivors retain a severe
      disability and almost all require long-term care. The medico-economic impact of stroke is
      therefore important in both the initial and chronic phases. Nevertheless, none of the French
      stroke registries consider the burden of post-stroke disability. In addition, there is
      limited data available on the impact of geographic disparities on the prognosis of stroke.
      Population studies are essential to accurately identify the incidence and burden of stroke,
      thereby supporting public health policy, guiding the allocation of resources, and evaluating
      the effectiveness of preventive strategies for a population. This is why we propose to create
      a Norman Observatory of Stroke. It will include an urban and rural population and will aim to
      become a population register.
