      Prospective cluster-randomized multicenter cross-over trial to prove non-inferiority of PI

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common nosocomial infections in surgical
      patients causing significant increases in morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. As
      they are usually caused by components of the normal skin flora, disinfection of the surgical
      site with an antiseptic skin preparation is standard practice prior to any surgical
      intervention. The most commonly used disinfectants are either chlorhexidine in alcoholic
      solution (CHX) or PVP iodine in alcoholic solution (PI) This prospective cluster-randomized
      multicenter cross-over trial is to prove non-inferiority of PI compared to CHX in
      preoperative skin antisepsis in abdominal and cardiothoracic surgery in regard of SSIs.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will be conducted as an open-label cluster-randomized cross-over multicenter trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1.
The departments of surgery of the 3 study sites will be randomized center-wise in clusters by month to use CHX or PI. The products will be switched over according to the computer-generated randomization list.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Surgical site infections (SSIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>occurrence of surgical site infections is evaluated at three time points: at time of dismissal from the hospital (approx. 1 week after surgical intervention); 30 days after abdominal and cardiac surgery; 1 year for cardiac surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of SSI rates between the two groups using standard chi-square test. Presence of SSIs for abdominal and cardiac surgeries as defined by Swiss society of hospital epidemiologists (Swissnoso) according to National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria. Analysis will be performed using the final SSI rate (30 days for abdominal, 30 days/1 year for cardiac surgery) and according to the different types of infections. Infection ratio will be calculated as crude ratio as well as adapted to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS) score. The method of aggregation for the combined SSI rate for both types of surgery together will be a weighted average based on the proportion of SSIs from each surgery type. The measure includes no scale.</description>

    <time_frame>three time points: at time of dismissal from the hospital (approx. 1 week after surgical intervention); 30 days after abdominal and cardiac surgery; 1 year for cardiac surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Type of SSI: superficial, deep, organ-space; DEFINITIONS OF SSI: For surveillance classification purposes, SSIs are divided into incisional SSIs and organ/space SSIs. Incisional SSIs are further classified into those involving only the skin and subcutaneous tissue (called superficial incisional SSIs) and those involving deep soft tissues of the incision (called deep incisional SSIs (e.g., fascial and muscle layers)). Organ/space SSIs involve any part of the anatomy (e.g., organs or spaces), other than the incision, opened or manipulated during the operative procedure.</description>
