  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large-to-massive rotator cuff tears accounts for 30% of all rotator cuff tears. These
      problems can be solved by surgeries, but only part of them can be completely repaired. The
      prognosis for partial repair is worse than complete repair, so evaluating the possibility of
      complete repair is so important that it will affect the decision of treatment. More and more
      recent researches focused on using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of fatty
      infiltration of rotator cuff muscles to predict the reparability of large-to-massive rotator
      cuff tears. However, the availability of MRI is not that good as ultrasound, so some
      researchers are starting to use ultrasound to predict the reparability of large-to-massive
      rotator cuff tears. Because it is hard to observe the tissue quality through the general
      ultrasound, many researchers use sonoelastography to evaluate the tissue elasticity and
      viability. This aim of this study is to:

        1. check the reliability of sonoelastography.

        2. associate the findings of sonoelastography to the results of MRI.

        3. build a predictive model for the reparability of large-to-massive rotator cuff tears.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This diagnostic test would be executed by a physician who has experiences of using Siemens Acuson S2000 ultrasound system for more than three year. The examination includes two of four rotator cuff muscles, listed as follows, supraspinatus muscle and infraspinatus muscle. Linear transducer (4-9 MHz) would be used for the whole test. The probe would be positioned along the longitudinal axis of the muscle belly.
Compressive sonoelastography technique is used for semiquantitative analysis. In order to maintain the quality of images, quality factor needs to be over or equal to 60. The quantitative analysis was performed by shear wave sonoelastography. While assessing, the region of interest (ROI) would be divided into four quadrants. The physicians will measure the shear wave velocity for wight times at the center point of each quadrant.</description>

    <description>MRI was performed on a 1.5T system (Signa Horizon LX, GE Healthcare) equipped with a standard shoulder surface coil. The shoulder MRI protocol was identical for all patients and consisted of axial proton-density-weighted fast spin-echo with fat suppression sequence, the sequences was performed above the level o f the acromioclavicular joint down to below the axillary pouch with the following parameters: Coronal oblique proton-density-weighted with and without fat suppression, with axis parallel to the supraspinatus tendon, and sagittal oblique proton-density--weighted with and without fat suppression, with axis perpendicular to the coronal oblique axis, the ast spin-echo sequences were performed with the following parameters: TR msec/TE msec, 2700-4800 /25-40, echo-train length, 6; matrix, 256 Ã— 256; field of view, 180 mm; section thickness, 2.5 mm with 2-mm gap. No IV or intraarticular gadolinium was administered.</description>

    <description>The investigator will discuss the surgical outcome with the orthopedist to define whether the tear side is repaired partially or completely. If the tendon can be repaired using simple side-to-side tendon repair, horizontal mattress transosseous repair via the bone trough and reduced into an anatomic position, or via the rough area of greater tuberosity (marginal converging repair), it is defined as complete repair of the tendon. If the tendon cannot be reduced to the anatomic footprint and the orthopedist only secures re-attachment of the infraspinatus to the posterior side of greater tuberosity and/or the subscapularis of lesser tuberosity, it is defined as partial repair of the tendon.</description>
