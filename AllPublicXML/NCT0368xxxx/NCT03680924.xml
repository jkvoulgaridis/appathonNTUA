  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of access to clinical and
      research resources for families of children affected with a phosphatase and tensin homology
      (PTEN) mutation. Ultimately, the researchers hope to be able to use this information to
      develop a standard of care for affected individuals and their family members. Family
      members/legal guardians of an individual with a PTEN mutation enrolled in the Rare Diseases
      Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Contact Registry will be invited via email to participate
      in this study.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate access to clinical care and clinical research for
      patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. This research will entail an anonymous online
      survey sent to families/caretakers of affected children. The survey will inquire: (1) basic
      clinical information about the child, such as diagnoses (both genetic and
      neurodevelopmental), level of functioning (estimated IQ) (2) clinical specialists that the
      child sees or needs to see (3) how families learn about clinical trials/research relevant to
      their child (4) basic demographics about the parent/caretaker completing the survey.

      Specifically, this survey will collect information pertaining to:

        -  Number of affected children in household

        -  PTEN mutation type of affected children

        -  Age and gender of affected children

        -  Age, neurodevelopmental disorders, medical problems, IQ, and access to clinical care
           (specialists currently being seen, specialists not able to see and why) of most affected
           child

        -  Research methods and mediums for disorder-specific treatment options for affected
           children

        -  Reasons behind not participating in clinical research options

        -  Facts (gender, age, if PTEN mutation carrier, work status, relationship to affected
           children, days per week of caregiving responsibilities, education level) about
           participant completing survey.

      In total, the survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete.
