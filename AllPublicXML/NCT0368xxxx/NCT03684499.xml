  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbilirubinemia is a common neonatal problem. bilirubin is potentially toxic to central
      nervous system and can cause serious permanent complication called kernicterus, in which
      brain stem nuclei and basal ganglia are damaged,resulting in cerebral palsy.In
      Hyperbiliubinemia,rapid reduction of serum bilirubin level is of utmost importance.

      Two commonly used mode of therapy are phototherapy and exchange transfusion. Phototherapy has
      some side effects such as diarrhea, skin rash, dehydration, overheating, mother-baby bonding
      disruption.On the other hand, complication of exchange transfusion include infections,
      emboli,anemia,apnea and hypocalcemia.

      while IV fluid supplementationis postulated to decrease bilirubin concentration directly
      through a reduction of haemoconcentration, increasing enteral feed volume is proposed to
      decrease bilirubin concentration through reduced enterohepatic circulation via an increased
      gut peristalsis.

      Bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus Unconjugated bilirubin is lipid soluble and therefore
      can cross the blood brain barrier .There it can deposit in areas of the brain, with a
      predilection for deposition in the basal ganglia, auditory pathways, and oculomotor nucleus.
      This deposition and accompanying damage result in the classical symptoms associated with
      kernicterus. Hypoxia, acidosis, prematurity, and genetic predispositions all increase the
      risk for kernicterus.In well term babies risk for kernicterus increases after bilirubin
      levels cross (20 mg/dL) and it is very high above (30 mg/dL). In preterm babies the threshold
      for damage from bilirubin could be as low as(20mg/dl). The risk increases with increasing
      serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

      Acute bilirubin encephalopathy presents as lethargy, high pitched cry, poor feeding, abnormal
      tone, opisthotonus, upgaze palsy and seizures. Aggressive treatment at this stage can reduce
      the damage caused. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy leads to conditions like choreoathetoid
      cerebral palsy, high frequency hearing loss, dental dysplasias and oculomotor palsies.

    <description>The subjects will be divided into two equal groups Study group and control group by randomization. The study group will be given IV fluid supplementation with 0.5% normal saline in dextrose 5%for period of 24hours . The volume of supplementation included a presumed deficit of 50 ml/kg (equivalent to mild dehydration), half of daily maintenance fluid for 24 hours in accordance to standard norms and extra 20 ml/kg per day as a phototherapy allowance. In addition, they will continue breastfeeding. The control group will be continued on breast feeding , before the randomization procedure. All the infants will get phototherapy by standard method. Phototherapy will be discontinued when the bilirubin level will be &lt;15 mg/dl.</description>
