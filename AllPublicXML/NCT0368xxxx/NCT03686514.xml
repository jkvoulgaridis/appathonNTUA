    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand the impact on the human immune system's response to
      the 4 strain flu vaccine in individuals who have &quot;imprinted&quot; on specific influenza strains.
      It will also consider the effects of repeated prior annual influenza vaccination on the
      immune system.

      The goal of this study is to understand the impact on the human immune system's response to
      the 4 strain flu vaccine in individuals who have &quot;imprinted&quot; on specific influenza strains.
      It will also consider the effects of repeated prior annual influenza vaccination on the
      immune system. This trial may hopefully lead to larger trials that advance understanding of
      flu vaccines and hopefully lead to a more effective flu vaccine that does not rely on annual
      updates, provides broad protection, and is durable; i.e., a universal influenza vaccine.

             vaccines for the duration of subject study participation.

         11. Have received immunoglobulin or other blood products, with the exception of Rho D
             immunoglobulin, within 90 days prior to study vaccination.

         13. Have known hypersensitivity or allergy to eggs, egg protein, chicken protein, or other
             compounds of the study vaccine.
