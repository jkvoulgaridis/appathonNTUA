  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lacerations are a common reason for presentation to the Emergency Department and children
      needing laceration repair with sutures are experiencing pain and anxiety.

      Virtual Reality (VR) is an immersive experience using sight, sound, and position sense. Using
      VR may enhance distraction during the painful procedure and may reduce attention to pain.

      This study will randomize children (6 - 16 years old) to receive Virtual Reality or standard
      of care in addition to pharmacoanalgesia during a laceration repair procedure. Investigators
      will measure pain, anxiety, satisfaction, amount of analgesia and the length of procedure and
      compare between the two groups.

    <measure>Pain using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain is reported by children immediately following completion of the laceration repair</time_frame>
    <description>Level of pain as reported by children using Faces Pain Scale - Revised. The scale includes six faces that represent progressively more intense features of pain. Children point to the face that best represents their current level of pain. The minimum score is 0 (representing least pain) and the maximum score is 10 (representing greater pain). The scale increase in increments of 2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety using the Venham Situational Anxiety Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Anxiety is reported by children immediately following completion of the laceration repair</time_frame>
    <description>Level of Situational Anxiety as reported by children using the Venham Situational Anxiety Score. This scale includes 8 sets of 2 images of children which represent differing levels of anxiety. Children point to the child that best represents them in that instance. In each set of 2 images of children, one represents greater anxiety (scored as 1) and one represents lesser anxiety (scored as 0). The points from each set of images are totaled. The minimum score is 0 (least anxious) and maximum score is 8 (most anxious).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction determined qualitatively by an open ended question</measure>
    <time_frame>Satisfaction question is reported by children immediately following completion of the laceration repair</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction from the procedure is determined qualitatively. Children are asked &quot;What is your opinion on how the procedure went?&quot; Answers will be recorded in writing and be assessed for themes (similar words, positive or negative language).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Satisfaction determined qualitatively by an open ended question</measure>
    <time_frame>Satisfaction question is reported by parents immediately following completion of the laceration repair</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction from the procedure is determined qualitatively. Parents are asked &quot;What is your opinion on how the procedure went?&quot; Answers will be recorded in writing and be assessed for themes (similar words, positive or negative language).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>These will be recorded during the procedure and immediately following the procedure using the patient chart and nursing notes</time_frame>
    <description>How much topical or local anesthetics are used and when they are used (24 hour time); how much sedatives are used and when they are used (24 hour time); how much analgesics are used and when they are used (24 hour time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timing</measure>
    <time_frame>Documented immediately after patient and family given discharge paperwork</time_frame>
    <description>Time in minutes from readiness for procedure (availability of child, staff and equipment) until completion of procedure (physician does not need to touch the patient anymore) and until discharged from the emergency department (given discharge paperwork).</description>
