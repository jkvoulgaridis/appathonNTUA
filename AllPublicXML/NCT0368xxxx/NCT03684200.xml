  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a 6-week intervention, using the
      Copenhagen adductor exercise, on adductor muscle strength in sub-elite male footballers.
      Secondly, it will also examine the effect of a 3-week detraining period, after stopping the
      Copenhagen adductor exercise, on adductor muscle strength.

      The primary outcome measure is eccentric hip adduction strength measured using a handheld
      dynamometer. Additionally, peak isometric adductor squeeze strength will also be measured
      using a handheld dynamometer.

      The hypothesis is that strength training of the adductor muscles elicited by the Copenhagen
      adductor exercise will result in enhanced eccentric hip adduction strength.

    <description>20 players allocated to the Copenhagen adductor exercise group complete a progressive strengthening programme comprising of the Copenhagen adductor exercise over a period of 6 weeks. They will complete two exercise sessions a week consisting of one set of the Copenhagen adductor exercise. The exercise will be performed on each side. The training load will increase from 5 repetitions in week 1, to 15 repetitions in week 6. The exercise programme is performed at the end of the warm-up of a regular football training session.</description>

    <description>The active player is supported on one forearm on the floor and the upper arm is resting along their side. The supporting partner places their hands at the ankle and the knee of the upper leg. The active partner raises their body from the floor and adducts both legs in a three second movement until the body reaches a straight line. The body is then lowered to the ground in a three second movement, the foot of the lower leg touches the ground before performing another repetition.</description>
