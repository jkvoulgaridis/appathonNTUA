  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PB) continues to be the main cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality, with
      emotional and economic consequences. Despite improvements in health, PB prevalence remains
      stable, possibly due to complex causes such as maternal age, stress, multiparity, etc.
      Shortening of the uterine cervix in early stages of gestation is a risk factor for PB. The
      presence of abnormal vaginal microbiota in the early stages of pregnancy is als a risk factor
      for PB. However, no studies have analysed the impact of probiotics (live microorganisms
      which, in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host) on the PB in high-risk PB
      patients (pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery, i.e., uterine contractions and
      cervical shortening, with a 30% PB risk before 34 weeks, and 50% PB prior to 37 weeks (&gt;
      6-10% PB). Similarly, the effect of probiotics on vaginal flora dominated by lactic
      acid-producing bacteria could be analysed.

      Hypothesis

        -  Pregnant women with threatened preterm labour (TPL) will present vaginal microbiome
           different from those without TPL.

        -  Treatment with probiotics will modify the vaginal microbioma of pregnant women with TPL.

        -  The PB rate before 37 weeks in pregnant women with TPL who have received probiotics
           since their diagnosis will be reduced by at least 30%.

      Goals

        -  To correlate the use of probiotics of pregnant women with TPL with the PB rate before 37
           weeks.

        -  To ascertain the PB rate before 28, 30, 32 and 34 weeks in both groups.

        -  To assess neonatal morbidity between both groups.

      Methods

      Prospective, randomised, longitudinal, prospective, double-blind study.

      Relevance

      This study will determine whether the use of probiotics in pregnant women with TPL is
      associated with a lower risk of PB before 37 weeks. If so, it would allow us to act on the
      tertiary prevention of PB and treatment of TPL, the main cause of perinatal morbidity and
      mortality in our setting. It will also facilitate understanding of the pathophysiology of PB,
      influence of vaginal microbiota and the mechanism of action of probiotics.
