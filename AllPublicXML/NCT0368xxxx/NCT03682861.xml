  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen endurance-trained male/female will be randomly assigned to do four exercise and
      nutrition trials involving ingestion of four different concentrations of sweet corn derived
      starch (food component) in water (0, 1, 1.5 and 2 g. kg-1. h-1). Each trial will be separated
      by at least one week. During these four experimental trials athletes will be subjected to a
      glycogen-lowering cycling exercise protocol followed by a 4-h post-exercise recovery period
      (2h feeding then 2 hours of rest). At the end of 4-h period they will do a 20 kilometre time
      trial test on a stationary bike in a laboratory condition to measure the effect of different
      glycogen repletion rates on exercise performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-exercise glycogen synthesis rate is an important factor in determining the time needed
      to recover. Glycogen synthesis is affected not only by the extent of glycogen depletion but
      also in a more direct manner by the type, duration, and intensity of the preceding exercise
      because these will differentially influence the acute enzymatic changes as well as recovery
      from the acute changes that are induced by strenuous exercise. To optimize glycogen synthesis
      rates, adequate amounts of carbohydrate should be ingested. It has been suggested initially
      that a carbohydrate intake of 0.35 g·kg body wt-1 ·h-1 , provided at 2-h intervals, maximized
      muscle glycogen synthesis. Others observed no differences in glycogen storage rates after
      subjects ingested 0.75 or 1.5 g carbohydrate·kg-1 · h-1 provided at 2-h intervals. In a
      follow-up study, it was reported that an intake of &gt;0.5 g·kg-1 · h-1 is necessary to maximize
      post-exercise glycogen synthesis if supplements are administered at 2-h intervals. Higher
      glycogen synthesis rates have been reported in studies in which carbohydrates were ingested
      more frequently and at higher ingestion rates than in previous studies. Other efforts to
      increase glycogen synthesis rates by changing the form of administration (ie, as a solution,
      as a solid, or intravenously) have been unsuccessful. While the above range of intake rates
      has been suggested to maximize muscle glycogen resynthesis post-exercise, the required dosage
      with sweet corn derived high glycemic starch and its effect on a subsequent time trial
      exercise is currently unknown. So, investigators objective in this experiment is to find out
      optimal sweet corn derived recovery ingestion dose by using a glycogen lowering exercise
      protocol, followed by glycogen repletion via ingestion and a subsequent 20 km time trial
      cycling performance.

    <intervention_model_description>It is a repeated measure design where each participant will undergo all four treatment in a randomized fashion to prevent any order effect. Treatments (recovery drinks) include a placebo which will be similar in taste and flavour to other treatments and three carbohydrate containing drinks mixed in water at different concentrations. Design of the study is composed of three main stages: 1) glycogen lowering exercise, 2) glycogen replenishment and rest and 3) performance based, timed cycling exercise. All participants will arrive fasted to the laboratory, performing an exercise protocol that lowers their glycogen levels, followed by ingestion of different drinks (every 30 min) during 2 hours of a 4 hour rest and finally performing a 20 km stationary bike test for the time to finish to evaluate the effect of recovery drinks ingested.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Glycogen will be lowered using a 10-min warm-up period at a workload of 50% max wattage power output (Wmax). Thereafter, participants will be instructed to cycle 2-min block periods at alternating workloads of 90% and 50% of Wmax, respectively. This will be continued until the participants are no longer able to complete the 2 min at 90% Wmax. That moment will be defined as the time at which the individual is unable to maintain cycling speed at 60 revolutions/min. At that moment the high-intensity block will be reduced to 80% Wmax. Again, athletes will cycle until they are unable to complete a 2-min block at 80% Wmax, after which the high-intensity block will be reduced to 70% Wmax. Finally, participants will be allowed to stop when pedalling speed could not be maintained at 70% Wmax.</description>
