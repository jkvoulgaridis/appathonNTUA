    <textblock>
      The main target is to determine levator ani muscle avulsion rate in vacuum delivery,
      comparing it to forceps delivery. As secondary goals, The aim to evaluate the difference in
      levator hiatus area among our study groups.

      Nulliparous women who were recruited for an initial evaluation from our maternity unit,
      Hospital Universitario Virgen de Valme. Participants were recruited prior to instrumentation
      at delivery and those meeting the inclusion criteria, being randomized into the two study
      groups (vacuum delivery or forceps delivery).

      Deliveries completed using vacuum instrumentation were performed by obstetricians with a
      minimum of five years' experience in obstetric practice. In terms of analgesia, epidural
      analgesia was used for intrapartum analgesia. The forceps used for the instrumentation was
      the forceps of Kielland and the vacuum was a metal vacuum (Bird's cup 50 mm, 80 kPa) was used
      to perform fetal extraction. A suction cup was carefully placed over the flexion point,
      avoiding caput succedaneum, and rapid negative pressure was applied (over 2 min, until
      0.6-0.8 kg/cm2 ). Traction was carried out during contraction, along with maternal push, at a
      rate of 2-3 tractions per contraction, and without associating Kristeller maneuver. The
      procedure was abandoned if, after three cup slides or 15 min, fetal extraction had not been
      successful. Selective episiotomy was carried out in VD following Valme's University Hospital
      clinical practice guideline for instrumental deliveries.

      Obstetric parameters evaluated were: gestational age, labor induction, epidural analgesia,
      type of instrumentation, duration of second stage of labor, episiotomy and perineal tears.
      Fetal parameters studied after birth were: fetal sex, weight, head circumference, umbilical
      artery pH at birth, Apgar test result (at 1 and 5 min), presence of neonatal morbidity
      (cephalohaematoma, brachial plexus palsy, etc.), admission to neonatology department and
      neonatal mortality.

      The sonographic evaluation was performed six months after delivery and was carried out by a
      single examiner, with more than five years experience exclusively in obstetric ultrasound,
      with specific training in 3/4D imaging and blinded to obstetric data relating to the
      delivery. A 500_ Toshiba Aplio (Toshiba Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan) ultrasound with
      an abdominal probe PVT-675MV 3D was used for the assessments. Images were acquired with
      patients in dorsal lithotomy position, placed on the gynecological examination table and
      under empty bladder conditions. The transducer was carefully placed on each patient's
      perineum, applying the minimal possible pressure. Three volume measurements were taken for
      each patient: at rest, with Valsalva maneuver and with maximum contraction. Then, offline
      analysis of ultrasound volumes was carried out. Analysis of ultrasound volumes was performed
      offline.

      In the multi-view ultrasound images, complete avulsion was defined as an abnormal insertion
      of LAM in the lower pubic branch identified in all three central slices, i.e. in the plane of
      minimal hiatal dimensions (PMD) and the 2.5 and 5.0mm slices cranial to this one. Levator
      hiatus measurements, transverse diameters, anteroposterior diameters and area were also
      determined in the same plane (PMD).

    <description>To compare the rate of levator ani muscle avulsion in vacuum delivery versus the rate of the ate of levator ani muscle avulsion in forceps delivery.
The avulsion is studied by 3D transperineal ultrasound, through the multiplanar study, including images at 2.5 mm from the plane of minimal dmensions. Avulsion was defined as the discontinuity of levator ani muscle fibres at their pubic insertion, which were identified in the three central slices of the multiplanar assessment.</description>

    <description>To compare the levator ani muscle hiatus area (cm2) in vacuum delivery versus the levator ani muscle hiatus area (cm2) in forceps delivery.
Levator hiatal dimensions can be determined on 3D ultrasound by identifying the plane of minimal dimensions, i.e., the plane which contains the minimal distance between the posterior symphyseal margin and the anterior margin of the levator ani loop immediately posterior to the anorectal angle.</description>
