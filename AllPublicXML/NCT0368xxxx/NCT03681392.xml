      This is the first clinical trial of Dr. Pyke's Supplement for Stream (S4S), a proprietary
      combination of Panax ginseng extract, L-citrulline, beta-sitosterol and vitamin D3, to
      investigate its effects on prostatism and erections, and its tolerability, when taken daily
      and twice-daily for 2 weeks.

      This is a 2-week clinical trial of Dr. Pyke's Supplement for Stream (S4S), a proprietary
      combination of Panax ginseng extract, L-citrullline, beta-sitosterol and vitamin D3,
      investigating its lower urinary tract effects, sexual effects, and tolerability in two dose
      regimensâ€”daily for a week and twice daily for a week--in men who have Lower Urinary Tract
      Symptoms (LUTS) and may have erectile dysfunction (ED). No clinic visits are required.
      Subjects will be consented, screened, supplied with S4S, and tested via the Internet. Subset
      analyses will evaluate effects in three populations: men with at least moderate lower urinary
      tract symptoms (LUTS), according to standard score cutoff; men with at least moderate
      Erectile Dysfunction (ED, according to standard score cutoff; and all men dissatisfied with
      their urinary function and meeting minimal criteria for inclusion.
