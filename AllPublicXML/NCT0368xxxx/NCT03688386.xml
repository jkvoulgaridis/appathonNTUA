  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to study a reading intervention in the NICU among
      preterm infants using LENA (Language Environment Analysis) recordings, linguistic feedback,
      and a language curriculum to improve the neonatal inpatient language environment and language
      outcomes for preterm infants.

    <textblock>
      This project aims to examine how an educational reading intervention in the NICU can impact
      preterm infant language development and examine the impact of reading on mother-infant
      autonomic systems. Investigators plan to determine the effects of parent reading in addition
      to standard caretaking and holding on preterm infants, between 23 to 31 weeks gestation
      hospitalized in the Women &amp; Infants NICU, on adult word count, infant vocalizations,
      conversational turns through audio recording obtained over 3 separate days when the infant is
      corrected to 32, 34 and 36 weeks. Investigators aim to determine the effect of parent reading
      on maternal and infant heart rate variability before, during, and after the shared reading
      intervention through video and a single channel electrocardiographic recording over the same
      3 separate days as the LENA recording. Additionally, investigators aim to determine the
      effect of parent reading on maternal stress and perceived well-being in the NICU through a
      validated questionnaire and to determine parent satisfaction of a NICU reading intervention
      through a parent questionnaire completed prior to infant discharge and at the 12 month follow
      up visit. Secondary outcomes include determining the effect of parent reading on infant DNA
      methylation of the several genes through two saliva samples collected from the infant prior
      to study and post study enrollment and examine its relationship with infant stress and
      self-regulation based on a neurobehavioral exam performed at 36 weeks corrected age. Final
      outcomes include examination of the long-term effect of inpatient shared reading education on
      infant receptive and expressive language development at 12 and 24 months. Investigators hope
      this research will contribute to the growing research supporting early language development
      in preterm infants and its impact on maternal-infant well-being.

    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A validated neurologic assessment of infant neurobehavioral, neurologic and stress responses, and regulatory capacities. The following summary scores and their minimum and maximum scores are as follows: habituation (1-9), attention (1-9), handling (0-1), quality of movement (1-3), regulation (1-9), non optimal reflexes (0-12), asymmetric reflexes (0-7), stress/abstinence (0-1), arousal (1-9), hypertonicity (0-5), hypotonicity (0-3), excitability (0-9), lethargy (0-10). Higher scores indicate the summary score, for example a higher hypertonicity score indicates increased muscle tone whereas a higher hypotonicity score indicates decreased muscle tone. Summary scores are compared to normative scores for high risk preterm infants to compare overall neurobehavior.</description>
