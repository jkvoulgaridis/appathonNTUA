  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and effectiveness of Reversed Tracking Method for the identification and
      protection of extralaryngeal nerve branches in thyroid surgery were analyzed. Evidence-based
      medical evidence was used to evaluate the importance of EBSLN recognition and protection in
      thyroid surgery.

      The incidence of thyroid cancer in the world is growing rapidly. The current incidence of
      thyroid cancer in China is about 4.2/100,000, ranking the fourth in the incidence of female
      malignant tumors. Surgical treatment is the first and most important treatment for thyroid
      cancer. According to the existing literature, the injury rate of EBSLN in thyroid surgery can
      be as high as 58%. The quality of sound changes caused by EBSLN injury affects the quality of
      life of patients after surgery, and even affects the work and career of patients. therefore,
      seeking better EBSLN protection The method has great social and economic benefits.
