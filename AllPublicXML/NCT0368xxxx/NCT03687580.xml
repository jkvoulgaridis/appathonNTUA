  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global prevalence of diabetes is on the rise and with it increase in prevalence of
      diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). These recalcitrant wounds are difficult to manage and pose a
      heavy economic burden. Photobiomodulation (low level laser) is used for acceleration of wound
      healing. The current study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of B-cure laser, a
      home-use low-level laser device, for acceleration of diabetic foot ulcer healing over
      standard treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetic foot ulcers will receive standard treatment and in addition will be
      randomly allocated to receive either active or sham laser device to self treat at home. The
      patient's wound will be evaluated every 2 weeks. Adverse events will be documented. The study
      hypothesis is that B-Cure laser treatments as an adjunct therapy to standard treatment,
      applied, at home, by the patient or personal care-giver, can accelerate diabetic foot ulcers
      healing compared to standard treatment alone.

    <masking_description>The active and sham devices are externally identical and emit the same guiding light. The only difference is that the sham does not emit the therapeutic near infrared rays. However, since near infrared laser light is invisible to the human eye, the treatment allocation cannot be determined.</masking_description>
