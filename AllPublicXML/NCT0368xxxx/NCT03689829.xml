  <brief_title>A Study to Test Safety, Tolerability, and the Way the Body Absorbs, Distributes, and Gets Rid of a Study Drug Called MOR106, in Healthy Subjects and in Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Parallel-design Phase 1 Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics/Exposure Following Different Single Dose Levels of MOR106 (Administered Subcutaneously or Intravenously) in Healthy Male Subjects (Randomized, Open-label), and in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Repeated Subcutaneous Dosing Over 12 Weeks)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study consists of three parts:

        -  Part 1 with healthy volunteers.

        -  Part 2 and Part 3 including subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (a skin
           disease).

      For Part 1 the main goal of the study is to compare the safety, tolerability, and exposure of
      administration of the test drug via an injection in a skin layer just under the surface
      (subcutaneous), to administration of the test drug into the vein (intravenous).

      For Part 2 and Part 3 the main goal of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      administration of the test drug via an injection in a skin layer just under the surface
      (subcutaneous) during 12 weeks of treatment.

             18-30 kg/m², inclusive.

          -  Judged to be in good health based upon the results of a medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and screening laboratory
             profile prior to the initial investigation medicinal product (IMP) administration.

        Part 2 and Part 3:

          -  Male or female between 18-65 years of age (extremes included), on the day of signing

             administration that, in the investigator's opinion, represents a safety risk for the
             subject's participation in the study, may affect the interpretation of clinical safety
             or efficacy data, or may prevent the subject from safely completing the assessments
             required by the protocol.

          -  History of, or current immunosuppressive condition.

        In addition for Part 2 and 3:

             iv) antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals within 4 weeks of baseline, or clinical
             signs of infective eczema within 1 week before baseline (Day 1 pre-dose).

          -  Having used any of the following treatments:

             i) Exposure to a biologic therapy for AD. ii) Immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating
             drugs (e.g. systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil,
             interferon-γ (IFN-γ), azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.) within 4 weeks of baseline.
             iii) Phototherapy (ultraviolet (UVB) or Psoralen Ultraviolet A [PUVA]) for AD within
             four weeks of baseline. iv) Treatment with TCS or TCI within two weeks before the
             baseline visit. v) Treatment with biologics (for non-AD indications) within five
             half-lives (if known) or 12 weeks prior to baseline visit, whichever is longer. vi)
             Regular use (more than two visits per week) of a tanning booth/parlor within four
             weeks of the screening visit.
