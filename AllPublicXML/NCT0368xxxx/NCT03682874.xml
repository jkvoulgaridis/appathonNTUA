  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research program is to improve understanding of the mechanistic
      link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, acute delirium, and cognitive
      impairment following acute respiratory failure. In this pilot study, the study team will
      establish a prospective cohort of older patients with acute respiratory failure and obtain
      data on delirium duration, AD imaging and CSF biomarkers, and cognitive outcomes following
      critical illness.

      The study team will recruit patients with no known history of dementia for enrollment into
      the cohort during their hospital stay for acute respiratory failure. The cohort will undergo
      testing including cognitive testing, MRI imaging, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) analysis at 3 months following hospital discharge. The study will examine the
      association of delirium duration during the hospital stay and cognitive impairment at 3 month
      follow-up with CSF levels of amyloid- Î²42, tau, and phospho-tau. Measures of delirium will
      also be related with structural/functional MRI dependent measures. The goal is to design a
      larger prospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between AD imaging and CSF
      biomarkers with delirium and post-ICU cognitive impairment. The results of this pilot study
      with provide important information with regard to future study design including: (1) ratio of
      eligible to recruited patients (2) retention rate; (3) safety and feasibility of protocol;
      and (4) preliminary effect size estimates.

        We propose to recruit older patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical
        ventilation admitted to the medical ICU of an academic medical center, Wake Forest Baptist
        Hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 55 years

          -  Anticipated ICU stay of at least 48 hours

          -  Delirium during ICU stay defined as CAM-ICU positive on at least two occasions at
             least 12 hours apart within 72 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of dementia in electronic medical record at time of ICU admission

             Syndrome (GBS)

          -  Psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression with
             psychotic features

             health/safety or integrity of study

          -  Active malignancy requiring treatment in the prior 6 months

          -  Inability to return for study procedures
