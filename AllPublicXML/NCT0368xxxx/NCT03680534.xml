      Aim To evaluate in vivo the shaping ability of the canal with 3 different single-file
      systems: Reciproc Blue, WaveOne Gold and XP Endo-Shaper, using cone beam computed tomography
      and 3D reconstructions to measure canal volume increase, centering ability of the instruments
      and canal transportation in human premolars in vivo.

      Methodology Thirty human lower premolars were randomly divided into three groups, in which
      root canals were prepared using one of these single-file systems: Reciproc Blue, WaveOne
      Gold, and XP EndoShaper. Root canals were scanned before and after root canal preparation by
      using CBCT and 3D reconstruction was carried out to evaluate canal volume increase, centering
      ability of the instrument and canal transportation for each group. Statistical analysis was
      made for each variable to determine statistically significant differences between groups.
