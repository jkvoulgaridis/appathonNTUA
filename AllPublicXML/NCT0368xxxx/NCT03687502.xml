  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the efficacy of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in
      improving the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children, when compared to the standard
      grey-scale ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a single-center, non-randomized trial that will add to our institution's current
      diagnostic algorithm using Contrast Enhanced Ultra Sound (CEUS) in subjects who are
      clinically suspicious for acute appendicitis.

      For those who consent to study participation, we propose obtaining a CEUS after the initial
      gray-scale ultrasound. Once the initial ultrasound is complete, the contrast LumasonÂ® (sulfur
      hexafluoride lipid type-A microspheres) will be administered through an already existing IV
      catheter and an abdominal scan will be completed. The patient will then continue with
      standard of care treatment per his treating physician. The CEUS image will be read at a
      future time by a Children's Mercy Hospital radiologist blinded to the results of the gray
      scale ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan if one was obtained; these will be used
      for comparison.
