  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study to compare
      the clinical outcomes of two trifocal IOLs differing in the dominance of additional power.
      The investigational device POD L GF shows dominance for the intermediate addition (+1.75 D),
      whereas the control device POD F GF shows dominance for the near addition (+3.5 D).
      Implantation of the IOLs is bilaterally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study
      whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of
      trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted with the hydrophobic IOL
      FineVision POD L GF or the hydrophobic IOL FineVision POD F GF (both lenses: (PhysIOL, Li√®ge,
      Belgium).

      The devices under investigation (FineVision POD L GF and POD F GF) are trifocal
      glistening-free acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study
      PhysIOL sa/nv. Both consist of the same hydrophobic material. The main difference between the
      lenses is the dominance of additional power. The investigational device POD L GF shows
      dominance for the intermediate addition (+1.75 D), whereas the control device POD F GF shows
      dominance for the near addition (+3.5 D). The IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine
      cataract surgery on patients suffering from cataract development.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 10 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 7 postoperative) over a period of 6 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary and secondary endpoint data will be collected at the 6 months follow up visit. Data
      analyses will be done after the last patient finished the final examination to support the
      study publication plan.
