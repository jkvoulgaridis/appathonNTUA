  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep can affect frequency and occurrence of interictal spikes and occurrence, timing, and
      threshold of seizure. Epilepsy can worsen sleep architecture and severity of sleep disorders.
      Thus, a vicious cycle is set. Certain epilepsy syndromes are so intertwined with sleep that
      they are considered sleep-related epilepsies. Poor sleep in epilepsy is multifactorial and is
      worsened by poorly controlled seizures. App-delivered intervention has shown promise as a
      method to overcome health issues; however, the long-term effectiveness has not been proven in
      epileptic patients with chronic insomnia.

    <description>Zigmond and Snaith developed the 14-item HADS to measure the anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) of patients with both somatic and mental problems. The response descriptors of all items are Yes, definitely (score 3); Yes, sometimes (score 2); No, not much (score 1); No, not at all (score 0); except for items 7 and 10, which are scored reversely. A higher score represents higher levels of anxiety and depression: a domain score of 11 or greater indicates anxiety or depression; 8-10 indicates borderline case; 7 or lower indicates no signs of anxiety or depression. The two-factor framework of the HADS has been supported in epileptic patients.</description>
