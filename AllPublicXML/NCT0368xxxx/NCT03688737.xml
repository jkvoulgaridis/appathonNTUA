      Does the use of low level laser (LLL) after surgical correction of cleft palate improve
      healing and decrease incidence of oronasal fistula?

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the effect of adjunctive use of LLL after surgical correction of cleft palate in
      improving healing among children with cleft palate Secondary objectives To evaluate the
      effect of adjunctive use of LLL after surgical correction of cleft palate in decreasing
      incidence of oronasal fistula after surgical repair among children with cleft palate Study
      group: Will use LLL after surgical correction of cleft palate at day of surgery, 1st day and
      3rd day Control group: Surgical correction of cleft palate without Adjunctive use of LLL

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Age: between 6 to 18 months of age

        2. Patient has isolated cleft palate

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Systemic disease

        2. Hematological disorder Outcome: Outcome measure (s) (1ry, 2ry) 1ry: healing assessment
           2ry: occurrence of oronasal fistula
