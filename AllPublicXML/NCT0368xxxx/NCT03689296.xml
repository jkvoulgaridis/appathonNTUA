  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with severe and persistent mental disorders (or SMI, Severe Mental Illness) have a
      life expectancy which is 20 years less than the general population, mainly due to excess
      mortality related to cardiovascular disease. Moreover, despite an overall increase in life
      expectancy, the gap is widening between people with long-term psychological disorders and the
      general population.

      This early excess mortality is explained by disparities between people with SMI and the
      general population not only in access to and use of health services but also in the quality
      and type of care provided. There is also an over-representation of risk factors and
      cardiovascular pathologies regardless of the mental disorder, despite the current
      recommendations for best practices.

      The World Health Organization has defined the fight against somatic comorbidities as one of
      the axes of the European Mental Health Plan and one of the reference themes of the World
      Health Organization Mental Health Evidence and Research Programme (EPSM-Lille-Métropole). The
      Groupement de Coopération Sanitaire pour la recherche et la formation en santé mentale, which
      brings together 17 hospitals in France and relays the actions of the World Health
      Organization's Collaborating Centre, has decided to make it into a national research project.

      Moreover, it is recognized that &quot;medical&quot; management of a disease is all the more effective
      when the patient is involved. However, the empowerment of people with long-term psychological
      disorders has never been put at the centre of a strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk.

      In this context, we hypothesize that one of the keys to reducing cardiovascular risk would be
      to take into account the experience and representations of this risk by all stakeholders
      (people with long-term psychological disorders, their carers, primary health professionals
      and psychiatric professionals).
