  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an frequent chronic and itchy inflammatory dermatitis which concern
      about 20% of pediatric population with a revelation usually toward 3-6 months of live.
      However, there are very few data about the prevalence of pruritus of young infants and about
      the discomfort linked with it. While the skin and the nervous system of young infants (Under
      6 month) are competent in pruritus experiment, the acquisition of conscious and deliberate
      motor ability allowing specific scratching of the body parts which are affected is possible
      only from 6 month. Thus, the diagnosis of AD intensity and the assesment of the potential
      associated discomfort are hard. At the present time, the diagnosis and the assesment of
      pruritus of children are based on a hetero-assesment via scales which are not applicable for
      infants under 6 month. The visual scale &quot;Numeric Rating Scale&quot; validated in adult population
      seems to be the most specific to assess AD severity. In pediatric population, the use of
      &quot;Eppendorf Itch Questionnaire&quot; and the american version of &quot;Childhood Atopic Dermatitis
      Impact Scale&quot; are recommended. Alternatives to clinic and subjective scoring of pruritus
      severity are described via actigraphy. Thus, a strong statistic correlation have been
      demonstrated between a nocturne measure of motor activity of wrist, as a reflect of the
      intensity of pruritus, and infra-red video analysis. But, once again, the technic is not
      adapted to young infants because of the absence of conscious and oriented motor ability and
      as a result of less organised sleep/wake cycle.

      In order to improve young infants' (Under 6 month) care, the analysis of their behaviours
      with AD seems to be necessary to better identify a discomfort of these patients.
