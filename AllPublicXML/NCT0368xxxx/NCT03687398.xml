    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 10-17% of women in childbearing
      age, 35-60% of women with chronic pelvic pain and can cause infertility, costing as much as
      2.8 billion dollars per year. For this reason, every step taken in diagnosis and treatment is
      of great importance both materially and spiritually. Patients can be diagnosed about 8-9
      years after the onset of their complaints due to inadequacy of diagnostic methods In the
      study, it is decided to look at the basis of the disease, endometrial cells. And aimed to
      find the difference between the two women who are thought to be no different from each other
      among our current knowledge but one has endometriosis while other have not.

      Endometriosis is the appearance of a tissue similar to the endometrium in the ovaries, large
      intestine, and many other organ walls, except the uterus. The reason is unknown yet. Severe
      periodic pain, infertility, and pain during intercourse, affects approximately 2 million
      women in Turkey on average, 10% of women around the world. Endometriosis is a chronic
      inflammatory disease that affects 10-17% of women in childbearing age, 35-60% of women with
      chronic pelvic pain and can cause infertility, costing as much as 2.8 billion dollars per
      year. For this reason, every step taken in diagnosis and treatment is of great importance
      both materially and spiritually. Patients can be diagnosed about 8-9 years after the onset of
      their complaints due to the inadequacy of diagnostic methods In the study, it is decided to
      look at the basis of the disease, endometrial cells. And aimed to find the difference between
      the two women who are thought to be no different from each other among our current knowledge
      but one has endometriosis while others have not. For this reason, mapping of all genomes with
      the nanoclonal technique, the most advanced genetic screening method currently available from
      endometrial samples of patients and healthy women, is to identify the possible copy numbers,
      translocation, insertion and inversion anomalies, and to name them functionally by proteomic
      analysis. We believe that the results obtained from our study will guide the diagnostic tests
      and possible gene therapy in the future.
