  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have motor impairments that make it challenging for them to
      participate in standard physical activity (PA) programs. There is a need to evaluate adapted
      PA programs for this population. Dance can promote coordination, posture, muscle strength,
      motor learning, and executive functioning. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and the
      effects of a new therapeutic ballet intervention specifically designed for children with CP
      on physiological and executive functions outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      8 children with CP (9-14y/o; 75% female) participated in a six-week therapeutic ballet
      program. Participants had body composition (DXA), muscle strength (hand-grip dynamometer),
      habitual physical activity, gait and selective motor control functions, and executive
      function tasks before and after the intervention. Follow-up assessments of habitual physical
      activity, gait and executive functions were completed four to five week post-intervention.
