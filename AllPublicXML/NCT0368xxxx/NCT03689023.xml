  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled pragmatic implementation study in clinical practice, with a
      primary focus on cardiovascular risk reduction through adherence to behavioral interventions
      related to physical activity and healthy diet.The intervention is interdisciplinary,
      multimodal and patient activating and uses the existing setting and work flows at the clinic,
      ensuring that the patients receive education about cardiovascular risk factors, physical
      activity and healthy diet through a systematic approach including targeted patient education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical intervention study will investigate the effectiveness of a uniform and
      systematic institutional strategy incorporating targeted strategic patient education about
      cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity and a healthy diet lifestyle starting early in
      the primary rehabilitation process with 6 months of follow up compared to a historic control
      group. Test - retest reliability of four different VO2 peak tests and a multi sensor
      accelerometer respectively will be assessed as well.

    <description>The classification tool involves a sensory and motor examination to determine the neurological level of the injury and whether the injury is complete or incomplete. It defines neurological level as the most caudal level at which sensory and motor function are intact. The completeness of the injury is graded from A to E according to the American Spinal Injury Assosciation Impairment Scale (AIS). Grade A indicates a worse score and E indicates a better score</description>
