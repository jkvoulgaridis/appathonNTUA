      Multicentre, prospective, observational, non-interventional, open- ended trial, collecting
      data from male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years, with a diagnosis of opioid addiction
      according to ICD-10 (F11.2), treated with therapeutic doses of levomethadone according to the
      routine medical practice.

      The study is divided in two different consecutive parts:

        -  Part 1 [from Informed Consent form (ICF) to last data collected at V4]: patients
           enrolled are receiving levomethadone maintenance treatment according to clinical
           practice.

        -  Part 2 (after V4 up to FU): patients are in opioid maintenance treatment with any drug
           (including levomethadone) according to clinical practice.

      The maximum duration on-study for a patient will be 405 days [from ICF signature (-30 days
      from V1) to FU (=360 + 15)]. This study is an open-ended trial. This means that for the
      enrolment and for the study, no maximum duration has been established.

      The study, which is a voluntary Post Authorization Safety Study (PASS), will be carried out
      on approximately 10 centers in Italy.

      The objectives are to provide further data on the safety profile after long term use and
      effectiveness of levomethadone, administered according Summary of Product Characteristics
      (SmPC) and in a real word clinical setting, in opioid-addicted patients undergoing
      maintenance treatment.

      Safety will be assessed throughout all the study and safety data will be described and
      analysed based on Adverse Drug Reactions and corrected QT (QTc) prolongation at 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG), where available.

      The effectiveness outcomes are the evaluation of levomethadone maintenance treatment
      according to investigator's judgment at V4(180 days), based on different questionnaires and
      assessment.
