  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental Contrasting (MC) consists of imaging a desired future and comparing it with obstacles
      of the present reality in order to increase goal commitment when expectations of success are
      high. The study aims to investigate the effects of a motivational training (Mental
      Contrasting with Implementation Interventions; MCII) as a therapeutic add-on to standard
      treatment in inpatients with Alcohol Use Disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today's elaborated therapeutic interventions do not ensure sustainability of therapeutic
      success in alcohol-dependent patients. Thus, it is to develop and implement new therapeutic
      methods in order to increase regular treatment termination and continuous abstinence during
      treatment. Mental Contrasting (MC) consists of imaging a desired future and comparing it with
      obstacles of the present reality in order to increase goal commitment when expectations of
      success are high.

      In the study, MCII is implemented as an add-on intervention in order to reduce the risk of a
      relapse during treatment and to decrease drop-outs from treatment in alcohol-dependent
      inpatients. Therefore, inpatients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are randomly assigned to
      one of two groups. The experimental group does receive MCII, the control group an exercise
      from treatment as usual. In addition, patients undergo brief motivational screenings in form
      of self-report questionnaires at the beginning and during treatment in order to assess
      motivational mediation of treatment effects and drinking events. The effect of the MCII
      training will be examined on primary (drinking during treatment) and secondary outcome
      variables (early treatment termination, motivational changes after drinking events).

      The Primary Outcome is return to drinking during treatment defined as any violation of total
      abstinence. Drinking is assumed if either a drinking event is reported by the patient or a
      Breathalyzer tests is positive.

      Participants are allocated to the groups using randomisation with emphasis on equal group
      sizes in control and experimental group. The list of randomisation was generated with the
      online tool &quot;Research Randomizer&quot;.

      The investigator's a priori calculation of the required sample size is based on the primary
      outcome, i.e. return to any drinking during treatment. Given α=0.05 and 1-β=0.80 a one-sided
      z-test then yields a required sample size of 122 participants, i.e. 61 subjects in the
      intervention group and 61 subjects in the control group.

      All randomized subjects will be included in the analyses, regardless of whether they
      terminate the study regularly or not. Analyses will be done according to the
      intention-to-treat method (ITT).

    <description>self-efficacy will be assessed on the proposal of Ludwig, Tadayon‐Manssuri, Strik, and Moggi (2013) to measure self-efficacy with simply one question (&quot;How confident are you that you will be completely abstinent in 1 year, on a scale from 1 to 10?&quot;). This scale is called &quot;general self-efficacy&quot;. Lower scores indicate low self-efficacy and therefore a worse outcome; higher scores indicate a high self-efficacy and consequently a better outcome. We changed this question for different time intervals (e.g. the next fourteen days, until the end of treatment). The subscales are analyzed individually.</description>

    <description>Goal commitment will be assessed with the &quot;Commitment to Sobriety Scale&quot; (Kelly &amp; Greene, 2014). It is a brief five-item measure to assess level of client commitment to alcohol and drug use cessation and continued abstinence. Each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6). Lower scores indicate low commitment to sobriety and therefore a worse outcome; higher scores indicate a high commitment to sobriety and consequently a better outcome. A total score will be computed.</description>

    <description>Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) combines two methods: Mental Contrasting and Implementation Intentions.
Mental Contrasting (MC) consists of imaging a desired future and comparing it with obstacles of the present reality (Oettingen, 2000, 2014; Oettingen, Pak, &amp; Schnetter, 2001) in order to increase goal commitment when expectations of success are high (Gollwitzer, 2014). Implementation Intentions on the other hand specify when, where, and how to strive for a goal in form of an if-then-plan, e.g. &quot;If situation Y is encountered, then I will perform the goal-directed response Z&quot; (Gollwitzer, 2014; Wieber, Thürmer, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2015).</description>

    <description>The control group receive a control training, which consists of an exercise from treatment as usual. Thus, patients in the control group are supported in their intention for abstinence and in the reappraisal of risk situations and relapse, while no individual motivational strategies are planned or provided</description>

    <description>In this study, the research staff will work through the MCII approach with the participant as an interactive, face-to-face training. The desired future consists of imaging an abstinent life and comparing it with personally relevant obstacles. Afterwards, the most relevant obstacle will be chosen and an if-then-plan will be formed, that refers to this obstacle.</description>

    <description>The patients in the control group will receive a 2 x 2 contingency table about the disadvantages and advantages of being abstinent and of drinking. In addition, abstinence intentions of patients in the control group will also be supported and risk situations and relapse events since the last trainings will be reappraised, but without the use of MCII.</description>
