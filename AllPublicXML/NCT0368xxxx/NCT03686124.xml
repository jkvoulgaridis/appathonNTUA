  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to establish the safety and tolerability of IMA203 product in patients
      with solid tumors that express preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME).

      SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening
      and a biopsy for biomarker screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be
      taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA203 product.

      MANUFACTURING: IMA203 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days
      before the IMA203 product infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA203 product stays
      in the body. The patient will be admitted to the hospital during the treatment.

      After the IMA203 product infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given subcutaneously twice
      daily for 14 days.

      Since this study involves gene therapy, patients will be monitored throughout the study and
      for up to a total of 15 years.
