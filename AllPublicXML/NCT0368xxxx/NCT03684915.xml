  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important concerns in pediatric dentistry is the loss of necrotic primary
      molars leading to space loss. pulpectomies for primary teeth with severe pulpal involvement
      should be considered as the treatment of choice.

      Bacteria plays an essential role in the initiation and perpetuation of pulpal and periapical
      disease. The investigator's target when cleaning and shaping the root canal system is to
      remove bacteria-containing tissue.

      The removal of organic debris is the main purpose of instrumentation in pulpectomy procedures
      in primary teeth, this could be achieved using manual or rotary Ni-Ti files. A practical
      pulpectomy technique for the primary teeth should include the following:1) Fast procedure
      with short treatment time and minimal number of appointments.2) Effective debridement of the
      root canal without weakening the tooth structure or endangering the underlining permanent
      teeth.3) Minimal procedural complications. 4) Maintaining tooth function until it is
      naturally exfoliated.

      Manufacturers using rotary files highlight their cleaning efficiency for root canal
      preparations, simple procedures, and decreased procedure time, which is especially important
      in children.

      Considering that preparation time is an important clinical factor in pediatric patient
      management, the use of rotary instruments for pulpectomies in primary teeth is recommended.
