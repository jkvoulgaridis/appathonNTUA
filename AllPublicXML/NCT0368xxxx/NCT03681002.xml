    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to describe and evaluate the effect of a structured lifestyle
      intervention program, focusing on lifestyle habits, in a primary care setting in patients
      with high cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, we want to explore the patientÂ´s experience of
      lifestyle change and counseling after participation in the intervention program and to
      investigate the cost-effectiveness of the program.

      Intervention The intervention program comprises five individual visits to the same nurse,
      specialised in diabetes care and the metabolic syndrome every three month during one year.
      The nurse led a person centered dialog based on the answers from a questionnaire. At every
      visit, focus was primarily on lifestyle habits, using motivational interviewing to strengthen
      the patient's ability to modify one or more lifestyle habits. Dietary counselling was in
      accordance with the Swedish recommendation in nutrition. If the patient were in need of
      extended counseling regarding one or more lifestyle habits, he or she could be referred
      within the primary care unit to a specialist. During the 12-month period, all patients where
      offered to participate in evening group sessions at three different occasions. Topics were
      physical activity, fatty acids, healthy food, tobacco and alcohol, stress, sleep and methods
      of how to change behavior&quot;.

    <description>The Framingham Risk Score is a gender-specific algorithm used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. Cardiovascular risk scoring systems give an estimate of the probability that a person will develop cardiovascular disease within a specified amount of time, in this case 10 years. Individuals with low risk have 10% or less CHD risk at 10 years, with intermediate risk 10-20%, and with high risk 20% or more.</description>
