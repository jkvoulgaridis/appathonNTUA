      An open label, multicentre, randomised, 2-cohort, sequential and crossover study to assess
      the relative oral bioavailability of MT-7117 higher content tablets versus MT-7117 lower
      content tablets and the pharmacokinetics of MT-7117 under various gastric conditions (fed and
      fasted, and following administration of a proton pump inhibitor and an acidic beverage) in
      healthy subjects
