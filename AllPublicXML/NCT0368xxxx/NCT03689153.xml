    <description>Systemic clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body.

    <description>Single ascending IV low, middle, and high dose of JNJ-63733657 will be administered in sequential cohorts. The progression to the next (higher) dose level is dependent on acceptable safety and tolerability profile of JNJ-63733657 obtained after dose administration of the current dose level. The length of time between dosing days of cohorts will be at least 14 days.</description>
