  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Chile, sexually transmitted infections (STI)s, including HIV / AIDS, are the main causes
      of morbidity in adolescents and young adults. The surveillance bulletin of the Institute of
      Public Health revealed an increase in cases of gonorrhea, over 200% in the last five years.
      HIV cases increased between 34% and 47% in this period as well.

      Unsafe sexual behaviors are among the most important risk factors for sexually transmitted
      infections (STI); it has been shown that educational / behavioral interventions can achieve
      success in behavioral changes, especially in young people. Some studies have evaluated the
      effectiveness of behavioral interventions to prevent sexual risk behavior of HIV and STIs
      with encouraging results.

      On the other hand, information and communication technologies (ICT) have been used in the
      prevention of STIs, HIV / AIDS. There is a considerable increase in the use of meta-universes
      or three-dimensional virtual worlds for educational purposes since 2006. No studies have yet
      been found that demonstrate the effectiveness of educational interventions carried out in
      meta-universes for the prevention of STIs in Chile.

      This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention through
      the use of meta-universes, on self-efficacy in the use of condoms and safe sexual behavior,
      in university students.

      An open randomized, controlled trial will be conducted. Dependent variables will be measured
      before the intervention and 15 days after the end of the intervention in the experimental
      group in both groups.

      Students from first year to fourth year of different careers (except Nursing), currently in
      the Universidad Autonoma de Chile will be included after their informed consent.

      The psychoeducational intervention consists of three sessions in which techniques based on
      three of the four sources of self-efficacy described are applied.

      The intervention will be carried out every 24 hours with four participants in four computers
      and 3D lenses available in the computer labs of the University.

      The dependent variables will be: 1) the self-efficacy in the use of male condom, measured
      with the Scale Condom self-efficacy scale of Brafford and Beck and 2) safe sexual behavior
      measured with Safe Sex Behavior Questionnaire scale of Dilorio, Lehr, Adame and Carlone. Both
      scales were culturally adapted to Chile.

      In Chile, sexually transmitted infections (STI)s, including HIV / AIDS, are the main causes
      of morbidity in adolescents and young adults. The surveillance bulletin of the Institute of
      Public Health revealed an increase in cases of gonorrhea, over 200% in the last five years.
      HIV cases increased between 34% and 47% in this period as well.

      Unsafe sexual behaviors are among the most important risk factors for these diseases; it has
      been shown that educational / behavioral interventions can achieve success in behavioral
      changes, especially in young people. Some studies have evaluated the effectiveness of
      behavioral interventions to prevent sexual risk behavior of HIV and STIs with encouraging
      results.

      On the other hand, information and communication technologies (ICT) have been used in the
      prevention of STIs, HIV / AIDS. These include computer interventions through meta-universes,
      chat rooms, text messaging and social media. There is a considerable increase in the use of
      meta-universes or three-dimensional virtual worlds for educational purposes since 2006. No
      studies have yet been found that demonstrate the effectiveness of educational interventions
      carried out in meta-universes for the prevention of STIs in Chile.

      This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention through
      the use of meta-universes, on self-efficacy in the use of condoms and safe sexual behavior,
      in university students.

      An open randomized, controlled trial will be conducted. Dependent variables will be measured
      before the intervention and 15 days after the end of the intervention in the experimental
      group, in both groups.

      Students from first year to fourth year of different careers (except Nursing), currently in
      the Universidad Autonoma de Chile will be included after their informed consent.

      The psychoeducational intervention consists of three sessions in which techniques based on
      three of the four sources of self-efficacy described are applied. The first session is called
      &quot;Knowledge about STI&quot;; the second session is entitled &quot;Use of the male condom&quot; and the third
      session is called &quot;Talking about sexuality issues&quot;. In the first session screens will be
      created with interactive information in which the participants wearing 3D glasses will select
      information on different types of STIs; modeled situations will be presented in which
      students will perform and at the same time develop self-efficacy in terms of knowledge about
      STIs. In the second session four metaverses will be created, the first represents a modeled
      situation in which the participant selects an avatar, then selects a scenario between four
      risk situations where he meets a possible sexual partner. The student must select riddles
      that lead to responsible sexual behavior, selecting the best way to use the condom and
      different barrier methods, proposing its use and rejecting any risky behavior. In the third
      session, four meta-universes will be created through 3D technology, each participant selects
      an avatar and a different role is assigned to each one so that they generate sexuality
      communication skills among them without knowing each one's identity.

      The intervention will be carried out every 24 hours with four participants in four computers
      and 3D lenses available in the computer labs of the University.

      The dependent variables will be: 1) the self-efficacy in the use of male condom, measured
      with the Scale Condom self-efficacy scale of Brafford and Beck and 2) safe sexual behavior
      measured with Safe Sex Behavior Questionnaire scale of Dilorio, Lehr, Adame and Carlone. Both
      scales were culturally adapted to Chile.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a behavioral intervention where 120 university students will be randomly assigned to the intervention or de control group. Intervention consists in a psychoeducational activity enhanced using meta-universes or three-dimensional virtual worlds. Each selected student will undergo a three-session educational activity before a personal computer and wearing 3D lenses. The first session is called &quot;Knowledge about STI&quot;; the second session is entitled &quot;Use of the male condom&quot; and the third session is called &quot;Talking about sexuality issues&quot;. The intervention will be carried out every 24 hours with four participants in four computers and 3D lenses available in the computer labs of the University. The control group will not receive this intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>All forms with the questionnaires will be consecutively numbered before the beginning of the study and randomly allocated to one of the study groups. This assignment list will be given to the secretary who will allocate the questionnaires to the corresponding group and deliver them to the corresponding researcher. After completion, all forms will be collected and merged and then delivered again to the secretary who will randomly assign number 1 or 2 to one of the groups and will write this number in the upper right edge of each completed questionnaire according to the original assignment list. The researcher that will introduce data in the database will include a field for this number but will not know to which of the groups it belongs. Statistical analysis will be then carried comparing groups 1 and 2. This will not be uncovered until all results are obtained and are ready for discussion.</masking_description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy in the use of male condom</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy in the use of male condom measured with an adaptation of the Condom Use Self Efficacy Scale (CUSES) developed by Brafford and Beck in 1991. This scale consists of 21 items describing an individual's feelings of confidence about being able to buy condoms, put them on and take them off, and negotiate their use with a new sexual partner. Each item is answered with a five-point Likert scale (0: total disagreement to 4: total agreement). Six items are worded negatively so should be reversed when coding. Total scores go from 0 to 84 points, the higher the better self-efficacy. This scale underwent translation and cross-cultural adaptation in Cuba (http://dx.doi.org/10.4321/S1132-12962011000200012) and is now in a process of cross-cultural validation in Chile (Universidad Autonoma de Chile) before the beginning of the study. The original authors of the scale have been consulted and agree with adaptation and validation.</description>

    <measure>Safe sexual behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safe sexual behavior measured with an adaptation of the Safe Sex Behavior Questionnaire (SSBQ) first developed by DiIorio, Parsons, Lehr, Adame and Carlone in 1992. This scale aims to detect safe sexual practices and risky sexual behavior. The current scale has 23 items. Participants rate on a 4-point scale the degree of safe sex practices from &quot;never&quot; (recorded as 1) to &quot;always&quot; (recorded as 4). There are 8 items worded negatively that should be reversed when coding. The total possible range of scores in this adapted SSBQ is between 23 and 92, with higher scores indicating less risky sexual behavior and lower scores indicating more risky sexual behavior. This scale is undergoing translation and cross-cultural validation now in Chile (Universidad Autonoma de Chile). The original authors of the scale have been consulted and agree with adaptation and validation.</description>
