  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data suggests that combining ramucirumab with immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients who have previously received immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) may be more
      effective than traditional therapy. The investigators propose a pilot study to test the
      combination of ramucirumab and atezolizumab in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC patients
      previously treated with ICB.
