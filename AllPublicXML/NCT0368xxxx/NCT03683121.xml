  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-selective beta blockers are commonly used drugs for primary prevention and secondary
      prevention in patients with cirrhotic decompensated esophageal varices bleedingï¼Œthe basic
      heart rate, blood pressure and condition of different patients have individual
      differences.This paper mainly discusses the compliance of patients taking NSBB under
      different follow-up methods and analyze the factors affecting patient compliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is a common complication of decompensated liver cirrhosis
      and the rate of rebleeding after hemostasis is high.Effective secondary prevention reduces
      the risk of rebleeding.Non-selective beta blockers are commonly used drugs for secondary
      prevention.Clinically, there is a great difference in the compliance of patients taking
      non-selective beta receptor blockers.In this study, the enrolled patients were divided into
      three groups: the traditional follow-up group (face-to-face interview);Non-traditional
      follow-up (WeChat, telephone, etc.);Traditional and non-traditional methods of follow-up were
      combined in the group.The investigators collected the basic data before the patients were
      enrolled, adjusted the medication dosage according to the patients' condition during the
      follow-up period, and recorded the treatment during the follow-up period, and analyzed the
      factors influencing the patients' compliance.
