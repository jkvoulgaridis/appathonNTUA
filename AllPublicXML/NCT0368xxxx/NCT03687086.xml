  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping medications, called hypnotics, are often prescribed for insomnia and are associated
      with adverse health outcomes in older adults. Response rates to hypnotic discontinuation
      programs are often inadequate, and many patients eventually resume use of hypnotics,
      suggesting that other mechanisms need to be targeted to achieve and sustain high rates of
      non-use. Current programs focus on the tapering of hypnotics and/or the treatment of insomnia
      symptoms. These programs employ strategies such as supervised gradual taper, cognitive
      behavioral therapy targeting hypnotic withdrawal, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy for
      insomnia. Evidence suggests that another mechanism involving &quot;placebo&quot; effects may be a
      viable target for achieving and sustaining higher discontinuation rates. Cognitive
      expectancies play a key role in producing placebo effects, which are characterized as real
      improvements in sleep arising from psychosocial aspects of treatment rather than drug effects
      alone. In this study, investigators are comparing two programs for discontinuing hypnotic
      medications-a program that addresses placebo effects associated with hypnotic use and a
      program that does not address these effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will complete a 5-year randomized trial, recruiting participants from two
      healthcare systems using a three-step screening process that minimizes time and travel burden
      to participants. Step 1 (identification of participants): Investigators will identify
      participants aged &gt;= 55 years who have current prescriptions for lorazepam, temazepam,
      alprazolam, and/or zolpidem for &gt;= 3 months. Investigators will use three sources to identify
      these patients: medication lists from electronic health records/administrative data, consults
      to insomnia clinic, and referrals from providers. The research team will mail a recruitment
      letter (with opt-out card) to patients identified from these sources. Step 2 (phone screening
      for current or prior insomnia and current hypnotic use); Patients who endorse a history of
      insomnia symptoms and current hypnotic use will be invited for an in-person screening. Step 3
      (in-person screening for remaining eligibility criteria (and baseline assessments): After
      written consent, the in-person screening visit consists of a comprehensive sleep, mental
      health, and brief physical health assessment. Individuals who meet study criteria and agree
      to continue will be randomized to receive either the Program A (N=94) or Program B (N=94).
      The interventions are approximately 2 months. Following intention-to-treat principles, all
      randomized participants will complete an assessment immediately after the intervention ends
      and 6 months after completing treatment. Participants will be compensated monetarily for
      assessment visits. Investigators will measure hypnotic expectancies, hypnotic
      discontinuation, and insomnia severity post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up.
