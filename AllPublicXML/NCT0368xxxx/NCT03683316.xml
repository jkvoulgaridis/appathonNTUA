    <description>There will be one arm for this study. All infants will receive a similar intervention during their routine kangaroo mother care (KMC). KMC is a national and international standard of care. This is an observational study of how infants breath while participating in KMC compared to how they breath while in a crib or incubator. Work of breathing will be measured at baseline and then during KMC. Mothers will participate in KMC regardless of participation in the study. Work of breathing will be measured by using Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP). This scientifically measures work of breathing (specifically phase angles) by placing soft bands around the abdomen and chest. The actual &quot;intervention&quot; is a standard of care and something that the mother infant dyad will do regardless of the study. Each mother / infants pair is expected to be actively enrolled for approximately 2 hours.</description>
