    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, multi-centre, cross-over study. All
      subjects will use both the study device (test catheter) and the comparator (control catheter)
      for one week each.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the subjects' tolerability of practising CIC by using two urinary catheters produced with different coating processes by means of subjective assessment scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability with regards to perceived pain, when using two different urinary catheters; test vs control catheter.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks in total. 1 week Treatment Period One/1 week Treatment Period Two. Safety variables spontaneously reported during whole study period</time_frame>
    <description>AE/SAE/ADE/SADE reporting/PRO variables. Assessed in patient questionnaire for each subject. A 5 graded scale will be used to determine the perception and the severity of each variable. The difference between the treatments will be calculated for each subject.</description>

    <measure>Tolerability with regards to presence of bleeding, when using two different urinary catheters; test vs control catheter</measure>

    <measure>Tolerability with regards to perceived &quot;other discomfort&quot;, when using two different urinary catheters; test vs. control catheter</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks in total. 1 week Treatment Period One/1 week Treatment Period Two. Safety variables spontaneously reported during whole study period</time_frame>
    <description>PRO variables. Frequency of &quot;other discomfort&quot; (yes/ no) will be assessed in patient questionnaire. The frequency of &quot;other discomfort&quot; will be compared between the treatments. &quot;Other discomfort&quot; will be further specified using 5 graded scale (as for the other variables on the 5 graded scale the difference between the treatments will be calculated for each subject).</description>

    <description>PRO variables. Assessed in patient questionnaire for each subject. A 5 graded scale will be used to determine the perception and the severity of each variable. The difference between the treatments will be calculated for each subject.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent.

          -  Males, aged 18 years and over.

          -  Maintained urethra sensibility as judged by the subject. (Can you feel the catheter
             during catheterization? Yes.).

          -  Practice CIC at least 2 times daily.

          -  Using catheters in the size CH 12 or CH 14, Nelaton tip, and able to use catheter
             length of 40 cm.

          -  Experienced users of CIC defined as a minimum of three months on therapy.

          -  Adults able to read, write and understand information given to them regarding the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing, symptomatic UTI at enrolment as judged by investigator. The definition of
             UTI, is a positive urine culture of ≥103 CFU/ml of ≥1 bacterial species and presence
             of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI with no other identified source of infection.

          -  Known urethral stricture which, in the opinion of the investigator, could influence
             the subject's evaluation of the catheters.

          -  Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both WHC staff and
             staff at the study site).

          -  Previous enrolment or randomisation of treatment in the present study.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical study that may impact the primary
             endpoint.

          -  Severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by the investigator
