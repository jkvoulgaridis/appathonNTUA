  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of natalizumab extended
      interval dosing (EID) in subjects who have previously been treated with natalizumab standard
      interval dosing (SID) for at least 12 months, in relation to continued SID treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate additional clinical and MRI based efficacy
      endpoints, disability worsening and safety of EID in subjects who have previously been
      treated with natalizumab SID for at least 12 months, in relation to continued SID treatment.

    <measure>Number of New or Newly Enlarging T2 Hyperintense Lesions at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions will be analysed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain. New MRI scans will be compared with the prior MRI scans to analyse the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Relapse as Adjudicated by an Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee (INEC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>A multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse will be defined as the onset of new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not associated with fever, infection, severe stress, or drug toxicity, lasting at least 24 hours, accompanied by new objective abnormalities on a neurological examination. Only relapses confirmed by an INEC will be included in the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 24, 48 and 72</time_frame>
    <description>Number of new Gd enhancing and new T1 hypointense lesions on brain will be analysed by MRI scans of brain. New MRI scans will be compared with the prior MRI scans to analyse number of new Gd enhancing and new T1 hypointense lesions.</description>

    <description>An MS relapse will be defined as the onset of new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not associated with fever, infection, severe stress, or drug toxicity, lasting at least 24 hours, accompanied by new objective abnormalities on a neurological examination. Only relapses confirmed by an INEC will be included in the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions will be analysed by MRI scans of brain. New MRI scans will be compared with the prior MRI scans to analyse the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is a life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in a significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly, is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Time to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Worsening as Confirmed After at Least 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24, 48, 72 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed EDSS worsening is defined as an increase of at least 1.0 point from a baseline EDSS score ≥ 1.0 or an increase of at least 1.5 points from a baseline EDSS score of 0 that is confirmed after at least 24 weeks.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability of the participant to understand the purpose and risks of the study and
             provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to use confidential health
             information in accordance with national and local participant privacy regulations.

          -  Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) according to the McDonald
             criteria [Thompson 2018].

          -  Treatment with natalizumab as disease-modifying monotherapy for RRMS that is
             consistent with the approved dosing for a minimum of 12 months prior to randomization.
             The participant must have received at least 11 doses of natalizumab in the 12 months
             prior to randomization with no missed doses in the 3 months prior to randomization.

          -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) &lt;=5.5 at screening.

          -  No relapses in the last 12 months prior to randomization, as determined by the
             enrolling Investigator.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).

          -  MRI positive for Gd-enhancing lesions at screening.

          -  Participants for whom MRI is contraindicated (e.g., have a contraindicated pacemaker
             or other contraindicated implanted metal device, have suffered, or are at risk for,
             side effects from Gd, or have claustrophobia that cannot be medically managed).

          -  History of any clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) cardiac,
             endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic (including diabetes),
             urologic, pulmonary, neurologic (except for RRMS), dermatologic, psychiatric, renal,
             or other major disease that would preclude participation in a clinical study, in the
             opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Presence of anti-natalizumab antibodies at screening. NOTE: Other protocol defined
             Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply
