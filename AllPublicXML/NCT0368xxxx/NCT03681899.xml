  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people frequently take several medications and are exposed to iatrogenic risks.

      The oral route is the preferred route of administration. The effectiveness and the safety of
      the drugs depend in particular on the modes of administration (frequency of the intake,
      respect of the doses and the galenic ...).

      However, these modalities are very little known concerning the treatments intake at home in
      the elderly population.

      In a health facility welcoming geriatric patients, the rupture of galenic is frequent and
      favored by swallowing disorders, dependence, the increase in age, the presence of cognitive
      disorders or psycho-behavioral disorders.

      The consequences of the rupture of galenic are numerous, concern the patients but also the
      caregivers who administer the treatments.

      Primary objective :

      - Estimate the rupture of galenic prevalence of at least one molecule in a population of
      subjects aged 65 years or over living at home and taking at least one oral drug for 2 weeks
      or more.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Identify the drug classes most frequently involved in the rupture of galenic in a
           population of subjects aged 65 years of age or over at home;

        -  Identify the actors of the drug administration in a population of subjects aged 65 years
           of or over at home;

        -  To determine the medical and sociodemographic factors associated with the rupture of
           galenic in a population of subjects aged 65 years or over at home;

        -  To determine the modalities of rupture of galenic in a population of subjects aged 65 or
           over at home.
