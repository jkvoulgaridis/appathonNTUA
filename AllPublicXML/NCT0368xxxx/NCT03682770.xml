      Primary objective is to assess whether dupilumab as adjunct to AR101 compared to placebo
      improves desensitization at the completion of up-dosing, defined as an increase in the
      proportion of participants who pass a post up-dosing double-blind placebo-controlled food
      challenge (DBPCFC) at visit 16.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess whether dupilumab as adjunct to AR101 compared to placebo improves
           desensitization at the completion of up-dosing, defined as an increase in the cumulative
           tolerated dose (log transformed) of peanut protein during a post up-dosing DBPCFC at
           visit 16

        -  To assess whether dupilumab as (indefinite [continuously]) adjunct to AR101 compared to
           placebo maintains desensitization, defined as an increase in the proportion of
           participants who pass a post maintenance DBPCFC at visit 22

        -  To assess whether dupilumab as (limited [previously]) adjunct to AR101 compared to
           placebo maintains desensitization, defined as an increase in the proportion of
           participants who pass a post maintenance DBPCFC at visit 22

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupilumab as adjunct to AR101 compared to
           placebo

        -  To assess the effect of dupilumab (compared to placebo) as adjunct to AR101 on the
           change in peanut-specific Immunoglobulin E (sIgE), Immunoglobulin G (IgG),
           Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), and peanut-specific IgG4/IgE ratio

        -  To assess if dupilumab increases the tolerability of AR101 as measured by the daily
           symptoms (electronic diary [e-diary]) during the up-dosing phase
