    <textblock>
      This study assessed the influence of a reduction of the palate extension of a custom-made
      mouthguard on the degree of satisfaction of elite water polo players. Eighteen water polo
      players wore a custom-made conventional mouthguard or a reduced palate extension mouthguard
      during the training sessions and for competing for two weeks. The sequence was randomized to
      obtain one-half of the participants started the first week wearing the conventional
      mouthguard, and the other half wearing the shortened mouthguard. The participants rated the
      degree of discomfort in reference to speech, breathing, swallowing, nauseas/vomiting,
      pressure/pain, loosening, aesthetics, and athletic performance, in a 10-point scale,
      considering 0 no discomfort and 10 maximum discomfort. After each session, players also rated
      the perception of protection and the degree of satisfaction in a 10-point scale, considering
      0 no protection/satisfaction and 10 maximum protection/satisfaction.

      This crossover intervention study aimed to assess the influence of a reduction of the palate
      extension of a custom-made mouthguard on the degree of satisfaction of elite water polo
      players. Eighteen water polo players participated in this study. Two different custom-made
      mouthguards were made, a conventional one and a reduced palate extension mouthguard. They
      wore them during the training sessions and for competing one type of mouthguard for the first
      and fourth week and the other type of mouthguard for the second and third week. The sequence
      was randomized to obtain one-half of the participants started the first week wearing the
      conventional mouthguard, and the other half wearing the shortened mouthguard. The
      participants rated the degree of discomfort or inconvenience in reference to speech,
      breathing, swallowing, nauseas/vomiting, pressure/pain, loosening, aesthetics, and athletic
      performance, in a 10-point scale, considering 0 no discomfort/inconvenience and 10 maximum
      discomfort/inconvenience. After each session, players also rated the perception of protection
      and the degree of satisfaction in a 10-point scale, considering 0 no protection/satisfaction
      and 10 maximum protection/satisfaction.
