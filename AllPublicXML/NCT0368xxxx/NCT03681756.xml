  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a health concern among Asians. Growing
      evidence indicates that Korean Americans had higher MetS prevalence compared to non-Hispanic
      Whites, but a culturally and linguistically appropriate lifestyle intervention has not been
      developed for Korean American middle-aged and older women. Thus, the investigators propose to
      develop a 4-week lifestyle intervention (Women's Active Living for Koreans (WALK) Study) to
      increase physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary behavior for Korean American women.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to develop a 4-week lifestyle intervention (Women's Active
      Living for Koreans (WALK) Study) to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary
      behavior for Korean American women. The investigators will assess feasibility and
      acceptability of the WALK Study and potential efficacy of the WALK Study on outcomes
      including sedentary behavior and PA.
