      Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the D1 receptor occupancy (D1 RO) in striatum after a single oral
           administration of PF-06412562

        -  To assess the relationship of D1 RO in the striatum versus plasma exposure of
           PF-06412562 after a single oral administration.

      Secondary Objective:

      • To evaluate the plasma exposure of PF-06412562for the duration of PET scan following a
      single oral administration of PF-06412562.

      Safety Objectives:

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06412562 of single oral doses of PF-06412562.

             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests, in the opinion of the
             investigator).

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          3. Male subjects must not donate sperm for the study duration.

          4. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory test and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hepatic, renal, cardiovascular,

             psychiatric, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated,
             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). This also includes subjects with
             previous history of epilepsy or seizures, clinically significant abnormal
             electroencephalogram (EEG), febrile convulsion, head injury with significant sequelae,
             psychiatric illness, attempted suicide or suicidal ideation.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5
             ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard
             liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the dose of study

          6. Screening supine blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of rest. If blood pressure (BP) is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic)
             or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of
             the three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          7. 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at screening. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the

         12. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Life Style Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

         13. Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry
             into this study.

         14. A lifetime history of seizure disorder of any etiology, inclusive of childhood
             seizures.

             assessment at screening. Abnormal values on Day 2 are left to the judgment of the
             investigator. Resting pulse rate &lt; 45 or &gt;100 bpm.
