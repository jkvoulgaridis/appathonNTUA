    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate if there is a better intervention for
      patients who present to the emergency department with an overdose or with symptoms consistent
      with drug use. There are currently two interventions that are routinely used when a patient
      comes to the Emergency Department with these criteria, and the investigators will compare the
      two. The first is when hospital social workers uses their own previous training to help
      people meet their goals. The second is when a person called a peer navigator, who is someone
      that has been in long-term drug recovery for over two years and has completed a lot of
      training to work with current drug users, delivers an intervention to current drug users and
      uses their own training and real- life experiences to help people meet their goals. The
      investigators hope to determine if patients have better outcomes if they work with one of
      these two groups.

      If a patient agrees to be in the study, the research staff will randomize them (like flipping
      a coin) to see if they will work with a social worker or a peer navigator. The research staff
      will distribute a survey in RedCap and the following information will be collected: age, sex,
      race, type of opioid used, and history of chronic pain, depression or post-traumatic stress
      disorder. Once the patient is assigned to a group, they will work with their assigned
      interventionist for the duration of the study. After this, the research team will track the
      patient to see if they joined an addiction-treatment program within 30 days of when the
      joined the study. The study team will also track patients to see if they had additional
      emergency department visits, additional overdoses, and if they successfully completed a
      treatment program over an 18-month period.

      650 patients will be enrolled into the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid overdoses are a leading cause of death for Americans under 50 years old, with recent
      years recording the most opioid overdose deaths on record. US Emergency Departments (EDs)
      have seen a parallel increase in opioid-related visits (a 100% increase from 2005 - 2014). ED
      patients presenting for an overdose are at greatly elevated risk for a repeat overdose and
      death. Thus, an overdose-related ED visit is both a critical and opportune time to prevent
      recurrent opioid overdose and overdose death through increased uptake in addiction treatment.
      The most effective means to promote engagement in treatment following an ED visit for opioid
      overdose remains unknown. To address this critical evidence gap, the investigators will
      compare the effectiveness of two ED-based behavioral interventions to increase treatment
      uptake and reduce the risk of future overdose among ED patients who are at greatest risk of
      accidental drug-related death.

      In response to RI's overdose crisis, in 2014, the state's largest ED (Rhode Island Hospital)
      began a proactive campaign to improve the care of overdose patients. The program includes an
      ED-based behavioral intervention either by in-house clinical social work staff or peer
      recovery support specialists (&quot;peer navigators&quot;). Following the introduction of these
      interventions in the ED, there was 10-fold increase in the proportion of patients engaging in
      addiction treatment within 30 days of the initial ED visit. While this preliminary data is
      promising, the effectiveness of the peer navigators versus the social work intervention is
      not known.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of early ED behavioral interventions
      following an opioid overdose. The investigators hypothesize that peer navigation will result
      in greater early treatment engagement and reduction in recurrent opioid overdose compared to
      a standard intervention delivered by a clinical social worker.

      The investigators will determine the effectiveness of peer navigation versus a standard
      behavioral intervention delivered in the ED to overdose patients and those at risk of
      recurrent opioid overdose. A total of 650 ED patients will be recruited (n=325 per arm) and
      followed for 18 months. Effectiveness will be measured objectively through linkage to
      administrative statewide databases, with two primary endpoints: (1) engagement in formal
      addiction treatment (e.g., inpatient services, outpatient services, medication assisted
      treatment (MAT)) from a licensed substance abuse treatment provider within 30 days following
      the ED visit, and (2) reduction in 18-month recurrent ED visits for an opioid overdose.
      Exploratory outcomes of interest are: overdose fatality, repeat ED visits related to opioids,
      and successful completion of an addiction treatment program and/or long-term retention in
      MAT.

      The investigators will explore if there is heterogeneity of treatment effect related to
      patient characteristics. The investigators anticipate that there will be individuals within
      each treatment arm who will vary in their response to the intervention. Specifically, the
      investigators will examine if the effects of the interventions are modified by baseline
      characteristics such as age, sex, race, type of opioid used, and history of comorbid chronic
      pain, depression or PTSD. Understanding these factors will allow us to further optimize
      subsequent interventions.

    <description>Engagement in addiction treatment will be defined as the proportion who are admitted to a formal addiction treatment program within thirty days following the initial ED visit. The research team will be using BHDDH and Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) records. The BHDDH database contains information on all admissions to publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs in the state. The RI PDMP manages a database that contains information on all prescriptions for schedule II-IV substances filled in the state. The database is updated daily; all pharmacies are required to report prescriptions within 48-hours of the fill date. All records will be linked deterministically to participant data using identifiable information (e.g., name, social security number) within the Stronghold computing environment, a HIPAA-compliant server maintained by the team at Brown University.</description>

    <description>The proportion of participants who are treated in any Rhode Island ED for an opioid overdose at any time during the 18-month follow-up period following the initial ED visit, will be assessed by first accessing the electronic medical records (EMRs) of the 12 EDs in Rhode Island (RI) through the Rhode Island Quality Institute Statewide Health Information Exchange. This unified data system provides access to EMR data from all major health systems in RI, capturing repeat visits for an opioid overdose that occur in all 12 EDs in RI. Secondly the research team will query the RI Department of Health (RIDOH) Opioid 48-Hour Overdose Surveillance System which mandates all suspected opioid overdose cases presenting to an RI hospital be reported to the department within 48 hours. This data source will capture recurrent overdoses not identified by ICD codes in the unified EMR data system, and also contains additional fields of interest (e.g., pre-existing risk factors for overdose).</description>
