  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of re-treatment using accelerated schedule of
      intermittent theta-burst stimulation for treatment-resistant depression. This is an open
      label study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technology as therapy
      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been very
      successful. The limitations of this approach include the duration of the treatment
      (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently, researchers have aggressively
      pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with some preliminary
      success. This study will investigate the efficacy of a further modified protocol, creating a
      more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in neuroimaging biomarkers. In
      particular, this study will determine the efficacy of re-treatment in individuals who have
      already experienced benefit of the accelerated protocol to ensure results can be repeated.

    <description>Participants will receive iTBS to the left DLPFC or bilateral DLPFC, to the right and left DLPFC. The DLPFC will be targeted utilizing either Localite's neuronavigation system or Nexstim's eField neuronavigation system. Stimulation intensity will be standardized at 90% of RMT and adjusted to the skull to cortical surface distance (see Nahas 2004).
Stimulation will be delivered to the L-DLPFC or bilateral DLPFC using either a MagVenture MagPro X100 or a Nexstim TMS device.</description>
