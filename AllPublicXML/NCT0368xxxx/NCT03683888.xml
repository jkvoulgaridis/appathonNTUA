  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of HealthSnap
      assessment, to reduce epicardial fat thickness. Excessive epicardial fat is associated with
      higher risk of developing diabetes and heart diseases. HealthSnap Assessment is a simple,
      quick and not invasive tool that will provide the patient with a personalized information
      nutritional and exercise plan.The use of HealthSnap in the clinical practice has not been
      evaluated, yet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the practicality of adding the HealthSnap algorithm to the standard
      care of patients with overweight/obesity and pre-diabetes.

      Participants will be recruited among the outpatient population who routinely refer to the
      Lennar Foundation Comprehensive Diabetes Center Outpatient Clinics, Division of
      Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism University of Miami, for standard care and management
      of diabetes, obesity, overweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia.

      Once patient eligibility and written consent are obtained, participant is then scheduled for
      the clinic visit through the University of Miami UChart (Epic) electronic system. The visits
      will be coordinated by the research coordinator. At each visit each patient will undergo:

        -  Full physical examination, body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, blood
           pressure (standard of care)

        -  Fasting blood glucose and haemoglobinA1c (HbA1c), lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic
           panel, fasting insulin, C-peptide and pro-insulin (all procedures are standard of care)

        -  Ultrasound assesment of epicardial fat, performed on site

        -  HealthSnap assessment performed on site (if randomized to the group receiving additional
           Healthnap)

        -  Standard of care dietary counselling performed on site by a registered dietitian (if
           randomized to the control group)

      Study patients and controls will be contacted by the dietitian and/or HealthSnap supervisor
      once a week via telephone, or email (Uchart) or via online session (collaborate Ultra) to
      monitor their compliance and adherence to the exercise and dietary program.
