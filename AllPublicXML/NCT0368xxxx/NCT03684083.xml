      Introduction. Chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is the main late noninfectious
      complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) that can affect
      several organs. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is recognized as pulmonary chronic
      GVHD. A diagnosis of a lower respiratory tract infection in the first 100 days following
      transplant has been associated to the development of BOS. One hypothesis is that the first
      stage driving to BOS is a previous aggression of bronchial epithelial cells by various
      factors such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thereafter, data suggest that viral
      infections, in particular Parainfluenza viruses could be a trigger for BOS. The alloimmune
      reaction activated by the respiratory virus could lead to the fibrosis process. Our
      hypothesis is that the bronchial epithelium of allogeneic HSCT recipients has phenotypic
      specificities that are associated with a specific response to the viral respiratory
      infections (in particular paramyxovirus) leading to the development of BOS.

      Main objective. To characterize and compare the inflammatory response after infection with
      Parainfluenza 3 virus in an ex-vivo model of bronchial epithelial cells obtained from
      allogeneic HSCT recipients and controls.

      Objective secondary. To characterize the phenotypic specificities of allogeneic HSCT
      recipients' bronchial epithelium.

      Methodology, and experimental plan. Prospective, monocentric research. Bronchial biopsies
      obtained from patients, will be completely differentiated after 21 days of culture.
      Epithelial cells will be infected by the virus strain Parainfluenza 3. Transcriptome of the
      cells from both allogeneic HSCT patients and controls, infected and non-infected will be
      analyzed 48 hours after infection.
