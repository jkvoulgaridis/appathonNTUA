  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma are often refractory to further
      chemotherapy. In this study, the investigators will attempt to use T cells obtained directly
      from the patient, which can be genetically engineered to express a fully human chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR used in this study can recognize CD19, a protein expressed on
      the surface of leukemia and lymphoma cells. The fully human CAR used in this study may help
      protect against rejection of the CAR T cells, which in turn could lead to lasting protection
      against return of the leukemia or lymphoma. The phase 1 part of this study will determine the
      safety of these CAR T cells, and the phase 2 part of the study will determine how effective
      this CAR T cell therapy is. Both patients who have never had prior CAR T cell therapy and
      those who have had prior CAR T cell therapy may be eligible to participate in this study.

             investigator, cannot be controlled during the interval between enrollment and CAR T
             cell infusion

          -  Presence of active GVHD, or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for treatment or
