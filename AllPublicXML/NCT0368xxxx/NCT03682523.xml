  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether an intervention aimed at reducing sedentary time in
      patients admitted to acute care will result in decreased frailty levels at hospital
      discharge, compared to the current standard of care. The first set of patients will be
      allocated to a control group and fitted with accelerometers. Otherwise, they will receive
      only standard of care while in hospital. After all participants in the control group have
      been discharged, enrollment for the intervention group will begin. Participants in the
      intervention group will be fitted with an accelerometer, engage in daily goal setting for
      time out-of-bed and have access to real-time feedback on a bedside monitor. Participants in
      the intervention group will also received assisted mobilization if they have not met their
      daily goal by the late afternoon. The main outcome is frailty, assessed by a frailty index.

      The objective of this study is to determine if an intervention designed to reduce sedentary
      time during a patient's stay in acute care will reduce patient's frailty levels more so than
      current standard of care. This study will use a single-center, quasi-experimental time series
      design, with a pre-intervention control group. Fifty participants will be recruited within 24
      hours of admission to a geriatric acute care unit. Both groups will be fitted with a device
      that measures sedentary and active time (accelerometer). Participants in the intervention
      group will have a daily goal for activity and will be provided with real-time feedback on
      attainment of that goal displayed on a bedside tablet. Participants in the intervention group
      who do not independently achieve their goal will be assisted in reducing their sedentary time
      in the afternoon and/or early evening to the maximum level of their ability; this level will
      be determined in consultation with the healthcare team. The primary outcome is a change in
      frailty during hospitalization, measured using a 30-item frailty index. The data collection
      phase is approximately 10 months. Data analysis will take an additional six months (16 months
      total). Knowledge-users will be involved during all stages of the project. The data generated
      from this study will enable us to scale up this intervention nationally and internationally.
      If the intervention is successful, it will warrant a study to implement the intervention as
      part of standard care. Ultimately, this study will inform guidelines to limit patients'
      sedentary behaviors in acute care.

    <measure>Change in the Frailty Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline frailty up to a median 14 day hospital length of stay</time_frame>
    <description>The frailty index (FI) operationalizes frailty in clinical practice and for research. FI scores are calculated as the proportion of potential deficits present in a given individual. For this study we will construct a 30-item FI using a health questionnaire administered to patients or their care partners (if patients are not able to self-report) at each study time point. The proportion of patients changing their FI scores by &gt;=0.1 from baseline to hospital discharge is the primary outcome.
Data collection is opportunistic, based on length of stay. The discharge date is not fixed - thus day-in-study at discharge will not be the same for all participants. Depending on length of stay, participants will provide data for additional time points between baseline and discharge, including week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4 and then in 30 day intervals. However, not every participant will have the same number of time points. Note that the median hospital length of stay is 14 days.</description>

    <description>The HABAM is a clinical tool used to obtain a global measure of a patients' health through the assessment of mobility, transfers and balance. Patients receive daily scores based on demonstrated ability in each focal area; testing if the patient can move around in bed, sit up in bed, stand up, etc. The median hospital length of stay is expected to be 14 days, but many patients will have a longer length of stay. This means that some patients will have more data collection time points than others.</description>

The research team will deliver an upright time goal and will target a 20% increase in upright time from the previous hospital day. Physiotherapist research assistants will visit the participants every afternoon to monitor progress and safely mobilize participants to their maximum ability if they have not met their daily goal (including weekend). The maximum level of ability will be determined in consultation with the healthcare team. Participants who do not meet their goal will be mobilized in the afternoon and early evening.</description>
