  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the clinical trial is to quantify the capacity of a translatable protocol of
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to improve walking performance and self-reported
      disabilities of persons with MS. The hypothesis is that activation of sensory nerve fibers
      with augmented TENS promotes recovery of sensorimotor function and improves the disability
      status of individuals with MS. The rationale for the proposed clinical trial is that the
      approach provides a low-cost therapeutic strategy for persons with MS to manage walking
      limitations and fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Randomization will be
      accomplished by recruiting two individuals with a similar level of disability at a time and
      flipping a coin (two persons present) to determine the group assignment (A or B) of the
      person who contacted the investigators first. The participants and outcome assessors will be
      blinded to group assignment. Both groups will receive the treatment (real or sham) during the
      first 4 weeks (3 sessions/week)and then there will be an 8-week follow-up period.
      Participants will be evaluated at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.
