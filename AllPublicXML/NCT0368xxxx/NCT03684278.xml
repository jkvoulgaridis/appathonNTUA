  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of infliximab in the treatment of acute
      pancreatitis in adults. A third of participants will receive one single dose of infliximab
      via infusion, another third will receive a higher dose of infliximab via infusion and the
      final third of participants will receive a placebo infusion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas causing excruciating
      pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction and pronounced systemic inflammatory responses with
      circulatory and respiratory disturbances that can lead to organ failure and death.

      Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) has a major role in the pathogenesis and severity of
      acute pancreatitis. TNFα levels rise early and remain elevated for days in human AP,
      proportional to severity, presenting a suitable drug target to inhibit the amplified immune
      responses that further damage the pancreas and drive widespread organ dysfunction.

      Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody biologic drug that blocks the actions of tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and is normally used to treat autoimmune diseases. Infliximab
      has been selected as it is given via intravenous infusion, which will ensure rapid
      bioavailability to treat AP. This is different from most other biologics, which are given
      subcutaneously.

      This trial will determine the efficacy of early initiation of anti-TNF treatment in AP,
      setting new standards for trials in AP. Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      adaptive design, with two doses of a single intravenous infusion of infliximab at 5 mg/kg or
      10 mg/kg, the trial will determine size of any effect and safety of this treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>RAPID-I is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre, three-arm, phase IIb efficacy trial of infliximab in patients with AP. Patients will be randomised (1:1:1 allocation ratio) to receive an intravenous infusion of either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infliximab or placebo, initiated within 12 hours of admission to the Accident and Emergency Medicine Department. Treatment allocation will only be revealed to Pharmacy to ensure the research team administering the treatment remains blinded.</intervention_model_description>
