  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the clinical activity of nivolumab in combination with the
      investigational agent sitravatinib in patients with locally-advanced clear cell renal cell
      carcinoma (ccRCC) in the pre-surgical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sitravatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets multiple closely
      related receptor tyrosine kinase pathways including VEGFR, PDGF receptor (PDGFR), c-KIT, MET,
      and the TAM family of receptors (TYRO3, AXL, and MER). Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody
      directed against PD-1 and blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, thereby
      releasing PD-1-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation (including cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells)
      and cytokine production. Together, sitravatinib and nivolumab may cooperate to elicit greater
      anti-tumor activity than either agent alone, as sitravatinib is predicted to enhance several
      steps in the cancer immunity cycle that may augment the efficacy of nivolumab.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Imaging results consistent with locally-advanced RCC

          2. Candidate for partial or complete nephrectomy as part of treatment plan.

          3. Measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1.

          4. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          5. Adequate bone marrow and organ function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior systemic anti-tumor treatment for RCC.

          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Clinical status indicating that immediate surgery (within 6 weeks) is warranted
             regardless of whether neoadjuvant therapy is to be administered, as assessed by the
             treating surgeon.

          4. Inability to undergo baseline tumor biopsy.

          5. Active or prior documented autoimmune or immunocompromising conditions.

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension.
