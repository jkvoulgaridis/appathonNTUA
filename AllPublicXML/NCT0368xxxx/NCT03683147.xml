    <textblock>
      This randomized trial studies how well a mindfulness-based stress reduction program helps
      participants with breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. A cancer
      diagnosis is a life-changing and highly stressful event for most people, often resulting in
      marked declines in quality of life both during and after treatment. There are approximately 3
      million women living with a history of invasive breast cancer in the U.S., with at least
      150,000 living with metastatic disease. Patient preferences suggest a high need for
      complementary and alternative medicine interventions to address these chronic symptoms.
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may help women living with metastatic breast
      cancer manage symptoms related to cancer treatment and improve quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a novel online mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) treatment for
      distressed metastatic breast cancer patients in the hope of reaching patients otherwise
      unable to participate in traditional interventions due to high symptom burden.

      II. Determine the impact of the intervention on both patient self-report and biological
      symptom measures.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      INTERVENTION ARM: Participants receive online group sessions over 60 minutes for 6 weeks,
      including 15 minutes of practice on that session's topic and daily meditation or yoga for 45
      minutes. At the conclusion of the study period participants participate in mindfulness
      meditation over 3 hours. Participants also receive a content manual and relaxation compact
      disc (CD).

      CONTROL ARM: Participants randomized to the wait-list control condition complete the online
      intervention as in the intervention arm after the initial 6-week period has ended.
