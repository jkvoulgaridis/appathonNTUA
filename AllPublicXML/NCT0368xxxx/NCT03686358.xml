  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interest of renal angioplasty in the nosological framework of atherosclerotic stenosis
      has been significantly challenged by STAR and ASTRAL clinical trials in 2009, confirmed by
      the CORAL study in 2014.

      These studies did not show any benefit of the gesture on renal function, morbidity and
      cardiovascular mortality or the tension control. The aim of the study is to evaluate renal
      angioplasty on atherosclerotic stenosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies did not concern the indication of renal angioplasty in some high-risk
      situations, such as malignant or resistant renal vascular hypertension, OAP (Acute pulmonary
      oedema) flash or acute renal failure of ischemic origin.

      There is no work in the literature that has studied retrospectively the evolution of
      angioplasty practices renal artery disease on atherosclerotic stenosis since 2009, nor their
      remote results of the gesture.
