  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design is a perspective, multi-center, historial control study of acute ischemic stroke
      patients. For achieving the target of diagnosis and treatment KPI (Key performance indicator)
      of AIS patients and improving the defects of the traditional working mode, our center
      developed the medical records data acquisition and KPI statistics system based on computer
      scan. This method guarantee the authenticity of the data, It computes the KPI of the
      corresponding medical institutions in the corresponding period and gives feedback on a
      regular basis. This study aims to explore whether this new working mode can continuously
      improve the overall KPI of all hospitals in Zhejiang province, and thus reflect the
      improvement of quality and standardization of medical service in AIS patients.
