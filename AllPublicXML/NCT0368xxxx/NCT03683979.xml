  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties with anger control are reported in a number of psychological conditions and are
      associated with social problems, such as dating violence and workplace violence. High trait
      anger is a personality construct characterized by elevations in the frequency, duration, and
      intensity of anger episodes. However, the cognitive processes contributing to high trait
      anger are still poorly understood. This study will examine the effectiveness of a
      computer-based cognitive bias modification (CBM) program designed to target hostile
      interpretations associated with high trait anger.

    <textblock>
      High trait anger is a personality construct characterized by elevations in the frequency,
      duration, and intensity of anger episodes. According to the Integrative Cognitive Model (ICM)
      of anger, three cognitive processes jointly contribute to an individual's level of trait
      anger and reactive aggression: hostile attributions, ruminative attention, and effortful
      control processes. Specifically, individuals high in trait anger are more prone to interpret
      ambiguous situations as hostile; are more likely to ruminate about anger-related events; and
      have a more limited capacity to employ control processes when they become angry.

      One means of evaluating unconscious biases that has become increasingly popular is cognitive
      bias modification (CBM). CBM programs are computerized training paradigms, which aim to train
      more adaptive cognitive biases by repeatedly exposing participants to an experimental
      contingency between an emotional stimulus and a response.Previous researchers have begun to
      investigate the impact of CBMs targeting cognitive control and hostile attribution bias in
      relation to anger. However, these studies have been conducted exclusively in samples
      reporting low trait anger.

      This study will examine the effectiveness of a short-term interpretation bias modification
      program (CBM-I) on hostile attribution biases and reactive aggression in a sample of
      undergraduate students eporting high trait anger.

    <time_frame>Administered two times over the course of one week. Changes will be examined from visit 1 (before CBM training program) to visit 2 (after CBM training program).</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of the degree to individuals focus on experiences with anger. The scale is comprised of four subscales, angry after thoughts (e.g., &quot;Whenever I experience anger, I keep thinking about it for a while&quot;), angry memories (e.g., &quot;I re-enact the anger episode in my mind after it has happened&quot;), understanding causes (e.g., &quot;When someone provokes me, I keep wondering why this should have happened to me&quot;), and thoughts of revenge (e.g. &quot;I have difficulty forgiving people who have hurt me.&quot;). Participants will be asked to read each item and rate it in terms of how well it reflects their experience on a 4-point scale from 1 (&quot;almost never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;almost always&quot;). Totals for each sub scale will be summed to produce a total score (range: 19-76), with higher scores indicating a greater propensity for rumination.</description>
