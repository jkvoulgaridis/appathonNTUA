    <textblock>
      Evaluation of safety, tolerability and superiority of RK-01, a valsartan plus celecoxib dual
      add-on to metformin-HCL XR over metformin in newly diagnosed and obese adult type 2 diabetes
      patients with high blood pressure, arthritis and inadequate glycemic control with metformin
      monotherapy, diet and exercise over 26 weeks of treatment.

      Objective: To assess effect of RK-01 on HbA1c levels, beta cell function and insulin
      resistance with co-administration of valsartan, celecoxib and metformin-HCl XR relative to
      metformin monotherapy.

      Hypothesis: After 26 weeks of treatment with valsartan, celecoxib and metformin-HCl XR
      provides greater improvements in glycemic, inflammatory and atherogenic parameters compared
      to metformin monotherapy.

      PRIMARY:

      In patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy:

      Objective: To assess effect of RK-01 on HbA1c levels, beta cell function and insulin
      resistance with co-administration of valsartan, celecoxib and metformin-HCl XR relative to
      metformin monotherapy. Improvements in glycemic, inflammatory and atherogenic parameters
      including beta cell function relative to adult healthy volunteers with normal glucose
      tolerance (NGT) treated with placebo for 26 weeks will also be assessed. An interim study
      assessment will also be performed after 12 weeks of treatment.

      Hypothesis: After 26 weeks of treatment with valsartan, celecoxib and metformin-HCl XR
      provides greater improvements in glycemic, inflammatory and atherogenic parameters compared
      to metformin monotherapy.

             protein (IA-2 and IA-2 beta), zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8), islet cell antibodies (ICA)
             or insulin autoantibody (IAA) will also be considered.
