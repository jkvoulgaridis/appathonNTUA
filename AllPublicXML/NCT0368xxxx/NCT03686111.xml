  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nuclear lamina (LN) consists of a network of proteins interposed between the chromatin
      and the internal nucleic membrane, to which it is closely associated. LN consists essentially
      of lamins encoded by the LMNA (Lamines A / C), LMNB1 and LMNB2 genes (BI, B2, B3 lamins).
      Malfunctions of the A / C-type laminates causing the production of a toxic isoform called
      progerin are directly responsible for various serious pathologies such as Progeria
      Hutchingson-Gilford. This rare disease is characterized by accelerated pathological aging.
      Moreover, it is known that progerin is produced in the absence of any mutation of the gene
      LMNA is involved in the physiological aging of tissus.

      The ovarian reserve of a woman is a parameter that changes with age. Although this
      progressive loss is inevitable in the course of life, the kinetics of this ovarian exhaustion
      appear variable according to the women, sometimes leading to an accelerated loss causing a
      discordance between the female age and the ovarian age. But ovarian age becomes a major
      prognostic parameter to be taken into account during any attempt at medical assistance to
      procreation (AMP) and is often incriminated in the failures of MPAs. There are currently few
      markers to predict the quality of ovarian response of women to ovarian stimulation, let alone
      the quality of the oocytes retrieved. However, their quality directly influences their
      ability to give an evolving embryo and therefore a pregnancy Our team has previously shown
      that type B laminates are involved in human spermiogenesis, and highlighted the human B3
      isoform. These very encouraging results obtained on human spermatogenesis, have prompted us
      to also look at the potential interest of the exploration of the nuclear lamina within the
      human ovary.

      The aim of this project is therefore to continue the exploration of the nuclear lamina and
      its potential role on the quality of human gametes, by studying the follicular ovarian cells
      surrounding the oocyte. These cells express A / C type lamins and sometime progerin
      Investigators want to conduct a prospective pilot study in a cohort of 40 women in MPA, aged
      between 20 and 42 years. The main objective is to compare the levels of expression of the A /
      C, B and progerin laminae in the follicular cells of 2 groups of women: a group of infertile
      patients managed to induce ovulation in order to Intraconjugal AMP and a group of women
      managed to induce ovulation to give their oocytes. For this purpose, investigators will
      analyze the expression of the A / C and B lamins in RT-PCR, the localization of the lamins
      and progerin in immunofluorescence, and will look for quantitative variations in the
      production of A / C and / or progerin lamins by western- blot, depending on the age of the
      patients.

      This pilot study will allow investigators to characterize for the first time the LN of human
      follicular cells. They should highlight variations in the expression and / or localization of
      lamins and possibly progerin in patients tested according to their age and / or ovarian
      reserve. The team preliminary results showed that this track deserves to be explored. This is
      an excellent opportunity to bring new insights into the understanding of the mechanisms
      responsible for alteration of ovarian reserve in women and the prognosis of MPA attempts.

      Finally, this approach could serve as a basis for a larger, multicenter study. These markers
      could represent new diagnostic markers to be taken into account to evaluate the chances of
      pregnancy of each woman in AMP.
