  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A monitoring system was developed for detecting upper gastrointestinal (UGI) rebleeding. This
      system consists of (1) a tiny endoscopy, (2) a wearable device, and (3) a software. The
      endoscopy is inserted to UGI tract via nasal cavity and then stayed there for 3 days. The
      wearable device is set to regularly receive the pictures from the endoscopy and sent to the
      software, which is able to automatically analyze whether the rebleeding occurs. This study
      aims to test the feasibility and efficacy of the monitoring system.

    <measure>Time to detection of upper gastrointestinal rebleeding between the upper gastrointestinal monitoring system vs. the current monitoring index.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The real-time upper gastrointestinal monitoring system is compared with the current monitoring index. The efficacy is estimated by which monitoring method finding the upper gastrointestinal rebleeding first.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The accuracy of upper gastrointestinal rebleeding detection between the upper gastrointestinal monitoring system vs. the current monitoring index.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of the current monitoring index and the real-time upper gastrointestinal monitoring system is compared. The accuracy is estimated by calculating the ratio of the number of making false alarm and the number of finding re-bleeding right.</description>
