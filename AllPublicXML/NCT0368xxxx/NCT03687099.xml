  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in neurosurgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival in GBM
      patients is only 15 months from diagnosis. Immunotherapy by checkpoint inhibitors (PD1
      /PDL-1) appears as a promising treatment for many cancers. However, first clinical results
      are disappointing for GBM. An hypothesis is the immunosuppressive activity from infiltrating
      non-tumor cells. Conversion of non-tumor cells from an immunosuppressive to an
      immuno-activating phenotype could be attempted in a therapeutic perspective.

    <textblock>
      An important and constant infiltration of cells marked with CD45 has been observed in 77 GBM
      studied for the prognostic value of PDL1 and IL17 infiltration (in association with Pr
      Ghiringhelli ; INSERM ; Dijon) . However, CD45 is present at the surface of all leucocytes.
      The purpose of this project is to better characterize the nature and functionality of the
      CD45+ cells that infiltrate GBM (lymphocytes and their sub-types, macrophages, microglial
      cells). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded GBM samples will be studied. A panel of immune cell
      antibody will be used for the immuno-histological (IH) study. Furthermore, the investigator
      will compare these data with those obtained by the nanoString technology, a multiplexed
      measurement of gene expression.

             laboratory of the University Hospital of Amiens-Picardie.

          -  Histologic diagnosis of a glioblastoma according to the WHO classification of central
             nervous system
