      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of
      10-nitro-9(E)-octadec-9-enoic acid (CXA-10) in obese adult asthmatics. The study's hypothesis
      is that 150 mg/day of CXA-10 for 12 weeks will alleviate obesity-related airway
      hyper-reactivity in obese adult asthmatics.
