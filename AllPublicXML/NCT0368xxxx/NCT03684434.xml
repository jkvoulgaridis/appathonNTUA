  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression are prevalent and disabling conditions. Although cognitive behaviour
      therapy (CBT) has been shown to significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression,
      access to the service is limited. Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT)
      represents a novel approach to overcoming access barriers and involves delivering therapeutic
      content to manage symptoms via structured online lessons. The Online Therapy Unit has been
      studying the efficacy of ICBT for anxiety and depression and found that ~75% of clients
      complete treatment and demonstrate large improvement in symptoms. However, recent research
      suggests that younger clients and clients with higher baseline distress are more likely to
      dropout of ICBT. While it remains unclear why these clients are more susceptible to
      attrition, it is plausible that they are experiencing a greater degree ambivalence to change
      and, thus, terminate treatment as a result. Motivational interviewing (MI) aims to help
      facilitate clients' intrinsic motivation to change by resolving ambivalence. MI has been
      integrated into CBT for anxiety to overcome similar concerns of poor treatment retention.
      Evidence suggests that the integration of MI and CBT further enhances response and completion
      rates. In the context of online therapy, however, the efficacy of MI remains unclear. In the
      current trial, the investigators aimed to assess a recently developed online MI pre-treatment
      (i.e., the Planning for Change lesson). A total of 480 clients (original aim for sample size
      was 300) applying to transdiagnostic ICBT in routine care were randomly assigned to receive
      the MI pre-treatment or no pre-treatment (i.e., a waiting period) prior to participating in
      ICBT (i.e., the Wellbeing Course). The investigators sought to examine: how ICBT with MI
      compared to standardized ICBT in terms of symptom change, rates of reliable improvement,
      intervention usage (e.g., number of lessons completed), frequency of motivational language in
      the first two emails to therapist, and motivation levels. It was hypothesized that there
      would be a small but significant effect of MI on these variables. Additionally, the
      investigators aimed to explore if age and severity of baseline distress moderate the effect
      between MI and ICBT outcomes. Younger clients and clients with higher baseline distress are
      more likely to drop out of ICBT and, thus, it was further hypothesized that online MI will
      have a greater impact on these groups.

    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 10, 13, 25, and 53 **Not used as a secondary measure anymore because SPS was mistakenly not administered at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Social Phobia Scale - 6 Item: Items are summed into a total score. Total scores range between 0 and 24, with higher scores representing more severe self-reported symptoms of social phobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 10, 13, 25, and 53 **Not used as a secondary measure anymore because EQ-5D-5L was mistakenly not administered at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by EQ-5D-5L: Items are summed into six sub-total scores. The first five sub-total scores respectively assess various domains of quality of life (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each of the five sub-total scores range between 1 and 5, with higher scores representing greater self-reported severity and impairment in these various domains. The last sub-total score provides an overall index of health and can range between 0 and 100, with higher scores representing better self-reported health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 2, 10, 13, 25, and 53 **K10 outcomes were only collected for half the sample during baseline due to the measure accidentally not being included at the start of recruitment. As such, distress was measured using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 instead.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale: Items are summed into a total score. Total scores range between 0 and 50, with higher scores representing more severe self-report psychological distress.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 13, 25, and 53</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Modified Brief Life Events Checklist: The Modified Brief Life Events Checklist consists of two sections. The first section assesses for exposure to a traumatic event using a checklist question. If the client endorses exposure to a traumatic event, they are provided the second section, which assesses severity of trauma symptoms. Items are summed into a total score, which can range between 0 and 80. Higher scores represent more severe self-reported symptoms of trauma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in treatment costs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 13, 25, and 53 **Only used to assess for group differences at baseline**</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Treatment Inventory of Costs in Psychiatric Patients (TIC-P) Adapted for Canada: A series of yes and no, rating, and frequency questions that are designed to ascertain the volume of medical consumption and productivity losses associated with mental health problems. Questions are independently analyzed and, therefore, the TIP-C does not include a total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in treatment credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Treatment Credibility Questionnaire: Items are summed into a total score. Total scores range between 3 and 27, with higher scores representing greater perceptions of ICBT credibility.</description>

    <description>Measured by Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form: Scores are summed into three sub-total scores, which respectively assess various domains of the therapeutic relationship (i.e., goal, task, and bond). Sub-total scores each range between 5 and 20, with higher scores representing better therapeutic relationship in each of the three domains assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Wellbeing Program assessed by the Internet-CBT Treatment Satisfaction Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Internet-CBT Treatment Satisfaction Measure: A series of yes and no, rating, and open-ended questions developed by the investigators' collaborators. These questions are designed to ascertain clients' satisfaction with the Wellbeing Course and include questions, for example, that pertain to the likelihood of recommending the Wellbeing Course to a friend and whether they learned useful information throughout the course. Questions are designed to provide both quantitative and qualitative information, and do not include a total score.</description>
