  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV) is part of routine care.

      Weaning phase is a daily preoccupation for the caregivers. Prolonged MV can lead to many
      complications. Failing the weaning phase expose the patient to the need for reintubation,
      that improves the mortality.

      The caregiver faces a major problem, in one hand the need to wean properly and quickly and on
      the other the risk of reintubation.

      In order to help the clinician making the good choice, the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)
      is a key tool. The international literature provides the investigators many ways to perform
      the SBT. The most common is the T-piece; the patient is disconnected from the ventilator and
      connected to a T-piece that can provide supplemental oxygen. Another one is the Support
      pressure trial, the patient is still connected to the ventilator, but the setups are changed
      to recreate the T-piece conditions.

      In many French ICU's, the SBT is performed by using a heat humidifier filter that is directly
      connected to the endotracheal tube, this filter allows the clinician to provide supplemental
      oxygen in accordance with the patient need.

      In high risk for reintubation patients, the SBT can create physical stress, that lead to
      prolonged MV.

      In our ICU, for those patients, the investigators perform the SBT by connecting the patient
      to a device that provides high flow oxygen trough endotracheal connector for tracheotomy.

      The investigators hypothesis that high flow oxygen SBT, will allow the high risk for
      reintubation patients to succeed the SBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators proposed to compare 2 strategies for SBT in high risk for reintubation
      patients:

        1. Classic SBT (C-SBT)

        2. High Flow Oxygen SBT (HFO-SBT)

      This prospective randomized study had 2 conjoint primary outcome:

        1. The HFO-SBT shows a better actuarial rate for extubation at day 7 from the begin of the
           weaning phase

        2. Compare the reintubation rate at D7 from the extubation
