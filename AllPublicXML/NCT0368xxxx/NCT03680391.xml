      7. Study Methods

      Population of study &amp; disease condition :

      Two hundred women were recruited, with 103 randomized to traditional feeding and 97 to early
      feeding and compare women satisfaction during discharge from hospital.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Maternal age from 20 to 40

        -  Primigravida and previous one or two cesarean section

        -  Elective cesarean section

        -  regional anesthesia .singleton pregnancy.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  age below 20 years old or above 40 years old

        -  medical disorders as (hypertension, diabetes , liver or kidney diseases)

        -  complication during surgery as( bleeding, intestinal injury or urinary bladder injury )
           .Emergency cesarean section .

        -  general anesthesia

        -  multiple pregnancy

      Methodology in details:

        1. all Women included in the study have undergo history taking and general examination

        2. All patient in the study are randomized in two groups:

      Group A:

      103 patients will have early postoperative oral fluids and semisolid food after 6 hours of
      cesarean section irrespective to intestinal sounds ,flatus or stool passage

      Group B:

      97 patient will start oral fluids 6 hours with no solid or semi solid until after passage of
      flatus or stool 3_Both groups cesarean section will be held with the same technique:

        -  spinal anethesia

        -  pfennenstiel imcision

        -  lower segment cesarean section

        -  suturing uterus in two layers while exterionezed

        -  gentle manibulation

        -  no towels in gutters will be used 4_ comparison will be held between both groups
           according:

        -  postoperative intestinal sounds.

        -  postoperative nausea and vomiting

        -  postoprative abdominal distension

        -  postoperative pain

        -  postoperative ambulation
