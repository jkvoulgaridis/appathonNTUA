  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic, debilitating condition, is a growing public
      health concern as the Canadian population has the highest PTSD prevalence worldwide (9.2%;
      3.7 million people). PTSD is linked with other comorbid mental health disorders (e.g.,
      depression) and increased risk of chronic disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity)
      which presents challenges as far as selection of the appropriate treatment approach.
      Adjunctive treatment approaches for PTSD that include somatic-sensory body awareness (e.g.,
      mindfulness, yoga) have been shown to be viable treatment options to reduce stress-related
      symptoms and enhance emotion regulation. Online treatment delivery for mental health
      disorders demonstrate similar reductions in self-reported symptoms as face-to-face methods
      and emphasize accessibility, reduced costs, and enhanced appeal to certain demographic
      groups. A target population at risk of untreated PTSD symptoms that may benefit from an
      online treatment is young adults, 18-34 yrs., who have experienced childhood trauma. No known
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) has addressed the effectiveness of a brief (8-week) online
      trauma-informed yoga intervention using both self-report and objective measures. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the within- and between-group changes in self-reported PTSD
      symptoms and objectively measured biomarkers of autonomic regulation via pupil dilation and
      heart-rate-variability (HRV) following an 8-week prospective RCT design. It is hypothesized
      that clinically significant reductions of: 1) PTSD total symptom severity by 10% and 2) pupil
      dilation and; 3) increased HRV in the intervention group compared to non-significant findings
      in the wait-list controls. This is the first study to examine objective markers of autonomic
      regulation among an at-risk population using multiple novel technologies (e.g., Eye Tracking
      Glasses, HRV) and comparing two theoretically-linked measures (e.g., HRV, Pupillometry).

    <measure>Change in Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms on the Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 30-item structured in-person interview with a trained clinician to confirm a current diagnosis of PTSD and associated symptoms based on a single index traumatic event (e.g., most recent, most severe). A single severity/distress score is calculated based on the frequency and intensity of a symptom using a 5-point scale (0 = absent/ no symptom; 1 = Mild/Symptom minimal; 2 = Moderate/Symptom Clearly Present; 3 = Severe/Symptom Pronounced; 4 = Extreme/Symptom is extreme/incapacitating). For a clinically significant symptom to be deemed present, a minimum frequency of twice per month or &quot;some of the time&quot; (approximately 20-30%) plus a minimum intensity of &quot;clearly present&quot; must be reported. Scores range from 0 to 80.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a 5-minute neutral stimulus, 5-minute emotional stimulus task, and 10-minute guided meditation protocol. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be collected using a 4-channel data acquisition system, which uses 2 adhesive electrodes applied to the chest and a ground electrode on the ankle. Frequency-based metrics represent respiratory-based modulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The primary three spectral components for ECG recordings are very low frequency (VLF; 0.003-0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz). Greater power in the HF band is considered to reflect respiratory sinus arrhythmia as it reflects HR variation attributed to parasympathetic (vagal) tone. Additionally, a ratio of LF to HF power will provide a marker of ANS regulation in all participants. A higher LF-HF ratio indicates &quot;sympathetic dominance&quot;, whereas values closer to 0 reflect ANS balance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pupil Diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear specialised eye tracking glasses to obtain pupil dilation recordings. Accordingly, participants will be presented with a plain, neutral stimulus and asked to focus their eyes on a fixation cross on the computer. Baseline (BL) pupil diameter will be captured in the 500ms directly preceding the emotional stimulus. Participants will undergo an emotional stimulus (ES) task viewing standardized emotional images (e.g., happy, sad) on a computer screen followed by a guided 10-minute meditation (GM) phase. Average peak stimulus pupil dilation will be calculated during each phase (BL, ES, GM). Increased pupil dilation reflects sympathetic nervous system dominance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Respiration Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a 5-minute neutral stimulus, 5-minute emotional stimulus task, and 10-minute guided meditation protocol. A respiratory belt transducer will be worn around the abdomen at the same time heart rate and pupil diameter are being measured. The respiratory belt transducer is measures changes in chest diameter resulting from breathing by producing a linear voltage proportional to changes in length and connects directly to a Pod (DIN) Port on the electrocardiogram machine. Breaths will be measured and recorded as the number of breaths per minute.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses eight subscales: physical function, social function, role limitations due to physical limitations, role limitations due to social/emotional problems, bodily pain, vitality, mental health perception, and general health perception. A single-item measure of comparative health is also included. A composite physical and mental health summary score are calculated using algorithms recommended by the developers. Response scales are based on five-level responses (e.g., 0 = poor; 4 = excellent) with the exception of item 3 (limitations to physical function) which is scored based on a three-level response (e.g., 0 = no, not limited at all; 3 = yes, limited a lot). The total score in each SF-36 subscale ranges between 0 and 100 with larger scores indicating a higher/better health-related quality of life</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Civilian Version (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a standardised 20-item self-report scale for PTSD symptoms. Participants indicate how much they have been bothered by a symptom item listed over the past month using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = Not at all to 4 = Extremely. The PCL-5 is easily scored by summing all of the items for a total symptom severity score ranging between 0 to 80. Clinically meaningful PTSD symptoms are present if items are rated as a minimum of 2 = &quot;Moderately&quot; or higher.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a 21-item self-report inventory to assess symptoms of anxiety within the last two weeks. Respondents rate how much each of the 21 symptoms bothered them in the past month on a four-point ordinal Likert scale from 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 = &quot;severely, it bothered me a lot&quot;. Scoring for the BAI ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 63 based on summing the scores for all items. The following empirically supported cutoffs are followed for the interpretation of scores: 0-9 = normal/no anxiety, 10-18 = mild to moderate anxiety, 19-29 = moderate to severe anxiety, 30-63 = severe anxiety.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Index-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms will be assessed using the BDI-II, a 21-item self-report survey. The BDI-II evaluates symptoms and attitudes related to depression using a four-level weighted Likert response scale ranging from 0 = not present to 3= severe. The participant is instructed to respond to items pertaining to how they were feeling in the past two weeks. Scoring for the BDI-II ranges from 0 to a maximum score of 63; empirically informed cutoff scores for severity of depression include the following: 0-13 = minimal, 14-19 = mild, 20-28 = moderate, 29-63 = severe.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily Mindfulness will be measured using the 39-item FFMQ. The FFMQ assesses changes in mindfulness tendencies (e.g., non-judgement of inner experience) before and after a mindfulness-based intervention. The FFMQ measures five mindfulness-based factors including non-reactivity, observing, describing, non-judgement, and acting with awareness. Item scores range on a five-level Likert scale of 1 = never or rarely true to 5 = very often or always true. The FFMQ is scored by summing all item responses and total scores range from 0 to 195, with higher scores indicating greater levels of mindfulness.</description>

    <description>Online video instruction of yoga postures combined with breath awareness and meditation form the foundation of the intervention. The trauma-informed component of the program uses specific language, movement cues, teacher qualities, and physical assists. The yoga intervention will emphasize full choice and control of the participant through invitational language such as, &quot;when you are ready&quot;, &quot;if you like&quot; before each body posture cue. Based on trauma-informed yoga best practices, a predictable foundation of yoga postures (with variations) will be followed in a consistent order each session to allow participants to anchor to the series.</description>
