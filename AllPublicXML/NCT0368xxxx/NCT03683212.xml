  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicentre (N=15), stepped-wedge randomized trial that aims to
      evaluate the benefit of a protocolised comprehensive care bundle for early management of
      acute heart failure in the ED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the most common diagnoses for elderly patients in the
      emergency department (ED), with an admission rate higher than 80% and 1-month mortality
      around 10%. There is scarce evidence of any clinical added value of a specific treatment to
      improve outcomes, and European guidelines for the management of AHF are based on moderate
      levels of evidence, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials. Recent reports suggest
      that the very early administration of full recommended therapy may decrease mortality.
      However, several studies highlighted that elderly patients often received suboptimal
      treatment: For example, less than a third of them received nitrates therapy while it is
      recommended. Furthermore, a recent preliminary study reported that only 50% of them are
      assessed for precipitating factors - although it has been reported that precipitating factors
      are independently associated with mortality.

      The hypothesis of the Elisabeth Study s is that an early care bundle that comprises early and
      comprehensive management of symptoms, along with prompt detection and treatment of
      precipitating factors should improve AHF outcome in elderly patients.
