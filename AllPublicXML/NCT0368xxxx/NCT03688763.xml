  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a multiple baseline design pilot study which seeks to evaluate the
      impact of digitally administered CBT-I, using the Sleepio platform, for the treatment of
      insomnia disorder among Veterans with co-morbid psychopathology. In addition, information
      related to acceptability and feasibility of the intervention among a Veteran sample will be
      obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the front-line intervention
      for individuals with insomnia and has recently been rolled-out throughout the Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA; Manber et al., 2012). CBT-I includes behavioral (sleep restriction,
      stimulus control, relaxation exercises), cognitive (cognitive restructuring, mindfulness
      exercise), and psychoeducation (sleep hygiene) components. While CBT-I has been demonstrated
      to be a highly efficacious and effective intervention, it is a specialized intervention that
      can be costly and is in limited supply based on the level of training required and number of
      providers available. For this reason, digital administration of CBT-I has been examined and
      research has demonstrated initial efficacy among community samples (Ritterband et al., 2009;
      Vincent et al., 2009; Espie et al., 2012), with one platform, Sleepio, demonstrating efficacy
      compared to a placebo intervention (Espie et al., 2012; Espie et al., 2014). For this reason,
      the current study will utilize the Sleepio platform which provides an interactive, customized
      and tailored delivery of CBT-I.

    <measure>Changes in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks (baseline), 12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase), and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is used to assess self-reported insomnia severity (Bastien et al., 2001). It is a 7-item self-report scale assessing sleep problem severity over the last two weeks, rated on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4; a higher score indicates higher severity. The ISI sums scores on the 7 items (1a, 1b, 1c, 2, 3, 4, 5) for a total score range of 0 to 28.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase) and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>The CSD (Carney et al., 2012) will be used to monitor self-reported sleep during the baseline phase, over the course of the digitally administered CBT-I intervention, and throughout follow-up. The CSD is a standardized sleep diary based on expert consensus and qualitative patient input.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Participant Perception of the Acceptability, Perceived Value, and Feasibility of using a Digital Modality to Treat Insomnia Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase) and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>This unpublished measure requests information on the participants impressions of using digitally administered CBT-i. Questions ask about the following areas: 1) Use of the digitally administered intervention including general impressions and frequency of use, 2) Perceived value and helpfulness of the digitally administered intervention including which features of the program were perceived to be most useful and how the program impacted different aspects of insomnia and management of insomnia, 3) Impact on health (e.g., perceived impact on management of insomnia), 4) Potential enhancements (i.e. recommendations for improvements to the intervention).</description>

    <measure>Changes in The Posttraumatic Checklist-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks (baseline), 12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase), and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a self-report measure of PTSD symptom severity (Weathers et al., 2013). The PCL is a 20-item measure which asks respondents how much they had been bothered in the prior month by their most traumatic experience. Item responses range from 0 (not very much) to 4 (extremely) with a total score range is 0-80. DSM-5 symptom cluster scores sum item scores: Cluster B (items 1-5), C (6-7), D (8-14), and E (items 15-20).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in The Patient Health Questionnaire: Depression Scale (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks (baseline), 12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase), and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report scale assessing depression over the last two weeks (Kroenke et al., 2002). An additional item asking about global depression and interference with life activities is not included in the PHQ-9 score. Items are scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), for a total score range of 0 to 27.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks (baseline), 12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase), and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7-item anxiety scale (Spitzer et al., 2006) assessing symptoms over the past two weeks. Item scores range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Items are summed to yield a total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in The Brief Inventory for Psychosocial Functioning (B-IPF)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks (baseline), 12 weeks (end of Intervention Phase), and 16 weeks (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>The B-IPF-7 is a 7-item measure scored from 0 (not at all) to 6 (very much) (Bovin et al., 2018). The total score is the mean of the sum of all 7 items. The B-IPF assesses social functioning, academic and occupational functioning, daily activities over the past 30 days.</description>
