  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a multilevel intervention's impact on increasing physical
      activity among rural residents. It is expected that participants who participate in more of
      the intervention (e.g., all levels) will increase their physical activity more than the
      control group and individuals who participate in less of the intervention (e.g., one level of
      the intervention).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the independent and moderating effects of a multilevel intervention and
      the community environment on physical activity among rural residents. The multilevel
      intervention consists of community, interpersonal, and intrapersonal aspects. The community
      level intervention consists of community events. The interpersonal level intervention
      consists of walking group formation. The intrapersonal level intervention consists of cues
      provided by short message service messages (i.e., text messaging). A dose response
      relationship is expected in the intervention communities.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective physical activity measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and 9-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will complete questionnaire via a telephone survey at baseline and 9-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire measures time spent in vigorous and moderate intensity physical activity in the domains of work, travel, and recreation. Participants will answer yes or no to their involvement in a given intensity (e.g., vigorous or moderate) in a given domain (e.g., work, travel, recreation). If the participant answers 'yes' they will be asked on how many days do they partake in the activity, and for how many hours and/or minutes do they partake in the activity. A higher score equates to more physical activity. The range is from 0 minutes per week (i.e., no moderate physical activity in a week) to over 150 minutes per week (i.e., meeting recommendations) for moderate physical activity, and 0 minutes per week (i.e., no vigorous physical activity in a week) to over 75 minutes per week (i.e., meeting recommendations).</description>
