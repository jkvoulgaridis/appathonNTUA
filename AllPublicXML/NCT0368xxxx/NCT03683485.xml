  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although EPBD has a lower risk of post-ERCP bleeding and long-term complications than EST and
      is easier to perform in altered/difficult anatomy, EPBD is reserved for patients with
      bleeding diathesis by current consensus because some studies reported a higher risk of
      pancreatitis. However, recent meta-analyses indicate that short EPBD duration increases the
      risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis, and EPBD with adequate duration has a similar pancreatitis
      risk and a lower overall complication rate compared with EST for choledocholithiasis.

      Therefore, this study aim to compare long-duration EPBD vs EST in the treatment of
      extrahepatic biliary stones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gallstones occur in 10%-15% of adults in the United States and are the most common and costly
      digestive disorder. Concomitant bile duct stones occur in up to 15% of persons with
      symptomatic gallstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with
      sphincterotomy is the standard treatment for removal choledocholithiasis. The biliary
      sphincter is permanently ablated by sphincterotomy. Enteric-biliary reflux occurs with
      bacterial colonization, increased bile lithogenicity, contamination with cytotoxins, and
      chronic inflammation of the biliary system. Endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) has
      become an option for removal of stones 1 cm or smaller in size. Advantages of EPBD over EST
      include a decreased risk of post-ERCP bleeding as well as a decreased risk of stone
      recurrence and cholangitis. Although a short dilation duration (≤1 minute) was previously
      advocated, a study that performed EPBD for 1 minute observed a 15.4% risk of post-ERCP
      pancreatitis with 2 cases of mortality. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
      guideline recommends that the duration of EPBD should exceed 2 minutes because long-duration
      EPBD (&gt;1 minute) is preferred over short-duration EPBD (≤1 minute) with better outcomes. A
      meta-analysis of RCTs showed that the duration of EPBD is inversely associated with the risk
      of PEP. Previous RCTs comparing outcome between EPBD and EST used short EPBD duration between
      25 seconds and 1 minute, and there has been no comparison of outcome between EST and
      long-duration EPBD. The aim of this study was to compare the early and long term outcomes of
      patients treated with long duration balloon dilation or sphincterotomy for extraction of bile
      duct stones in a randomized, multicenter fashion involving a broad spectrum of practices.

    <description>Balloon dilation was performed using wire-guided hydrostatic balloon catheters. An 8-mm dilatation balloon was used for EPBD. Balloons were gradually inflated to maximum pressure for 3 minute, and complete inflation was verified by fluoroscopy. Stones were removed by standard techniques, including balloon or basket catheters.</description>
