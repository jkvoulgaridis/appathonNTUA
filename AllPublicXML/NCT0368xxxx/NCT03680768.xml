  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to collect relevant molecular markers of aging
      and measures of physiological function. Together these biomarkers are used to develope a new
      Biological Age model, useful in health promotion interventions in the public health sector .

      Study design: 100 participants representing the healthy danish working adult population. This
      study seek to include both men and women equally distributed in the range of 18-65 of age.

      Data collection: After recruitment, participants need to attend once to the laboratory,
      overnight fasted and without having exercised for the previous 24 hours.

      All analyse are done in investigators lab (Xlab) at the department of Biomedical Sciences,
      Copenhagen University. When analyzes are done, the results are used in algorithm developement
      in cooperation with Technical university Denmark.
