  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The healthcare system in Sweden is publicly funded and aims to provide equal access to care
      irrespective of socioeconomic status. This includes ensuring equity in drug treatment.
      Socioeconomic disparities have been shown to influence patient management and health outcomes
      in certain Swedish populations. The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare has stated that the
      prescription of new drugs, which are more expensive than generic standard of care drugs,
      might be influenced by patients' socioeconomic status.

      To evaluate the association between socioeconomic factors and use of a DOAC (rivaroxaban,
      dabigatran, or apixaban) or standard of care (warfarin) in patients with NVAF in Sweden.
