      Objectives In pilot study investigators aimed to compare novel parameters of right ventricle
      (RV) function from right heart catheterization (RHC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      with PET-derived RV FDG uptake.

      Background Right ventricular (RV) function is a major determinant of survival in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Hemodynamic parameters like end-systolic
      elastance (Ees), arterial elastance (Ea), pulmonary arterial compliance (PAC) and Ees/Ea
      ratio have been shown to reflect RV function and prognosis in PAH. Increased RV
      18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) was recently
      associated with progressive RV dysfunction in these patients.

      Methods Twenty-five stable PAH patients (49.92±15.94 years) and twelve healthy subjects
      (control group, 44.75±13.51 years) had simultaneous PET and MRI scans performed. FDG was used
      as a tracer and its uptake was presented as a standardized uptake value (SUV) for both left
      (LV) and right ventricle.

        We enrolled twenty-five stable adult patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial
        hypertension. A diagnosis of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) was confirmed by
        right heart catheterization [mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg, pulmonary
        artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg] and the use of an algorithm that included perfusion
        lung scan, echocardiography, respiratory function tests, and computer tomography to rule
        out secondary PH causes according to European guidelines [16]. The control group consisted
        of twelve healthy controls who were matched based on sex and age. During the baseline
        evaluation, we performed a physical examination, six-minute walk test, laboratory tests
        e.g. serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), morphology and renal function parameters.
