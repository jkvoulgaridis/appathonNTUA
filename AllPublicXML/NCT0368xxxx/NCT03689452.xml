  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of platelet rich plasma (PRP)
      injections for non-scaring alopecia in women. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      will be performed where patients with non-scarring alopecia will either receive injections of
      their own PRP or injections of normal saline (placebo). Patients in the treatment group
      (Group A) will have a small amount of their own blood drawn and have their PRP injected into
      their scalp four times. The injections will be given at weeks zero, four, eight, and twenty
      four. The placebo group (Group B) will be given the same schedule but will receive sham
      injections only and will not have any blood drawn. Both groups will have clinical data
      collected at all visits, including a screening visit before enrollment and a final assessment
      visit at week 40, for a total of 6 study visits per patient. Data collection will include
      representative photographs of the scalp and measurements of hair thickness. The results from
      the two groups will then be compared.

      In summary, all study participants will have a screening visit before enrollment, four study
      visits for sub-dermal scalp injections, and one final assessment visit at week 40.
