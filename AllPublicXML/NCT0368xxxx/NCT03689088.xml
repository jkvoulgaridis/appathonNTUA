  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is characterized by irreversible vision loss through the progressive death of optic
      nerve fibers unless timely diagnosis and adequate treatment are provided. Medical therapy is
      aimed at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) below a clinically determined target level in
      order to prevent or slow glaucoma progression. IOP is known to vary with the time of day as
      well as with daily activities.

      The current way of assessing nycthemeral IOP fluctuation is to perform repeated discrete
      tonometry measurements, allowing only snapshot and non-continuous measurements once per hour
      in the best cases. The procedure is cumbersome, expensive, inconvenient (disturbed sleep
      cycle as patient is awoken for nocturnal/sleep period measurements) and may not detect
      crucial IOP values in time.

      Sensimed AG has developed a new contact lens (CL)-based device intended to continuously
      measure IOP over 24 hours. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of device
      for 24-hour IOP monitoring in healthy subjects and glaucoma patients.
