  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      150 patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with heart failure will undergo
      comprehensive Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imagining during their admission and
      continuous heart rhythm monitoring using wearable technology post discharge.

      We hypothesise that analysis of this outcome data will discover novel CMR tissue
      characterisation and heart rhythm biomarkers that can be used to predict adverse clinical
      outcomes in heart failure populations and how individual patients will respond to specific
      therapies.

      PREDICT-HF a low risk single centre observational study in which 150 consecutive patients
      admitted with a new, primary diagnosis of heart failure undergo advanced CMR to
      non-invasively establish their individual myocardial tissue characteristics during their
      initial presentation.

      All study participants will be invited to participate in an optional heart rhythm and rate
      monitoring sub study which will involve continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for up to
      2 days prior to discharge and up to 30 day immediately post discharge using a Samsung S-PATCH
      device.

      To enable multivariate statistical analysis to be performed each study participant will
      undergo a range of validated investigation to comprehensively establish and monitor other
      recognised heart failure prognostic biomarkers.

      Participants will be managed per current NICE heart failure guidelines and will undergo
      rigorous clinical reviews at 6, 12 and 24 months. All clinically relevant event data e.g.
      MACE, rehospitalisation, decompensation and arrhythmias will be meticulously recorded for
      each participant throughout the study period.

      This study will identify novel CMR derived tissue characterisation biomarkers of adverse
      outcome, response to therapy and arrhythmias in a hospitalised heart failure population. It
      will also be the first study to utilise wearable heart monitoring technology to accurately
      record heart rate and rhythm data in this population and investigate the potential impact of
      this on patient's clinical management and outcomes.

        All patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with a new primary diagnosis of
        heart failure will be considered for the study.

        The diagnosis of heart failure will be confirmed by a senior cardiologist with a
        subspecialty interest in heart failure following detailed review of the patient's history,
        clinical findings and investigations using the following diagnostic criteria:

          1. Signs and symptoms of heart failure

             &amp;

          2. Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction either by;

        Left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 50%

        or;

        Plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) &gt;400 pg/mL if
        in sinus rhythm or &gt; 1000 pg/ml if in atrial fibrillation/flutter and being treated with
        either oral or intravenous furosemide ≥40 mg/day or equivalent at the time of inclusion.
