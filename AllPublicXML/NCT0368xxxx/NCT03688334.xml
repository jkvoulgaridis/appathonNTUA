  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease characterised with significant morbidity and
      poor prognosis. Dyspnoea and impaired exercise capacity are very common manifestations of the
      disease, and result in significant impairment of patients' quality of life. Although
      hypoxemia is common among subjects with IPF, published data on the effects of supplementary
      oxygen therapy on specific clinical outcomes among these patients are currently few, while
      the existing data on the potential benefits of oxygen supplementation to treat
      exercise-induced hypoxemia, in this patient population, are even more controversial.

      Based on the aforementioned, the purpose of this prospective, cross-over clinical trial is to
      investigate the acute effects of supplemental oxygen administration on the: a) exercise
      capacity, b) severity of dyspnea, c) cerebral oxygenation, b) muscle oxygenation, and e)
      hemodynamic profile, as compared to delivery of medical air (sham oxygen), in a group of
      patients with IPF, without resting hypoxemia, during steady state cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing (CPET).
