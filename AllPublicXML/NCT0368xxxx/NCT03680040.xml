  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational trial is to determine time to valve failure due to valve
      deterioration requiring re-intervention and collect/investigate early potential predictors of
      valve durability (e.g., calcification and hemodynamic deterioration) in RESILIA tissue
      valves.

      Multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, observational trial. Subjects will be
      evaluated at 5, 7, 9, and 11 years post-implant. Up to two hundred fifty (250) total subjects
      at up to fifteen (15) investigational sites will be enrolled.
