  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a
      future large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether Reiki is superior to
      sham Reiki and usual care when delivered to critically ill older adults who require
      mechanical ventilation (MV). Our three-arm, pilot RCT will include 45 subjects and their LARs
      (45) recruited from the OSU-WMC intensive care units (ICUs) who are randomly allocated 1:1:1
      to: 1) Reiki, 2) sham Reiki, or 3) usual care for 5 days or until the subject is discharged
      from the hospital or expires. The Investigators will perform interviews with the subjects'
      LARs upon study enrollment to determine the subjects preadmission physical, functional, and
      cognitive health status. Each subject will be assessed for pain, anxiety, and agitation and
      have their vital signs taken daily for 5 days using valid and reliable tools. Medical records
      will be used to record demographic and clinical characteristics. The Investigators will
      survey each subject and their LAR regarding their experiences with the Reiki, sham Reiki or
      usual care sessions. Reiki and sham Reiki will be administered for 5 consecutive days even if
      the subject is transferred to the floor from the ICU. Usual care will also involve a 5-day
      period. Study Arms. Reiki. Three professional Reiki therapists trained at Level 2
      (intermediate) and with a minimum of 2 years of Reiki practice will administer the Reiki
      intervention. The Reiki intervention involves a 30-minute treatment in which the participant
      is lightly touched for 3 minutes at each of 10 standardized Reiki hand positions (eyes,
      temples, crown, back of head, thymus/lungs, abdomen, scapula, mid back, lower back, feet).
      Sham Reiki. Three actors matched for age and sex with the Reiki therapists will administer
      sham Reiki. Sham interventionists may not be providers of any touch therapy or bodywork
      modalities (e.g. Reiki, Therapeutic Tough, Healing Touch, general massage) nor may they be
      providers of any type of complementary therapies (e.g. aromatherapy, guided imagery,
      hypnosis). The sham Reiki session consists of 30-minutes of direct contact using the same 10
      standardized hand positions as the Reiki intervention. To minimize unconscious healing
      intentions, sham interventionists will occupy their minds with thoughts unrelated to the
      participant (e.g., counting backwards from 100 to 1). Usual Care. Subjects assigned to usual
      care will not receive Reiki or sham Reiki. The usual care group will undergo the same
      in-person symptom assessments and electronic health record (EHR) reviews as the Reiki and
      sham Reiki groups. Reiki therapy is not part of usual care in the participating ICUs. The
      knowledge gained from this study will contribute to a better understanding of how/if a
      nonpharmacologic intervention can reduce the symptoms experienced by critically ill older
      adults.
