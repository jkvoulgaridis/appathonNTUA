      A phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to

      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to
      evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on airway inflammation in adults with inadequately
      controlled moderate-to-severe asthma, taking inhaled corticosteroids and at least one
      additional asthma controller. Approximately 110 subjects will be randomized globally.
      Subjects will receive tezepelumab, or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the
      study site, over a 28-week treatment period. Although, due to the Covid-19 pandemic this may
      be an extended time frame for some subject visits. The study also includes a post-treatment
      follow-up period of 12 weeks.
