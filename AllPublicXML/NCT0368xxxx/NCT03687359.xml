      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the characteristics of pediatric patients with moderate to severe atopic
           dermatitis (AD) whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies or
           when those therapies are not medically advisable.

        -  To evaluate the time-course of AD and selected atopic comorbidities.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize disease burden and unmet need.

        -  To describe real-world treatment patterns (eg, dosing regimens, treatment duration, and
           reasons for discontinuation and/or switching).

        -  To document the real-world effectiveness and safety of treatments.
