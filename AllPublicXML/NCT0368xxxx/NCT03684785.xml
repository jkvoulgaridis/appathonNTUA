  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral
      AST-008 injections alone and in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab or cemiplimab in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Phase 1b of this trial is a 3+3 dose escalation study evaluating escalating or intermediate
      dose levels of AST-008 given with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab.

      The Phase 2 dose expansion part of the study will consist of two cohorts of patients: Merkel
      cell carcinoma (MCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Patients in the MCC cohort
      will receive IT AST-008 combined with a fixed, standard dose of pembrolizumab while the CSCC
      cohort will receive IT AST-008 combined with a fixed, standard dose of cemiplimab. The Phase
      2 dose expansion is designed to provide a preliminary estimate of efficacy in patients that
      have progressed on an anti-PD-(L)1 CPI or are otherwise refractory to CPI therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 evaluates AST-008 given in combination with
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors in a classical 3+3 dose escalation
      design, with up to five ascending dose cohorts of AST-008 and enrollment of 3 patients per
      cohort to identify an RP2D. Patients will be dosed twice with AST-008 as a monotherapy before
      adding pembrolizumab, which will be added starting at the second cycle. Once the MTD or
      highest escalation cohort has been reached, or notable efficacy has been observed at a given
      dose level, and a decision as to a RP2D has been made, a two two-stage expansion cohorts will
      be initiated.

      Phase 2 will evaluate the RP2D of AST-008 given in combination with pembrolizumab or
      cemiplimab in two expansion cohorts following a modified Simon 2-stage optimal design
      comprised of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
      (CSCC). who previously received and have progressed on an anti-PD-(L)1 CPI or are otherwise
      refractory to CPI therapy. Patients in the MCC cohort will receive IT AST-008 combined with a
      fixed, standard dose of pembrolizumab while the CSCC cohort will receive IT AST-008 combined
      with a fixed, standard dose of cemiplimab.

             tissue for biomarker analysis. Tissue obtained for the biopsy must not be previously
             irradiated, but a new or progressing lesion in the radiation field is acceptable.

          6. In the investigator's opinion the patient may derive clinical benefit from the
             treatment or is ineligible for a particular form of standard therapy due to
             tolerability, or the patient failed one or more established standard medical
             anti-cancer therapies, including:

               1. In the dose escalation phase and optional liver dosing cohort, exposure to
                  anti-PD-(L)1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody CPIs is permitted but not required.

               2. In the Phase 2 MCC expansion cohort:

             i. At least 4 doses of q2w-administered avelumab or 3 doses of q3w-administered
             pembrolizumab as the most recent preceding therapy prior to being enrolled in this
             study with confirmed progression. Pembrolizumab treatment was for recurrent locally
             advanced or metastatic MCC, or avelumab treatment was for metastatic MCC. Prior
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy is permitted but not required.

             ii. Last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy must be within 12 weeks of initiating
             study treatment.

             iii. Confirmed progressive disease on anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy defined as:

               -  Treatment duration with the anti-PD-(L)1 antibody was ≥ 8 weeks.

               -  Documented radiographic progression on two sequential radiographic scans
                  separated by at least 4 weeks per RECIST 1.1. However, if radiographic
                  progression is accompanied with unequivocal clinical progression, then a single
                  scan assessment may be used if, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient
                  is unable to wait 4 weeks for a second scan.

               -  If progression was only in a lymph node, biopsy confirmation of cancer in the

                  cemiplimab as the most recent preceding therapy prior to being enrolled in this
                  study with confirmed progression. Cemiplimab was administered for metastatic CSCC
                  or locally advanced CSCC that was not a candidate for curative surgery or
                  curative radiation. Prior anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy is permitted but not

               -  Documented radiographic progression on two sequential radiographic scans
                  separated by at least 4 weeks per RECIST 1.1. However, if radiographic
                  progression is accompanied with documented unequivocal clinical progression, then
                  a single scan assessment may be used.

               -  If progression was only in a lymph node, biopsy confirmation of cancer in the
                  lymph node is required.

                  separated by at least 4 weeks per RECIST 1.1. However, if radiographic
                  progression is accompanied with documented unequivocal clinical progression, then
                  a single scan assessment may be used if, in the opinion of the investigator, the
                  patient is unable to wait 4 weeks for a second scan.

               -  If progression was only in a lymph node, biopsy confirmation of cancer in the
                  lymph node is required.

          7. Evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 with at least two target lesions. Both injectable and
             non-injectable target lesions should be chosen for efficacy evaluation.

         12. Adequate organ function.

         13. Able and willing to comply with the protocol and the restrictions and assessments
             therein.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Small molecule or tyrosine kinase inhibitor within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug, chemotherapy or biological cancer

             limited to a recent medical history of acute diverticulitis or other infective
             abdominal condition, or a diagnosis of abdominal carcinomatosis) that could confound
             interpretation of GI AEs.

          7. Symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A patient who is clinically stable following
             treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thoraco- or paracentesis) is

             least 4 weeks prior to study entry, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
             metastases and are off steroids for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study
             drug.

          9. Known history of a hematologic malignancy, malignant primary brain tumor or malignant
             sarcoma, or of another malignant primary solid tumor (other than that under study),
             unless the patient has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that
             disease for 3 years.

             Note: The time requirement for no evidence of disease for 3 years does not apply to
             the tumor for which a patient is enrolled in the study. The time requirement also does
             not apply to patients who underwent successful definitive resection of basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, in situ cervical cancer, or other in situ cancers.

         10. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease or evidence of such as determined
             by HRCT at baseline.

         11. Known infection with HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B (surface antigen), or hepatitis C.
             Baseline testing is not required for patient enrollment.

         12. Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Vitiligo or resolved
             childhood asthma/atopy are exceptions to this rule. Patients requiring intermittent
