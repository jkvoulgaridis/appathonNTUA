    <textblock>
      In this phase I first-in-humans-study a vaccine consisting of arginase-1 (ARG1) peptides and
      the adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 will be tested in ten patients with metastatic solid tumors.
      Patients will be treated with an ARG1 vaccine every third week for 45 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arginase-1 (ARG1) is an enzyme that converts the amino acid arginine into urea and ornithine.
      ARG1 is mainly expressed in hepatocytes but different myeloid cells are also capable of
      ARG1-expression.

      An ARG1-induced arginine depletion suppresses T cell function through the impairment of the T
      cell receptor (TCR)-complex. A research group from the Center for Cancer Immune Therapy
      (CCIT) have identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against ARG1 peptides in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients and healthy donors. The theoretic background for
      an ARG1 peptide vaccine is to activate ARG1-specific T cells to infiltrate the tumor
      microenvironment and eliminate ARG1-expressing immunosuppressive cells. The aim is to treat
      10 patients with progressive solid tumors following treatment with standard of care agents.
      Patients will receive ARG1 vaccinations administered subcutaneously every third week for 45
      weeks.

      The primary endpoint is to evaluate safety and toxicity. Immune responses will be assessed
      using blood- and tumor tissue samples and clinical responses are evaluated using RECIST 1.1.
