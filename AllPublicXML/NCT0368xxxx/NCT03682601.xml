    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of topical 10% sinecatechins, a botanical drug derived from
      green tea for the alleviation of sexual pain in the area around the vaginal opening (the
      vulvar vestibule), that is a main source of pain during sexual contact or dyspareunia, in
      postmenopausal women, with vulvovaginal atrophy. Women may or may not be using estrogens.
      Half of the women will receive the study drug, 10% sinecatechins and half will receive
      placebo. In addition to the reduction or elimination of pain upon penetration, women may also
      experience increase in lubrication, arousal and intensity of orgasm

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical Veregen (15% sinecatechins) is an FDA approved botanical drug derived from green tea
      and is approved to be used as multiple doses, three times a day to treat all visible external
      genital warts.

      Topical green tea ointment has been shown to alleviate pain and improve wound healing in the
      vulvar vestibule for women who have had a recent episiotomy in the medical literature. In
      private clinical practice, dilute Veregen (10% sinecatechins) has been effective in
      alleviating , sexual pain, vulvar vestibular pain, dyspareunia, in postmenopausal women as
      well as improving overall sexual satisfaction,( increasing lubrication, arousal and quality
      of orgasm). In this study, dilute Veregen, (10% sinecatechins) or placebo is being applied,
      as a single dose, topically, once a day, to alleviate pain in the vulvar vestibule,
      penetration pain, upon sexual contact or other manipulation of this area in postmenopausal
      women. Women are eligible whether or not they are currently using any form of estrogen or
      other hormonal treatments (eg.DHEA). Please note that women not using estrogen or who maybe
      taking aromatase inhibitors,tamoxifen, SERMS, are also eligible to be included.

    <description>30 postmenopausal women will apply a 1/2 inch strand of Placebo ointment once daily to their vulvar vestibule for a total of 4 weeks.
They will come for three office visits with the gynecologist, who will exam their vulvar vestibule and perform a Qtip test. The Qtip test consists of applying pressure with a cotton tipped swab to the vulvar vestibule and asking the participant to rate the degree of pain that they experience on a scale from 0-10 ( 0=no pain; 1-3=mild pain; 4-6=moderate pain; 7-9=significant pain; 10=severe pain).
A swab will be taken of the lateral vaginal wall for to assess the degree of vaginal atrophy.
The participant will fill out questionnaires during office visits with the gynecologist. In addition, 2 short questionnaires will be filled out online on a HIPAA compliant web based survey at the end of weeks 1 and 3.</description>

             screening their vaginal pH will be 4.6 or greater and their vaginal maturation index
             will be consistent with vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is thinning, drying and of
             the vaginal walls due to having less estrogen in the body.

          5. Be, sexually functional, both psychologically and physically, whereby a woman is to be
             psychologically interested in sexual activity and (unless these activities are

             vaginal introital genital manipulation whether through masturbation or partner sex,
             whether using digits, oral sexual contact, sex toys, and/or penile penetration present
             at regular intervals each month during the 4-week pre-treatment and the 4- week active

             the study.

          6. Be able and willing to participate in the study as evidenced by providing written
             informed consent.

          7. Answer affirmatively to ALL of the following questions:

               1. Before your vulvar pain, would you say that in general, your sex life was good
                  and satisfying?

               2. Since you have been experiencing vulvar pain, do you feel you have experienced a

                  decrease in your sexual activity?

               4. Are you concerned or bothered by your current level of desire for or interest in
                  sex?

                  sexual activity?

          8. Women can enter the trial if they are taking estrogens.

             function.

          2. Have used within the last 12 weeks any of the following medications/preparations that
             may interfere with the study purpose: systemic corticosteroids (acute use for fewer
             than 7 days is accepted), SSRI's, tricyclic antidepressants, anti-androgens,
             spironolactone, PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra ®).

          3. Be experiencing any chronic or acute life stress relating to any major life change,
             such as recent loss of income or the death of a close family member, that may, in the

             outcome of the study.

          6. Have a history of genital herpes because of the episodic nature of genital herpes and
             of the known possibility of occurrence of herpetic pain without visible dermatologic
             manifestations of herpes. Genital herpes and its accompanying genital pain may obscure
             the source of the genital pain experienced and confound the ability to determine the
             efficacy of treatment/placebo on endpoint of alleviation of pain in women with
             secondary provoked vulvar vestibular pain.

          7. Have any infection of the genitalia

          8. Have lichen sclerosis, lichen planus, contact dermatitis, psoriasis or any
             inflammatory condition or abrasions of the vulva

          9. Have an episiotomy scar in the area where pain is perceived as it may confound the
             etiology of the perceived pain

         10. Have diabetes.
