  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial examining the feasibility
      and effectiveness of two guided self-help behavioral weight loss (gshBWL) treatments
      delivered via the internet for individuals struggling with weight loss one year following
      bariatric surgery. The two treatments will consist of 1) gshBWL delivered through the
      internet only (gshBWL-I) and 2) gshBWL delivered via the internet with additional
      complementary phone sessions (gshBWL-IP).

    <description>Participants will be provided with patient-focused materials and worksheets that contain all the necessary information, procedures, and techniques of the behavioral weight loss program. For 12 weeks, treatment will be provided over the internet. This therapy focuses on making gradual and modest lifestyle changes with goals of normalizing eating patterns, decreasing caloric intake, building coping skills, and increasing physical activity.</description>
