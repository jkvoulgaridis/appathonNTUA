  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether offering an evidence-based package of
      employment supports integrated with mental health services has a positive impact on
      employment and clinical recovery, and delays or diminishes the need for disability benefits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SSA contracted with Westat to implement and evaluate the Supported Employment Demonstration
      (SED). The SED provides integrated mental health and vocational services to people with
      mental illness who were recently denied Social Security disability benefits. The evaluation
      will determine the impact of the SED on employment, clinical recovery, and receipt of
      disability payments. The evaluation is using a randomized controlled trial design to compare
      the outcomes of two treatment groups and a control group. In the full-service arm (n =
      1,000), participants receive services from an Individual Placement and Support employment
      specialist, a care manager, and a nurse care coordinator (NCC) who provides medication
      management support, as well as modest funding for out-of-pocket prescriptions, essential
      work-related expenses, and other services in the participant's treatment plan. The
      basic-service arm (n=1,000), which is expected to cost about 50 percent less than the
      full-service arm, provides all services and funds except the NCC. Participants in the usual
      services (control) group (n = 1,000) seek services as they normally would but receive a
      comprehensive guide to local, state, and national resources.

      Data collection includes computer-assisted baseline (in-person) and blinded quarterly
      (telephone) interviews with participants, collection of SSA administrative and site-level
      program data, site visits (including fidelity assessments), qualitative interviews with site
      administrators and service providers, focus groups with study participants, and
      person-centered ethnographic interviews with participants and nonparticipants.
