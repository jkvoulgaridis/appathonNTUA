  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eMOM is a randomized, controlled trial to compare the effects of two different dietary
      interventions during pregnancy. The comparison is based on tissue glucose content (using
      continuous glucose monitoring system) in pregnant women and on neonate body composition. The
      recruited women (n=60) have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus, and are of
      Caucasian origin. Of the study diets, one is moderately carbohydrate restricted and the other
      one is high on plant-based protein with an emphasis on healthy Nordic foods. The study has
      two two-week study periods that are carried out on approximately gestational weeks 24-28
      (period I) and 34-36 (period II). Continuous glucose monitoring and other measurements
      (accelerometer, 3-day food record, gut microbiota, serum lipids, metabolomics, epigenetics
      etc.) are done during these study periods. At the beginning of the study, before study period
      I, the participants are randomized to either one of the intervention diets. The first study
      period consists of a crossover phase in which the participants receive three days' worth of
      food according to one of the intervention diets (according to the randomization) after which
      there is a three-day wash-out period. After the wash-out period, the participants receive
      three days' worth of food according to the other diet. After the first study period, a
      nutritionist advises the lastly followed intervention diet to the participant and the diet is
      followed until delivery. To ensure the diet is followed, the participants gets at least three
      personal face-to-face counseling sessions, phone calls, mobile reminders, recipes and food
      items. After delivery, the infant's body composition, epigenetic markers of cord blood and
      placenta, gut microbiome and urine metabolomics are measured.
