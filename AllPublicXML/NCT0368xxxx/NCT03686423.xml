  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-over design study proposes an innovative multinuclear MRI approach to gain
      mechanistic insight into the exercise-associated adaptations in lower leg muscle function and
      peripheral nerve integrity of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Currently,
      there are no therapies to prevent or reverse the progress of DPN. This study will use novel
      multinuclear MRI technology to understand how exercise affects skeletal muscle and peripheral
      nerve integrity and function in patients with DPN. This study will prescribe a 4-week
      non-exercise phase followed by a 10-week exercise program (with both aerobic and
      strengthening components) to 40 DPN patients who will receive personal supervision from
      health professionals.

    <measure>Change in Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The glycosylated hemoglobin test shows what a person's average blood glucose level was for the 2 to 3 months before the test. This can help determine how well a person's diabetes is being controlled over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in C-reactive protein</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Used to evaluate your risk of developing coronary artery disease, a condition in which the arteries of your heart are narrowed. ... A simple blood test measures C-reactive protein.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MNSI symptom questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>15 questions. Responses of &quot;yes&quot; to items 1-3, 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, 14-15 are each counted as one point. A &quot;no&quot; response on items 7 and 13 counts as 1 point. Item #4 is a measure of impaired circulation and item #10 is a measure of general aesthenia and are not included in scoring.</description>
