  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase-2, multicenter, multiple dose, open-label, 2-part evaluation study which will
      primarily assess the safety and tolerability of VTS-270 (2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin
      [HP-β-CD]) in pediatric participants with age &lt;4 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A of the study, participants after confirmation of the diagnosis of NPC will receive
      VTS-270 for 20 weeks during the active treatment period. Further, based on investigator's
      discretion participants would either end treatment with a follow-up visit 28 days (+/- 7)
      days after last treatment, or will enter to Part-B to benefit from open-label treatment.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive and Motor Development Assessed Using Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) at Week 6, 12, 20, 44, and every 24 Week Thereafter Until End of Treatment (EOT: 3 Years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, 12, 20, 44, every 24 Week thereafter until EOT (3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSEL is a standardized developmental test for children consisting of five subscales: fine motor, visual reception, expressive language, receptive language and an optional fifth gross motor scale (scale includes standing, walking and running) that only measures skills to 36 months. The raw score is reported for each subscale domain. The potential score ranges are as follows: Visual Reception: 33 items, score range=0-50, Fine Motor: 30 items, score range= 0-49, Receptive Language: 33 items, score range= 0-48, Expressive Language: 28 items, score range= 0-50. A higher raw score indicates more advanced abilities in that section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) Assessed Using Standard Clinical Pediatric Score at Week 6, 12, 20, 44, and every 24 Week Thereafter Until End of Treatment (EOT: 3 Years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, 12, 20, 44, every 24 Week thereafter until EOT (3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The ABR is a voltage response evoked by acoustic stimuli as sound is processed along the auditory pathway. It consists of electrical signals resulting from the sum of sound-evoked activity along the auditory nerve and brainstem nuclei. The ABR analysis determines the sound intensity at which a neural response first appears (hearing threshold). Other parameters of interest include amplitude (the number of neurons firing), latency (the speed of transmission), interpeak latency (the time between peaks), and interaural latency (the difference in wave V latency between ears). The interpeak latency I-V interval (or central transmission time) is considered the most reliable index of brainstem function. Auditory brainstem response assessments were based on standard clinical pediatric score criteria: mild hearing loss: 21-40 decibels hearing level (dBHL), moderate hearing loss: 41-70 dBHL, severe hearing loss: 71-90 dBHL, profound hearing loss: 91dBHL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, 12, 20, 44, every 24 Week thereafter until EOT (3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-CGIC is conducted by a clinician who is trained in performing neurological examinations. CGIC is measured using 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot; to 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot;. If the rater notes an improvement or worsening on the scale, the rater should indicate the major factor for the reported changes in score.</description>

    <description>The caregiver-CGIC is to be completed by the responsible parent or legal guardian. CGIC is measured using 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot; to 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot;. If the caregiver notes an improvement or worsening on the scale, the caregiver should indicate the major reason for the reported changes in score.</description>
