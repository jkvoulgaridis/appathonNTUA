  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if memantine administered for four weeks starting two
      weeks before surgery induces a decrease in pain intensity at 3 months post-mastectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label study in patients undergoing mastectomy.
      Patients included in this trial will receive memantine or not. For patients in the
      &quot;memantine&quot; group, the treatment will be given in titration (maximum dose of 20 mg/day).
      Concerning the comparator group, patients will be followed in the same way as those in the
      &quot;memantine&quot; group except that they will not receive the study treatment. Whether it is the
      &quot;memantine&quot; group or the &quot;usual care&quot; group, visits will be scheduled under the usual
      following conditions of the participating center.

    <description>Neuropathic Pain in 4 questions&quot; (DN4): DN4 is a clinical tool for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. This questionnaire has four questions divided into 10 items related to the interview (ie, symptoms) and to the sensory examination (ie, signs). The investigator asks and examines the patient and notes a response &quot;no&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; for each item: &quot;yes&quot; is scored as &quot;1&quot; and &quot;no&quot; is scored as &quot;0&quot;. The sum of scores gives the total score of the patient (/10). DN4 is considered as positive if the patient obtains a score of 4/10.</description>

    <description>NPSI is a self-questionnaire and includes 10 pain descriptors. Intensity is rated on 0 to 10 numerical scales and two temporal items are designed to assess spontaneous ongoing pain duration and the number of pain paroxysms over 24 hours. This questionnaire discriminates five distinct clinically relevant dimensions: spontaneous burning pain, spontaneous deep pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain, and paresthesia/dysesthesia. Each item is calculated on 10 and the overall test score is scored on 100.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire allows to describe pain experienced during the last 48 hours. It has fifty eight qualifiers divided into sixteen items (A to P). Each qualifier is rated from 0 to 4, where 0 = absent, 1 = low, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong, 4 = very strong. The score is divided between two subclasses, sensory subclass (items A to I) and emotional subclass (items J to P).</description>

    <description>This non-verbal cognitive test assesses the ability of speed, executive functions, attention, concentration, visual perceptual speed. The test takes place in two parts. In Part A, circles are numbered from 1 to 25 and the patient must connect with lines the numbers in ascending order (1-2-3-4, etc.). In Part B, the circles contain numbers from 1 to 13 and letters from A to L, the patient must connect the circles with lines but alternating numbers and letters (1A-2B -3C, etc.). The patient must connect the circles as quickly as possible for both parts of the test, without lifting the pen from the paper. The TMT B additionally provides an estimate of mental flexibility.</description>

    <description>The items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale ranged 0 from 4. This questionnaire is composed by four subscales: 2 subscales ranged as following: 0 (never), 1 (one time a week), 2 (two to three times a week), 3 (every day) and 4 (several times a day): Perceived cognitive impairments subscale and comments from others subscale and two others subscale ranged as following: 0 (not at all), 1 (a little), 2 (moderately), 3 (much) and 4 (enormously): Perceived cognitive abilities and impact of quality of life subscales. The total score is obtained with the sum of these 4 subscales</description>

    <measure>Quality of life assessment by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30).</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (15 days before surgery: Day 0 - 15 days), visit 3 (Day 0 + 16 days), visit 4 (Day 0 + 3 months), visit 5 (Day 0 + 6 months) and visit 6 (Day 0 + 12 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The average of some questions lead to the score of 15 subscales reported on 100: 9 subscales consisting of several items: 5 subscales measuring functional status (physical, role, social, emotional, cognitive), three subscales measuring symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting) and a global subscale of quality of life and health. Finally, six items/isolated symptoms, covering cancer symptoms and frequent side effects of cancer therapies (e.g. loss of appetite) are also included in the questionnaire. For the 6 item assessing the isolated symptoms and some subscales assessing functional status (as physical, role, social cognitive, emotional) and subscales measuring symptoms (fatigue, pain nausea and vomiting): higher values represent a worse outcome. Concerning subscale of quality of life and health, higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The anxiety sub-score is obtained by summing items relate to anxiety (Subscore Anxiety (A): /21). The depression sub-score is obtained by summing items relate to depression (subscore Depression: /21). For each of the two subscores, if a subject obtain a score ranged from: 0 to 7, he is considered as &quot;normal&quot;; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case) and 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>

    <description>The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction).In all cases, a score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas</description>

    <description>Women provide written informed consent prior to their participation in the study, during their Anesthesiology visit. After baseline assessments (15 days before surgery: Day 0 - 15) of pain intensity, cognitive, quality of life and quality of sleep questionnaires, participants will be randomized in two parallel groups: &quot;memantine&quot; (n=75) or &quot;usual care&quot; (n=75). Memantine will be given orally for four weeks starting two weeks before surgery. Endpoints will be assessed 15 days (Day 0 + 15), 3 months (Day 0 + 3 months), 6 months (Day 0 + 6 months) et 12 months (Day 0 + 12 months) post-mastectomy. In order to maintain a good compliance and to verify that women do not develop adverse events, patients will be called once a week by phone. A booklet for monitoring will be completed daily by the patient for 3 months from the day of surgery.</description>
