  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) is the highest risk factor for
      Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). The core feature for differentiating PDD from PD-MCI is
      the loss of the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). As Parkinson's Disease
      (PD) is primarily a movement disorder, the distinction between motor and cognitive
      contributions to ADL in PD is an obvious challenge, which the investigators aimed to explore
      in this study. The goal of the study is to evaluate whether PD-MCI patients with more
      pronounced, cognitive-driven ADL impairment are at higher risk for cognitive worsening and
      PDD. A longitudinal follow-up assessment of 262 non-demented PD patients will be conducted
      over the next two years, with a comprehensive clinical assessment as well as biomarker
      sampling (cerebrospinal fluid and blood markers). Primary longitudinal outcome will be
      conversion to PDD and PD-MCI. Conversion rates of patients with and without additional mild
      cognitive-driven ADL impairment at baseline will be compared. Novel scores of the Pfeffer
      Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) are used to assess instrumental ADL,
      differentiating between cognitive- and motor-driven ADL impairment in PD-MCI.

      Through venipuncture, the following samples will be taken:

        -  venous blood for the determination of routine values (1 Serum tube)

        -  venous blood for RNA Isolation

        -  venous blood for DNA isolation

        -  venous blood in 1 Serum tube

      A lumbar puncture at level L3/L4 or L4/L5 of the spine will be performed by a qualified
      clinician in subsample of the cohort. Neurodegenerative markers such as Abeta1-42 and
      Abeta1-40 will be analysed.

        Participants of the already recruited ABC-PD (Amyloid-Beta in cerebrospinal fluid as a risk
        factor for cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease) cross-sectional cohort (Ethic
        Protocol of the Medical Faculty Tuebingen 686/2013B01) will be asked to participate in the
        follow-up assessment. A drop-out rate of 20% is expected for follow-up retention.
        Therefore, investigation of 209 patients will be conducted between August 2018 and April
        2020.
