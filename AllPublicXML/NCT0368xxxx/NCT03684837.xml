  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older with Chronic obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were submitted to chronic whole body
      vibration training during 03 months, receiving a vitamine D dose for each week or placebo
      vitamine. This group was compared with healthy older which were submitted to the same
      intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Older patients with COPD

          -  Both genders

          -  Sedentary according to International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form

          -  BMI in between 22.9 and 28 kg/m2.

          -  Older patients with COPD should have a clinical-functional diagnosis of the disease
             according to GOLD (GOLD, 2018), have been ex-smokers and have not used corticosteroids
             or have used this drug in a stable way for at least one year (without dosage or
             medication modifications).

          -  Older volunteers should be self-referenced healthy or, if they had systemic arterial
             hypertension or diabetes mellitus, these comorbidities should be controlled by diet or
             regular medication use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Older patients with COPD who had episodes of exacerbation in the last three months,
             those with pulmonary rehabilitation programs in the last year, those who used home
             oxygen therapy, and patients with COPD-associated comorbidities were excluded.

          -  Volunteers of both groups who were taking vitamin D were excluded, as well as the
             current smokers, although occasional, volunteers with a history of labyrinthitis or
             thromboembolism, who had undergone surgical procedures of any size in the last year,
             such as plaques, pins or cardiac pacemakers, those with unconsolidated fractures that
             used medications that affected bone metabolism or lean mass, or those who had
             difficulties adapting to the assessment or the training protocol.
