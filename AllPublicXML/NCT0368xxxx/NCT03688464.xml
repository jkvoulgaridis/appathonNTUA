  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 6 week study to determine the efficacy of melatonin vs. first generation
      antihistamine vs. placebo in improving nighttime pruritus in children with atopic dermatitis.

      Secondary aims will include:

        1. Determine efficacy of melatonin vs. first generation antihistamine in management of
           sleep disturbance in children with atopic dermatitis

        2. Compare differences between treatment groups in disease improvement

        3. Compare differences between treatment groups in quality of life

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>POEM (Patient Oriented Eczema Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey is a total of 7 questions that assesses the quality of life of patient's with eczema to determine their disease severity. The 7 questions are scored out of 4 points. A higher total score indicates a higher severity of disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EASI score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This tool is also used to assess severity of eczema. 4 different body regions are scored based on the percentage of eczema affecting the area. The calculations for each region are severity score x area score x known multiplier. A higher score indicates a higher severity of disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>5D Pruritus survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey is a 5 question survey to assess severity of itch in patient's with eczema. The higher the score the worse the pruritus is and the more it affects the patient on a daily basis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ESS-CHAD</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a series of questions that assesses sleepiness. Patient's can rank the situations based on a 3 point scale, 0 indicating would never doze and 3 indicating a high chance of dozing. A higher score indicates increased sleepiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This device is worn on the wrist of a patient like a watch and records sleep-wake cycles.</description>
