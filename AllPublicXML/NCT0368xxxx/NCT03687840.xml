    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the spatio-temporal gait parameters and gait symmetry in individuals
      with lower extremity burn injury due to diabetic polyneuropathy. Study group consisted of 14
      subjects with unilateral lower extremity burn injuries due to diabetic polyneuropathy and
      control group consisted of 14 subjects with only diabetic polyneuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic polyneuropathy, a frequent complication of diabetes, is used to describe sensory,
      motor and autonomic nerve damage caused by metabolic and micro vessel alterations due to
      hyperglycaemia. The signs and symptoms of diabetic polyneuropathy vary according to the type
      of nerve fiber affected. The involvement of the small nerve fibers results in deterioration
      of the pain and temperature perception, while the impairing of large nerve fibers result in
      decrease of touch and proprioception sensations. Due to the sensory loss, accidental foot
      injuries may develop in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. While the feet constitute a
      small percentage (3.5%) of the total body surface area, burn injuries of them in patients
      with diabetic polyneuropathy can cause significant effects on quality of life because
      impaired wound healing process in diabetics may cause risk of prolonged bed rest and
      hospitalization period, and increased early and late complications. Therefore, it has an
      important effects on daily living activities because it causes inadequacies in gait and
      balance activities due to the negative effects on mobility and weight bearing functions. In
      studies that examining changes in gait parameters in other diabetic foot complications such
      as sensory loss, ulceration, and amputation as secondary to diabetic polyneuropathy have
      shown that these individuals acquire a protective adaptive gait strategies that allow for
      more controlled gait in the present of proprioceptive deficits such as slower gait speed,
      smaller step length and in particular increased opposite foot off time in order to shift body
      weight from injured limb to unaffected side. There's no studies have yet been conducted to
      investigating of changes in gait parameters in patients who have diabetic
      polyneuropathy-related lower extremity burn injury. The aim of this case-control study is to
      examine whether similar gait strategies have been gained in this group of patients, as
      indicated in the results of previous studies demonstrating protective adaptive gait
      strategies that adopt under the presence of other diabetic foot complications due to diabetic
      polyneuropathy.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stride Length</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>

    <measure>Foot Progression Angle</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is the angle between the line of progression and the midline of the footprint. This angle is zero if the geometric mid- line of the footprint is parallel to the line of progression; positive, toe-out, when the mid-line of the footprint is outside the line of progression and negative, toe-in, when inside the line of progression.

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is obtained after dividing the distance traveled by the ambulation time. It is expressed in centimeters per second (cm/sec)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cadence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The rate at which a person walk, expressed in steps per minute (step/min). The average cadence is 100 - 115 steps/min.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Double Support</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is the amount of time that a person spends with both feet on the ground during one gait cycle. It is presented as a percentage of the gait cycle time (% gait cycle). The percentage of time spent in double support decreases as the speed of walking increases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Stance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The stance phase is the weight bearing portion of each gait cycle. It is initiated by heel contact and ends with toe off of the same foot. It is the time elapsed between the first contact and the last contact of two consecutive footfalls on the same foot. It is also presented as a percentage of the gait cycle time (% gait cycle)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Swing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is initiated with toe off and ends with heel strike. It is the time elapsed between the last contact of the current footfall to the first contact of the next footfall on the same foot. It is expressed in seconds (sec) and it is also presented as a percent of the gait cycle (% gait cycle) of the same foot. The Swing Time is equal to the Single Support time of the opposite foot.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symmetry Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>It's calculated in order to evaluate symmetry and bilateral coordination of gait. The Symmetry Index and Symmetry Angle are interpreted as a complete symmetry if the result is 0.
