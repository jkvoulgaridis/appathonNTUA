    <textblock>
      In France, as in many countries of the world, trisomy 21 or Down syndrome (DS) is the subject
      of an antenatal screening based on a risk calculation (R) including the assay of biochemical
      markers in the maternal blood, and the measurement of a fetal ultrasound parameter (nuchal
      translucency). In the population of pregnant women said to be at high risk (R&gt; 1/250),
      confirmation of the diagnosis of DS is made by invasive sampling (trophoblast biopsy or
      amniocentesis), which allows the establishment of fetal karyotype. In addition to limited
      sensitivity (80 to 85% depending on the techniques), this screening is an anxiety factor (8%
      false positives), and miscarriages of euploid fetuses (normal karyotype) in 1% of cases
      (procedures invasive).

      The plasma of a pregnant woman contains a mixture of free DNA of maternal (90%) and fetal
      origin (cffDNA for cell free fetal DNA) (about 10%, but this proportion increases in cases of
      fetal trisomy 21. The proportion of cffDNA is sufficient to qualitatively and quantitatively
      study specific genetic markers of a pair of chromosomes. It is therefore possible to evaluate
      the quantity of markers chromosome of interest relative to a reference chromosome marker, and
      to calculate a marker / marker ratio of interest, theoretically identical for all autosomes
      (chromosomes 1 to 22) during euploid pregnancy. In case of fetal aneuploidy (for example,
      trisomy 21), this ratio is unbalanced for the chromosomal pair involved.

      Advances in technology, such as high-throughput mass sequencing (MPS) and digital PCR (dPCR),
      now make it possible to consider the diagnosis of fetal maternal DS through the study of
      cffDNA. Several teams have already published on this subject with the MPS technique, applied
      directly to free DNA from maternal plasma, or after a cffDNA isolation step. This involves
      sequencing the DNA fragments present in the sample and placing them back on their original
      chromosome. In case of trisomy 21 fetal, one seeks to put in evidence of an excess of
      sequences from chromosome 21. These techniques require expensive equipment (sequencer,
      bioinformatic platform, servers) and a technical time and important analysis (often several
      days for a single run). Concerning the research of aneuploidies by digital PCR (dPCR), few
      publications are today due to the absence of sufficiently powerful instruments until
      recently. DPCR is less expensive.
