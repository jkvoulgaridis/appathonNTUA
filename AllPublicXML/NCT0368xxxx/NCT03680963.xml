      The objective of the present research is a combination of a one-sided test of non-inferiority
      and a one-sided test of superiority. A stepped approach will be used to evaluate these
      hypotheses:

        1. a less invasive intervention (i.e., no indwelling arterial catheter insertion until felt
           absolutely needed, according to consensual and predefined safety criteria) is non
           inferior to usual care (i.e., systematic indwelling arterial catheter insertion in the
           early hours of shock) in terms of mortality at day 28 (non-inferiority margin of 5%).

        2. a less invasive intervention is not only non-inferior but also superior to usual care in
           terms of mortality.

      Multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled, open, two-parallel group, non-inferiority
      clinical trial.

             cuff placement impossible

          -  Patient for whom an Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy (either
             veno-arterial or venous-venous) is already in place or is to be initiated within the
             next 6 hours

          -  Patient treated with vasopressor doses of more than 2.5 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine
             tartrate plus epinephrine for at least 2 hours (i.e., for instance, more than 8 mg of
             norepinephrine tartrate in 50 mL at the rate of 66 mL/hour for a patient weighing 70
             kg) (please note that in fact this dosage corresponds to 1.25 μg/kg/min of
             norepinephrine base)

          -  Severe traumatic brain injury (i.e., traumatic brain injury with a Glasgow coma scale
