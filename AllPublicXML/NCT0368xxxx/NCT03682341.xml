      the relationship between FOXO3A-bim pathway gene polymorphisms and ovarian reserve function
      of paitients with ovarian endometrioma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian reserve refers to the left ovarian cortex follicle growth, development, the quantity
      and quality of potential ability of oocytes, reflects the fertility in women. Ovarian
      endometrioms have an effect on ovarian reserve function. Oxidative stress is one of the
      important reasons. The effect has individual differences and the mechanisms are not
      clear.FOXO3A-bim pathway gene polymorphisms have been reported to related to individual
      variation of ovarian reserve function of paitients with POF. Our working hypothesis is that
      FOXO3A-bim pathway gene polymorphisms are also related to ovarian reserve function of
      paitients with ovarian endometrioma. In recent 10 years, we have set up a database including
      more than 2000 cases of ovarian endometrioma. In this project, we are going to investigate
      the oxidative stress factors, the level of sexual hormone, ultrasound information and the
      relationship between FOXO3A-bim pathway gene polymorphism.All these multi-diciplinary
      research will lead to novel understanding of individual variation of ovarian reserve
      function.
