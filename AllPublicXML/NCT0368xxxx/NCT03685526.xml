      The study is designed as a prospective, nonrandomized, exploratory, single center,
      first-in-man study. The objective of this study is to evaluate its safety and feasibility of
      the CinensesTM Lung Volume Reduction Reverser System in patients with severe emphysema. The
      study will also collect clinical data up to 6-month follow-up to explore its safety and
      effectiveness.

    <description>Lung Volume Reduction Reverser System is show as figure 1-4, consists of lung volume reduction reverser (short as: reverser), conveyor, measuring guide wire and transporting sheath. Matrix of reverser is nickel titanium alloy, its surface is coated by polymer flexible film, at the end of the connection segment is specially designed connector, which is easy for the reverser's transport and recycling. The silica gel part at the far end of reverser makes it softer.</description>
