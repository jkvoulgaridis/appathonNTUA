      In this study, the investigator try to select 80 patients who received radical surgery for
      pancreatic cancer, whose circulating tumor cells(CTCs) count then performed on intraoperative
      portal venous blood to predict postoperative liver metastasis and were divided into two
      groups. for those who have high CTCs count may have more chance for the occurrence of
      postoperative liver metastasis was applied hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy with
      minimal dynamic randomization. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility of hepatic arterial
      infusion chemotherapy for the prevention of postoperative liver metastasis and improvement of
      prognosis of pancreatic cancer, so as to further improve postoperative management of
      pancreatic cancer
