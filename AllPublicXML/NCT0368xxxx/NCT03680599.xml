  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to develop and test Connection to Health for Smokers (CTHS), a
      comprehensive program to support smokers to quit and improve smokers' general health. The
      program will be designed for implementation by health educators in community health centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a participatory approach to develop and test the feasibility and
      acceptability of CTHS in community health center sites in Contra Costa County. Development of
      the program will be informed by active engagement with a patient advisory group composed of
      current smokers and clinical team members who serve current smokers in community health
      centers. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed by implementing the CTHS program for
      patients in 3 clinical sites, using the RE-AIM evaluation framework. Primary outcomes will
      include the number and proportion of enrolled smokers who create at least one health-related
      action plan with a health educator, and stated intention of clinical teams to continue using
      CTHS after the research. The investigators will enroll 90 smokers in CTHS and 90 additional
      smokers in Enhanced Standard of Care (ESC) which will be the active comparison group.
      Participants will be randomly assigned. Smoking status will be reassessed after 3 months.
      Primary outcomes will include number of 24-hour quit attempts, and 7-day smoking abstinence,
      as well as changes in self-efficacy and readiness to quit smoking among participants who do
      not quit. Results of this pilot program will inform further development of the CTHS program
      for testing in larger scale clinical trials.
