    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of unloader knee brace, biomechanical footwear device and
      exercise therapy on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis. The aim is to find more effective treatment strategies to delay or prevent
      heavy knee replacement surgeries.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of exercising, and using a knee brace and
      exercising, and using of biomechanical footwear device on clinically important symptoms,
      physical function and quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The
      hypothesis is that the groups of using knee brace and biomechanical footwear can alleviate
      pain, improve physical function and quality of life more efficiently, than the group doing
      home exercises only.

      The subjects (n = 120) will be randomized into three groups mentioned above, after which they
      will start to do exercises, or to use a knee brace and do exercises, or to use biomechanical
      footwear at home according to the instructions for 4 months. Physical function, symptoms and
      quality of life will be measured before and after 4-month intervention. In addition, at
      12-month time point follow-up surveys will be addressed with regard to symptoms and quality
      of life, as well as to cost-effectiveness of the study.

    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)-questionnaire evaluates the condition of patients with knee osteoarthritis including pain, stiffness and physical function. In the subscale of pain (score range 0 - 500), stiffness (score range 0 - 200), and functional limitation (score range 0 - 1700) lower values represent a better outcome. In order to normalize each score on 0 - 100 scales, the following correction factors are used: pain 0.20, stiffness 0.50, functional limitation 0.059.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline physical activity at 4 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The short form of International Physical Activity (IPAQ-SF) questionnaire measures data on Health-Related Physical Activity. The IPAQ-SF Records the activity of four intensity levels (vigorous-intensity, moderate-intensity, walking, sitting) for the last 7 days. Results are reported as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week). To calculate MET minutes a week the MET value given (walking = 3.3, moderate activity = 4, vigorous activity = 8) is multiplied by the minutes the activity was carried out and again by the number of days that the activity was undertaken. To get total MET minutes of physical activity a week, the MET minutes achieved in each category are added together. Higher MET-values represent better outcome.</description>
