  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project will be to evaluate the impact of the insertion of new complete
      denture (CD) in the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in total edentulous patients
      comparing to dentate individuals. This is an clinical trial study approved at the Research
      Ethics Committee (nº 31105714.7.0000.5626 ) which will be conducted in 100 patients attended
      in the clinics of Federal Fluminense Unniversity, with necessity of CD. The eligibility
      criteria will included: healthy patients without disabilities; aged up to 50 years; complete
      upper and or lower jaw edentulism for a minimum 5 years; the presence of adequate healthy
      tissue to support the prosthesis; adequate cognitive ability and understanding to respond to
      the questions posed. It will be excluded patient with motor disabilities, cognitive
      impairment and people with special needs. After the installation of the CD a follow-up of one
      week, three, six, nine, twelve and eighteen months will be performed. The Oral Health Impact
      Profile (OHIP-Edent) instrument will be applied (in form of interview) to evaluate the impact
      of CD on OHRQoL. The scores of the OHIP-Edent index will be calculated using the additive
      method, summing the numeric response codes for each item. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be
      performed to evaluate the normality of the data to determine the use of parametric or
      non-parametric test. Mean or median comparisons will be made for items in the overall scale
      and subscale scores for the all situations (one week, three, six, nine, twelve and eighteen
      months). The responsiveness will be assessed by analyzing the change of the scores on the
      scales and subscales. The changes will be calculated by subtracting the post-treatment scores
      from the before treatment scores. Positive change scores will indicate an improvement in
      OHRQoL, while negative scores will indicate deterioration.

    <description>Steps: 1) Preliminary impressions will be done using stock trays and impression compound; 2) primary casts will be fabricated to make custom trays for definitive impressions; 3) definitive impressions will be made using zinc oxide eugenol impression paste;4) definitive impressions will be poured with type III dental stone to obtain mastercasts; 5)jaw relations will be recorded, and the casts will be mounted on the articulator; 6) the artificial acrylic resin teeth will be arranged, esthetics will be verified, and the trial dentures will be flasked and polymerized (72°C per 12 hours). The dentures will be finished and polished for insertion and follow-up. After denture insertion, post-denture insertion instructions such as oral hygiene will be explained to the patients.
The Oral Health Related to Quality of Life assessment will be conducted before treatment (Baseline) and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after treatment.</description>
