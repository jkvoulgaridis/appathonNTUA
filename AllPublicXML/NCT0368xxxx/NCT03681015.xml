  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate disease progression in persons with early Parkinson
      disease, as assessed by digital and electronic sensor data collection to be correlated with
      typical clinical assessments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be evaluated via both in-clinic and at-home assessments. The in-clinic
      assessments are designed to compare the ability of current Parkinson disease clinical trial
      measures with the ability of mobile and wearable devices to detect disease progression in the
      early stage of disease. The at-home assessments are designed to determine the feasibility of
      motor and non-motor assessments of disease progression using a commercially available
      wearable device/mobile application platform and to determine how this data compares with
      traditional clinical measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to give written informed consent, as determined by the investigator.

          2. Subjects must have at least two of the following: resting tremor, bradykinesia,
             rigidity (must have either resting tremor or bradykinesia as one of two symptoms); OR
             either asymmetric resting tremor or asymmetric bradykinesia.

          3. Screening dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT scan is consistent with dopamine
             transporter deficit.

          4. A diagnosis of Parkinson disease for 2 years or less at screening.

          5. Modified Hoehn and Yahr stage I or II at screening.

          6. Not expected to require PD medication for at least 6 months from baseline (includes
             dopaminergics, MAO-B inhibitors, and anti-cholinergics used to treat PD-related
             symptoms).

          7. Male or female age 30 years or older at time of PD diagnosis.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be using highly effective
             contraception within 30 days prior to DaTscan (e.g., oral contraceptives, a barrier
             method of birth control (e.g., condoms with contraceptive foam, diaphragm with
             contraceptive jelly), intrauterine device, partner with vasectomy or sexual
             abstinence).

             methyldopa, reserpine, or amphetamine derivative) must be willing and able from a
