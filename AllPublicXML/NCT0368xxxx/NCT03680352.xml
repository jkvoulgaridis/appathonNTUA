  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, PK and safety study of a single dose of AAI101
      in combination with cefepime in male and female subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 1,
      n = 6), moderate renal impairment (Group 2, n = 6), severe renal impairment (Group 3, n = 6),
      ESRD requiring dialysis (Group 4, n = 6), and normal renal function (Group 5, n = 6) as
      defined using the estimated value for creatinine clearance (CLcr) at Screening.

      The study consists of a 28-day screening period, followed by a single dose administration of
      AAI101 in combination with cefepime antibiotic on Day 1, an in house period (assessment
      period) and follow-up visit. All subjects will be confined to the study site from Day -1 (the
      day before dosing) until the morning of Day 3. The follow-up visits will occur on Day 7 (±2
      days), on Day 14 (±2 days), and on Day 30 (±2 days), if the results of the safety hepatic
      assessments are abnormal on Day 14 (±2 days).

      Group 4 (ESRD requiring dialysis) will have 2 in-house periods (separated by at least 7
      days), and will receive the single doses of AAI101 in combination with cefepime antibiotic
      once after dialysis and once before dialysis. The follow-up visit for Group 4 will occur on
      Day 7 (±2 days), on Day 14 (±2 days), and on Day 30 (±2 days), if the results of the safety
      hepatic assessments are abnormal on Day 14 (±2 days), counting from Day 1 of the second
      period.
