  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Canada. Most patients with this cancer
      will undergo treatment with major chest surgery that is associated with serious
      complications. As many as 50% of patients will suffer respiratory complications after
      surgery, keeping them in the hospital for extended periods of time. These long
      hospitalizations have a dramatic negative effect on the lives of those people, in addition to
      a large cost burden on our healthcare system. Traditionally, patients who suffer from
      complications are treated with rehabilitation AFTER the complications have occurred. But what
      if complications can be prevented BEFORE they happen? Having major chest surgery imposes
      great stress on the human body, one that is equivalent to running a marathon. Analogous to
      training before completing a marathon, the investigator designed Move For Surgery (MFS), a
      novel preconditioning program that encourages and empowers patients to improve their health
      prior to surgery. The investigator aims to demonstrate that patients who train with Move For
      Surgery will have lower respiratory complication rates, will recover better, and will leave
      the hospital sooner than their counterparts.

    <measure>The primary outcome of the comparative trial will be length of stay (LOS) in hospital after surgery, which will also be used to measure speed of recovery from surgery and postoperative complications.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>LOS is a good surrogate measure for the speed of recovery from surgery (patients who recover faster leave hospital earlier) and postoperative complications (patients who do not suffer complications leave the hospital earlier).</description>
