    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study to compare
      the clinical outcomes of two trifocal IOLs differing in the dominance of additional power.
      The investigational device POD L GF shows dominance for the intermediate addition (+1.75 D),
      whereas the control device POD F GF shows dominance for the near addition (+3.5 D).
      Implantation of the IOLs is bilaterally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study
      whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of
      trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted with the hydrophobic IOL
      FineVision POD L GF or the hydrophobic IOL FineVision POD F GF (both lenses: (PhysIOL, Liège,
      Belgium).

      The devices under investigation (FineVision POD L GF and POD F GF) are trifocal
      glistening-free acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study
      PhysIOL sa/nv. Both consist of the same hydrophobic material. The main difference between the
      lenses is the dominance of additional power. The investigational device POD L GF shows
      dominance for the intermediate addition (+1.75 D), whereas the control device POD F GF shows
      dominance for the near addition (+3.5 D). The IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine
      cataract surgery on patients suffering from cataract development.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 10 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 7 postoperative) over a period of 6 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary and secondary endpoint data will be collected at the 6 months follow up visit. Data
      analyses will be done after the last patient finished the final examination to support the
      study publication plan.

    <time_frame>3 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcomes measures of a questionnaire to address the general patient satisfaction and possible side effects of the treatment. For this study, the validated and verified questionnaire VFQ-25 (National Eye Institute) will be used. This questionnaire consists of 25 questions. Each answer is scaled between a score of 0 and 100 according to a predefined calculation algorithm, with 100 always being the best possible outcome.
Additionally subscales are calculated as an average value of several answers belonging to the same set of questions.
The subscales are:
General Health
General Vision
Ocular Pain
Near Activities
Distance Activities
Social Functioning
Mental Health
Role Difficulties
Dependancy
Driving
Color Vision
Peripheral Vision</description>
