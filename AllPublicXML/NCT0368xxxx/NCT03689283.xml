  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would be the first study to assess the immediate effects of dry needling of latent
      trigger points of the gastrocnemius muscle on muscle stiffness, gait, range of motion, and
      strength. The study has the potential to demonstrate that dry needling may have immediate
      effects on mechanical properties of muscle and may thus guide future treatment for
      individuals with changes in muscle tissue secondary to pain and/or injury.

      Participants will complete the following tests: muscle stiffness testing in both a relaxed
      and contracted position, GAITRite for spatial and temporal gait characteristics, the Ankle
      Lunge Test (ALT) to assess range of motion, and calf strength using a dynamometer. Subjects
      will then receive treatment according to which group they are randomized. Muscle stiffness,
      gait, motion and strength will be reassessed immediately following treatment at the first
      session. Four to10 days later, participants will complete the same tests and measures prior
      to treatment being administered a second time. Another 4-10 days after the second session,
      participants will complete the tests and measures one final time.
