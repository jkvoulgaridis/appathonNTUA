  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative
      ultrasound-guided axillary lymph node biopsy for staging in patients with newly diagnosed
      breast cancer, and also to compare between ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology
      and core needle biopsy in their ability to detect metastatic disease in the axillary lymph
      nodes of patients with breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Axillary lymph node status is an extremely important prognostic factor in the assessment and
      treatment evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Historically, axillary
      lymph node dissection (ALND) has been the reference standard for diagnosis and staging.
      However, this procedure can cause numerous postoperative problems, such as lymphedema , pain,
      impaired shoulder mobility and arm weakness. Furthermore, in this era of mammographic
      screening, axillary lymph node dissection yields negative results in 80%-85% of patients with
      T1 cancer.

      Therefore, in recent years, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) has replaced axillary dissection
      for lymph node staging at major medical centers. However, there are some practical issues to
      be resolved. For example, radiotracer distribution can be slow or faulty, valuable operating
      room time is expended, and pathologists must make quick decisions based on the analysis of
      frozen sections or there is the need to undergo two surgical interventions (i.e., removal of
      primary tumor and SNB, and in a next step completion ALND). If nodal positivity could be
      proven and documented preoperatively, sentinel lymph node biopsy could be bypassed and a
      decision will be made to perform axillary dissection, which is the standard of care in most
      node-positive patients.
