  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn about changes in the brain that occur during Engage, a
      psychotherapy for depression in older adults, and how they may differ from changes that occur
      during supportive therapy. Older adults with depression will receive 9 weeks of either Engage
      or supportive therapy and will complete research assessments before the therapy begins and at
      weeks 3, 6, and 9 of treatment. Research assessments will include questionnaires, computer
      tasks, and recordings of electrical brain activity (also called electroencephalography or
      EEG).

    <textblock>
      Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most
      effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions
      such as Engage - a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for
      late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of neural reward systems. This
      study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other reward system measures to assess
      target engagement in depressed older adults receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group
      of depressed peers receiving supportive therapy. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either Engage or supportive therapy and will complete research assessments at baseline and
      weeks 3, 6, and 9 (end of treatment).

    <measure>Change in behavioral activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral activation will be measured using the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS), a 25-item measure of behaviors targeted in behavioral activation therapies such as Engage. Higher scores on this measure indicate more participation in activities and social interactions, and lower scores indicate more social isolation, rumination, and avoidance of activities.</description>

    <description>Engage therapy is designed to help individuals with depression become involved in activities they previously enjoyed but have not been participating in since developing depression. In Engage therapy, individuals with depression work with a therapist to develop &quot;action plans&quot; to pursue rewarding activities of their choice.</description>

    <description>Supportive therapy is designed to provide a warm and supportive environment in which individuals with depression can feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings. In supportive therapy, therapists help patients identify themes in their thinking, provide reassurance, emphasize coping skills, and provide guidance as needed.</description>
