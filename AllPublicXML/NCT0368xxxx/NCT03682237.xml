  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of flash glucose monitoring (FGM) with traditional
      self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with or without carbohydrate counting and automated
      bolus calculation, in patients with type 1 diabetes and poor metabolic control.

      The investigators will include in total 200 patients recruited from 5 clinical sites in the
      Capital Region of Copenhagen.

      The patients will be randomized into four groups; A) Standard diabetes training, i.e. group
      training in in general diabetes health issues, B) Group training in carbohydrate counting and
      automated bolus calculation, the app MySugr will be taught and downloaded, C) Group training
      as in group A, and instructed to use FGM, D) Group training as in group B, and besides
      training in the use of the app MySugr, also instructed to use FGM.

      All patients are followed for 26 weeks with 6 clinical visits, group training (1 visit) and 2
      telephone consultations.

      The primary outcome is time spent in normoglycemia.

             alcohol and drug abuse

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment
             of the principle investigator, will compromise the results of the study or the safety
             of the subject

          -  Use of anti-diabetic medicine (other than insulin), corticosteroids or other drugs
             affecting glucose metabolism during the study period or within 30 days prior to study
