  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual-reality-based interactive treadmill system will be applied to the Parkinsons' disease
      patients who can walk (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 to 4). Subjects will be randomly allocated to
      either VR-based treadmill training group or treadmill training without VR-based interaction.
      The training will be provided for 3 sessions (30min/session)/week for 4weeks, the total of 12
      sessions. The outcomes will be measured at baseline, immediately after the completion of the
      intervention and 1 month after the intervention.

    <description>In this group, the subjects will receive virtual reality (VR)-based interactive treadmill training. During the 30-min training session, VR based interaction and feedback will be provided; the foot location will be visualized in the VR screen (semi-immersive condition), the obstacles will be seen in the screen from which subjects has to avoid, gait speed will be visualized, slopes of the treadmill will be changed according to the slope changes in VR and distractors will be added. Dual tasks will also be provided. Subjects in this group will receive a 30min/session, 3 sessions/week for 4 weeks, the total of 12 sessions of VR-based training.</description>
