  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bioequivalence study is proposed to be carried out on patients of ovarian cancer, who are
      already receiving or who in the opinion of their treating physicians are candidates for
      Doxorubicin liposomal injection therapy .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open label, two arm, single dose, crossover bioequivalence study.
      This study will be conducted in female subjects aged 18 to 65 years diagnosed with ovarian
      cancer whose disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy and who are
      already receiving or scheduled to start therapy with Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome
      Injection product. Each subject will be randomized to one of the two treatment sequences (RT
      or TR) according to a randomization scheme prepared prior to start of the trial. Serial blood
      samples for determination of free and liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin plasma concentration
      for PK analysis will be obtained in each cycle., This study has an adaptive 2-stage design. A
      sufficient number of subjects with ovarian cancer shall be recruited to have approximately 42
      evaluable subjects completing all follow up procedures (Stage 1). An interim analysis of free
      and encapsulated doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage 1. If the bioequivalence
      of encapsulated and free doxorubicin has been established, then the study will be stopped.
      Otherwise, the study may continue into Stage 2 with additional number of ovarian cancer
      subjects. A final evaluation of bioequivalence based on free and encapsulated doxorubicin
      will be performed at the end of Stage 2 and will include all enrolled subjects completing the
      study. Bioequivalence criteria: the 94.12% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric
      means of TEST to REFERENCE for Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-âˆž, for free and encapsulated doxorubicin
      should be between 80.00% and 125.00%.
