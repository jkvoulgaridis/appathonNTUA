  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medical school educates students on essential skills, which is an important task.
      Especially, endotracheal intubation is considered an important option in the management of
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

      To avoid technical and ethical concerns of training involving real patients, conventional
      teaching methods incorporate the use of a low-fidelity manikin in replacement. However, the
      manikin anatomy often lacks the realism of a live human.

      The addition of virtual reality technology may optimize learning by providing an ethical,
      cost-effective and more realistic modality to acquire the basic skills of intubation. If it
      is proven to be effective, efforts to integrate virtual reality technology into routine
      training of such procedures in the medical school should be promoted.

      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of virtual reality mobile application to
      conventional training will improve procedural skill dexterity and proficiency and hence,
      improve learner's satisfaction and confidence in performing endotracheal intubation.
