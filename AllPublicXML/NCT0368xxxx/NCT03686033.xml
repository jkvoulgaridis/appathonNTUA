  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of E2082 as
      measured by suppression of epileptic photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in the participant's most
      sensitive eye condition in participants with photosensitive epilepsy, compared to placebo.
