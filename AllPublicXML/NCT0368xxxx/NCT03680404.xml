  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine possible mechanisms of heightened vasoconstriction in
      Black/African American men and women as possible links to the elevated prevalence of
      cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. The main targets in this study are sources of
      oxidative stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) afflicts nearly one-third of the adult population with all races
      and ethnicities represented in CVD prevalence. Unfortunately, a disparity exists such that
      the black population (BL) is disproportionately affected compared to other groups, including
      the white population (WH). While the underlying cause of this disparity is multifactorial,
      vascular dysfunction (i.e., impaired vasodilation and/or augmented vasoconstriction) is a key
      contributor. As has been previously observed, BL exhibit a heightened vasoconstrictor
      response to both pharmacological (e.g., alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists) and environmental
      (e.g., cold pressor test) stimuli compared to their WH counterparts. Additionally, reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability may
      partially mediate this response.

      Interestingly, the small blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous microvasculature) in BL, but
      otherwise healthy individuals, produce an impaired blood flow response to local heating when
      compared to age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and gender-matched WH. However, pre-treatment of
      the cutaneous microvasculature with either allopurinol or apocynin (xanthine oxidase
      inhibitor and NADPH oxidase inhibitor, respectively) abolishes this skin blood flow
      difference. These drugs inhibit possible sources of ROS, which, as mentioned, may be
      mediating the heightened vasoconstrictor response in BL. Accordingly, apocynin administration
      in previous research using an animal model ameliorates alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated
      vasoconstriction, possibly due to a reduction in ROS. The role of xanthine/NADPH oxidase and
      the production of ROS on alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in humans
      remains unknown.

    <description>Determine to what degree superoxide, either generally available or produced through xanthine/NADPH oxidases, contributes to heightened phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Following local coninfusions of phenylephrine with apocynin, allopurinol, or tempol, the changes in blood flux will be quantified using laser Doppler fluxmetry.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals (ages 18-35, both genders) will be recruited from the greater Arlington
             area to participate in the study.

          -  Must self-report both parents as either African American or Caucasian American.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have donated more than 550 ml of blood within the past 8 weeks will
             not have blood drawn from them in this protocol. However, if they remain interested in
             the study, and otherwise meet the inclusion criteria, than we may still opt to proceed
             with data collection.

          -  Individuals with cardiovascular, neurological, and/or metabolic illnesses will be
             excluded from participating as well as individuals with a history of various diseases
             of the microvasculature including Reynaud's disease, cold-induced urticaria,
             cryoglobulinemia, etc.

          -  Subjects currently taking any prescription medications and individuals with a body
             mass index about 30 kg/m2) will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant subjects and children (i.e. younger than 18) will not be recruited for the
             study. Eligible females will be scheduled for days 2-7 of their menstrual cycle to
             account for hormonal effects on blood flow. A regular menstrual cycle is required to
             identify and schedule the study for the low hormone period, therefore females who lack
             a regular cycle will be excluded from the study. Females currently taking birth
             control are eligible, as long as they can be scheduled during a low-hormone &quot;placebo&quot;
             week. If their hormone do not contain a placebo week than these individuals will not
             be eligible for data collection. Females who are breast-feeding will also be eligible
             as there are no systemic or lasting effects of the proposed vasoactive agents.

          -  Given that smoking can affect the peripheral vasculature, current smokers and
             individuals who regularly smoked (&gt;1 pack per two weeks) within the prior 2 years will
             be excluded
