      Determining acceptability and usability of a wearable open-source speech processing platform
      (Master Hearing Aid) developed for hearing-aid research
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Part 1 Speech perception tests. You will hear words and sentences under a variety of
      listening conditions and be asked either to either repeat them or to select what you heard
      from a set of options. You will also answer a few questions about the speech and the
      background noise. The goal is to determine the ability of the most recent version of the
      device to deliver good quality speech that is comfortable and understandable over a range of
      conditions that are representative of everyday listening.

      Part 2. Suitability and Acceptability. You will be asked to respond to a short structured
      interview about the device. If the device has reached a wearable stage, you will wear it
      outside the laboratory while engaging in discussion with one of the researchers before
      completing the interview. The goal is to obtain the opinions of persons with hearing loss
      about the device itself, and about their willingness to wear it as a hearing aid in their
      everyday life, if they were to be involved in a research study.

      Part 3 is a focus-group session with about 10 hearing-aid users, some of whom will have
      participated in Parts 1 and 2. Topics will deal with hearing aids in general and about the
      current version of the experimental device. Discussion will be recorded for later
      transcription and analysis. The goal is to gain the perspective of hearing-aid users about
      hearing aids, hearing-aid research, and the acceptability of this experimental device for
      field research.

    <description>Participants will repeat prerecorded single syllable words presented at varying levels levels from a loudspeaker. Performance will be assessed as the percentage of speech sounds correctly repeated and will be measured while wearing the speech-processing platform as set before and after self-adjustment.

    <description>Participants will be accompanied by a researcher while wearing the open-source speech processing platform as a hearing aid - adjusted to their needs using a widely accepted Fitting prescription. Using a hand-held controller, they will readjust to their liking as the acoustic conditions change. After returning to the laboratory, they will complete speech perception tests using under their self-selected amplification conditions and respond to a structured interview dealing with perceived performance of the device and its acceptability as a hearing aid during possible field studies.</description>
