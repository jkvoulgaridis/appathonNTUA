  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing concern in Europe, vaccination coverage is
      inadequate, and young adults, who are the highest antibiotic consumers, have the lowest level
      of knowledge. Extension of the e-Bug project, a European educational school programme
      concerning microbes, antibiotics and vaccination, to 15-18-year-olds implies the development
      of educational resources based on social marketing to promote sustainable behavioural
      changes. The objectives of the present study, which is part of the needs assessment in
      France, are to explore the attitudes, knowledge and behaviour of 15-18-year-olds concerning
      antibiotics and vaccination and their health education needs.

      Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted using purposeful sampling of 15- to
      18-year-olds, until data saturation, and were transcribed and analysed.
