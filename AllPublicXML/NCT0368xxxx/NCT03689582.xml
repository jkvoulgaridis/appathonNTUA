  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out whether imaging of the prostate with a new molecule
      called 68Ga-PSMA can find prostate cancer. 68Ga-PSMA has been shown in a large number of
      patients to be useful to find recurring prostate cancer following initial cancer treatment.
      This study is performed to test 68Ga-PSMA whether it can be used to find prostate cancers
      that would be considered in need for treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, two different imaging tests are being compared: a) 68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) and b) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the
      prostate gland. Participants already have received the MRI, and this test resulted either
      suspicious or definitive for prostate cancer. Both tests (MRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) are
      expected to show tumor tissue when more aggressive, but one test could be more accurate than
      the other test.

      Another important question is whether these imaging tests will perform as good or better than
      prostate biopsies in finding all prostate cancer lesions in need for treatment. If imaging
      would be comparable or better than biopsies, then imaging may be able to replace invasive
      biopsies for some indications in the future.

      To investigate these questions, participants are asked to undergo a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT before a
      planned prostate biopsy procedure. After the biopsy procedure is performed, investigators
      will compare the imaging results from 68Ga-PSMA with those from the MRI and determine which
      test is more accurate.
