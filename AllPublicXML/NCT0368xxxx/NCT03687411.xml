  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuraxial ultrasonography has been shown a safe and effective technique to enhance the
      overall success rate of lumbar puncture and reduce the number of injection attempts. However,
      the current blind palpation landmark technique is known to be highly inaccurate and may
      increase the risk of multiple insertion attempts, patient suffering and complication rates
      such as spinal cord injury. Various clinical studies have confirmed the effectiveness of
      ultrasound imaging compared with the traditional palpation method. However, none of the
      present system can achieve real-time guidance.

      The overall aim of this proposal is to develop an ultrasound guided automated spinal landmark
      identification with real-time neuraxial needle insertion system to improve patient safety and
      efficacy of neuraxial procedure needle insertion success. This will be achieved in 2 phases
      of technology development and clinical trial phases. The investigators will recruit 20
      subjects in a prospective cohort study to investigate the spinal needle first attempt success
      rate as a clinically relevant outcome. The secondary aim is to develop an automated spinal
      landmark identification algorithm using image processing to identify spinal landmarks in 50
      obese patients within 12 months.

      The investigators have set out objectives for regulatory development, technical disclosure
      and transfer of developed technology to industry partner at the end of the project.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of ultrasound guided
      automated spinal landmark identification with real-time neuraxial needle insertion system
      (ULTRA-SINE).

      The subjects assume a seated position and the lower back is exposed. Ultrasound gel will be
      applied to the lower back lumbar spine and the investigator will place an ultrasound curved
      array probe around the sacral region. The graphical interface of the software, integrated
      with the wireless ultrasound probe and ultrasound machine, will inform the investigator when
      the software has positively identified the sacrum. The investigator will then move the probe
      in a steady vertical upward longitudinal direction until the L3/4 interspinous space is
      identified by the program. The ultrasound algorithm will identify the skin surface marking.
      The longitudinal section of the scan will be completed and the investigator will turn the
      probe 90 degrees clockwise around the probe center to the transverse view.

      The transverse scan consists of minimal vertical movements by the investigator who will
      obtain images using the ultrasound probe. The software will signal when the correct
      identification of the ligamentum flavum is visualized. The scan sequence will be completed.

      The first phase will involve 20 non-obese patients who are undergoing neuraxial anaesthesia
      or analgesia. The system is used prior and during needle insertion to provide real-time
      guidance for the anaesthetists. The neuraxial needle insertion is conducted manually by the
      anaesthetist as per routine practice.

      In the second phase, 50 obese patients (body mass index more than 30) will be recruited to
      investigate and develop an &quot;obesity&quot; mode visualisation of the ultrasound guided automated
      spinal landmark identification. This will be to advance the technology to evaluate more
      difficult anatomy and more complex neuraxial needle insertion in future work plan. The
      patients' back will be scanned to obtain the images. The neuraxial needle insertion is
      conducted manually (i.e. independent of the ultrasound results) by the anaesthetist as per
      hospital routine practice.

    <description>There will be two phases in this proposed neuraxial ultrasonography with real-time neuraxial needle insertion system. In first phase attending anaesthetist will use the automated spinal landmark system for neuraxial needle insertion to place the neuraxial anaesthesia in non-obese patients. For the second phase, obese patients will have ultrasound scan of their lumbar back and no needle insertion is involved.</description>
