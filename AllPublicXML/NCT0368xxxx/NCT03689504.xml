  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot quasi-experimental study to evaluate the impact of adding a family garden
      intervention to an existing wrap-around nutrition intervention for children with chronic
      malnutrition and their family. The existing nutrition intervention is provided by community
      health workers affiliated with Wuqu' Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance. A single community in
      rural Guatemala will participate in the intervention, with the goal to recruit approximately
      70 families in the combined nutrition/garden intervention. A nearby community, also
      participating in the nutrition intervention, will serve as a nonrandom contemporaneous
      control.

      Aims of the study include:

        1. Evaluate the impact of the garden intervention on maternal and child dietary diversity,
           child growth and household food insecurity.

        2. Use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to
           conduct a preliminary implementation analysis, to guide a future, well-controlled study.
