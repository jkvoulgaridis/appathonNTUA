      The purpose of the study is to compare cosmetic outcomes of simple facial lacerations in
      children repaired with Dermabond (skin glue) compared with Dermabond (skin glue) with
      underlying steristrips (skin adhesive strips).

    <description>cosmetic scar outcome; photo will be taken of scar at 2 months and graded using a visual analog scale (VAS) by blinded reviewers. The VAS is a 0-100mm standardized scale where 0mm represents the &quot;worst scar&quot; and 100mm represents the &quot;best scar&quot; and reviewers will place a marking along the line of where they feel the scar belongs.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 (physician will complete just after the repair)</time_frame>
    <description>Physicians will complete a VAS (visual analog scale) on how easy the laceration was to repair. The VAS is a 0-100mm scale where 0 will represent &quot;very easy&quot; and 100mm will represent &quot;very difficult&quot; to repair and the physician will mark along the scale.</description>
