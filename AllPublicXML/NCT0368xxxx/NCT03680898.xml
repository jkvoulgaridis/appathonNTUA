  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this clinical investigation is to establish the performance of the
      GenePOC Carba assay on the revogene. This will be achieved by comparing the test to a
      conventional method for detection of Carbapenemase Producing Organisms (CPOs) in rectal swab
      samples.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GenePOC Carba assay will be performed using the revogene instrument. The revogene
      instrument, used in conjunction with appropriate reagents, is capable of automated cell
      lysis, dilution of nucleic acids from multiple sample types as well as automated
      amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences.

      The GenePOC Carba assay reagents kits consist of:

        1. Sample Buffer Tube (SBT)

        2. Disposable Transfer Tool (DTT)

        3. Disposable microfluidic cartridges (PIE)

      The test is performed using the revogeneâ„¢. The revogene automates sample homogenization,
      sample dilution, cells lysis, DNA amplification, and detection of the amplified PCR products.
      User intervention is only required for discharging the patient sample into the Sample Buffer
      Tube (SBT), transferring the sample into the PIE, and loading/unloading the PIEs into the
      revogene carousel.

      A dual swab sample is collected when ICF is signed by patient. One of the swab is transferred
      into the SBT and vortexed. Sample is then transferred to the GenePOC Carba PIE. The PIE is
      then automatically processed by the revogene. On completion of a run, the user removes the
      processed PIEs from the instrument and discards them according to local biological waste
      management procedures.

      One revogene will be allocated per site. The purpose of this clinical trial is to enroll
      sufficient patients from up to 14 Clinical Centers to meet regulatory requirements, based on
      the Reference Method final results.
