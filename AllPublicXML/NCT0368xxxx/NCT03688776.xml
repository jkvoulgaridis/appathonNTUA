  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare nicotine uptake and product use behavior during and
      following use of two moist snuff products in generally healthy, adult moist snuff users.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an single-blind, multi-center, randomized, two-way crossover study, conducted in
      generally healthy, adult moist snuff users who will be randomly assigned to the order in
      which they will use two moist snuff study products (comparator product, test product). The
      study will evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) measures for two moist snuff products in a 7-day
      confinement setting.
