    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Lymphedema is a pathologic soft tissue swelling that arises secondary to
      disruption of the lymphatic system. Lymphedema affects approximately 250 million people
      worldwide and causes significant physical and psychological morbidity. There is no definitive
      treatment for lymphedema. Lymphovenous bypass - microsurgically anastomosing lymphatic
      channels and venules - has demonstrated promising results in the treatment of lymphedema.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of lymphovenous bypass in
      treating extremity lymphedema. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-arm, cohort study.
      Eligible patients between 18-70 years of age with extremity lymphedema will undergo
      lymphovenous bypass. The primary outcome measure will be extremity volume and the secondary
      outcome measure will be quality of life assessed by a validated assessment tool for
      lymphedema of the limbs (LYMQOL). Patients will be assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 9,
      and 12-months postoperatively. Each participant will serve as their own control.

      Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed with paired t-tests. With a sample
      size of 9 patients we will have at least 80% power to reject the null hypothesis assuming an
      alpha level of 0.01. To further increase the power and to account for patients lost to
      follow-up the investigators will target a patient recruitment of 20.

      The findings of this study will help further elucidate the role of lymphovenous bypass in the
      treatment of extremity lymphedema.

    <intervention_name>Lymphovenous bypass</intervention_name>
    <description>Lymphovenous bypass will be performed under general anesthetic. Indocyanine green lymphangiography will be performed by injecting indocyanine green into each finger / toe web of the lymphedematous limb and mapping the lymphatic system with the NOVADAQ SPY Fluorescence Imaging (Mississauga, Canada).
Subdermal dissection of lymphatics and venules will be carried out under a surgical microscope. Lymphatic vessels will be anastomosed to adjacent recipient venules to create the bypass between the lymphatic and the venous systems. In total, 1-5 anastomoses will be performed. This will require 1-5 incisions, each with a length of 2-3 cm.
Postoperatively, the limb will be wrapped loosely with compression bandages. No special postoperative monitoring is required.
The surgery will be performed on an outpatient basis with no planned hospital stay.</description>
