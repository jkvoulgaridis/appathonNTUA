      A randomized comparison of the live birth rate between the progestin-primed ovarian
      stimulation protocol and the gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonist protocol in patients
      undergoing in vitro fertilization

      Research question Does the live birth rate of the progestin-primed ovarian stimulation
      protocol comparable with the GnRH antagonist protocol for patients undergoing IVF?

      Design This is a randomized controlled trial.

      Research plan

      Population: Infertile women who have medical indication for IVF will be recruited for study
      if they fulfil the selection criteria.

      Intervention: Women will receive oral dydrogesterone 20mg daily from Day 3 till the day of
      ovulation trigger.

      Comparator: Women will receive antagonist (Cetrorelix 0.25mg) once subcutaneously daily from
      day 6 of ovarian stimulation till the day of the ovulation trigger.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome is the live birth rate the first FET.

      Ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, embryos frozen and frozen embryo transfer will be
      performed according to the standard operating procedures of the centres.
