      the aim of the study is to establish reference data that could be used for the creation of
      more accurate three dimensional prediction of soft tissue outcome.

    <textblock>
      in this study, 15 skeletal class 2 orthognathic patients will be selected. CBCT and proface
      will be done preoperatively. after the surgery and 6 months later the imaging investigations
      will be repeated to investigate the soft tissue changes that have resulted due to the bone
      movement.
