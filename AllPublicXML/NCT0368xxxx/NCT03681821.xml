  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. The main
      treatment approach is radical surgery, and the auxiliary treatment may be chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, immunotherapy and other supportive therapies, which can increase the resection
      rate, reduce the recurrence rate, and improve the survival rate. Abdominoperineal resection
      with an ostomy and the formation of a permanent ostomy continue to be the primary and radical
      surgical approaches for many patients with rectal cancer, which results in the loss of
      defecation control function.

      Although ostomy-related surgery is a life-saving procedure in most cases, it inevitably
      elicits some complex and lifelong consequences, such as uncontrolled gas and stool emissions,
      disturbed patients' body images, and effects their social and sexual lives, which place heavy
      pressure on ostomy self-management.

      Some studies have revealed the various ways that patients' lives are affected by their stoma,
      including changes to their quality of life, body image, and social life, requiring coping and
      practical adjustments. Others have shown that not enough attention has been paid to patients'
      self-management abilities, with most care being provided by nurses or caregivers, leaving
      little opportunities for patients to manage on their own. Consequently, their self-management
      ability after discharge remains weak, especially their related knowledge and skills. Studies
      have shown that 33.0-80.4% of patients with an ostomy cannot cope with the problems
      encountered in ostomy care.

      Many scholars focused on the ability of early self-management in patients with an ostomy
      after discharge, and there were several issues in the field of stoma nursing care, such as
      insufficient discharge preparedness because of shortened hospital stays and a lack of
      systematic acquisition of related knowledge and skills. Others highlighted the paucity of
      attention paid to the post-discharge needs of patients with a stoma and a lack of formal
      training for follow-up.

      Currently, self-management programs for patients with an ostomy mainly focus on the passive
      problem-solving model led by nurses and less emphasize has been placed on the self-assessment
      of patients who passively accept relevant knowledge and skills. This is insufficient for the
      pertinence, continuity, operability, and promotion of self-management. It is essential to
      call for a patient-tailored and theoretical approach to improve self-management and promote
      rehabilitation.

      The transtheoretical model (TTM) is an empirically validated model of individual behavioral
      change, which involves progress through a series of stages to make a particular behavioral
      change. TTM-based interventions have been applied to facilitate health behavioral changes,
      such as physical exercise, smoking cessation, and weight management, studies of which
      continue to demonstrate positive effects. There have been few studies of patients with an
      ostomy using TTM as an interventional tool to provide continuous and dynamic education.
      Therefore, this study decided to investigate the use of an integrated method of incorporating
      TTM into patient instruction and to provide assistance to enhance the self-management ability
      of patients with an ostomy.

      The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a transtheoretical model (TTM)-based
      intervention on ostomy self-management on patients' stages of change, processes of change,
      decisional balance, and self-efficacy. The study's hypotheses were: (1) There would be no
      significant difference between the intervention group and the control group before the
      intervention, and after intervention there would be more patients in the intervention group
      than those in the control groups. (2) Patients in the intervention group would achieve
      greater improvement in the ability of self-management than those in the control group.

      This study was a randomized controlled trial according to the CONSORT guidelines. The sample
      comprised 55 men and 37 women (24 to 77 years old, mean ± standard deviation = 52.8 ± 11.13
      years). The study settings included three tertiary hospitals in Changsha, Hunan, China. The
      92 patients recruited were randomized into a control group and an intervention group.
      Instruments, including self-management behaviors, were assessed at the baseline, 2 days
      before discharge and after 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up. The chi-squared test, independent
      sample t test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.

      The study was a single blind, follow-up, randomized, controlled trial. Researchers recruited
      subjects from three Central South University-affiliated general tertiary hospitals in
      Changsha, Hunan province, China. And the whole trail was on the basis of the CONSORT
      statements. These three hospitals provided similar conventional care for patients with an
      ostomy. Study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of all
      participating centers before data collection began. All patients were screened by researchers
      for eligibility and then enrolled in the study if eligible and if the provided consent.

      Potential eligible participants were identified by researchers according to medical records
      at the colorectal surgery unit in each hospital. They were recruited with informed consent,
      and researchers explained the study purposes, procedures, benefits, and risks involved
      orally. The participants were then randomly allocated to the intervention or the control
      group according to a computer-generated block randomization list. A sequentially numbered and
      opaque , sealed envelope system was used by a non-investigator.

      The generated random numbers were put into consecutively numbered and opaque sealed
      envelopes. When enrolling and randomising a new participant, the enrolling investigators
      opened the sealed envelope after participant's name was written on next available envelopes;
      the enrolling investigators were blinded to the trial design and study hypotheses.

      Patients in the intervention group had access to conventional care, in addition to receiving
      the follow-up TTM-based intervention sessions. The intervention was provided by trained
      nurses, including one researcher and one enterostomal therapy (ET) nurse. The researcher was
      regarded as primary leader of the intervention sessions. The leader informed patients of the
      schedule for each session using the educational manual'All can do the same: a pro-change
      program for self-management of an ostomy' (developed by psychologists, nursing managers,
      experienced ET nurses, and researchers).

      Sessions were held in the meeting room in the unit four times: at baseline (T0), 2 days
      before discharge (T1), and at 1-month (T2) and 3-months (T3) after discharge, according to
      the assessment of their current stage of change delivered by filling the Stages of Change
      Subscale.

      No interventions were performed for the control group participants during the study. However,
      these patients received conventional care in the colorectal surgery units according to the
      three hospitals' similar nursing guidelines. Preoperative visits for brief psychological
      counseling and general postoperative health education for ostomy cleaning, stoma appliance
      use, and self-care skills were provided by ward nurses. Additionally, post-discharge
      telephone follow-up focused on an unstructured interview and general health inquiries. To
      minimize contamination bias, the health education was implemented to avoid simultaneous
      scheduling for the two groups.

      Data were collected by a research assistant who was blind to the study design and allocation
      of participants. At baseline, before randomization, socio-demographic and clinical
      characteristics were collected from medical records and personal interviews. The two groups
      of participants completed surveys after each follow-up via face to face interviews at
      baseline (T0), 2 days before discharge (T1), and at 1-month (T2) and 3-months (T3) after
      discharge. The last evaluation of scales was performed at 6-months (T4) of follow-up via
      telephone contact.

    <description>There were four subscales in the study, the stages of change subscale, the processes of change subscale, the decisional balance subscale, and the self-efficacy subscale.
The outcome 1 was measured by the stages of change subscale and aimed to determine changes from baseline the percentage of participants of stages of change at 3 months. This subscale consisted of one item: 'Would you participant in self-management behavior of ostomy regularly?), which assess the patients' stages of self-management behavioral change, with five statements representing each stage: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Patients were asked to select one suitable statement that exactly described their current condition of ostomy self-management .</description>

    <description>The outcome 2 was measured by the stages of change subscale and aimed to determine changes from baseline the scores of the processes of change subscale at 3 months. This subscale was used to assess whether patients have had any activities or experiences that can affect their self-management of ostomy. It comprised 23 items and two dimensions, including cognitive level and behavioral level. Each individual item was scored from 1 (never) to 5 (always), with higher scores indicating higher frequency use of the process. The Cronbach values of the two dimensions were 0.958 and 0.905 respectively.</description>

    <description>The outcome 3 was measured by the stages of change subscale and aimed to determine changes from baseline the scores of decisional balance subscale at 3 months. This subscale was developed to assess patients' various points of view on the method of ostomy self-management that they had undertaken. It covered two dimensions of 20 items including perceived benefits and perceived barriers. Each item was ranked on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (absolutely disagree) to 5 (absolutely agree). A higher score indicates a greater degree of agreement. The Cronbach's value of the perceived benefits and perceived barriers were 0.895 and 0.717, respectively.</description>

The scale consisted of eight items and aimed to assess patients' confidence in self-management. Each item is evaluated on a Likert-type scale (1-5). A higher score indicated stronger self-confidence. In this study, the Cronbach's coefficient level of the scale was 0.966 .</description>
