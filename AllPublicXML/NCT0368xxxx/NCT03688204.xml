  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess how a polygenic risk score (PRS) reported with the results of
      multi-gene panel testing affects the breast cancer risk management recommendations healthcare
      providers make to their patients. The PRS is a score based on small genetic changes, clinical
      history, and family history. The PRS is used to estimate remaining lifetime risk of
      developing breast cancer for patients with no personal history of breast cancer and an
      overall negative result from MGPT.

    <time_frame>First recommendations will be made within 45 days of the initial study visit. Second recommendations will be made within 75 days of the initial study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Breast Cancer Risk Management Recommendations are recorded at two separate times; first recommendations will be recorded by the investigator or his/her designee based on the results of MGPT only. After these recommendations are recorded, the complete report including the PRS will be released. Then the healthcare provider will record recommendations again based on the results of MGPT and PRS. The difference between these recommendations will be used as a measure of the effect a PRS has on breast cancer risk management recommendations made by healthcare providers.</description>

        The study population will include 2000 individuals with a family history of breast and/or
        ovarian cancer who present for genetic counseling at one of the investigative sites. The
        investigative sites will be clinics that regularly sees patients that meet the above
