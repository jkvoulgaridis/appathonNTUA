    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well two different supportive programs work in supporting optimal
      recovery in participants undergoing gynecological surgery. Supportive programs use different
      methods for helping participants cope with the surgical experience including gentle
      movements, counseling, writing, or relaxation techniques, and may help improve participants'
      well-being after gynecological surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To calculate recruitment, adherence, assessment completion, and retention rates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document the frequency of adverse events. II. Assess descriptive data on proposed outcomes
      (i.e., pain, sleep disturbances, psychological distress) for the next phase of study.) III.
      Qualitatively assess acceptability to guide future study planning.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GRUOP I (MINDFUL MOVEMENT AND BREATHING [eMMB]): Participants receive information about the
      intervention individually via telephone and video conference on postoperative day 1 or as
      soon as feasible. Participants also have access to a video or written information before
      participating in 20 minutes of awareness meditation, gentle movements, and
      breathing/relaxation techniques daily for 2 weeks.

      GROUP II (ATTENTION CONTROL [AC]): Participants receive caring attention from an
      interventionist via telephone or video conference over 30 minutes on postoperative day 1 or
      as soon as feasible.

    <description>Will provide quantitative data to guide future study planning. Will calculate 95% confidence intervals for each of the feasibility measures to determine the range of estimates that are consistent with the data. Will track the number of screened participants, those who are eligible, and the percent who agree to participate. For those not meeting the eligibility criteria, reasons will be summarized. The proportion of participants and corresponding 95% CI for participants who participated in each group will be computed. Will use one-sample tests of binomial proportions to compare the recruitment, adherence, and retention rates to the hypothesized values of 50%, 70% and 70%, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity per Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline analyses will include descriptive statistics of pain, background characteristics and other possible confounding variables by intervention group. The primary goal of the statistical analysis of these measures for this Aim will be to estimate standard deviations (SD) for use in future studies. Additional analyses will include fitting mixed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models (adjustment for baseline) to model the trajectory of pain by time and group accounting for the repeated measures on a subject.
The PROMIS assesses pain on a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain)</description>
