  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended for early-stage lung cancer screening.
      However, it is often difficult to determine indolent lesions from more aggressive tumors
      without an invasive intervention or prolonged follow-up period. Thus, the main purpose of
      this study is to develop a non-invasive method to detect lung-cancer specific circulating
      tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood, which can greatly improve the specificity of lung cancer early
      screening.

      In this study, the investigators sought to explore sensitive and specific methylation
      biomarkers that are highly prevalent in lung cancer. It is the first time to perform
      screening assay on healthy, lung nodule, and lung cancer tissues to identify preliminary set
      of highly prevalent methylation markers, and then refined these markers by removing regions
      were unstable in matched plasma samples. Next, investigators interrogated significant
      methylation marker regions enriched in lung nodules of training sample set to buildup a
      non-invasive biomarker classification model to discriminate cancerous nodules from benign
      lesions. Eventually, the model in patient lung nodule samples were validated.
