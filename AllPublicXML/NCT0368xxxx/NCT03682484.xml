  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FiH) study consists of 2 parts: single ascending dose (SAD) with
      evaluation of food effect (Part 1) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) (Part 2).

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending oral doses in Part 1 (SAD Including Evaluation of Food Effect) and multiple
      ascending oral doses in Part 2 (MAD) of MA-0211 in healthy adult participants.

      This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single
      ascending and multiple ascending oral doses of MA-0211 in healthy adult participants. In
      addition, this study will evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of MA-0211 on the QT
      interval using Fridericia's Correction (QTcF); determine the effect of food on the PK of a
      single oral dose of MA-0211 as well as evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of MA-0211
      on the QTcF.

      After a screening period of up to 29 days prior to study drug administration, eligible
      participants will be residential for a single period of 6 days/5 nights in Part 1 and 19
      days/18 nights in Part 2 . Participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day 2.
