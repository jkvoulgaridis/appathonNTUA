  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To record the digital data from monitoring instruments (standard patient monitor) containing
      cardiovascular system information, and from depth-of-anesthesia monitoring modules
      (Bispectral index, Entropy module, Surgical Plethysmography Index, Analgesia Nociception
      Index) containing neurological system information captured in the patient monitor, as well as
      the physiological data regarding anesthetic dosage, respiratory gas analysis and the standard
      monitoring requirement of anesthesia. The investigators also record the precise time points
      of detail surgical steps during the shoulder arthroscopic surgery. Clinical data collected
      from these monitoring instrument will be used to gain more understanding of the complex
      interaction between anesthetic effect, surgical procedure, autonomic response and drug
      modeling. The goal is to obtain the performance of each monitoring index in detail surgical
      steps.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dynamic interaction between surgery and anesthesia is closely monitored by the
      anesthesiologist using various monitoring instruments in the operating room. However, it
      requires the recording and collecting the data for further analysis to answer the question
      that what is the exact effects of the surgical procedure to human body. In particular, the
      measurement performance of transient bradycardia calculated from electrocardiography and the
      monitoring indices such as Surgical Plethysmography Index, Analgesia Nociception Index should
      be compared side-by-side using data from the same subject.

      In this prospective observational study, the investigators will enroll 40 patients undergoing
      elective laparoscopic surgery. Anesthetic management and surgery will be performed as usual
      clinical practice.

      The investigators will record the digital data exported from monitoring instruments,
      including cardiovascular system information (electrocardiography, photo-plethysmography ,
      blood pressure and any additional monitoring items clinically required), neurological system
      information (Bispectral index, Entropy, Surgical Plethysmography Index ) and the respiratory
      gas monitoring (gas analyzer, respiratory waveform). All above data are provided by standard
      patient monitor (CARESCAPE Monitor B850, GE Healthcare). Analgesia Nociception Index are
      provides by Analgesia Nociception Index monitoring instruments (Mdoloris Medical Systems).

      The detailed surgical steps will be noted with precise time stamps to pinpoint the surgical
      effects afterwards. Registered events including anesthetic induction, intubation,
      disinfection, skin incision, dissecting muscle layer, fixing rupture site, suture to close
      tear site and wound closure. The recording is ended before the end of monitoring in the
      operating room. All physiological data and demographic data will be stored in digital media
      after being de-linked from personal identification.

      Data analysis and Statistics will be particularly performed to explore the temporal effect
      and relationship. Methods including modeling, windowing and non-parametric spectral
      estimation will be used.

    <measure>Correlation of the instantaneous effects and accumulative noxious effects of surgical steps with quantitative transient bradycardia indices: high frequency power, low frequency power, and the low-to-high ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>For each surgical events (skin incision, dissection... ), time frame will be one minute before the event to one minute afterward</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency power will be calculated using time-frequency analysis technique. The unit of high frequency power and low frequency power is millisecond square. There is no unit for the ratio. Both absolute change and relative change will be calculated. These indices will be compared with physiological data from patient monitoring instrument also. Range of Spearman correlation is -1 to 1 and Range of prediction probability is 0.5-1.</description>

    <time_frame>The intra-operative period which mostly lasts less than two hours, the duration of general anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of age, gender, pre-existing diseases, the effect site concentration of anesthetics and the combined effects are taken into consideration in real-life clinical anesthetic management. The collected data will be put altogether for analysis by training and verifying in a pharmacological drug surface modeling or other more advanced modeling tools, which include but not limited to &quot;Concentration-effect curve&quot;, &quot;Reduced Greco model&quot;, &quot;Minto model&quot; and &quot;Hierarchy model&quot;.</description>
