      A Prospective, Multi-center, Single-Arm Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the GodenFlow Peripheral Stent System manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co.,
      LTD. for lower limb artery stenosis or occlusion diseases. A total of 90 cases of patients,
      who are suitable to be treated with Peripheral Stent will be screened and enrolled according
      to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the lesion will be treated with GodenFlow
      Peripheral Stent System under the guidance of Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). Clinical
      and imaging follow-up was conducted 3 months and 6 months after surgery, The follow-ups
      mainly included clinical symptoms and signs, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and colour Doppler
      ultrasound, Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), etc., for the sake of verifying the
      efficacy and safety of the device in treating patients with lower limb artery stenosis or
      occlusion.
