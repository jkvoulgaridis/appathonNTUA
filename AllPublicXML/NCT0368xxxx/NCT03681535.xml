    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate whether a reduction in radiation dose and field size will
      maintain a high rate of local control while minimizing the risk of acute and late toxicity .

      Hypothesis: The radiation dose and treatment volume can be safely reduced from 30 Gy to 20 Gy
      while maintaining high rates of local control in patients who had a negative PET-CT scan
      following rituximab - containing chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy followed by consolidation radiation therapy (RT) is a recognized treatment
      paradigm for DLBCL. This was initially established based on the results of 2 randomized
      trials conducted in the 1980s-1990s. In these studies patients were treated with 30Gy after
      chemotherapy (ECOG study) or 40-55Gy (SWOG study). A British National Lymphoma Investigation
      study showed no difference in freedom from local progression, progression-free survival or
      overall survival in between patients receiving 30Gy and 40-45Gy. Additionally systemic
      therapy for DLBCL has significantly improved since these initial studies, with the addition
      of rituximab to standard chemotherapy.

      In a phase II study at Duke University patients with DLBCL NOS or primary mediastinal B-cell
      lymphoma were treated to 19.5-20Gy after achieving complete response to 4-6 cycles of
      chemotherapy containing rituximab. With a median follow-up of 43 months, there was only 1
      local recurrence. The 5-year local control rate was 98%. Progression-free and overall
      survival at 5 years was 81% and 88%. Therefore, there is emerging evidence of long term
      favorable outcomes in localized DLBCL, while decreasing the risk of late effects by reducing
      the dose and volume of RT.

      All participants will receive 20Gy instead of 30-36Gy after completion of at least 3 cycles
      of rituximab with combination chemotherapy. Participants must have a negative post
      chemotherapy PET-CT to participate in this study.

    <description>This phase II study will evaluate whether a reduction in the RT dose, concomitant with a decrease in the RT field size, in patients that achieve complete response and have a negative post-chemotherapy PET scan following 3 to 6 cycles of rituximab containing chemotherapy, will be associated with a low risk of in-field failure. The goal of this approach is to maintain excellent control rates while minimizing the risk of acute and late toxicity.</description>
