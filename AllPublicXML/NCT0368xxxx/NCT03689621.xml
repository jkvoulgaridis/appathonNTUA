  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's recent pilot study of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) from a surgically
      implanted medical device to control the excess eating behaviour characteristic of
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) found that it was safe and acceptable. In addition, there were
      unanticipated marked improvements in rates of problem behaviours, such as emotional
      disturbances and verbal and physical outbursts. These observations indicated the need for a
      trial specifically focusing on the effects of VNS on problem behaviour and also that the use
      of VNS might be extended to include people with other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
      autism spectrum conditions (ASC). The primary aims of this study are: a) to investigate
      whether VNS, now given by an external medical device, is associated with a significant
      reduction in the number and severity of maladaptive behaviours in adults with PWS; and b) to
      undertake a pilot study that includes others with a different neurodevelopmental syndrome who
      have histories of similar behaviours.

      The study will be a single case cross-over design with 4 to 6 months baseline phase and a
      similar period of active treatment. The study cannot be blind as the stimulation is apparent
      but the participants will wear the device initially for four hours a day, at times convenient
      to them, with it switched off in the baseline phase and activated, according to standard
      protocols, in the treatment phase. Six adults with PWS and six with a different
      neurodevelopmental disorder with histories of significant problem behaviours will be included
      initially, with a view to extending if the analysis indicates a likely effect. Behaviours
      will be operationally defined and measured over time using participant and informant diaries
      with additional secondary outcome measures. Before and during the treatment phases autonomic
      nervous system and brain biomarkers will be assessed using ambulatory monitoring of heart
      rate variability and fMRI brain scans.

    <description>Intended to gather information about the potentially traumatic experiences a person has experienced. There is no formal scoring protocol or interpretation per se, other than identifying whether a person has experienced one or more of the events listed. Respondents indicate varying levels of exposure to each type of potentially traumatic event included on a 6-point nominal scale, and respondents may endorse multiple levels of exposure to the same trauma type.</description>

    <description>Two voice recordings of the participant talking will be collected on each of these occasions. Each recording will be at least 20 seconds long, with the participant asked to talk about a positive experience (e.g. favourite birthday, best friend etc.) in one, a less positive time (e.g. a time when he/she was disappointed or sad) in the other. These will be analysed for changes in vocal prosody with t-VNS.</description>
