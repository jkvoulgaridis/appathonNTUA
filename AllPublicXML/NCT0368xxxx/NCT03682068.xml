  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of combining durvalumab ± tremelimumab with standard of
      care (SoC) chemotherapy (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet)
      followed by durvalumab monotherapy versus SoC alone as first-line chemotherapy in patients
      with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic
      transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary
      bladder, and urethra).

          -  No severe concomitant condition that requires immunosuppression medication

          -  Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis
