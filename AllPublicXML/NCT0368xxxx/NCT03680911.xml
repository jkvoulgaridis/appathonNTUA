    <textblock>
      This study will compare administration of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) versus placebo for the
      treatment of olfactory loss due to head injury. The hypothesis is that treatment with NAC
      acutely after head injury will result in improved olfactory function

    <description>â€¢The SIT is a self-administered 40-item test involving microencapsulated (scratch-and-sniff) odors with a forced-choice design. There are 4 booklets with 10 questions each, asking the subject to identify which of 4 answers best described the odor. Total scores are categorized, based on normative data, as normal, mild hyposmia, moderate hyposmia, severe hposmia, total anosmia, or probable malingering. The test was developed at University of Pennsylvania as part of an NIH-funded program project and is widely used as a standard assessment of olfactory function.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Admitted to Ryder Trauma Center for observation acutely following head injury (i.e.
             concussion), with documented hyposmia or anosmia by University of Pennsylvania Smell
             Identification Test (SIT).

          -  Male or female, aged 18 years or older

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent form

          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study

          -  Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the NAC regimen

          -  For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at
             least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study
             participation and for an additional 4 weeks after the end of NAC administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe trauma requiring ongoing inpatient treatment beyond 48 hours

          -  Pregnancy (based on urine screening) or lactation

          -  Known allergic reactions to components of NAC, such as Mucomyst

          -  Currently taking nitrates such as nitroglycerine and/or isosorbide regularly

          -  Currently taking azathioprine (Imuran) or cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)

          -  Known diagnosis of cystinuria (renal condition in which cysteine supplement should be
             avoided)

          -  Febrile illness within 1 week

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention within 3 months

          -  Active sinonasal disease by imaging and/or nasal exam, i.e. rhinosinusitis, nasal
             polyps

          -  Adults unable to consent

          -  Prisoners, employees or subordinates

          -  Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers). This population is
             excluded because efficacy has not yet been established in adults.
