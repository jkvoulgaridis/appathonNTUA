    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether rapid sequence animation videos (RSAV) are of use as an
      additional learning resource for the elective pre-operative patient. The investigators aimed
      to do this by comparing the change in knowledge and anxiety in two groups; Half of the
      patients were allocated to the normal patient pathway and the other half received the
      educational video as an additional preoperative learning resource.

      This single centre single-blinded randomised controlled study evaluates whether rapid
      sequence animation videos (RSAV) are of use as an additional learning resource for the
      elective pre-operative patient. The investigators aimed to do this by comparing the change in
      knowledge and anxiety from baseline to immediately preoperatively. Patients were block
      randomised to either the normal patient pathway or to receive the educational video as an
      additional preoperative learning resource.

      Patients over 18 years of age electively listed for lower segment caesarean section (LSCS)
      and transobturator / transvaginal tape (TVT/TOT) were included.

      Two RSAV were created explaining LSCS and TVT/TOT. Participants were block-randomised in
      groups of 10 to either control (no video) or intervention (video). Two questionnaires
      assessing anxiety were completed at baseline and immediately preoperatively using a Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) and a State- Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Patient knowledge was
      assessed using a custom questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were the change in knowledge
      and anxiety scores.

    <masking_description>Patients were block randomised in groups of 10 participants to either control (no video) or intervention (video), using opaque envelopes. Both control and intervention arms received standard pre-operative face to face counseling and written information. Clinicians were blinded to allocation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety from baseline to immediately preoperatively using a Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at preoperative assessment to immediately preoperatively: 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Anxiety from baseline to immediately preoperatively using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). This will be assessed using questionnaires, of which two will be completed: at baseline (stage 1) and immediately preoperatively (stage 2).
VAS is a ten point linear scale where participants mark the corresponding value for their level of anxiety, where 0 is 'no anxiety' and 10 is 'extremely anxious'. Change will be recorded as points scored immediately preoperatively (stage 2) minus baseline score (stage 1), and referred to as an absolute number. An overall reduction in anxiety is therefore a negative integer, while an increase in anxiety is a positive integer.</description>

    <measure>Change in Knowledge from baseline to immediately preoperatively using a customised questionnaire where patients self-rated their knowledge related to the operation or condition.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at preoperative assessment to immediately preoperatively: 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Knowledge from baseline to immediately preoperatively using a customised questionnaire where patients self-rated their knowledge related to the operation or condition. Each question has a ten-point scale, where the 0 points is 'not at all informed' and 10 points is 'extremely well informed'. Total scores are converted to a percentage (the higher percentage equating to being better informed) and change calculated as score at stage 2 minus score at stage 1. A negative percentage score for change in knowledge would therefore be interpreted as a reduction in knowledge, and a positive percentage score would be an increase in knowledge over the given time. The higher the change in percentage score, the bigger the change in knowledge noted by the participant.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anxiety from baseline to immediately preoperatively using the State-Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at preoperative assessment to immediately preoperatively: 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Anxiety from baseline to immediately preoperatively using the State-Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI).This will be assessed using questionnaires, of which two will be completed: at baseline (stage 1) and immediately preoperatively (stage 2). STAI is a validated anxiety score with a maximum score of 80 (extremely anxious) and minimum score of 20 (not at all anxious). These scores are converted to percentages, so 0% is not at all anxious, and 100% is extremely anxious.
Change will be recorded as points scored immediately preoperatively (stage 2) minus baseline score (stage 1). Therefore a negative percentage score for change in anxiety measured by STAI equates to a reduction in anxiety, whilst a positive percentage change in anxiety measured by STAI equates to an increase in anxiety during the given time.</description>
