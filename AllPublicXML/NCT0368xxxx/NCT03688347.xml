  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the fecal, skin, nasal and oral microbiome and metabolome in patients with
      lung cancer and other malignancies, and correlate to treatment response and toxicities of
      various therapies including immunotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy, etc.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be asked to provide nasal, oral and skin swabs, as well as stool samples during
      their regular clinic visits, at the baseline before desired therapy is given, and at the time
      when treatment is changed due to either disease progression or unbearable toxicities leading
      to treatment stop/change. If treatment stop/held is due to toxicities, a 3rd set of samples
      will be collected when toxicities reduce to less than grade 1. The samples will be subjected
      to DNA extraction followed by 16S rRNA and/or shotgun sequencing metagenomic analysis. The
      data will be correlated to clinical response from treatments, toxicities, clinical data (use
      of antibiotics, PPIs, lab parameters, etc.) and tissue genetic/immunological characteristics
      (mutations, PDL1 expression, etc.) for review of response. This is not data to be used for
      treatment of these subjects.

    <description>The swab is removed from packaging, moistened with sterile water if needed to prevent any discomfort to the participant. The swab is gently inserted less than one inch into the anterior nare (nostril) until resistance is met at turbinate. Then it is rotated several times against nasal wall and repeated in other nostril using the same swab.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed with lung cancer and other malignancies who are candidates for systemic
        therapies such as immunotherapy and chemotherapy

        Eligibility criteria for studying microbiome in patients receiving immunotherapy:

          -  Patients with advanced/recurrent lung cancer (including both NSCLC and SCLC) and other
             solid tumors of our study interest (e.g. GU cancer and melanoma, etc.) that initiate a
             new line of immunotherapy (can be 1st or later line), either alone or in combination
             with chemotherapy, targeted therapy or other immunotherapy.

          -  Patients can be in other clinical trials as long as they meet criteria 1.

          -  Prior treatment with immunotherapy is acceptable as long as criteria 1 is met. For
             example, a new line therapy with pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed after failing
             pembrolizumab is considered eligible.

          -  Patients who are to start immunotherapy maintenance after chemoradiation therapy are
             eligible (e.g. NSCLC patients who will be on durvalumab maintenance)

          -  Patients who are to start immunotherapy after local therapies (e.g. radiation,
             ablation, etc.) are eligible.

          -  Immunotherapy must have component of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents (e.g. nivolumab,
             pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab, etc.) or anti-CTLA4 (e.g.
             ipilimumab)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age

          -  Patients that are pregnant

          -  Patients taking more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day and those using non-medical drugs
             such as marijuana, cocaine, heroine, etc.
