             cmÂ²) present at screening and baseline visit where more than 2 AK lesions are visible
             in each field (preferably the forehead, temple or cheek)

          -  Subjects must be able to participate and willing to give written informed consent and
             to comply with the study restrictions

          -  Subjects must be able to communicate well with the investigator in Dutch

             or prohibited medication for the duration of the study

          -  Subjects must be willing to limit sun exposure of the involved skin to the extent
             vocationally possible

          -  Subjects and their partners of childbearing potential must use effective

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have used or received any treatment for AK in the treatment area within 28 days prior
             to enrollment (including topical medications, immunosuppressive or immunomodulating
             agents, phototherapy, oral retinoids, or other therapies for AKs)

          -  Have any current pathologically relevant skin conditions in the field area other than
             AK (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma).

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the investigational product ingredients,
             including digoxin and furosemide.

          -  Current use of systemic digoxin or furosemide.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 3 months prior to
             screening or more than 4 times a year

          -  Loss or donation of blood over 500 mL within three months (males) or four months
