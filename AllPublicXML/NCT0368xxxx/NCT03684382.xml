  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narrative e-Writing Intervention (NeW-I) is an evidence-based, strength-focused and
      meaning-oriented approach that aims at enhancing well-being, alleviating burden, and reducing
      adverse grief outcomes among Singaporean parents caring for a child with chronic
      life-threatening illness. In collaboration with KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Club
      Rainbow Singapore, a pilot randomized controlled trial with a built-in qualitative evaluation
      and feasibility study will be carried out to assess the efficacy of the therapist-facilitated
      NeW-I protocol and platform among a purposive sample of 66 participants. The findings
      generated will form the foundation for a full-scale RCT for advancing paediatric palliative
      care and parental bereavement support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Conventional grief support interventions for parents whose children are suffering
      from a chronic life-threatening illness often begin only after the child's death. Despite
      robust evidence which shows that pre-loss interventions that enhance death preparedness can
      alleviate psychological distress and prevent adverse grief outcomes among family caregivers
      of dying patients, there is no known program designed specifically to address the
      psycho-emotional-spiritual needs of parents facing child loss. And while the National
      Strategy for Palliative Care in Singapore aims to promote holistic end-of- life care services
      to patients and their caregivers, vast inadequacy continues to exist in the support provided
      to parents caring for a dying child in the local context.

      Objective and Methods: A novel therapist-facilitated, online intervention is conceived to
      fill this critical service gap. Adopting an evidence-based approach, the research team has
      developed a strength-focused and meaning-oriented Narrative e-Writing Intervention (NeW-I)
      for parents anticipating the death of their child due to a chronic life-threatening
      condition. The design of NeW-I is informed by an existing body of research (i.e.
      international systematic review and local qualitative inquiry) that critically examines the
      lived experience of bereaved parents of children with life- limiting illnesses. NeW-I will be
      implemented in Singapore in collaboration with KK Women and Child's Hospital and Club Rainbow
      Singapore. A pilot Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with a built-in accessibility and
      feasibility study will examine the efficacy of the NeW-I therapeutic protocol for enhancing
      quality of life, spiritual wellbeing, hope and perceived social support, as well as reducing
      depressive symptoms, caregiver burden and anticipatory grief among a purposive sample of 66
      participants.

      Significance: NeW-I aspires to enhance quality of life, spiritual well-being, hope and sense
      of social support, as well as alleviating depressive symptoms, caregiving burden, and adverse
      grief outcomes among Singaporean parents facing the terminal illness and eventual death of
      their sick child. The findings generated will form the foundation of a full-scale RCT for
      advancing holistic paediatric palliative care and parental bereavement support locally and
      around the world.

    <description>The FACIT-Sp-12 is a 12-item questionnaire that examines the relationships between spiritual well-being, health, and adjustment to chronic illness; it has been successfully used to assess spiritual well-being across a wide range of religious traditions, including those who identify themselves as &quot;spiritual yet not religious&quot; (Bredle, Salsman, Debb, Arnold, &amp; Cella, 2011)</description>

    <description>Participants engage in a weekly structured writing task of 15-30 minutes which provides them an opportunity to reflect on the emotional, practical and financial demands of caregiving, and the means to cope with these challenges (week 1), explore avenues where they can seek information and resources for caregiving (week 2), explore the sources of support which they have within their network of family and friends (week 3) and examine how they (and their children) can rise above illness-related challenges and live their lives as fully as possible (week 4). After participants complete their weekly writing task, the written narrative will be reviewed and edited by the therapist within the next 3-4 days. The revised draft will be shared with the participant along with constructive feedback, empathic support and psychoeducation. In week 5, participants will receive a 'legacy' document and engage in a voice call with the therapist to receive psychosocial support and for closure of therapy.</description>

This legacy document is structured in a manner that enables participants to find a sense of spiritual well-being and hope in their experience of caring for their child through examination of past experiences and achievements as well as future aspirations.</description>
