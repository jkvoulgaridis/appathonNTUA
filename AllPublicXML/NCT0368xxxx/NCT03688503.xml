      This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial will test whether a magnesium
      glycinate supplement (480 mg/day) taken for 12 weeks lowers blood pressure in 60 adults aged
      40-69 who have elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension and are not taking
      anti-hypertensive medication. Animal studies, epidemiologic studies, and small randomized
      trials suggest that supplemental Mg may reduce blood pressure, but the evidence is not
      definitive.

      Eligibility to participate in the trial will be determined by a 2-stage screening process --
      completion of a pre-screening form online followed by an in-person screening clinic visit.
      Eligible participants will assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to daily magnesium or to
      placebo and will receive a supply of study capsules via U.S. mail. Participants will take 4
      study capsules per day (2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules in the evening).

      Assessments at the screening visit include seated blood pressure; 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure (monitor will be worn by the participant for 24 hours and then returned via mail);
      pulse; weight, height, waist and hip circumference measurements; fasting blood and urine
      collection; and health and diet questionnaires. Participants will return for clinic visits at
      6 weeks and at 12 weeks to assess these measures, including 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure.
