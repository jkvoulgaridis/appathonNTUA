  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mediterranean diet is a model for health. Indeed, according to some epidemiological
      studies, it would participate in the prevention of various diseases such as cardiovascular
      diseases, diabetes type 2, cancer and obesity. Among the foods composing the Mediterranean
      diet, wheat and legumes are strongly represented. The introduction of legumes into an easily
      prepared and economical food for a large part of the population will lead to an increase in
      consumption. The combination of durum wheat semolina and legume flour would benefit from the
      nutritional qualities of the two raw materials (high protein, slow digestible carbohydrates,
      fiber, vitamins and minerals), but also of their double wheat-legume allergenicity.
