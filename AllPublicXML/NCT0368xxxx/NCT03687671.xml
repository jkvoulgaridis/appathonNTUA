  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate weather patients treated with animal-assisted therapy
      show better socioemotional skills compared to treatment as usual.

      70 patients will be allocated randomly to one of two groups (control group and intervention
      group). During 6 weeks, all patients get two therapy sessions (AAT vs. TAU) per week. The 35
      patients in the control group will get treatment as usual (TAU) in speech therapy,
      occupational therapy or physiotherapy twice a week whereas the 35 patients in the
      intervention group will get the same therapies but there will be an animal included in the
      therapy sessions.

      The main outcome is the amount of expressed emotion and interaction in a standardized social
      situation measured via behavioral video coding.

      Measurements will be done before the first therapy session (pre-measurement, t0) and after
      the last therapy session (post-measurement, t1) of the 6 weeks of intervention. The follow-up
      measurement will be done 6 weeks (follow-up I, t2) and 12 weeks later (follow-up II, t3).

    <description>Measured via the &quot;Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition&quot; MASC, Movie for the assessment of social cognition
The MASC is a video based test, where 46 questions need to be answered. Correct answer = 1 point, incorrect answer = 0 point. The more questions are answered correctly the merrier the results are.
Each question has four answer options. Each option has its own signification:
a) correct ToM, b) exceeding ToM, c) less ToM, d) no ToM
Emotion: 17 items, total score range 0-17
Intention: 18 items, total score range 0-18
Thoughts: 7 items, total score range 0-7
Overall score range 0-46. The higher the score, the higher the capability of theory of mind (ToM).
There is a rage of 30-39 right answered questions in healthy populations.</description>
