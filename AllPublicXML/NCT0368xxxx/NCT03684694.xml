    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Loncastuximab
      Tesirine (ADCT-402) in combination with Ibrutinib in participants with Advanced Diffuse Large
      B-Cell Lymphoma or Mantle Cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will cover the dose escalation portion of the study. This
      will then be followed by the Phase 2 portion of the study, which will treat participants with
      the dose of loncastuximab tesirine determined in the Phase 1 portion of the study. The
      ibrutinib dose of 560 mg daily, will remain the same throughout both phases of the study.

      A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used for the Phase 1 portion of the study. The
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period will be the 21 days following the first dose of
      ibrutinib. The dose escalation cohort will receive loncastuximab tesirine for 2 cycles with
      concurrent ibrutinib (concomitant therapy) and may then continue ibrutinib therapy up to one
      year.

      The Phase 2 portion of the study will involve 3 cohorts:

        -  Non-germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Non-GCB DLBCL) cohort

        -  Germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB DLBCL) cohort

        -  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cohort

      Each of the cohorts will be treated with the recommended dose of loncastuximab tesirine
      determined in the Phase 1 portion of the study.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of 3
      to 4 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 2 years
      after treatment discontinuation).

             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, uncontrolled atrial or
             ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, or severe chronic
             pulmonary disease, or tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening based on local
             standards).

         16. Major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other anti-neoplastic therapy within 14
             days prior to start of study drugs (C1D1), except shorter if approved by the Sponsor

             (C1D1)

         18. Planned live vaccine administration after starting study drugs (C1D1)

             breast, or other malignancy that the Sponsor's medical monitor and Investigator agree,
             and document should not be exclusionary

         25. Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would, in the
             Investigator's judgement, make the participant inappropriate for study participation
             or put the participant at risk
