      This is a Phase 2 study of SPR001 for the treatment of classic CAH that will provide 12 weeks
      of open-label treatment to eligible subjects. To be eligible for this study, an individual
      must either have completed Study SPR001-201 or meet eligibility criteria for SPR001-naïve
      subjects. The expected duration of study participation for each subject is up to
      approximately 5 months. This includes a screening period of ≤30 days, a treatment period of
      12 weeks, and a safety follow-up period of 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is approved by the Sponsor's Medical Monitor

          -  Is on a stable regimen of glucocorticoid replacement for ≥30 days before baseline that
             is expected to remain stable throughout the study

          -  If screening for this study occurs &gt;3 months after the subject's final follow-up visit
             in Study SPR001-201, the subject will have serum 17-OHP measured at screening.

          -  Agrees to follow contraception guidelines

          -  Is able to understand all study procedures and risks involved and provides written
             informed consent indicating willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Experienced a clinically significant AE considered at least possibly related to SPR001
             in Study SPR001-201

          -  If screening for this study occurs &gt;3 months after the subject's final follow-up visit
             in Study SPR001-201, the subject will be screened for any clinically significant
             unstable medical condition, medically significant illness, or chronic disease
             occurring within 30 days of screening

          -  Is at increased risk of suicide

          -  Clinically significant depression or anxiety at screening or baseline

          -  Clinically significant abnormal clinical or laboratory assessments must be discussed
             with the Medical Monitor to determine eligibility for this study.

          -  Subjects who routinely work overnight shifts require Medical Monitor approval for
             enrollment

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Use of any other investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives before screening

          -  Use of prohibited concomitant medications (including rosiglitazone, testosterone, and
             strong inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4) within 30 days or 5 half-lives of
             baseline. Medications metabolized by CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, or 2C19, especially those that
             are sensitive substrates or substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges should be
             discussed on a case-by-case basis with the Medical Monitor.
