  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 12-week, randomized nutrition intervention for the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk
      factors in a high-risk population in the southeastern United States. The primary objective of
      this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet intervention (education +
      extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) and mixed nut supplementation) versus that of an American Heart
      Association (AHA) nutrition intervention (education) on serum blood lipid levels as markers
      for cardiovascular disease risk. Researchers conducting this trial hypothesize that a greater
      reduction will be seen in cardiovascular disease risk factors in the Mediterranean diet
      intervention.
