    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To study the effect of mild, moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of Venglustat following a single dose.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the tolerability of Venglustat given as a single dose in subjects with mild,
      moderate and severe renal impairment in comparison with matched subjects with normal renal
      function.

      Approximately 41 days, including a 21-day screening period, a 1-day treatment period,
      followed by a 9-day period of plasma sampling for assessment of primary endpoints.
