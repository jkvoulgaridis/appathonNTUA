  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In stroke patients, the most common neurological deficits were motor impairment, loss of
      somatosensation, abnormal muscle tone, and impaired fractionated movement at affected limbs.
      Therefore, the investigators try to facilitate upper extremity function and normalize the
      muscle tone to enlarge their capacity to perform daily activities and to improve life quality
      by modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) and Kinesiotaping (KT).

      The investigators will collect 90 subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia in this study.
      These 90 patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups. In KT group (n=30), the patients
      will perform Kinesiology taping for 5 days per week for 3 weeks. In mCIMT group (n=30), the
      patient will receive constraint the unaffected limb for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for
      three weeks. In KT+mCIMT group, the KT and mCIMT interventions would be performed for 5 days
      a week in three weeks. All the patients in KT, CIMT and KT+mCIMT groups will receive
      20-minute hand function training twice daily for 5 days per week for 3 weeks. Before
      intervention, immediately and 3 week later after intervention, all patients will receive the
      physical examinations including motor recovery stage (Brunnstrom stage), spasticity (modified
      Ashworth scale and Tardieu scale), and sensation. Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity
      (FMA-UE), box and block test, Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function (STEF), and Wolf Motor
      Function Test for hand function, ADL and quality of life assessment and musculoskeletal
      sonography for affected forearms will be also evaluated in this study.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To investigate the effect of Kinesiotaping and modified CIMT in improving upper
           extremity function and spasticity for subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia.

        2. To explore the role of sonoelastography and shear wave velocity in poststroke spasticity
           assessment.

    <measure>the change from baseline to time of Fugl-Meyer assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd week, and 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>a therapist will evaluate Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE) for each participant. In this assessment, participants would need to execute a series of movements, which involved proximal and distal part of upper limb. The higher the grade, the better the performance.</description>

    <measure>the change from baseline to time of Musculoskeletal sonography</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd week, and 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>an experienced physiatrist will evaluate the findings on sonography, sonoelastography, and shear wave velocity (SWV). The participants will sit upright and put their upper extremities on the bed with elbow flexion in 90 degrees and the forearm full supination. The measured levels for evaluating FCR, FCU, and FDS muscles will be recorded at first time and use the same level at follow up for each patient. The SWV will be done in the longitudinal/transverse planes and be performed at the maximal cross-section area of the muscles and repeatedly measured for 7 times for each muscle. The sonoelastography will be applied in the longitudinal plane of the detected muscles at the same level of the SWV.</description>

    <measure>the change from baseline to time of MAS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd week, and 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>a therapist will measure spasticity of affected upper extremity at elbow and wrist joints (modified Ashworth scale). In this scale, muscle tone would be assessed by quick stretch of muscle belly. The scoring criteria are as follows. 0, no increase in muscle tone; 1, Slight increase in muscle tone; 2, More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM; 3, considerable increase in muscle tone; 4, affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>
