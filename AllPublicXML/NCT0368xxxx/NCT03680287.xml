  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central scientific premise of the proposed study is that sleep disruption (SD) will
      influence individuals' subjective response to blinded medication administration. The
      investigators further believe these responses will vary among patients who have chronic low
      back pain (CLBP) vs. healthy controls, and that sex will moderate effects.

      The proposed study evaluates whether CLBP patients' subjective responses to study medication
      administration are altered by SD. The investigators focus on two outcome domains: abuse
      liability (i.e., drug liking and valuation) and response to pain testing.

      The investigators propose a mixed between-within randomized crossover human-laboratory
      experiment that investigates placebo-controlled effects of study medication on 1) abuse
      liability metrics (Drug Liking and Monetary Valuation) and 2) response to laboratory-evoked
      standardized pain measures, after one night of uninterrupted sleep (US) and again after one
      night of SD. The investigators will recruit both CLBP patients (N = 60) and healthy controls
      (N = 60).

    <description>Participants are presented with an array of choices (in dollar value) which they will compare to the option of receiving study drug. They will decide for each choice whether they would take the money (at that value) or the drug they received in the session.

    <description>On the day after each sleep condition (Uninterrupted Sleep and Sleep Disruption), participants will undergo multiple injections of study medication or placebo. This is a double-blind within-subject Phase II trial. As such, study medications must remain blinded. Participants may receive a medication from one or more of the following categories: prescription stimulants, prescription benzodiazepines, prescription opioids, prescription cannabinoids, over-the-counter medications, or placebo (saline). This study uses a within-subject design, such that participants serve as participants' own control.</description>
