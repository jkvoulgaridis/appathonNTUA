  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global prevalence of diabetes is on the rise and with it increase in prevalence of
      diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). These recalcitrant wounds are difficult to manage and pose a
      heavy economic burden. Photobiomodulation (low-level laser) is used for acceleration of wound
      healing.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of B-cure laser, a home-use
      low-level laser device, for acceleration of diabetic foot ulcer healing over standard
      treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetic foot ulcers will receive standard treatment and in addition will be
      randomly allocated to receive either active or sham laser device to self-treat at home. The
      patient's wound will be evaluated every 2 weeks. Adverse events will be documented.

      The study hypothesis is that B-Cure laser treatments as an adjunct therapy to standard
      treatment, applied, at home, by the patient or personal care-giver, can accelerate diabetic
      foot ulcers healing compared to standard treatment alone.
