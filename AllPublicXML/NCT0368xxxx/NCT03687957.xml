    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the effect of
      rhIL-7-hyFc on lymphocyte counts in patients with high grade glioma (HGG).

      A phase I study will test whether rhIL-7-hyFc can be safely administered to patients with
      HGG. Six doses of rhIL-7-hyFc will be tested using a mix of Accelerated Phase and standard
      3+3 dose-escalation design. The phase II portion to test effect of rhIL-7-hyFc on lymphocyte
      counts will use placebo-controlled randomization in HGG patients whose treatment include the
      standard radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ).

    <description>Per standard treatment, patients will receive concurrent RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ on Days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle for a total of 6 cycles. rhIL-7hyFc will be given by intramuscular injection starting at the end of RT/TMZ (within 5 days after last day of RT/TMZ). The 2nd injection will be administered 3-5 days after the last dose of cycle 3 TMZ treatment (~week 13). The 3rd injection will be given 3-5 days after the last dose of cycle 6 TMZ treatment (~week 25). Note the 2nd and 3rd injections should be administered once between Day 3 through 5 following the last dose of TMZ to achieve the strongest response. The 4th injection (last injection in the study) will be given after completion of monthly TMZ (~Week 37). A total of 4 doses of rhIL-7-hyFc injections are planned
The phase I part will begin with an Accelerated Phase with 1 patient per cohort at the first 2 doses (60 mcg/kg and 120 mcg/kg) followed by a standard 3+3 design on the remaining 4 dose levels</description>

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 60% (i.e. the patient must be able to care for
             himself/herself with occasional help from others).

          -  Able to provide written informed consent (or consent from a legally authorized
             representative).

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             study entry (within 14 days). Patients must be willing to be on adequate contraception
             during treatment.

               -  18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents which may affect patient's lymphocyte
             counts.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because rhIL-7-hyFc has not been evaluated
             regarding its potential for teratogenic or abortifacients effects. There is a
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with the study drug, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with rhIL-7-hyFc.

          -  Has an active viral infection requiring systemic treatment at screening.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease or syndrome (i.e. moderate or severe rheumatoid
             arthritis, moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis,
             Guillain Barre syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, Wegener's etc.,) that requires
             systemic treatment at the time of screening. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Subjects are permitted
             to enroll if they have vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study
             treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:
             measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin
             (BCG), Zoster, and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are
             generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.
