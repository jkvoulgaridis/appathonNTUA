  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to help patients, caregivers, and providers make decisions about how
      best to manage depressive symptoms in advanced heart failure. There are two evidence-based
      treatment approaches to treating depression in patients with advanced heart failure,
      behavioral action psychotherapy and treatment with anti-depressant medications. In this study
      we want to compare the effectiveness of these two treatment options to learn which treatment
      works better.

      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of BA vs. MEDS, for depressed AHF patients. Hypothesis 1:
      Compared to depressed AHF patients who receive MEDS, patients receiving BA will have
      significantly greater improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptom severity as
      measured with the PHQ-9 at 6-month follow-up. Significantly greater improvements will also be
      detected in the secondary outcomes of general physical and mental HRQoL (SF-12v2), heart
      failure-specific HRQoL (KCCQ), and caregiver burden (CBQ-HF) at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Aim 2: To compare the impact of BA vs. MEDS on disadvantageous outcomes of Morbidity (as
      evidenced by ED visits, hospital readmissions, total days in the hospital), and Mortality
      among depressed AHF patients.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to depressed AHF patients who receive MEDS, those receiving BA will
      have significantly less Morbidity (as evidenced by less frequent ED visits, lower readmission
      rates, fewer total days in the hospital), and reduced Mortality at the data collection points
      of 3, 6, and 12 months.

    <measure>Change from baseline in depression, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale results at 6 months follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from baseline enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is used to measure depressive symptoms severity. The PHQ-9 is a self-report instrument that corresponds with the validated Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders PRIME-MD clinician-administered instrument. The PHQ-9 measures all nine dimensions of depression assessed in the DSM criteria for MDD on a 0-3 scale.</description>

    <time_frame>3 month, 6 month, and 12 months from baseline enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12v2 is a 12-item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective.The SF-12v2 assess general physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), including the impact of any and all illnesses on a broad range of functional domains.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ )scale results.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month, 6 month, and 12 months from baseline enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The KCCQ is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and HRQoL.Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status. We will measure the Heart failure-specific quality of life as measured by the KCCQ.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline on the Caregiver burden questionnaire-Heart Failure (CBQ-HF) scale results.</measure>

    <description>The Caregiver Burden Questionnaire - Heart Failure Version 3.0 (CBQ-HF) is a quantitative survey of 26 questions covering the past four weeks of the caregiver's experience is evaluated as caregiver burden. uses a 5-point Likert severity scale assessing 4 domains of physical, emotional/psychological, social and lifestyle burdens.</description>
