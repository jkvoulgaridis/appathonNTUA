  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 9th most common cancer in Australia, the 10th most common
      cancer in Western populations.~75% of kidney cancers are clear-cell renal cell carcinomas
      (ccRCC). Many patients present with advanced or unresectable disease at diagnosis and a
      number of treatments are now available for metastatic ccRCC included vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKIs), mTOR inhibitors, and
      cytokines. More recently first line use of immunotherapy demonstrated improved survival with
      checkpoint inhibitors. While many patients benefit from first-line treatment, progression is
      inevitable and these treatments remain on the whole palliative. Second-line VEGFR TKIs, mTOR
      inhibitors and immunotherapy have some benefit but in a smaller increment than first-line
      treatment.

      While ~75% of kidney cancers are the clear-cell variant, ~25% of kidney cancers are non-clear
      cell histology (nccRCC) and include papillary, chromophobe, sarcomatoid, collecting duct
      carcinoma, Xp11 translocation carcinoma and unclassified. Patients with non-ccRCC have
      significantly lower response rates and poorer median progression-free survival and overall
      survival than those with ccRCC. Non clear cell histologies have largely been excluded from
      large phase III randomised clinical trials and therefore the optimal treatment and sequencing
      of therapies for these patients remains unclear.

      Despite recent unprecedented advances in treatment, there continues to be an unmet need to
      improve outcomes for patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma. This is particularly relevant in non-clear cell RCC. Because it is a rarer
      subtype of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, it is more challenging to study, and treatment
      efficacy data is sparse.

      The research project is testing a new treatment for participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-clear cell kidney cancer. The new treatment involves a drug called
      Cabozantinib (also known as Cabometyx). This drug has been used previously in many cancers,
      including clear cell kidney cancer and thyroid cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and
      tolerability of Cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is a anti-cancer drug that works by blocking
      cancer cell growth. It blocks particular proteins called protein kinases on cancer cells.
      Protein kinases encourage the cancer to grow. Cabozantinib is called a multi kinase inhibitor
      because it blocks a number of these proteins. How well cabozantinib works in cancer of the
      kidney will be tested by measuring the change in size of your tumours that are seen on CT
      scans.

      Cabozantinib is approved to treat clear cell kidney cancer and thyroid cancer in Australia.
      It has not been tested in people with non-clear cell kidney cancer.

      About 48 participants with non-clear cell kidney cancer are expected to participate in this
      study, from Australia. Even though this study may be suitable for you, it is possible that
      you may not be enrolled in this study.

      This research study has been initiated by Dr. David Pook, is being conducted in collaboration
      with the Centre for Biostatistics and Clinical Trials (BaCT) and sponsored in Australia by
      the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate (ANZUP) Cancer Trials Group Pty Ltd.
