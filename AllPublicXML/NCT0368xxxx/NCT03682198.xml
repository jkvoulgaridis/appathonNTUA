  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study, consisting of 3 substudies carried out during
      elective neurosurgery under general anaesthesia. Each participant will take part in all 3
      substudies. First, the capability of Near Infra Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure the brain
      oxygenation is examined. A NIRS-electrode is placed on forehead skin, on the skull, and on
      dura. Secondly, a small dose of Phenylephrine is given, and the brain oxygenation is measured
      by a Clark-electrode and a NIRS-electrode, to see how Phenylephrine affects these
      measurements. In the third substudy, the brain oxygenations' (NIRS and Licox) response to an
      inspired oxygen fraction of 0.30 vs. 0.80 is investigated.
