      This trial studies how well music works in reducing distress in participants with cancer
      during chemotherapy treatment. Music in participants receiving cancer treatment such as
      infusion treatment and caregiver may reduce pain, anxiety, and distress and improve
      participant's psychological and physiological wellbeing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effect of patients? listening to music on level of distress during cancer
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the influence of covariates (patients? sociodemographics, musical background,
      and clinical variables) on the association between patients? listening to music and level of
      distress during cancer treatment.

      II. To explore the interdependence of adjustment among patients and their caregivers on the
      association between.

      OUTLINE: Participants and caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants and caregivers listen to music of their choice for up to 60 minutes
      during infusion session.

      GROUP II: Participants and caregivers do not listen to music during infusion session and are
      placed on music waitlist.

    <description>Clinical variables will be summarized by median and range for continuous variables and by count and percentage for categorical variables. The changes between pre- and post-survey will be compared between control and experimental groups using an unpaired t-test. Total scores are reported with the total scores ranging from 0-10; higher scores indicate more pain.</description>

    <description>Clinical variables will be summarized by median and range for continuous variables and by count and percentage for categorical variables. The changes between pre- and post-survey will be compared between control and experimental groups using an unpaired t-test. There are two subscales: Positive Affect and Negative Affect. Scores for each subscale (10 items each) range from 10 to 50 with higher scores meaning higher levels of affect (either higher positive or higher negative affect).</description>
