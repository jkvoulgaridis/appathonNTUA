               -  Postmenopausal status will be confirmed with a screening serum follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level greater than 40 milli-international units per
                  milliliter (mlU/mL).

               -  Patient has a negative urine and/or serum pregnancy test (serum Î²-human chorionic
                  gonadotropin) within 1 day prior to study entry, and agrees to use highly
                  effective contraception methods during treatment and for at least 7 days after
                  the last dose of i.v. study therapy;

          3. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2.

          4. As judged by the Investigator, all the subjects must be able to understand and be
             willing to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

        4.2 Exclusion criteria

        Subjects should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        fulfilled:

          1. Male subjects who do not agree to follow contraception restrictions.

          2. Female subjects who are pregnant or currently lactating

          3. Female subjects who are of child bearing potential who do not agree to follow
             contraception restrictions as detailed in section 5.1.10.

          4. Donated blood in the 3 months prior to screening, plasma in the 7 days prior to
             screening, platelets in the 6 weeks prior to screening

          5. Consume more than 28 units of alcohol per week if male, or 21 units of alcohol per
             week if female or any significant history of alcohol / substance misuse as determined
             by the investigator

          6. Unwilling to abstain from vigorous exercise for 48 hours prior to any study visit
