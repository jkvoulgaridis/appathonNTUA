  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety problems are a major concern of youth mental health given that the prevalence of
      anxiety disorders in Dutch children aged up to 12 is approximately 4 to 8 percent. In this
      group, specific phobias are among the most common. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with
      exposure as its key ingredient, takes a prominent place in national guidelines for the
      treatment of anxiety disorders. These guidelines are based on empirical support that exposure
      is effective in the treatment of specific phobia. Yet, despite the empirical evidence of its
      efficacy, a gap between theory and practice remains, with exposure-based CBT being underused
      in clinical practice. For example, a recent Dutch survey found that exposure was mostly
      practiced outside the formal therapy sessions as homework assignment. It is questionable
      whether this is effective, given that it might be hard for children to do these assignments
      independently (e.g., without the help of a therapist or their parents). This study therefore
      proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of different degrees of therapist and parent
      involvement during exposure, comparing therapist supported exposure with self-supported
      exposure with and without the use of parents as co-therapists.

      Objective: The primary goal of this study is to evaluate whether therapist supported
      in-session exposure exercises are more effective than individual out-session exposure
      exercises, or parent supported out-session exposure exercises. The secondary goal is to find
      child, parent and therapist factors that possibly relate to the effectiveness of the exposure
      exercises.

      Study design: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with three parallel groups (intervention
      versus intervention versus intervention).

      Study population: Children aged 8 to 12 years with a specific phobia of the
      animal/situational subtype

      Intervention (if applicable): The intervention will be designed as a CBT, a therapy which has
      proven to be effective in treating specific phobia. The intervention consists of three
      individual sessions, each up to 60 minutes long. Each condition starts with a
      psycho-education session on specific phobias and exposure. In the following two sessions,
      that differ per condition, either two therapist-guided in-session exposure exercises or two
      self-guided out-session exposure sessions are offered. In the out-session exposure sessions
      the child conducts the exposure exercises either with or without the help of a parent. The
      intervention will be provided by an experienced mental health professional.

      Main study parameters/endpoints (see outcome measures paragraph): The main study parameter is
      specific phobia severity. Secondary study parameters are subjective level of fear, fearful
      cognitions, bodily tension, avoidance, coping (possible mediator variables), approach
      behavior and self-efficacy. Tertiary study parameters are healthcare costs and quality of
      life (cost-effectiveness), note: cost-effectiveness is assessed for another study. Other
      study parameters are specific phobiadiagnosis, general comorbidity, comorbid anxiety and
      depression, parental fear, parental modelling behaviors, and demographic variables (possible
      moderator variables); and credibility and expectancy of the treatment, treatment compliance,
      treatment satisfaction, and therapeutic alliance (treatment characteristics).

    <time_frame>At intake (T0), four weeks later at pre-intervention assessment (T1), another four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Specific phobia severity in children will be measured with a clinical semi-structured interview using the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Children and Parents (ADIS-IV-C/P). The study will only include the section of specific phobia. Severity of the specific phobia will be rated on a 0-8 interval scale by an independent psychologist on the ADIS-IV (see above). This rating is based on the level of interference, number of symptoms and general impression of the psychologist. A rating 0, 1, 2 or 3 is labelled as no specific phobia, a rating of 4 or 5 is labelled as a mild specific phobia, whereas a rating of 6, 7 or 8 means the specific phobia is labelled as severe. This rating is used to randomize the participants to one of the conditions. The ADIS-IV has good test-retest reliability and concurrent validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of anxiety (Subjective level of fear, Fearful cognitions, Bodily tension, Avoidance and Coping)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first intervention week (T2), the second week (T3), and the third week (T4), and one week later at post-intervention assessment (T5), and four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Level of anxiety compromised of Subjective level of fear, Fearful cognitions, Bodily tension, Avoidance and Coping will be measured by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) ranging from 0-100 (ratio scale) on which the child rates the following aspects of the goal situation as set in the PE session:
Subjective level of fear: 'Not frightened at all' (0) - 'Completely frightened' (100)
Fearful cognitions: 'I do not believe this at all' (0) - 'I completely believe this' (100), in which the credibility of the cognition about the feared object or situation as set in the PE session is rated.
Bodily tension: 'My body feels not tense at all' (0) - 'My body feels completely tense' (100)
Avoidance: 'I would never avoid this situation/object if I could' (0) - 'I would always avoid this situation/object if I could' (100)
Coping: 'I cannot cope with this situation/object at all when I encounter it' (0) - 'I can completely cope with this situation/object when I encounter it' (100)</description>

    <measure>Change in approach behaviour towards phobic stimulus (Time and distance)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-intervention assessment (T1), four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Approach behaviour will be measured by three situational Behavioural Approach Tests (BAT) for feared and avoided objects or situations. The test consists of a number of increasingly difficult steps in which children are asked to approach a phobic object or situation, but are told they can stop the test at any time they wish to do so. During the BAT, individuals are asked to provide &quot;subjective unit of disturbance scale&quot; (SUDS 0-100 ratio scale) ratings immediately after encountering the phobic animal or situation.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-efficacy (Academic, Social and Emotional)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-intervention assessment (T1), four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured by the Self Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C; Muris, 2001). This questionnaire contains 24 questions regarding academic, social and emotional self-efficacy. Items are rated on a 5-point interval scale from 'not at all' (1) to 'very well' (5). The SEQ-C is proven to be a valid instrument with sufficient reliability (Muris, 2001).</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness (Healthcare costs and In quality adjusted life years)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-intervention assessment (T1) and eight weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>In addition, cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed by measuring costs and quality of life (effectiveness). Measuring cost-effectiveness is not the primary goal of this research but since this study is part of a larger national project in which cost-effectiveness will also be taken into account, we consider it relevant to state here.
Healthcare costs will be measured by registration of costs in a cost diary based on the Trimbos Institute and Institute of Medical Technology Assessment Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P) and PRODISQ.
The EuroQol Questionaire (EQ-5D-Y youth version) will be used to establish quality of life as expressed in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).
Healthcare costs and in quality adjusted life years will be combined to report cost-effectiveness.</description>

    <measure>Change in specific phobia diagnosis (Interference, number of symptoms and general impression of the psychologist)</measure>
    <time_frame>At intake (T0), four weeks later at pre-intervention assessment (T1), another four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Specific phobia diagnosis will be assessed with the ADIS IV (see above). All items offer three possible answers: 'yes', 'no' or 'other' on a nominal scale (which is chosen when the adolescent answers 'I don't know' or 'sometimes'). If the adolescent meets all four criteria for specific phobia as set in the ADIS-IV, he or she can participate in the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-intervention assessment (T1), four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Given the high comorbidity of anxiety and depression in children, comorbid anxiety and depression will be assessed with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale for Children and Parents (RCADS-C/P) consisting of 47 items and the Phobia section of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale for Children and Parents (SCAS-C/P) consisting of 9 items. All items are rated on a 4-point interval scale from 'never' to 'always'. Both the RCADS and the SCAS have good psychometric properties and are combined into the RCADSCAS for this study.</description>

    <measure>Change in parental fear (Phobia, Avoidance and Associated anxiety)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-intervention assessment (T1), four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>Parental fear will be measured by the Fear Questionnaire (FQ). This questionnaire contains 24 questions regarding phobia, avoidance, and associated anxiety. The specific phobia of the child will be added idiosyncratically for each family. Items are rated on an 8-point interval scale from 'no fear' to 'in panic'. Reliability and construct validity have proven to be sufficient.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-intervention assessment (T1), four weeks later at post-intervention assessment (T5) and another four weeks later at follow-up assessment (T6)</time_frame>
    <description>• Treatment satisfaction will be measured with the Service Satisfaction Scale (SSS). Four items are rated on a 4-point interval scale ranging from 'no, definitely not' to 'yes, definitely'. The psychometric properties of the scale have been qualified as good.</description>

    <description>. Each intervention will contain a 60-minute psycho-education session (PE) and two 60-minute exposure sessions (EX), conducted by a mental health professional together with a master student in psychology, who are both weekly supervised by a CBT certified psychologist. In the first (PE) session, participants learn about anxiety, specific phobias and exposure. During this session they will create a fear hierarchy, formulate their cognition about the feared object or situation and determine what they want to achieve during treatment (e.g. goal situation). The next two sessions consist of exposure exercises.</description>
