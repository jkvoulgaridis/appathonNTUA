  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ProVent study is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the efficacy of
      sipuleucel-T in reducing the progression of lower risk non-metastatic prostate cancer
      compared to subjects followed on active surveillance as standard of care.

      The ProVent Study is designed to look at subjects who recieve sipuleucel-T compared to
      control subjects followed on AS. The study will enroll subjects being followed by AS and
      initially diagnosed within 12 months prior to Screening with either ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      The Screening Phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and
      continues until randomization. After Screening assessments are completed, eligible subjects
      will be randomized 2:1 to the sipuleucel-T arm or the control arm. Subjects randomized to
      sipuleucel-T arm will receive product as described in the sipuleucel-T approved label.

      Subjects will undergotheir first leukapheresis within 60 days of randomization.

      Subjects randomized to the control arm will be followed on AS. The Active Phase will begin at
      randomization and continues through completion of the end of Active Phase study visit (within
      30 days of Biopsy 2). Once a subject from either the sipuleucel-T or control arms completes
      the end of Active Phase visit, they will enter the Follow-up Phase and complete Follow-up
      Phase visits every 6 months starting from their last Active Phase visit. The Follow-up Phase
      visits end when the last subject enrolled completes Biopsy 2 and end of Active Phase visit or
      until the study is terminated by the sponsor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Age is ≥ 18 years

          -  2. Written informed consent provided prior to the initiation of study procedures

          -  3. Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially diagnosed ≤12 months
             of Screening. All biopsy slides with subject information redacted must be submitted
             for BICR.

          -  4. Prostate cancer diagnosis determined by BICR as one of the following: 4a. ISUP
             Grade Group 1 with 3 or more cores positive from a systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy 4b.
             ISUP Grade Group 1 with ≥ 1 core positive with ≥50% cancer involvement from a
             systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy 4c. ISUP Grade Group 1 from 3 or more positive cores
             from any combination of cores from a systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and MRI targeted
             biopsy (note: multiple cores from each MRI targeted lesion will count as 1 core) 4d.
             ISUP Grade Group 1 from a negative systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and an MRI targeted
             core positive with ≥50% cancer involvement 4e. ISUP Grade Group 2 from a systematic
             (≥10 cores) biopsy with &lt;50% of the total number of any cores positive for cancer 4f.
             ISUP Grade Group 2 from a negative systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and MRI targeted
             core(s) positive for Gleason 3+4 (see note below) 4g. ISUP Grade Group 2 from any
             combination of cores from a systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and MRI targeted biopsy (see

        both the systematic biopsy and MRI targeted lesions; each MRI targeted lesion, irrespective
        of multiple positive cores, will each count as 1 core for the total number of positive
        cores, e.g., 4 targeted lesions with 2 positive cores each will only add 4 to the total
        core count.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Former therapy for prostate cancer (local or systemic)

          -  2. Any previous prostatic surgical procedure that significantly changes the anatomy of
             prostate (at the discretion of sponsor's Medical Monitor)

          -  9. Subject has a history of any other stage I-IV malignancy, except for basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer. The subject must be disease free and off any
             malignancy-related treatment for at least 5 years.

             heart failure (New York Classification III-IV) or unstable angina pectoris within the
             last 6 months, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study
             requirements as well as any condition that would preclude a subject from undergoing
             leukapheresis (e.g., within the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction,
             interventional cardiology procedure such as angioplasty or stent placement, pulmonary
             embolism or deep vein thrombosis).

          -  13. Hypogonadal (T &lt;175 ng/dL) or on continuous testosterone replacement therapy

          -  14. Positive serology for HIV-1, HIV-2 or HTLV-1, HTLV-2

          -  16. Any medical intervention, any other condition, or any other circumstance which, in
             the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor's Medical Monitor, could compromise
             adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.
