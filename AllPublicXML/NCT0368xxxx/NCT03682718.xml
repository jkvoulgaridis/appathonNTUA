      The aim of present study is to compare the safety and efficacy of vaginal misoprostol versus
      the combination of vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foley catheter in induction of labor
      at term pregnancy.

    <textblock>
      Cervical status is a good predictor of the likelihood of vaginal delivery when labor is
      induced. Any induction method is likely to be effective in a woman with a favorable cervix,
      whereas no method is highly successful when performed in a woman with a cervix that is
      unfavorable.

      The use of a balloon catheter as induction method was first described in 1862 by Trainer. The
      goal of the catheter was to ripen the cervix through direct mechanical dilatation of the
      cervical canal and indirectly by increasing endogenous prostaglandin secretion.

      Alternatively, Prostaglandins are one of the key players in cervical ripening by a number of
      different mechanisms.

      The aim of present study is to compare the safety and efficacy of vaginal misoprostol versus
      the combination of vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foley catheter in induction of labor
      at term pregnancy.

    <description>participants will receive misoprostol by the same dose and method. Transcervical Foley catheter (size 16F, with 30ml balloon capacity) will be passed. The catheter will deﬂated, removed and cervix re-assessed if no spontaneous expulsion occurred at 12 hours post- insertion. A new catheter will be passed for another 12 hours, if the Bishop score is less than 8 this will be considered as failure of induction.</description>

    <description>Misoprostol group; participants will receive 50 μg intravaginal in the posterior vaginal fornix, 25 μg will be given every 4 hours for another two doses, if a satisfactory Bishop score of 8 not reached, patient will take an overnight rest and she will continue induction by the same doses on the next day-provided that there is no ROMs- (this is according to Ain Shams University Protocol) The maximum dose of Misoprostol is 200 μg.
Oxytocin infusion will not started until 6 hours after the last dose or if there is no adequate contractions obtained.</description>
