  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose
      (MAD), study to evaluate the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of FP-045
      administered to normal health volunteers (NHVs). 3 cohorts of NHVs will be enrolled. Subjects
      in each cohort will be randomized to orally receive either FP-045 (6 subjects) or placebo (2
      subjects). Subjects will receive 7 daily doses of study drug.

      Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 21 days before Day 1 and will have
      been admitted to the CRU on Day -1 to confirm eligibility and to undergo baseline
      assessments. Subjects will remain in the CRU for observation until completion of all
      assessments on Day 10. Subjects will return to the CRU on Day 11 for an additional PK sample,
      and again for an end of study (EOS) Visit on Day 14 (±2 days) for safety evaluations and
      collection of PK samples.
