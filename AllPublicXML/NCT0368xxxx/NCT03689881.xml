  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthropathies (SpAs) are chronic inflammatory diseases encompassing ankylosing
      spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthropathy, and
      undifferentiated SpA.

      In 2001, the estimated prevalence of SpA was 1.5% worldwide. Sacroiliitis is a condition
      caused by inflammation within the sacroiliac joint. It is the most frequent damage of SpA
      depicted at imaging evaluation.

      Conventional radiography (X-ray) is usually used to depict the structural changes associated
      with sacroiliitis.

      However further evaluation often requires additionnal computed tomography (CT).

      Tomosynthesis is an Xray-based imaging technology which allows reconstruction of multiple
      section images from a set of projection images acquired as the x-ray tube moves along a
      prescribed path. The advantagee of tomosynthesis is the significant reduction of radiation
      dose exposure compared to CT Tomosynthesis is currently used in the field of breast imaging
      and pneumology. Very few studies have examined the value of tomosynthesis for osteoarticular
      imaging.

      The study aims at evaluating the diagnostic performances of tomosynthesis as compared to
      standard X-ray and CT, in patients with a clinical suspicion of sacroiliitis.

      the investigators hypothesize that tomosynthesis is superior to conventional radiography for
      detection of sacroiliitis and is at least equal to CT with lower irradiation.

  <detailed_description>

      Consecutive patients referred to CT for exploration of sacrollitis will be included and
      investigated with standard radiography, CT and tomosynthesis of SI joints.

      Imaging examinations will be performed at day of enrollment as follow : X-ray and CT as
      standard management and tomosynthesis as additional evaluation. CT will be considered as the
      reference standard Sacroiliitis will be assessed in a centralized, blind and randomized
      retrospective reading of all imaging modalities by two independent radiologists.

      Diagnostic performances and radiation doses of tomosynthesis will be compared to those of
      standard CT and X-ray examinations.
