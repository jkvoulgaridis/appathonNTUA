  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted for a master's dissertation. Our goal is to determine if there
      are physical performance benefits to performing the FIFA11+ soccer warm-up program in adult
      female soccer players over an eight week period. This topic has been studied primarily using
      male soccer players. The performance effects in adult female soccer players is currently
      unknown.

      This warm-up has been shown to reduce non-contact injury rates in soccer players aged &gt;13. If
      performance benefits are demonstrated in this study, in addition to the reported injury
      reduction benefits of the FIFA11+ warm-up, program adherence and player performance could
      improve.

    <intervention_model_description>A parallel, two-group, pre-post comparative trial is proposed for this study. Two soccer teams comprise the convenience sample. One team (&quot;Impact&quot;) will be allocated to the control group while the other team (&quot;Hearts&quot;) are allocated to the intervention group. Participant allocation is premeditated due to Dr. Matt Wentzell's regular paramedical involvement with the &quot;Hearts&quot; and therefore his ability to oversee and administer the intervention warm-up. The control warm-up will be run by the coaching staff of the control group.
Performance pre-testing will be performed by three trained assistants one week after the 2018/2019 soccer season begins. Tests will be performed three times with the best test score being recorded.
Both groups will then complete their assigned warm-up three times per week for eight weeks. Both groups will complete posttesting within three days of the trial period concluding in a fashion identical to that of the pre-testing session.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants from both teams will be aware of whether or not they received the intervention warm-up since the intervention warm-up would be a deviation from what each team typically performs for a warm-up.
Investigator, Dr. Matt Wentzell is not blinded to which group is receiving the intervention warm-up since he will be leading the warm-up over the 8-week period.
The three trained assistants will be performing the performance pre- and posttesting. They will be blinded to the group each player has been allocated to.
Any study member that is not blinded will not be performing the pre- and posttesting.</masking_description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in 10m Sprint Times After an 8 Week Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention is 8 weeks in duration with baseline and post-test outcome measurements occurring within 3 days of the commencement and end of the intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>10m sprint times will be recorded in seconds.
The 10m sprint involves a stationary participant starting behind a timing gate and running through a second timing gate 10 meters away.
Three trials will be performed during the pre-test and the posttest, with the best time being selected for each. Participants will have a 2-minute break between trials.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Agility T-Test Times After an 8 Week Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention is 8 weeks in duration with baseline and post-test outcome measurements occurring within 3 days of the commencement and end of the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Agility T-test times will be recorded in seconds..
The Agility T-Test involves a stationary participant running forward through a timing gate to touch a cone 10 yards away, shuffle 5 yards to the left to touch a second cone, shuffle right 10 yards to touch a third cone, shuffle left to touch a fourth cone (the first cone touched after the 10 yard run), then back-peddle 10 yards to pass through the timing gate a second time. This running pattern creates a &quot;T&quot; shape with the vertical and horizontal components of the &quot;T&quot; measuring 10 yards each.
Three trials will be performed during the pre-test and the posttest, with the best time being selected for each. Participants will have a 2-minute break between trials.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Squat Jump Height After an 8 Week Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention is 8 weeks in duration with baseline and post-test outcome measurements occurring within 3 days of the commencement and end of the intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Squat jumps will be measured in centimeters.
This test requires each participant to stand on a contact mat with their hands on their hips, squat and pause in a position with their knees at a 90 degree angle, then propel upward as high as possible.
Three trials will be performed during the pre-test and the posttest, with the best time being selected for each. Participants will have a 1-minute break between trials.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Warm-up Attendance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Practice and game attendance will be recorded so warm-up compliance may be calculated. This will be done three days per week for eight weeks.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Player Information</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes before pre-testing.</time_frame>
    <description>Month and year of birth, height, weight and player position, number of years playing soccer, injury status, approximate number of hours of moderate/high intensity exercise per week (including soccer), and pregnancy status will be collected from each player.
This information will be collected to compare and contrast the averages of these variables once participants are assigned to the control or intervention group.</description>

    <description>The FIFA11+ has three parts and consist of 15 exercises.
Part 1 consists of active stretching, running and controlled partner contact drills.
Part 2 has three difficulty levels for 6 sets of exercises. The exercises consist of core and leg strength exercises, balance and plyometric drills. The exercises in this section are perhaps the most unique element to the FIFA11+ warm-up, as strength-specific exercises like the Nordic Hamstring Curl are not generally included in soccer warm-ups.
Part 3 consists of higher intensity running drills, compared to those covered in Part 1.
Unlike many soccer warm-ups, the FIFA11+ has been studied rigorously in terms of its injury reduction potential.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be a female amateur soccer players on a North Shore Girls Soccer Club Selects A
             Team

          -  Must be between the ages of 18 and 45

          -  Must play a forward, midfield or defender position

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mustn't play a goal keeper position. The physical demands of this position is
             drastically different than all other soccer positions. The training effects from
             practices and games are unique and may therefore influence the effects the FIFA11+ has
             on players of this particular positions.

          -  Mustn't have an illness or injury preventing them from participating in soccer
             practice, games, and testing procedures. Injury or illness would likely result in
             poorer physical performance outcomes relative to healthy participants.

          -  Mustn't miss a physical performance testing session. Pre- and posttest data is
             required to determine if there are changes in performance metrics in relation to both
             the intervention and control groups.

          -  Mustn't be pregnant or of childbearing potential for the duration of the study (10
             weeks). The PI and Co-Investigators are not familiar with each participant's
             reproductive health and history or how pregnancy may affect each participant's
             response to either the intervention or control group. It is therefore decided that
             participants that are pregnant or of childbearing potential will be removed from the
             study.

The 10m sprint involves a stationary participant starting behind a timing gate and running through a second timing gate 10 meters away.
Three trials will be performed during the pre-test and the posttest, with the best time being selected for each. Participants will have a 2-minute break between trials.</description>

            <description>This group will complete the FIFA11+ warm-up three times per week for eight weeks.
FIFA11+: The FIFA11+ has three parts and consist of 15 exercises.
Part 1 consists of active stretching, running and controlled partner contact drills.
Part 2 has three difficulty levels for 6 sets of exercises. The exercises consist of core and leg strength exercises, balance and plyometric drills. The exercises in this section are perhaps the most unique element to the FIFA11+ warm-up, as strength-specific exercises like the Nordic Hamstring Curl are not generally included in soccer warm-ups.
Part 3 consists of higher intensity running drills, compared to those covered in Part 1.
Unlike many soccer warm-ups, the FIFA11+ has been studied rigorously in terms of its injury reduction potential.</description>

'Usual' Soccer Warm-up: This warm-up is time-matched to the FIFA11+ (approximately 20 minutes) and is considered 'usual' for the team.
This warm-up consists of stretching, running and agility drills, in addition to &quot;small sided&quot; games with a soccer ball, which is not included in the FIFA11+.
The 'usual' warm-up is decided by the coach with no standardization nor any formal research on its effectiveness in injury reduction or performance enhancement.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Agility T-Test Times After an 8 Week Intervention</title>
        <description>Agility T-test times will be recorded in seconds..
The Agility T-Test involves a stationary participant running forward through a timing gate to touch a cone 10 yards away, shuffle 5 yards to the left to touch a second cone, shuffle right 10 yards to touch a third cone, shuffle left to touch a fourth cone (the first cone touched after the 10 yard run), then back-peddle 10 yards to pass through the timing gate a second time. This running pattern creates a &quot;T&quot; shape with the vertical and horizontal components of the &quot;T&quot; measuring 10 yards each.

            <description>This group will complete the FIFA11+ warm-up three times per week for eight weeks.
FIFA11+: The FIFA11+ has three parts and consist of 15 exercises.
Part 1 consists of active stretching, running and controlled partner contact drills.
Part 2 has three difficulty levels for 6 sets of exercises. The exercises consist of core and leg strength exercises, balance and plyometric drills. The exercises in this section are perhaps the most unique element to the FIFA11+ warm-up, as strength-specific exercises like the Nordic Hamstring Curl are not generally included in soccer warm-ups.
Part 3 consists of higher intensity running drills, compared to those covered in Part 1.
Unlike many soccer warm-ups, the FIFA11+ has been studied rigorously in terms of its injury reduction potential.</description>

          <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Agility T-Test Times After an 8 Week Intervention</title>
          <description>Agility T-test times will be recorded in seconds..
The Agility T-Test involves a stationary participant running forward through a timing gate to touch a cone 10 yards away, shuffle 5 yards to the left to touch a second cone, shuffle right 10 yards to touch a third cone, shuffle left to touch a fourth cone (the first cone touched after the 10 yard run), then back-peddle 10 yards to pass through the timing gate a second time. This running pattern creates a &quot;T&quot; shape with the vertical and horizontal components of the &quot;T&quot; measuring 10 yards each.
Three trials will be performed during the pre-test and the posttest, with the best time being selected for each. Participants will have a 2-minute break between trials.</description>
