  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of FT-2102 as a single
      agent and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in patients with advanced solid tumors
      and gliomas.

      The study is divided into two parts: single agent FT-2102 followed by combination therapy.

      Part 1: A single agent, open-label study in up to five cohorts (glioma, hepatobiliary tumors,
      chondrosarcoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and other IDH1 mutant solid tumors) that
      will include a Phase 1 dose confirmation followed by a Phase 2 investigation of clinical
      activity in up to 4 cohorts. During the dose confirmation, additional doses or altered dose
      schedules may be explored.

      Part 2: An open-label study of FT-2102 in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Patients
      will be enrolled across 4 different disease cohorts, examining the effect of FT-2102 +
      azacitidine (glioma and chondrosarcoma), FT-2102+nivolumab (hepatobiliary tumors) and
      FT-2102+gemcitabine/cisplatin (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). There will be a safety
      lead-in followed by a Phase 2 evaluation in up to four cohorts of patients.
