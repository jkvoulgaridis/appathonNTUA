  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the effects of interactive video game-based exercise (IVGB) on balance in
      persons with Parkinson's disease . Twenty-four patients were randomly allocated to two groups
      (12 participants per group). Group A underwent IVGB training for the first 6 weeks, with no
      exercise in the subsequent 6 weeks. Group B had no exercise for the first 6 weeks and then
      received IVGB training in the subsequent 6 weeks. Both subjective and objective measures were
      used to determine whether IVGB exercise improves balance function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experiments were conducted as a prospective, randomized, single blinded, crossover,
      12-week trial. The group A undergoes the IVGB training in the initial 6 weeks (intervention
      phase), follows by suspended from exercise in the subsequent 6 weeks (control phase). The
      group B does not received treatment in the first 6 weeks (control phase), and then performs
      IVGB training in the following 6 weeks (intervention phase). For all participants, The
      36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES), Berg Balance
      Scale (BBS), Multidirectional reach test (MDRT) and Maximum step length (MSL) test were
      assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment.

    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants perform a series of 14 functional balance tasks, such as maintaining a quiet stance, sitting-to-stand, shifting weight and reaching, turning in place, standing on one leg, and maintaining a tandem stance. The performance of each task is scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (from 0 to 4). A score of 0 denotes the inability of the participant to perform the task, and a score of 4 denotes that the participant can complete the task based on a preset criterion. The highest possible score is 56 . Previous studies have shown that inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of BBS is high in elderly people and stroke patients.</description>

    <measure>Change of 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>The 8 scales in SF 36 including Physical function (PF), Role-physical (RP), Bodily pain (BP), General health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Function (SF), Role-Emotional (RE), Mental Health (MH) . Neuromuscular condition is one of the most frequently studied disease with use of SF-36 .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>The MFES is a 14-item rating scale questionnaire that contains the original 10-activity Falls Efficacy Scale and 4 additional activities. Items are rated from 0 (not confident at all) to 10 (completely confident), and the highest possible score is 140.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Multidirectional Reach Test (MDRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were required to reach in the forward, left and right directions. For the forward-reaching direction, the participants began by raising both arms to the shoulder level. They were then instructed to reach forward as far as they could without moving their feet, while maintaining the end-range position for 3 seconds. A soft measuring tape fixed to the wall was used to measure the start and end positions of the middle finger to measure the reaching distance. The same instructions were provided for the lateral reaching tests, except that the participants lifted only their right or left arm when reaching in the right or left directions, respectively. Three trials were performed in each direction, and the reaching distance was normalized according to the measured foot length.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Maximum Step Length (MSL) test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>The participants performed the MSL test in the forward, lateral and backward directions. For the forward direction test, the participants assumed the starting position by crossing their arms over their chest. They were then instructed to take a maximum step forward with one leg without moving the other, and then to return to the starting position with a single step.</description>
