    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is often painful, and is caused by
      neurotoxic chemotherapy including vincristine. It is a cause of significant impairment in
      quality of life in patients surviving to a solid cancer or malignant lymphoma. The only
      recognized prevention is based on pre-existing neuropathy and early detection of neuropathic
      signs and symptoms in individuals subjected to neurotoxic chemotherapy, justifying sometimes
      a change in the therapeutic strategy when other molecules are available. It seems obvious
      that to identify early markers of CIPN and to develop preventive therapeutic strategies, are
      priorities for improving patients' quality of life and enable them to follow optimal
      treatment.

      Purpose:

      To describe in patients treated for non-Hodgkin's type B malignant lymphoma with multidrug
      therapy containing vincristine, the impact of candesartan on the occurrence of neuropathy
      measured by the variation of TNSc (Total Neuropathy Score clinical version, evaluating
      clinical signs of neuropathy)

    <description>The primary endpoint in this clinical study is the V1 - V4 variation of the TNSc score TNSc is the Total Neuropathy Score Clinical version scale
Validated 7-item TNSc quantifies subjective sensory and motor symptoms, vibration sensation, strength, and reflexes.Items are rated using a 0 to 4 scale and summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 28. Higher scores reflect more severe neuropathy.
The evaluation of the TNSc will be performed by a blinded evaluator of the randomization group</description>

    <description>Variation oh the VAS score between V1 - V3 and between V1- V4 The visual analogue scale (VAS) is commonly used as the outcome measure to characterize the intensity of pain . It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot;
Higher scores reflect more severe pain.</description>
