  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the correlation and agreement of Quantra-derived parameters with
      parameters reported by the ROTEM delta and standard laboratory tests in cardiac surgery
      patients. In addition the association of Quantra-derived parameters with select platelet
      function tests will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra QPlus Cartridge
      (previously called the Surgical Cartridge), was developed to monitor hemostasis during major
      surgical procedures in adult patients. The cartridge provides six parameters that depict the
      functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This single site, prospective observational study will investigate the correlation and
      agreement of Quantra-derived parameters with parameters reported by the ROTEM delta and
      standard laboratory tests (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, platelet count) in cardiac surgery patients.
      As an additional exploratory study, the association of Quantra-derived parameters with select
      platelet function tests will be investigated.
