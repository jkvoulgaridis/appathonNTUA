  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate effect of 52-week treatment with Alglucosidase Alfa in the extension of survival
      and improvement of cardiomyopathy measured by Left Ventricular Mass Index in Chinese patients
      with infantile-onset Pompe Disease.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To observe the improvement of physical growth, motor and cognitive development of
           52-week treatment with Alglucosidase Alfa in infantile-onset Pompe Disease from the
           baseline.

        -  To observe the efficacy on survival free of invasive ventilation, use of any ventilation
           support of 52- week treatment with Alglucosidase Alfa in Chinese patients with
           infantile-onset Pompe Disease.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Alglucosidase Alfa in Chinese patients with
           infantile-onset Pompe Disease.

      Total of 56 weeks in the study period, including an up to 28-day screening period and 52-week
      treatment period, followed by 30-day post-treatment observation period.

      After the end of 52-week treatment, patients' guardians could choose to participate in a
      patient assistance program (PAP) sponsored by Sanofi and launched before first patient out
      (FPO) or reimbursement from social insurance for continued treatment.
