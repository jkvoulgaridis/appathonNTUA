  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many postmenopausal women have vasomotor symptoms during adjuvant hormonal treatment for
      breast cancer. PCC-100 is a pollen extract used for alleviation of postmenopausal symptoms.
      In a randomised, double blinded study pollen extract PCC-100 will be used to treat vasomotor
      complaints in postmenopausal women under adjuvant hormonal treatment and also in menopausal
      women without a history of breast cancer.
