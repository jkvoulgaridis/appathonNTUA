  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain affects patients' daily life. Patients can suffer from various symptoms which
      appear intermittent or permanent; pain, sensory malfunction, reduction of muscular strength
      and coordination. Therefore, patients are impaired in participation and activity.

      Physiotherapy is recommended to improve those symptoms and to positively affect the cause of
      the problem. However, some patients do not benefit from physiotherapeutic treatment and
      require a surgery.

      The investigators intend to attend patients suffering from back pain and to document the
      changes of pain and functional parameters over a period of 6 months. The investigators
      include pre-operative, post-operative or non-operated patients which allows to discuss the
      different treatment options and its effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess pain and functional parameters physicians, medical staff and physiotherapist often
      use subjective clinical testings which impede the comparability of testings over time,
      between testers and between subjects.

      Therefore, a second aim of this study is to evaluate each subjective clinical test with a
      standardized objective measurement tool.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline pain sensation at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes of pain, sensory malfunction and numbness assessed by pain drawings and the visual analog scale. The visual analog scale ranges from 0 to 10 points, where 0 indicates no pain, no numbness or no impairment of sensation and 10 stands for the highest pain value, total numbness or unsustainable paresthesia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline neurological status at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The neurological status will be assessed by the straight leg raise test. The hydrogoniometer serves as assessment tool and measures the range of motion in degrees. The test will be performed following its description and will be stopped when the patient recognises his symptoms or when more than 70 degrees of hip flexion are reached without causing any symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline tissue tenderness status at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The neurological status will be assessed by the pressure pain threshold over tenderpoints along the ilica crest. The NOD-algometer device serves as assessment tool and measures the pressure pain threshold in kPa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline reflex activity status at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The neurological status will be assessed by the reflex activity of the patellar and achilles tendon reflex. An acceleration attached to the moving limb will measure the amplitude of the limb movement in m/s2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline muscular strength at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular strength will be assessed by an handheld dynamometer measuring in Newton.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline balance at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Balance during the one leg stance with eyes open will be assessed by the SwayStar measurement tool which is based on integrated gyroscopes to measure pitch and roll movements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline quality of life at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. The total score is calculated from subscales by adding the points. The total score ranges from 0 to 100 points. 0 indicates a low quality of life and 100 indicates a high quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline disability at 6 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 measurement time points through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be assessed by the German version of the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. The total score is calculated from subscales by adding the points. The total score ranges from 0 to 50 points. 0 indicates no disability, 50 indicates a high degree of disability.</description>

        The investigators are looking for subjects suffering from back pain, who visit the
        neurosurgery department of the Cantonal hospital of Grisons in Chur to discuss the further
        treatment of their disease. The subjects get their normal medical and physiotherapeutical
        treatment independent of the study participation.
