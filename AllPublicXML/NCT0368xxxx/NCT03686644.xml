  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy present early in the childhood altered muscular properties,
      characterized by short muscle belly length and increased stiffness which contribute to
      contracture and limiting joint range of motion. In order to prevent equinus deformity, ankle
      foot orthoses for night splinting are usually used in children with spastic Cerebral Palsy
      (CP). However, there's a lack of proof about efficacy by using this modality of treatment.
      Moreover, impact on quality of life for children and families, cost for society were high.
