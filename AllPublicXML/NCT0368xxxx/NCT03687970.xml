  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that using the Diode Laser fiber type Selective Stimulator (DLss)
      in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) will allow for the
      assessment of changes in small-fiber pain thresholds, to identify differences between
      subjects who received chemotherapy and developed painful CIPN, compared to subjects who
      received similar chemotherapy but did not develop painful CIPN (control group).

      Additionally, the investigators would like to investigate whether the response to DLss
      correlates with pain severity in patients with persistent painful neuropathy.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a non-invasive, bedside quantitative test that
      is specific for painful CIPN. If the investigators' initial hypothesis is confirmed, the next
      step would be to design a prospective longitudinal study and assess changes in DLss early
      after initiation of chemotherapy, to determine whether this approach can help identify early
      predictive parameters of painful CIPN.

    <description>-A self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity (4 items which generate the PAIN SEVERITY score), list current treatments and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life (7 items which generate the PAIN INTERFERENCE score) on a 10 point scale.</description>
