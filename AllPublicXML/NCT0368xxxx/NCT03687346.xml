  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed project is to test whether several biological factors (such as
      elevated brain reward region and attention region response to high-calorie foods, weaker
      inhibitory region response to high-calorie foods, habitual caloric deprivation, and elevated
      limbic region responsivity) increase the risk of problematic eating (bingeing and purging) in
      female adolescents.

      Participants will be adolescent girls aged 14-16, some of whom will have parental history of
      eating pathology. Participants will be recruited from the general population but their age,
      gender, and the presence of parental lifetime eating pathology will create a high-risk
      sample. The goals of the proposed project are to (1) conduct a prospective high-risk study to
      test whether proposed biological risk factors predict the future onset of core ED symptoms
      (e.g., binge eating, compensatory behaviors); (2) test hypotheses regarding how these
      biological risk factors and established self-report ED risk factors may work together to
      predict ED behavior onset; (3) examine if certain biological factors account for the effects
      of certain established self-reported ED risk factors (e.g., elevated brain response to thin
      models accounts for the effect of questionnaire-measured thin-ideal internalization). The
      participants will complete a baseline assessment and then follow-ups assessments over a span
      of three years. In addition, participants will complete one fMRI scan after the first
      assessment.

      During the COVID-19 shelter-at-home order, the investigators will not measure in person only
      outcomes including fMRI scans, height and weight measurement for BMI calculation nor IAT
      computer paradigms for all participants that have assessments due during this order.
