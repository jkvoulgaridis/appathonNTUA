    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well an informational intervention works in increasing lactation
      practices by African American women. Giving additional information about breastfeeding and
      breast cancer risks to African American women may help doctors understand the factors that
      affect the decision to breast feed and to test whether providing useful information about
      breastfeeding will change breastfeeding behavior.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Develop appropriate intervention strategies about the &quot;breastfeeding-breast cancer
      connection&quot; appropriate for use by experienced Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Peer
      Counselors (PCs) to disseminate to African-American mothers through a community-based
      participatory research (CBPR) approach including social media..

      II. Assess the comparative cognitive (e.g., knowledge, utility, cost-benefit), affective
      association (e.g., feelings), socioeconomic, familial and intent/outcome (e.g.,
      breastfeeding) measures pre- and post-intervention to determine effectiveness of the content
      to impact cognitive and feeling measures and increase breastfeeding in young African-American
      mothers compared to an existing counseling program.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive standard information about pregnancy and breastfeeding.
      Participants may also participate in a focus group with their partner/spouse or family
      members after the baby's birth.

      GROUP II: Participants receive standard information about pregnancy and breastfeeding as well
      as information about breastfeeding and breast cancer. Participants may also participate in a
      focus group with their partner/spouse or family members after the baby's birth.

      After completion of the information intervention, participants are followed for up to 1 year.

    <description>Will be recorded and transcribed. This text will be coded and categorized by Erwin following methods established in earlier research. The PEN-3 Model analysis will focus on the most salient factors as they apply to what will be considered the ?Positive, Existential, Negative? influences within the Cultural Empowerment domain in reference to breastfeeding and formula feeding topics. Will sort the responses into categories in a 3 x 3 table according to the Relationships and Expectations domain factors, ?Perceptions, Enablers, Nurturers,? on one axis, and the ?Positive, Existential, Negative? factors across the other axis. This categorical analysis will be reviewed and edited and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) peer counselors (PCs) to increase validity of the process.</description>
