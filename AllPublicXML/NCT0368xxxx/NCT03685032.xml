  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common problem and may lead to catastrophic
      complications, especially in neurosurgical cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of dexamethasone and ondansetron for preventing PONV in patients who underwent
      microvascular decompression surgery (MVD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blinded randomized control trial was conducted with 54 patients who
      underwent MVD. Patients were allocated into two groups. The study group (Gr. D) received
      intraoperative dexamethasone 4 mg iv and ondansetron 4 mg iv, whereas the control group (Gr.
      N) received placebo (0.9% normal saline 1 ml iv and 0.9% normal saline 2 ml iv). The
      incidence and severity of PONV were observed at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hr post-surgery.

    <masking_description>The study drugs based on a sequentially numbered list were prepared in the same way. These drugs had similar characteristics, including clear color and no observable particles, and were loaded into syringes labeled for each group. The attending anesthesiologists, anesthetic nurses, and ward nurses, as well as the patients were blinded to the computer-generated randomization lists.</masking_description>
