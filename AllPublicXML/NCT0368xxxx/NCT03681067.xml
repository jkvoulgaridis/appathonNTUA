    <textblock>
      This trial aims to investigate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of humanised
      antibody GSK1070806 delivered via intravenous infusion in the treatment of patients with
      moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. 30-36 patients will be enrolled into the trial, with two
      thirds of the patients receiving active drug and one third receiving placebo. After 30
      patients have been recruited into the study the sample size will be reassessed and up to an
      additional 6 patients could be recruited (i.e. up to 36 patients).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      investigate the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of single intravenous infusion (one dose on Day 1) of GSK1070806 or placebo,
      in patients with active, moderate to severe CD. The primary objective of the study is to
      assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose IV administration of GSK1070806. A
      secondary objective will be to evaluate the effect of GSK1070806 in change of CDAI over time.
      Further secondary endpoints will include assessment of endoscopic response in patients at
      week 12. (Other secondary endpoints are detailed in Section 2.3).

      30 patients will be recruited with randomisation of 2:1 active drug to placebo in multiple
      centres in the UK. After 30 patients have been recruited into the study the sample size will
      be reassessed and up to an additional 6 patients could be recruited (i.e. up to 36 patients).
      These additional patients will also be recruited with randomisation of 2:1 active drug to
      placebo.

      An initial screening shall take place to identify patients diagnosed with CD for at least 3
      months prior to screening, active disease based on CDAI score of 220-450 points and
      colonoscopic confirmation of active mucosal inflammation (SES-CD excluding narrowed component
      ≥6; or in patients with isolated ileal disease ≥4).

      Patients who do not have colonoscopically demonstrated mucosal inflammation will be excluded
      even if they have MRI evidence of Crohn's disease more proximally in the small intestine. For
      inclusion, CDAI criteria have to be fulfilled within 7 days prior to dosing and colonoscopic
      SES-CD criteria has to be fulfilled with 28 days prior to dosing.

      The induction of clinical activity will be assessed at week 12 by CDAI score, average
      clinical SF and/or AP scores as well as by colonoscopic assessment of baseline video images
      and week 12 video images.

      The first 5 patients randomised into the trial will be dosed at least 3 days apart. At the
      interim analysis time point, a safety decision will be taken on the subsequent recruitment
      and patient spacing out strategy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Written informed consent prior to any of the screening procedures including
             discontinuation of prohibited medications. (see Section 7.11 for additional
             information)

          2. Patients that have been diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease for at least
             3 months prior to Screening Visit 1 defined by CDAI score between 220-450

          3. Patients are required to have endoscopic evidence of active Crohn's disease at
             Baseline (screening visit 1) defined by endoscopic appearance: SES-CD excluding the
             narrowed component of ≥ 6 (or ≥4 for patients with isolated ileal disease).

          4. AST and ALT ≤ 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)

          5. Male or female participants aged ≥16 years (up to 80 years)

             Male participants:

          6. A male participant must agree to use contraception as detailed in Appendix 5 of this
             protocol for at least 180 days post-dose of study medication and refrain from donating
             sperm during this period.

        Female participants:

        7. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding
        and not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) defined as at least one of the following
        conditions: i. Premenopausal female with documented hysterectomy ii Premenopausal female
        with documented bilateral salpingectomy or oophorectomy iii. Postmenopausal female defined
        as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle
        stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a
        postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement
        therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement
        is insufficient.

        iv. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
        the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
        during the trial. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
        postmenopausal status before trial enrolment.

        v. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 5 for at least 180
        days post-dose of trial medication. If a hormonal method of birth control is selected from
        the list in Appendix 1 then participants must have been using these methods at least 28
        days prior to GSK1070806 administration, or be abstinent, or utilise a condom as a method
        of contraception until the selected hormonal method has been in place for the 28 day
        period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A participant will not be eligible for inclusion in this trial if any of the following
        criteria apply:

         18. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening, 5 half-lives or
             twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever
             is longer)

         19. Participant has received live, attenuated or recombinant vaccine(s) within 2 months of
             randomisation or will require vaccination within 3 months of trial drug infusion
