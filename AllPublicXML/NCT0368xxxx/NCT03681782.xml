  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth creates difficulties for the child in starting his diet and digestion. The
      immaturity of the major vital functions complicates the abdominal transit. The initial diet,
      essentially parenteral in the central way, decreases progressively according to the digestive
      tolerance allowing the increase of the enteral feedings to optimize the growth. To ensure
      this transition, nurses nurses in Neonatology service, through their knowledge and expertise,
      practice a daily gesture: abdominal massage-care. This prevents or remedies a slowing of
      transit. The paramedical clinical examination of the child, determines the realization of
      this care. Several studies have proved the benefit of massage on the weight gain of premature
      babies. These stimulate peristalsis, decrease the duration of intestinal transit and the
      sensations of discomfort and pain related to it. Currently in Neonatology, developmental care
      (NIDCAP) is an approach to individualized care for the premature to improve its evolution.
      The fine observation of his behavior allows us to adapt our care and to ensure the respect of
      his pace. However, the first sensory capacity developed in the fetus, the touch can also be a
      source of over-stimulation for the premature baby. Moreover, the greater the prematurity, the
      greater the risk of occurrence of digestive complications. Can the abdominal care-massage in
      premature babies be harmful or risk increasing existing symptoms? The abdominal care-massage
      is neither described nor referenced in the nomenclature of nursing, neither taught nor
      subject to medical prescription.

      Few publications exist on this subject, no large-scale research has been reported. On the
      other hand, the perception of our empirical practice seems to show that the abdominal
      massage-care is an important aid to the smooth transit of the premature newborn. Transmitted
      orally by professionals to newcomers to Neonatology, this treatment is carried out in a
      heterogeneous manner according to professionals. Convinced of its effectiveness, carers
      wonder about their practice: is there an optimal technique without risk for the child?
      Determining the absence of risk and the effectiveness of the abdominal care-massage suggests
      a wider benefit for the well-being and progress of the premature child until he leaves the
      hospital. This validated practice could be disseminated on a larger scale in other neonatal
      departments.
