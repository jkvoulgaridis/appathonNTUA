      • Trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the advent of
      specialized trauma centers the outcome of patients who sustain major trauma remains
      disappointing. Plain radiography and more advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound,
      computerised tomography (CT) and angiography, have a major role to play in the early decision
      making and subsequent management of patients who sustain polytrauma. This article discusses
      the choice of emergency imaging techniques available in chest trauma for clinicians and
      radiologists; their evaluation and some of the common pitfalls that may lead to errors of
      interpretation.

      Imaging plays a key role for both, the primary diagnostic work-up, and the secondary
      assessment of potential treatment. Despite its well-known limitations, the posteroanterior
      chest radiograph remains the starting point of the imaging work-up. Adjunctive imaging with
      computed tomography, that recently is increasingly often performed on multidetector computed
      tomography units, adds essential information not readily available on the conventional
      radiograph. This allows better definition of trauma-associated thoracic injuries not only in
      acute traumatic aortic injury, but also in pulmonary, tracheobronchial, cardiac, diaphragmal,
      and thoracic skeletal injuries. This article reviews common radiographic findings in patients
      after chest trauma, shows typical imaging features resulting from thoracic injury, presents
      imaging algorithms, and recalls to the reader less common but clinically relevant entities
      encountered in patients after thoracic trauma.

        Information collected by this study may contribute to the care of patients in the future
        who have the same lesions as those that participate in this study. The information may also
        improve the future management of study participants. On the other hand patients will
        benefit from the clinical and radiological follow up postoperatively. There are no known
        risks associated with participation in this study. Patients' treatment and follow up will
        not be altered by any means
