  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This explorative investigation will assess the adhesion and tolerability of the Rivelin®
      plain patch when applied directly on lesions in subjects with Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Rivelin® plain patch works by forming a protective barrier over a lesion, protecting it
      from further irritation and thus providing pain relief in much the same way as the adhesive
      pastes and films that are available to treat VLS. However, the adhesion/protection time of
      the Rivelin® plain patch is expected to be longer compared to current treatment with
      bioadhesive agents, thereby potentially increasing the pain free period for the subject.

      This study is undertaken to gather information covering adhesion time and tolerability of the
      Rivelin® plain patch on areas affected by VLS. Since protecting a lesion with a physical
      barrier could reduce the sensation of pain caused by normal function, this investigation will
      also explore subject experienced pain and/or symptom relief during use of the patch for
      further development.
