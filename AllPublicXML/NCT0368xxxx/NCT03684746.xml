  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research sets to address two key areas. The first is identified by the researcher in
      academic literature that there is a lack of a comprehensive innovation adoption model in UK
      National Health System (NHS), specifically for Medical Robotic Surgery. Existing frameworks
      are mainly developed in the US or in other fields. The second problem was identified by
      surgeons involved in Robotic Surgery in Royal Bournemouth Hospital (RBH). The project started
      by offering RBH a deeper understanding of the innovation adoption process, issues and
      development of an adapted innovation model, however after our initial meeting with the
      Surgical Director and his team, it was clear that one the main areas RBH was keen for us to
      investigate, was the communication pathway of all stakeholders involved in robotic surgery
      adoption. They were concerned that key staff dealing with patients undergoing medical robotic
      surgery were uninformed about the technology and process which can impact patients'
      experience and staff communication.

      The research will develop a comprehensive innovation adoption model for robotic surgery (and
      similar medical innovation) in NHS. Currently there are no models adapted to NHS UK structure
      and requirements. This model will assist the NHS to understand and evaluate any innovation
      adoption process within the NHS and to avoid future innovation adoption failure.

      The case example will Identify the communication pathway and key stakeholders in RBH for the
      process of Gastrointestinal Robotic Surgery, evaluation of stakeholders' knowledge and needs
      and further proposing ways to improve adoption and increase knowledge. NHS can use the
      proposed communication pathway to identify stakeholders that need to be informed, trained and
      communicated to, in any innovation adoption process within NHS.

    <description>To develop a 'Surgical Innovation Framework' through discussion with surgeons, medical experts and staff at the research site. This framework would then be of use to other medical/surgical areas within the NHS, as there is currently no model adapted to the NHS' needs and requirements. The research will increase knowledge and enable better communication.</description>
