    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of a single session of bright light treatment
      (BLT) on emotional information processing in healthy volunteers. We hypothesised that BLT can
      acutely push the processing of emotional information towards a prioritisation of positive
      (relative to negative) input. To test this hypothesis, healthy volunteers were randomly
      allocated to receive either bright light treatment or sham-placebo treatment and study
      participants as well as investigators were blind as to which treatment was used. After
      treatment, all participants underwent testing with the Oxford Emotional Test Battery, an
      established set of psychological tasks that allow to assess how emotional information is
      processed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Bright light treatment (BLT) is an efficacious treatment for depressive disorders but the
      causal mechanisms by which it exerts its clinical effects are largely unknown. According to
      the cognitive neuropsychological model of antidepressant treatment action, one way by which
      antidepressant treatments lead to clinical effects is by acutely inducing a relatively
      increased preferential processing of positive (as compared to negative) emotional stimuli.
      Whether BLT has the potential to induce such positive biases is not known to date.

      Aim of study:

      To investigate the influence of single-dose BLT on emotion-related information processing in
      healthy volunteers.

      Methods:

      Using a double-blind, parallel-group design, fifty healthy volunteers (male and female) were
      randomly allocated to a single session (60 minutes) of treatment with either bright light (10
      000 lux) or a credible placebo-sham condition (deactivated negative ion generator). After
      treatment, all participants underwent testing with the Oxford Emotional Test Battery, an
      established battery of behavioural tasks that allow to assess emotional information
      processing in multiple cognitive domains. This battery consists of a facial expression
      recognition task, an emotional categorization task, an emotional dot probe task, an emotional
      recall task and an emotional recognition task. Before and after treatment, subjective state
      was assessed using different questionnaires.

      Hypotheses:

      Our working hypothesis, in line with the cognitive neuropsychological model of antidepressant
      treatment action, is that one-time BLT can induce biases towards positive stimuli in multiple
      cognitive domains and this bias will be present even in the absence of observable changes in
      subjective state.

      Implications of the study:

      This study will show whether a single dose of BLT can influence emotion-related information
      processing in a similar way as previously observed for antidepressant drugs. If this is the
      case, then the clinical effects of BLT could be explained through its acute effects on
      emotional processing. On a broader level, the results of this study will also add to our
      understanding of any potential effects that acute exposure to bright light (e.g. sunlight)
      could have on the healthy human mind.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in a facial expression recognition task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed within 2 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with individual pictures of facial expressions of emotions. Each presented face displays one of six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise). Each emotional expression is presented at different levels of intensity which have been created by combining shape and texture features of the two extremes &quot;neutral&quot; (0%) and &quot;full prototypical emotion&quot; (100%) to varying degrees. Examples of neutral facial expressions are presented as well. Participants are instructed to correctly classify each facial expression as angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, surprised or neutral both as quickly and as accurately as possible. Responses are made by pushing one out of seven labelled keys on a response box. Hit rates, false alarm rates, and reaction times for correct classifications are measured separately for each emotion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional categorisation task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed within 2 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with positive and negative personality descriptors and are asked to classify the valence of each word. These words describe either extremely agreeable/positive characteristics (e.g. &quot;cheerful&quot;, &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;optimistic&quot;) or extremely disagreeable/negative characteristics (e.g. &quot;domineering&quot;, &quot;untidy&quot;, &quot;hostile&quot;) and are presented individually in the centre of the screen. Participants are instructed to imagine themselves overhearing someone describing them with each of the words and to indicate as quickly and accurately as possible whether they would like or dislike to be described with each of the words. Responses are made by pressing a correspondingly labelled key on a button box. Reaction times for correct classifications are measured separately for positive and negative words.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional faces dot probe task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed within 2 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pictures of positive and negative emotional stimuli (happy and fearful facial expressions) are presented individually together with a matched neutral stimulus (neutral face). On each trial, one stimulus is shown above and the other below a central fixation point. Subsequently, a probe appears behind one of the stimuli and participants have to correctly classify the probe as quickly and as accurately as possible. Stimuli can be masked (i.e. presented very briefly and followed by a jumbled face) or unmasked (i.e. presented for a longer period without a subsequent masking stimulus). Reaction times for correct responses are recorded and vigilance scores are calculated for masked and unmasked positive and negative stimuli by subtracting reaction time data from trials when the probe appeared in the same position as the emotional stimulus (congruent trials) from trials when the probe appeared in the opposite position to the emotional stimulus (incongruent trials).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional recall task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed within 2 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Following a delay period after the emotional categorization task (about 15 min), emotional recall memory is assessed. Participants are asked to recall and write down as many words as possible from the emotional categorization task. Numbers of correctly and incorrectly recalled positive and negative words are measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional recognition task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed within 2 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Following the emotional recall task, emotional recognition memory is assessed by presenting participants with the original personality descriptors plus an equal number of matched distractor words (50% positive, 50% negative). Participants are asked to indicate for each word as accurately and as quickly as possible whether they recognise it from the emotional categorization task. Numbers of correctly and incorrectly recognised items as well as reaction times for correct recognitions are measured separately for positive and negative words.</description>
