    <measure>Quality of Life - AFEQT</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life as measured by the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) scale. The scale consists of 21 questions with 7-point Likert scale responses. Questions 1-18 are grouped into three subscales (symptoms, daily activities and treatment concern). Questions 19-21 capture satisfaction with treatment and are not include in the HRQoL score of the questionnaire. Overall and subscale scores range from 0 to 100. Lower scores correspond to higher levels of disability (e.g., 0 corresponds to complete disability or responding &quot;extremely&quot; limited, difficult or bothersome to all questions answered), while a score of 100 corresponds to no disability (e.g., responding &quot;not at all&quot; limited, difficult or bothersome to all questions answered). For Satisfaction questions, a score of 100 corresponds to extreme satisfaction with current treatment.</description>

    <measure>Exercise compliance - IPAQ</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance to exercise recommendations will be measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) which calculates a metabolic equivalent (MET) score by asking participants the days and minutes exercised in three categories of intensity (vigorous, moderate, and walking) during the previous one week. MET values are as follows: walking = 3.3, moderate activity = 4, vigorous activity = 8). Results will be reported as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week) calculated by multiplying the MET value by the minutes the activity was carried out and the number of days the activity was undertaken. MET minutes achieved in each category will be added to get the total MET minutes of physical activity a week.</description>

AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values for adults are: normal (AHI&lt;5); mild (5≤AHI&lt;15); moderate (15≤AHI&lt;30) and severe (AHI≥30)</description>
