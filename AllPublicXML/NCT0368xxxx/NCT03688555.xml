             nostrils (with at least a score of 2 for each nostril) despite completion of a prior
             intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) treatment for at least 8 weeks before screening,
             with at least the 6 last weeks on INCS spray.

          -  Presence of at least 2 of the following symptoms at screening:

               -  nasal blockade/obstruction

               -  nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip)

               -  reduction or loss of smell.

          -  Male and female subjects aged between 18 and 70 years (inclusive) at screening.

          -  Systolic blood pressure 90 to 160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 50 to 100 mmHg, pulse
             rate 45 to 100 bpm (inclusive), measured on the dominant arm, after 5 minutes in the
             supine position at screening.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test predose on Day 1. Women of childbearing potential
             must consistently and correctly use (from at least first dosing, during the entire
             study, and for at least 30 days after last study treatment intake) 1 highly effective

               -  An exacerbation requiring systemic (oral and/or parenteral) steroid treatment or
                  hospitalization (&gt;24 h) for treatment of asthma has occurred within 3 months
