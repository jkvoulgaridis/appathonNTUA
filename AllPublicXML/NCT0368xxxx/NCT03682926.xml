      To verify the effect of an adapted electrostimulation (EE) protocol for stress and mixed
      urinary incontinence (SUI / M) and its impact on quality of life (QoL)

    <textblock>
      Controlled and randomized clinical trial performed at the Physiotherapy Outpatient Clinic at
      the Magalhães Neto Pavilion of ComHUPES / UFBA. Women aged between 30 and 65 years and
      diagnosis of SUI / IUM. The patients were allocated to two groups (GA) submitted to selective
      electrostimulation for tonic fiber, phasic fibers IIa / IIb and different times of electrical
      stimulation; (GB) used 50hz for all fibers by 20mm, both answered the questionnaire King's
      Health Questionnaire (KHQ).

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perineal muscle function evaluated subjectively by vaginal touch using the PERFECT system to measure strength (graded from 0 to 5), strength (holding capacity of contraction recorded in seconds) and number of contractions of tonic and phasic fibers (ability to repeat muscle contractions perineal). Objectively, the vaginal cones were used to determine which load the patient was able to support (kit with 5 cones with weights ranging from 20 to 70g)</description>

    <measure>King's Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It allows qualitative evaluation of the impact of urinary incontinence on the quality of life of women, it is responsible for 20 questions, divided into 8 domains, in addition to these domains, there are two other independent scales: the first evaluates the severity of UI (severity measures) and the second, the presence and intensity of urinary symptoms through the scale of urinary symptoms (VAS) where there is a graduation from 0 to 10, where the higher the score, the higher the severity</description>

    <description>Selective electrostimulation for tonic fiber, phasic fiber FIa and FIIb and different stimulus times. Muscle fibers (Tonic) with a frequency of 20Hz, pulse width (t) of 700μs to 1ms, time of rise and fall of the wave of 1.0 seconds, duration of contraction and repetition was based on the perineal evaluation But the resting time was twice as long as sustained. For the IIa (phasic) fibers the frequency was 50 Hz with a pulse width of 400μs to 500μs, for 3 seconds of sustentation and 6 seconds of relaxation, time of rise of 0,5 seconds and 0,5 seconds of descent. E for type IIb (phasic) fibers, 80 Hz frequency, pulse width 250μs to 400μs, 1 second contraction for 3 seconds rest and 0.2 seconds rise and fall time.</description>

Pulse width 700μs, rise and fall time of 2 seconds each, sustain time of 4 seconds and rest 8 seconds for 20 minutes, the intensity will be modulated, as in the previous group by patient tolerance in milliamperes.</description>
