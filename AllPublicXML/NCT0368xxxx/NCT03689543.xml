  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Some women who had depression in the perimenopause may have mood symptoms again if they stop
      estrogen therapy. Estrogen acts in the brain and other tissues by binding to at least three
      types of estrogen receptors. One of these receptors, estrogen receptor beta may affect
      anxiety and depression. The drug LY500307 acts only on this receptor. In this study,
      researchers will initially give you estrogen and then suddenly stop estrogen after three
      weeks. Then they will study how LY500307 affects mood symptoms.

      Objectives:

      To study how withdrawing estradiol affects mood. To test the safety and side effects of
      LY500307.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy women ages 45-65 who had depression related to perimenopause in recent years and
      whose mood systems got better with estradiol

      Design:

      -Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Psychiatric interview

      Gynecological exam

        -  Participants able to get pregnant must use effective barrier birth control throughout
           the study.

        -  During the first 3 weeks, participants will wear an estrogen patch. It is 1x2 inches and
           will be replaced every 3 days.

        -  For the next 3 weeks, participants will take 3 study capsules every morning. They will
           not know if they get the study drug or placebo.

        -  Some participants will also take a progesterone-like drug for 1 week at the end of the
           medication phase of the study.

        -  Participants will have 9 one-hour study visits. They will have blood samples and vital
           signs taken. They will answer questions about mood and behavior symptoms.

        -  Participants will keep a daily log of these symptoms.

        -  Participants will have 2 transvaginal ultrasounds. A probe is temporarily placed 2-3
           inches into the vaginal canal and sound waves are used to create pictures of the lining
           of the uturus.

        -  Participants will have a final visit 4 weeks after stopping the study drug. They will
           answer questions about mood and side effects.

      OBJECTIVE:

      During the perimenopause, the incidence of depression increases 1-5 and predicts increased
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood
      disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by estradiol s
      antidepressant efficacy and safety in perimenopausal depression. Moreover, observational
      studies report the emergence of depressive symptoms after the discontinuation of menopausal
      hormone therapy (HT) in 5-10% of women. The coincidence of declining ovarian function with
      the onset of depression led to the inference that withdrawal from physiologic estradiol
      levels underpinned depression during the perimenopause. To test this inference, we undertook
      a study to examine the role of estradiol withdrawal in perimenopausal depression. We
      evaluated the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in postmenopausal women
      with and those without a past perimenopausal depression. Results demonstrated that estradiol
      withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with a past perimenopausal depression, but
      not in those without such a history. This study was the first to provide direct evidence that
      estradiol withdrawal is the relevant physiologic trigger for depressive symptoms in women
      with this condition. In women with past perimenopausal depression, the recurrence of
      depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian
      estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women.
      These data also suggest that the effects of estradiol withdrawal are processed differently in
      some women, presumably by altering the brain network composition or activity that underlies
      affective state. In this next protocol, we will examine a possible mechanism mediating the
      effects of estradiol- withdrawal on mood symptoms in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with a
      past perimenopausal depression. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a selective
      estrogen receptor (ER) beta agonist (Lilly Compound LY500307) to prevent estradiol
      withdrawal-induced mood symptoms. The effects of estradiol primarily occur through activation
      of two receptor subtypes, often with opposing outcomes: estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, and ER
      beta. We focus on ER beta because the beta estrogen receptor is reported to mediate the
      effects of estradiol on the serotonergic system and mediate the antidepressant-like effects
      of estradiol in the forced-swim test. Moreover, selective agonists of estrogen receptor beta
      have been demonstrated to attenuate the behavioral and hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA)
      axis response to stress in animal studies. We propose to employ the selective estrogen
      receptor agonist LY500307 under double-blind, placebo controlled conditions to examine the
      specific role of estrogen receptor beta in the effects of estrogen withdrawal in women with a
      past perimenopause-related depression. Depressive symptoms will be measured with standardized
      ratings scales (i.e., Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and 17-item
      Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD)). Results of this study will determine the role of
      ER beta in estradiol withdrawal-induced mood symptoms and can provide preliminary data to
      support the efficacy and safety of this compound as a treatment for depression during the
      perimenopausal transition.
