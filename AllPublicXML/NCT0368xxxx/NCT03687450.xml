  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to initiate and complete the first investigation of the effect of a
      yoga-based program on resident physicians' psychological health using a randomized controlled
      trial to assess feasibility of the program in this population and measure outcomes across
      several domains. To meet the goals of the proposed project the investigators have identified
      3 specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Assess the acceptability and feasibility of the yoga program through
      measuring participation and conducting standardized interviews with a subset of yoga
      participants.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the yoga program on resident physicians' stress,
      burnout, resilience, mindfulness, mood, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality using
      quantitative self-report measures.

      Specific Aim 3. Examine whether outcome measures were perceived as relevant to the
      participants' work environment and were not burdensome as to the length and content of the
      program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will implement a single group mixed-methods randomized controlled trial to
      investigate the impact of the 6-week RISE program on psychological health in Longwood medical
      area residents. The RISE program is an existing standardized yoga program at Kripalu that
      will be adapted for residents in a 60-90-minute, once-weekly class for six weeks.
      Participants will be randomized to either the RISE yoga program or a no-treatment control
      group. Participants randomized to the RISE program will also be instructed to maintain a
      short 10-15-minute daily home yoga practice. Sessions will be lead by experienced instructors
      from Kripalu and will be held in the Longwood medical area. Self-report outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, at program completion (post-program), at 2-month follow-up, and at
      6-month follow-up.

      Participants will include resident physicians at Longwood medical area hospitals. The only
      exclusion criterion is having practiced yoga, meditation, tai chi, qigong, or another
      mind-body practice at least 25 hours or more in the past 6 months. Participants must be
      willing not to practice mind-body programs other than the treatment protocol during the
      intervention. We plan to enroll up to 200 participants with a goal of at least 60
      participants with a 2:1 ratio of participants randomized to yoga to participants randomized
      to control. The control group will receive one session of RISE after their participation in
      the trial is complete.

    <description>Participants were ask to rate the feasibility of attending the yoga program on a visual analogue scale from 0 (not at all feasible) to 100 (very feasible). Only the intervention group rated feasibility since the control group was a waitlist control group and did not attend the program. The standard deviation of the mean score was calculated.</description>

        <title>Feasibility of Attending the Yoga Program</title>
        <description>Participants were ask to rate the feasibility of attending the yoga program on a visual analogue scale from 0 (not at all feasible) to 100 (very feasible). Only the intervention group rated feasibility since the control group was a waitlist control group and did not attend the program. The standard deviation of the mean score was calculated.</description>

            <description>This is the group that will receive a weekly 60-90minute yoga-based class for six weeks and direction for a 5-10 minute daily home practice.
RISE yoga-based program: The RISE program developed by Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health includes yoga postures, mindfulness practices, meditation, breathing techniques, and education sessions about mindful approaches to daily living. The RISE program will be delivered as a 6-week yoga-based program on-site at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA. The program will consist of six 60-90-minute weekly yoga-based RISE classes. Sessions will be lead by experienced instructors from Kripalu Center for Yoga &amp; Health. Subjects in this arm will also be asked to participate in 5-10 minutes of daily home practice with direction from the RISE curriculum.</description>
