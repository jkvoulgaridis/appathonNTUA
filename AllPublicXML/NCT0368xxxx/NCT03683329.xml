  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      De-escalation aims at reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and therefore the
      emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

      Observational studies suggested that this strategy seems to be safe. However, there is no
      adequate, direct evidence showing de-escalation of antimicrobial agents to be effective and
      safe for onco-hematology patients with sepsis or septic shock. Thus, randomized clinical
      trials are needed for testing the safety and efficiency of de-escalation of antimicrobial
      therapy.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial therapy in
      onco-hematology patients with sepsis or septic shock is noninferior to the continuation of
      empirical antimicrobial therapy.

      The first aim of the study is to demonstrate that de-escalation is noninferior to the
      continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics in terms of hospital mortality.

      The secondary aims are to compare the two strategies in terms of mortality, duration of
      antimicrobial therapy, durations of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, numbers of
      superinfections, organ failure.

      Antimicrobial de-escalation (ADE) of antimicrobial therapy is a strategy proposed to allow
      for the rational use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy as the empiric treatment for
      infections and minimize the overall exposure to these broad-spectrum agents. The need for
      prompt, effective antimicrobial therapy for patients with known or suspected infections is
      widely accepted. This principle leads to the use of very broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy
      to increase the odds that all suspected potential pathogens are adequately treated. However,
      the potential drawback is selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms.

      ADE is widely recommended in the management of antimicrobial therapy in intensive care unit
      (ICU) patients. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines describe and recommend the process
      for selecting antimicrobial therapy as commencement of antimicrobials within the first hour,
      antimicrobial therapy broad enough to cover all likely pathogens, and daily reassessment for
      potential ADE.

      To date, no randomized study assessing this strategy is available for this specific
      population of cancer critically ill patients. In a recent systematic review based on 13
      observational studies and one randomized controlled trial, the authors conclude that the
      equipoise remains and a large randomized trial is required to assess the effect of the
      antibiotics de-escalation strategy on the bacterial ecosystem, on MDR carriage, and on
      patient outcomes.
