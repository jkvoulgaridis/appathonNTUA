    <textblock>
      AIMS-2-CT-01 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, study to explore the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of Arbaclofen administered to children and adolescents
      (ages 5-17) for the treatment of social adaptive function in participants with ASD. The
      effects of Arbaclofen on social function in children and adolescents with ASD will be
      evaluated in a randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group study of 16 weeks duration.
      Subjects who meet protocol criteria will be randomly allocated to receive either Arbaclofen
      or placebo in a 1:1 ratio in the Treatment Period. There will be 7 recruiting sites and
      randomization will be stratified by site. A sample of 130 patients will be recruited.
      Blinding will be maintained by utilizing identical tablets containing either Arbaclofen or
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a clinically and etiologically heterogeneous
      neurodevelopmental condition affecting approximately 1% of the population. The core symptoms
      of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted
      behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective
      medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non
      evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a
      limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it
      in vitro and in vivo.

      A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I
      balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in
      functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers
      promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.

      The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial
      (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets
      core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD. Arbaclofen is a selective GABA-B receptor agonist and
      augments GABA-ergic activity, inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate, inhibits
      postsynaptic transmission, and modulates intracellular signalling. Through elevation of
      GABA-ergic inhibitory activity, Arbaclofen may act to alleviate ASD symptoms with social
      anxiety and emotional hyperarousal.

      Hypothesis: Arbaclofen will be superior to placebo in improving social function as measured
      by the Vineland-3 social domain.

    <masking_description>AIMS2-CT-01 is a double-blind study where participants and parent(s)/legal guardians as well as research staff will be unaware of the treatment allocation, with the exception of a dedicated unblinded pharmacist at each individual site. Blinding of the remainder of the study team members will be maintained by utilizing identical tablets, blistercards and boxes containing either Arbaclofen or placebo. Unblinded study drug and placebo supplies will be stocked at each study site pharmacy. An online randomization system will be used, by this unblinded pharmacist, to assign the study treatment. Based on the outcome of the randomisation, the pharmacist prepares the boxes containing the applicable treatment and releases these (blinded) boxes to the investigator for dispensing to the patient. In order to maintain the study blind, the dosing regimen will be consistent whether participants are randomized to Arbaclofen or placebo.</masking_description>

The total up-titration to 15 mg TID or 20 mg TID, and dose adjustment period to the optimal dose will be 35 days. If a participant does not tolerate a dose increase, he or she should return to the previous dose level and must remain at the dose level for the remainder of the Treatment Period. No changes should be made to dosing after 5 weeks, unless for safety.

                  protocol related procedures that are not part of normal participant care.
                  Participants who do not have the capacity to consent will give developmentally
                  appropriate assent.

               2. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
                  schedule, and laboratory testing.

               3. The subject's parent/caregiver/LAR must be able to speak and understand the local
                  language where the study is conducted sufficiently to understand the nature of
                  the study and to allow for the completion of all study assessments. The same
                  parent/caregiver/LAR must be capable of providing reliable information about the
                  subject's condition, agree to oversee the administration of study drug, and
                  accompany the subject to all clinic visits.

               4. Patient must be able to speak and understand the local language where the study
                  is conducted sufficiently to understand the nature of the study and to allow for
                  the completion of all study assessments.

          2. Type of Participant and Target Disease Characteristics

               1. Diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder according to the DSM-5 criteria

               2. Complex language as defined in ADOS-2 to qualify for a Module 3 or 4.

               3. Current pharmacological treatment regimen affecting behaviour has been stable for
                  at least 6 weeks prior to screening and is expected to be stable during the
                  duration of the study

               4. Current psychotherapeutic/psychosocial interventions affecting behaviour stable

             includes, but is not limited to impairment of renal function, evidence or history of
             malignancy or any significant haematological, endocrine, respiratory, hepatic,
             cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disease, including any clinically significant
             abnormalities on ECG. In general, any co-morbid conditions that may interact with
             study procedures.

          2. Prior/Concomitant Therapy

               1. Subjects who are currently receiving treatment with racemic baclofen, vigabatrin,
                  tiagabine, or riluzole or other GABA-related medications (e.g. gabapentin or
                  pregabalin). Only occasional benzodiazepine (or derivative drugs) use (PM, i.e.
                  at night) will be allowed.

               2. Subjects who are currently receiving pharmacologic treatment affecting behaviour
                  (see concomitant medication section) need to have a stable dose during the 6
                  weeks prior to the screening visit and for the duration of the study.

               3. Participating in programs including non-pharmacologic educational, behavioural,
                  and/or dietary interventions affecting behaviour, participation in these programs
                  must have been continuous during the 3 months prior to screening and participants
                  or their parent/caregiver/LAR may not electively initiate new or modify ongoing
                  interventions for the duration of the study. Typical school vacations are not
                  considered modifications of stable programming.

               4. Subjects who have taken another investigational drug within the last 30 days.

          3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings

             a. Patients with evidence of any significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular
             (including uncorrected symptomatic congenital heart disease), respiratory, renal,
             hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease, not including mild common pediatric diseases in
             these areas that are stable (e.g. mild asthma, constipation, etc.), as judged by the
             investigator.

          4. Study Medication Related

               1. Subjects who are not able to take oral medications.

               2. Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to racemic baclofen.

               3. Subjects with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lactase
                  deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

               4. Active peptic ulceration as Baclofen stimulates gastric acid secretion.

               5. Porphyria.

          5. Other Exclusion Criteria

               1. Subjects who are currently engaged in illicit drug use or alcohol abuse,
                  according to DSM-5 criteria.
