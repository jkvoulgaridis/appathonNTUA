    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to assess the reliability and validity of Autocad software to
      measure JPS in PFPS, especially:

        1. To assess the intra-tester and between day reliability of measurement of JPS using
           Autocad software.

        2. To assess the validity of these measurements against those found during an IKD.

      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common painful musculoskeletal condition that
      affects physically active young adults and adolescents.

      Joint position sense (JPS) is considered as a component of proprioception as it provides the
      clinician with information regarding the accuracy of movement as well as its relationship
      with movement performance and injuries. Therefore researchers use advanced instruments as 3 D
      video systems and isokinetic dynamometer. Since these instruments are less portable and
      expensive, therefore researchers used another method to evaluate JPS using high precision
      software using video analysis and markers in the joints. Unfortunately, video analysis
      requires difficult and time-consuming tasks and that this slow the evaluation process.

      Although immediate feedback could help physiotherapists and athletic trainers to monitor
      athletes and make decisions during the training session and the rehabilitation process, such
      immediacy is not available for proprioceptive tests in field situations. Autocad software is
      available and inexpensive and provides immediate feedback

Anterior or retropatellar knee pain from at least 2 of the following Activities : (1) prolonged sitting; (2) stair climbing; (3) squatting; (4) running; (5) kneeling; and (6) hopping/jumping.</description>

    <description>The participants will be prepared for image-capture data collection by putting four squared markers on leg and thigh.Each subject will extend his/her leg and make two angles from the resting position (90º) to the full extension, photos will be taken. The tested leg passively moved by the researcher through 20° to 60° of knee extension, the participant will be instructed to actively move that leg to the target angle and hold it in this position another photograph will be taken. The angles will be measured using the AutoCAD software. Knee JPS measurements will also be collected using an IKD by same steps</description>

        inclusion criteria:

          1. Anterior or retropatellar knee pain from at least 2 of the following Activities : (1)
             prolonged sitting; (2) stair climbing; (3) squatting; (4) running; (5) kneeling; (6)
             hopping/jumping; (7) kneel sitting

          2. Insidious onset of symptoms unrelated to a traumatic incident.

          3. Age of the subject 18-35 years to limit the possibility that PFPS over age 35 may have
             been complicated by arthritic changes, and also the subjects should have closed
             epiphyseal growth plates.

          4. Patient with chronic PFPS (pain &gt; 3 months)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Meniscal or other intraarticular pathologic conditions; cruciate or collateral
             ligament involvement.

          2. A history of traumatic patellar subluxation or dislocation.

          3. Previous surgery in the knee, ankle and hip joints.

          4. Knee, ankle and hip joints osteoarthritis.
