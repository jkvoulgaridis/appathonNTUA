    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of RO5126766 at different doses to find out
      what effects, if any, it has on people with advanced lung cancer who have previously received
      treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.

    <description>The study will begin with a standard 3+3 design. The study will enroll 3 patients at the previously identified MTD15 (4mg two times per week on days 1 and 4). The period of evaluation for dose limiting toxicity will be through completion of cycle 1. If ≤1 of the 3 initial patients at the proposed dose experience a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled for a total of 6 planned patients at that dose level. Otherwise, 3 patients will be enrolled at dose level -1. If ≤ 1 of these patients experience a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. If more than 1 patient experiences a DLT in dose level -1, the study will be terminated.</description>

             inducers 7 days prior to the first dose. RO5126766 (CH5126766) is metabolised mainly
             by CYP3A4 therefore concomitant administration of strong inhibitors and inducers of
             cytochrome p450 3A4 enzymes is forbidden during study treatment (for a complete list
