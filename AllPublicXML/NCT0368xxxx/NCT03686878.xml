  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common reason for contact lens discontinuation is contact lens discomfort. The
      investigators believe that inflammation plays a role in contact lens discomfort and the use
      of lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution may reduce end of the day contact lens discomfort. This
      study will enroll 21 contact lens users who will be receiving lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic
      solution and monitor the contact lens discomfort for a 8 week period while.

      Contact lens discontinuation is mostly associated with ocular discomfort. Most patients
      identifying dryness as the primary reason for contact lens discontinuation. Patients often
      resort to contact lens solutions, lubricating and/or rewetting drops to temporality improve
      their contact lens wearing experience. Clinicians often resort to changing contact lens
      designs, solutions and wearing modalities to improve comfort.

      Contact lens discomfort is believed to be mediated by many factors including inflammation and
      very similar in clinical symptoms of dry eye disease and symptoms of dryness.

      Lifitegrast 5.0% ophthalmic solution is an FDA approved solution for the management of signs
      and symptoms of dryness of dry eye disease. Studies have shown lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic
      solution may work by blocking the interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 leading to a decrease
      in activation and recruitment of T-cells, an initial step in inflammation.

      The safety and efficacy of Xiidra has been studied in four, 12 week clinical trials involving
      over 2,100 patients for signs (https://www.xiidra-ecp.com/efficacy-treating-signs) and
      symptoms (https://www.xiidra-ecp.com/efficacy-symptom-improvement).

      The purpose of this open label, interventional study is to examine the effect of lifitegrast
      5% ophthalmic solution in contact lens wearing experience by using the CLDEQ-8.
