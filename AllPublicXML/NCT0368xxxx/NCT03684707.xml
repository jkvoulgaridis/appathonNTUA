    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the metformin drug effect as a drug that found to improve the quality of
      tissues, decrease signs &amp; symptoms of cancer, and decrease histo-pathological criteria of
      dysplasia.

      This will be done by the aid of measuring salivary Micro RNA 31 &amp; 210 in saliva in addition
      to measure cyclin A2 as an immuno-histochemical analysis.

      Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) are among the most common types of head and neck
      cancers and are a major cause of significant morbidity. It was reported that 16- 62% of OSCCs
      develop from premalignant lesions, which often presents clinically as white or red mucosal
      patches known as leukoplakia and erythroplakia. The role of miRNA in cancer has been
      reiterated and established by many studies that have shown that miRNA signatures (i.e., mRNA
      expression profiles) can be useful for classifying human cancers. These studies have
      identified &quot;cancer related miRNAs&quot; through investigating expression profiles in matched
      normal and tumor tissues, as well as in body fluids. In addition, a vast number of studies
      have shown that miRNAs can play a role in regulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor
      suppressor genes, whereas others have shown that miRNA gene deletion or mutation can lead
      cancer initiation, progression and metastasis . Several potential mechanisms have been
      suggested for the ability of metformin to suppress cancer growth in vitro and vivo:

      (1) Activation of LKB1/AMPK pathway, (2) Induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, (3)
      Inhibition of protein synthesis, (4) Reduction in circulating insulin levels, (5) Inhibition
      of the unfolded protein response (UPR), (6) Activation of the immune system.

      This study is performed to evaluate metformin effect on the patients premalignant lesion
      versus maintenace follow ups.
