  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implants have become the perfect solution for replacement of missing single teeth, partial or
      even complete edentulism.18 However, the dilemma of anterior implant-supported prosthesis is
      still not quite solved.19-21 Implant abutments are one of the esthetic influencers. And
      concerning the material, ready-made titanium abutments are considered the gold standard of
      all. Nevertheless, the esthetic properties remain doubtful. Lithium disilicate ceramics have
      been used as implant superstructures for many years now for their combined esthetic and
      biomechanical properties. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of using
      titanium implant abutment on the color of lithium disilicate crowns and the significance of
      masking the titanium abutments with opaque porcelain or using opaque lithium disilicate
      coping on the final esthetic outcome

      Clinical resemblance is one the of main factors that preclude the success of any restoration.
      The use of conventional titanium implant abutment and ceramic restoration succeeded to
      prevail until now. New ceramic and polymer derivatives have been introduced such as hybrid
      ceramics, PEEK and PEKK. However, the low mechanical properties and the ease of breakage
      still limited them to certain clinical situations. Hybrid fixture-abutment combinations such
      as hybrid abutments and hybrid crowns proved to be highly efficient in the literature. But
      the technique sensitivity and the urge of high clinical and laboratory skills are obstacles
      that must be taken into consideration. This is the reason that finding esthetic modification
      of the conventional techniques seems reasonable. Masking the color of the underlying abutment
      appears to be a simple and easily achievable solution for having a highly esthetic implant
      supported prosthesis.

      The importance of peri-implant soft tissues, whether esthetically or biologically, has been
      emphasized in literature. (4) Furthermore, achieving the desired esthetic outcome depends on
      simultaneously matching the proper esthetic criteria of the tooth and its supporting
      structures. (5) Esthetic failures in implant dentistry can be categorized as pink-tissue
      failures and white-tissue failures. (6) Pink esthetics include color, texture and level of
      peri-implant tissues (7), while white esthetics include color, shape and characterization of
      crown. (3) The mode of fabrication also influences the performance of the materials, where
      the use of press technology facilitates the construction of implant supported crowns,
      offering precision of fit, durability and esthetic materials application. (11)
