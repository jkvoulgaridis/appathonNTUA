        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or legal guardian is able to comprehend and is willing to sign an informed

               2. Be a discrete lesion, i.e. each wart meeting the entry criteria is clearly
                  separated from other warts.

               3. Be present for at least 4 weeks

                  are excluded from treatment and evaluation. If a subject has these types of
                  warts, but also has warts that meet the inclusion criteria, the subject will NOT
                  be excluded from the study.

          6. Subject's chemistry and complete blood count results are within normal limits.

          7. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition.

             immunodeficiency, transplant status, etc.).

          3. Subject has a history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.

          4. Subject has had any Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine within 6 months prior to Visit

               -  Immunotherapy (e.g., Candida antigen, mumps antigen, Trichophyton antigen); 8
                  weeks

               -  Anti-metabolite therapy (e.g., bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil); 8 weeks

             treatment or the study assessments:

               -  LASER, light or other energy-based therapy (e.g., intense pulsed light [IPL],
                  photodynamic therapy [PDT]); 180 days

             participation or interfere with the study conduct or evaluations.

         11. Participation in another therapeutic investigational drug/device trial in which
             administration of an investigational treatment occurred with 30 days prior to Visit 1.
