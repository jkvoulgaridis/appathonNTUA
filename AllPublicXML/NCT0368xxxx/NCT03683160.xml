  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will combine best-evidence gait and mobility training with best evidence
      cognitive strategy training to produce a new cognitive-augmented mobility intervention that
      is expected to optimize long-term functional mobility outcomes for those living with stroke.
      More importantly, the new cognitive-augmented mobility program (CAMP) will address two
      crucial outcomes that do not occur with current approaches: 1. Maintenance of mobility gains
      after discharge from formal rehabilitation and 2. Transfer of skills learned in
      rehabilitation to real-world community living. This project will result in a new, fully
      defined intervention, and will provide effect size and cost estimates to design a future
      appropriately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficulty walking is a leading cause of activity restriction in survivors of stroke. It is
      directly related to important functional issues, such as challenges in crossing a street in
      time, difficulty walking to a bus stop and increased risk of falls. These functional issues
      can then impact a person's confidence to move around their community, ultimately leading to
      lower levels of physical activity and potential negative health consequences. The best way to
      optimize recovery in walking and mobility is not yet known, and there are critical gaps in
      existing treatments. While some approaches are effective in the short term, strategies to
      promote the maintenance of improvements are not well established, benefits are usually not
      transferred beyond the specific skills trained and the specific context in which they were
      learned, few interventions impact community participation, and cost effectiveness has rarely
      been investigated. A potential solution exists in combining best-evidence interventions:
      task-specific gait and mobility training to improve skill quality, cardiorespiratory and
      strength exercises to improve endurance and speed, and cognitive strategy training to teach
      problem solving, improve confidence and to ensure long-term maintenance and transfer of
      skills to home and community settings. The investigators will combine best evidence mobility
      interventions with best evidence cognitive strategy training to develop and evaluate a new
      intervention to optimize long-term functional mobility outcomes for those living with stroke.
      The project consists of two sequential stages: 1) intervention development through literature
      synthesis; face validity testing using focus groups with patients, family members and expert
      stroke rehabilitation clinicians; and intervention refinement; followed by 2)
      feasibility/pilot testing with 10 people more than 6 months post stroke. Anticipated outcomes
      include a fully developed intervention with the potential to optimize mobility rehabilitation
      and effect size estimates to permit the design of a future, appropriately-powered randomized
      controlled trial.

    <time_frame>1) 1 week pre-intervention; 2) 1 week post-intervention, 3) 4 to 5 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a self-report measure of performance and satisfaction with self-selected goals. Participants are asked to generate 5 personally meaningful rehabilitation goals and rate their current performance and satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10. Total scores are the average performance and satisfaction score. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Mean Berg Balance Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1) 1 week pre-intervention; 2) 1 week post-intervention, 3) 4 to 5 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a measure of static balance. Participants are asked to complete a series of 14 tasks and are scored from 0 to 4. Total score (min=0; max=56) is calculated by adding the scores of the individual tasks, higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>1) 1 week pre-intervention; 2) 1 week post-intervention, 3) 4 to 5 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale is a self-report measure of confidence to perform daily activities without falling. Participants assign a score from 0 to 100 to each of the measure's 16 items and the total score is calculated by obtaining the average score. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Mean Community Balance and Mobility Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1) 1 week pre-intervention; 2) 1 week post-intervention, 3) 4 to 5 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Community Balance and Mobility (CB&amp;M) Scale is a measure of balance and mobility. Participants are asked to perform 13 tasks while a therapist scores their performance. Several tasks require using both sides. The total score (min=0; max=96) is the sum of all task scores and greater scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is a measure of the amount of assistance required to complete activities of daily living. Participants are asked about the amount of assistance required to complete each of the measure's 18 items and are assigned a score from 1 to 7 for each item. Total scores (min=18; max=126) are the sum of the item scores and greater scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Mean Stroke Impact Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1) 1 week pre-intervention; 2) 1 week post-intervention, 3) 4 to 5 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a self-report measure of perceived impact of stroke on function and everyday life. The SIS is a 56 item measure with 8 subscales measuring strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation/role function. Subscale scores range from 0 to 100. Greater scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a 2 question survey to gauge their satisfaction with the intervention and their interest in using the skills they learned during the intervention. Scores for each item range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction and intention to use the skills they learned in the future.</description>
