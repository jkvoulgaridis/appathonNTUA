  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an educational module is successful in
      training primary care nurse practitioner (PNP) students to assess the emotional connection of
      mother/child dyads with accuracy, and to determine how the education is maintained three
      months after administering.

      The investigators hypothesize than after completing the educational module involving recorded
      dyad interactions, subjects will achieve coding reliability with the PI, which will be
      maintained after three months without practice coding.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and test an educational intervention designed to
      instruct primary care nurse practitioner (PNP) trainees how to assess the quality and
      strength of mother-child relationships. The approach will use constructs of Emotional
      Connectivity that were used in development of an investigational observation-based screening
      instrument, the Welch Emotional Connection Scale (WECS). The WECS is a scale that allows
      healthcare providers to rate the emotional connectivity of a mother-child relationship in
      just a few minutes of observed interaction, and shows preliminary predictive properties when
      performed in the first year of life. Administration of the WECS involves watching recorded
      interactions of a child sitting face-to-face on the mother's lap, and scores the interaction
      on sliding scales in 4 domains. During the WECS development, the Nurture Science Program of
      Columbia University Medical Center created and coded hours of parent-child interaction
      videos. These videos will be used to assess and train the PNP students (subjects) on rating
      mother/child dyads around emotional connectivity. Subjects will rate the quality of
      mother-child relationships in prepared educational video cases. After all subjects rate in a
      way that achieves high reliability with PI scores of the same recorded dyads, subjects will
      spend 3 months without further training in emotional connection or practice coding WECS.
      Subjects will then rate the quality of mother-child relationships for videos of dyads they
      hadn't previously seen. Maintenance of high reliability of coding dyad interaction is the
      main outcome of this study.

    <measure>Intra-Class Correlations of Students' Welch Emotional Connection Screen (WECS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2018 - 2019</time_frame>
    <description>The Welch Emotional Connection Scale (WECS) is an investigational developmental screening tool, developed to rate the quality of the emotional connection that formed between mother and child. The scale is administered in 2-3 minutes by observing a mother and child interact, and requires the rater to critically assess 4 sub-domains of emotional connection.
The WECS is scored on intervals of 0.25, with a minimum of 1 (little or no connection) and maximum of 3 (high connection). High connection is considered optimal for child development, and low connection is considered a risk in child development.
Separately from these scores, the final portion of the screen determines, &quot;Is the dyad emotionally connected?&quot; and is scored with &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Yes.&quot; Observing these scores could help determine if the educational module is successful in training PNP students to assess the emotional connection.</description>
