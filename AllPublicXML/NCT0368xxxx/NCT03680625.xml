      Background: Outpatient pediatric orthopedic procedures such as percutaneous pins removal and
      sutures are considered painful and generate significant anxiety in children. However, given
      their short duration and the need for a quick turnover in outpatient clinics, there are very
      few interventions aimed at relieving pain and anxiety related to these procedures. Neither
      simple analgesia nor topical anesthetics proved effective for procedural pain reduction with
      this population. Moreover, narcotics and procedural sedation do not appear to be feasible
      alternatives as they require surveillance, prolonging visit to the outpatient clinic and
      generating several undesired side effects. Therefore, it would be imperative to explore
      non-pharmacological pain management methods as they require minimal preparation and do not
      usually generate any side effects.

      Aim: To examine the effect of virtual reality (VR) compared to passive distraction, on pain,
      anxiety and memory of pain in children undergoing a percutaneous pin removal procedure or
      sutures in an outpatient orthopedic clinic.

      Hypothesis: VR distraction provides better pain relief during percutaneous pin removal
      procedures or sutures than passive distraction, in children from 7 to 21 years old.

      Methods: The study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial with parallel groups.
      Children from 7 to 21 years old, visiting the clinic for follow up and percutaneous pin
      removal procedure or sutures, accompanied by a parent or legal guardian will be recruited.
      The experimental group will receive a VR distraction through a head-mounted Oculus rift® and
      the control group will receive passive distraction through watching a video on an iPad®. The
      primary outcome will be the mean pain score after the procedure (self-report of pain level
      during the procedure) measured by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Anxiety will be measured
      by the Child Fear Scale (CFS). Memories of pain and anxiety will be measured one week after
      the procedure using the same scales (NRS and CFS). The investigators aim to recruit 88
      children to achieve a power of 80% with a significance level (alpha) of 5%.

      Discussion: The investigators believe that results of this study will allow to improve pain
      and anxiety management practices in this orthopedic clinic by showing that
      non-pharmacological interventions can be done, at very low cost, to improve the experience of
      the child undergoing these painful procedures through an innovative and more humanistic
      approach.

      BACKGROUND

      In children, many fractures treated surgically will be stabilized percutaneously with
      Kirschner wires and some will require sutures to help the surgical wound to heal. When the
      fracture is adequately healed, the percutaneous wires and/or the sutures are generally
      removed in the outpatient clinic. These procedures represent a potential source of pain and
      anxiety for the patient, as well as for the parents and the caregivers.

      A study looked at different types of analgesia during percutaneous pin removal comparing
      Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen and placebo but no clinically nor statistically significant
      difference was found among the three groups. Another study compared topical liposomal
      lidocaine to a placebo but found no statistically significant difference in postprocedure
      pain scores between groups. On the other hand, administration of narcotics or procedural
      sedation for pin removal procedure probably exceeds the real needs for the majority of
      patients. Adding the fact that the administration of narcotics or procedural sedation
      requires monitoring post administration, those options lengthen visit time, reduce
      significantly the efficiency in an outpatient clinic setting and are not recommended for
      routine administration.

      In contrast, there seems to be some emerging evidence about distraction methods such as
      distraction techniques facilitated by a hospital play specialist for pin removal procedures.
      Distraction use for children in orthopedic outpatient clinics has been reported anecdotally
      in some literature but, to our knowledge, has never been formally assessed in a randomised
      controlled trial. Exploring non-pharmacological interventions, including distraction, could
      be a promising venue for pain management in this population as they are simple, practical,
      easily implementable and usually without side effects.

      Virtual Reality (VR) is a distraction method that allows the user to interact with an
      immersive environment generated by a computer stimulating different senses. A review of
      studies on VR, mostly conducted with adult burn patients, showed a 35 to 50% reduction in
      procedural pain while using VR. Its positive effect has also been reported on anxiety and
      general distress during painful medical procedures in children and in adults such as
      venipuncture, wound care, chemotherapy, dental procedures, etc. A recent
      randomized-controlled trial comparing VR and standard distraction in children undergoing
      blood drawn procedures, demonstrated a significant positive effect of VR on pain and anxiety
      reduction as well as patients', caregivers' and phlebotomist's satisfaction. The authors also
      concluded that VR was more effective for children with higher anxiety sensitivity, adding
      another plus value to this new technology in children's care.

      Considering the lack of optimal pain and anxiety management during pin removal and/or removal
      or sutures, and the positive effect of VR for painful procedures, combining VR to pin/sutures
      removal procedures may show promising results. To our knowledge, no other studies have tested
      the effect of VR distraction via Oculus Rift® for procedural pain management in children
      undergoing painful orthopedic procedures such as percutaneous pins removal and removal of
      sutures.

      AIM &amp; STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective: To determine if VR distraction provides better pain relief during
      percutaneous pin removal procedures and/or removal of sutures, than passive distraction, in
      children from 7 to 21 years old.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine if VR distraction provides better anxiety relief in children during
           percutaneous pin removal procedures and/or removal of sutures than passive distraction.

        2. To determine if children receiving VR distraction will remember less pain and anxiety
           than children receiving passive distraction during the percutaneous pin removal
           procedure and/or removal of sutures.

        3. To compare the occurrence of side effects between VR distraction and passive distraction
           groups.

        4. To compare healthcare professionals' satisfaction levels between VR distraction and
           passive distraction.

        5. To compare children and parents' satisfaction levels between VR distraction and passive
           distraction.

        6. To compare requirement for rescue analgesia between VR distraction and passive
           distraction.

      METHODS

      Design: Multi-center randomized controlled trial using a parallel design with two groups: a)
      experimental group (virtual reality), b) active comparator (videogame on an iPad®).

      Sample and Setting: Recruitment will be done through convenience sampling at the orthopedic
      outpatient day clinic at CHU Ste-Justine, and at the Shriners Hospital for Children and the
      Montreal Children's Hospital.

      Measures and outcomes: Timepoints. Data will be collected by the research assistant at the
      following study times: before the procedure to establish baseline (T0), immediately after the
      procedure (T1), and one week after the procedure (T2).

      Sample Size: Group sample sizes of 44 and 44 (88 in total) are necessary to achieve 80% power
      to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the population mean difference is 2.0 with
      a standard deviation for both groups of 3.3 and a significance level (alpha) of 5% using a
      two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test. No attrition is expected as the primary outcome
      will be assessed immediately after the procedure.

      Data analysis plan: Descriptive statistics will be used to present sociodemographic and
      clinical data as well as parents, children and healthcare professionals' levels of
      satisfaction. The primary outcome analysis will be the mean difference in pain scores at T1
      using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Secondary analyses using independent t-tests will also
      include mean differences in children-reported pain on the GRS, on procedural anxiety using
      the CSF, as well as on difference in pain memories between groups. Chi square tests will be
      conducted to compare dichotomous variables including the occurrence of side effects, use of
      rescue analgesia, and use of other non-pharmacological interventions in each group. Finally,
      analyses will be carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle, with a
      significance level (α) of 0.05.

    <description>Patients in this group will be offered virtual reality distraction through the use of Oculus Rift® while they undergo their pins' removal and/or removal of sutures. VR produces a high level of immersion, with high photorealism while maintaining the low latency necessary to induce presence and prevent cybersickness symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache. The videogame was developed by our team with three levels of difficulty, and approved by pediatric healthcare professionals. The game, oculus goggles and computer will be available in the procedure room and ready for immediate use. Goggles will be adjusted to the head of the child before any procedure and a period of 5 minutes will be allotted prior to pin and/or suture removal in order for the child to get acquainted with the game and immersed in the virtual environment.</description>
