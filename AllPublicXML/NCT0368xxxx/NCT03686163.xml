  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and adult disability worldwide. Yet,
      currently, the only accepted treatment for acute ischemic stroke(AIS) is recanalization of
      occluded arteries. Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, limited by its narrow
      therapeutic time window and the concern of hemorrhagic complication, is still uncommon in
      use. The other approach is to try to impede the ischemic cascade by targeting various
      components of the cascade that are deemed to be of importance, namely, a neuroprotection
      strategy.

      Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays extensive roles in preventing ischemic injury. Besides that,
      it is also involved in neurogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, the
      levels of NGF protein and messenger RNA significantly decreased in the CNS at the first few
      hours and returned to normal levels several days later after middle cerebral artery occlusion
      (MCAO) in animal models. These observed results suggested that NGF was demanded in ischemic
      brain injury, but endogenous NGF is insufficient for the requirement and delivering exogenous
      ones will be blocked in entering into the CNS by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
      Intracerebroventricular or intracerebral injection of NGF or grafting of NGF-producing cells
      may be less practicable due to invasiveness and safety concerns.

      Intranasal (IN) administration is a noninvasive and acceptable delivery strategy for drugs
      bypassing BBB and can deliver NGF to the CNS, which has been proved to show neuroprotective
      effects on brain injury.

      The effects of intranasal NGF in human ischemic stroke is still controversial that need
      further evaluation.

      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trail of NGF, starting
      between 24 to 72 hours post acute ischemic stroke, continuing for 2 weeks.
