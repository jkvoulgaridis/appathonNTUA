  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and engraftment (cumulative
      relative abundance) of MET-4 strains when given in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICIs). There will be a safety cohort (group A) of 5 subjects which will receive
      MET-4 in addition to standard of care (SOC) ICI. After the safety cohort, 40 patients will be
      enrolled in group B which will be randomized to MET4 with SOC ICI vs. control group with SOC
      ICI only. Group C will enroll 20 patients who have already started on SOC ICI and have had
      first unconfirmed progression of disease and expected to continue with standard ICI
      treatment. These patients will be randomized to continue receiving standard ICI alone, or SOC
      ICI with MET4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human associated microorganisms (the microbiota) inhabit virtually all surfaces of the human
      body. The gut is densely colonized by the microbiota which aids in the digestion. Animal and
      human observational and experimental evidence show a link between gut microbiota and the
      activation, regulation and function of the immune system. Pre-clinical studies in mouse
      models have linked the gut microbiota to efficacy of anticancer therapies. Microbial
      Ecosystem Therapeutics (MET) is a new treatment approach developed as an alternative to fecal
      transplantation. MET consists of a defined mixture of pure live cultures of intestinal
      bacteria isolated from a stool sample of a healthy donor.

      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and engraftment (cumulative
      relative abundance) of MET-4 strains when given in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICIs).

    <description>Eligible subjects with advanced solid tumors starting ICI will be randomised in a 3:1 ratio stratifying for prior IO exposure, to receive MET-4 together with any approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as per SOC or control group. There will be a run-in period for subjects in the MET-4 treatment group. Following the run-in period of ICI therapy, subjects will be administered the same MET-4 dose as subjects in group A.</description>

             colostomies may be enrolled.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with subject
