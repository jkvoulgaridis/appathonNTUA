  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of post-operative abdominal binder usage on total narcotic usage
      after undergoing surgery. To determine if abdominal binder usage results in decreased visual
      analog scale (VAS) pain scores and shorter time to first ambulation post operatively.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess effect of abdominal binder on total post-operative narcotic use within seven days following pelvic surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Total narcotic usage, calculated in morphine equivalents, during the first seven days post operatively to be calculated and a difference in the amount used by non-abdominal binder patients and abdominal binder patients will be determined. Will review medical record to determine amount of medication used while inpatient, amount / type of narcotic medication prescribed for discharge home, and will call patients to determine how many narcotic pills they have remaining on post operative day seven and calculate the amount used which will then be converted to morphine equivalents.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess whether post operative abdominal binder usage shortens the time to first ambulation after surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in the first time of ambulation after surgery during inpatient admission between non-abdominal binder patients and abdominal binder patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare post operative pain scores using visual analog scale (VAS) scores in post operatives patients who use and do not use an abdominal binder.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in VAS pain scores will be obtained only while the patient is admitted to the hospital post operatively between non-abdominal binder patients and abdominal binder patients.</description>
