  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety and the effect of isolated limb perfusion together with nivolumab as a way
      to increase efficacy and give further insights in early immunological mechanisms.

      In the first phase Ib part, 20 patients will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 3
      months. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will continuously review safety
      and judge the seriousness of the events and also recommend the study to stop if necessary. If
      the DSMB do not find safety issues, the trial will continue as a phase II trial.

    <intervention_name>Isolated limb perfusion (ILP)</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be treated with ILP according to clinical routine at each separate site. The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia. The major artery and vein of the limb is catheterized, and a tourniquet is placed proximally on the limb. Continuous leakage monitoring is performed. The perfusate is heated to 40C and after ensuring steady state, melphalan (Alkeran®) at a dose of 13 mg/L (upper limb) or 10 mg/L (lower limb) is infused into the circulation during 20 minutes for a total perfusion time of 60 minutes. According to local routine tasonermin (Beromun®) will be added to the perfusate 30 minutes before the melphalan as a bolus dose of 1-4 mg.</description>
