  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine possible mechanisms of heightened vasoconstriction in
      Black/African American men and women as possible links to the elevated prevalence of
      cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. The main targets in this study are sources of
      oxidative stress

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans (AA) not only have a higher prevalence of hypertension but the severity of
      the cardiovascular complications related to this condition are greater in this population
      relative to other populations. While the underlying causes of this elevated risk are
      multifactorial, vascular dysfunction (i.e. impaired vasodilation and/or augmented
      vasoconstriction) is believed to be a key contributing factor. The investigators have
      recently observed (UTA IRB 2016-0268) that the small blood vessels in the skin (the cutaneous
      microvasculature) in AA, but otherwise healthy individuals, have an impaired blood flow
      response in the cutaneous circulation to local heating when compared to age, body mass index
      (BMI), and gender, matched Caucasians (CA). This blunted response is abolished in AA when the
      sites are pre-treated with either Allopurinol or Apocynin which block the production of
      xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase, respectively. In addition, Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is
      critically involved in vascular function. BH4 is a cofactor involved in the conversion of
      L-Arginine into the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) by the enzyme endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase (eNOS). Reduced bioavailable BH4 leads to elevated oxidative stress and thus
      impaired vascular function.

      In addition to local heating another commonly utilized research approach to assess
      microcirculatory vascular function is via local infusion of the potent vasodilator
      methacholine (Mch). Mch is an acetylcholine analog that causes endothelial dependent
      vasodilation primarily through stimulation of NO production. Much like the local heating data
      mentioned above, our laboratory (data collected while at UT Austin) has demonstrated a
      blunted response to Mch in AA relative to CA. However, the role of xanthine oxidase, NADPH
      oxidase, and BH4 in this blunted response remains unknown.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>To establish impaired blood flow response to local administration of Mch in African American relative to Caucasians. Mch will be administered using intradermal microdialysis in separate doses while the skin blood flux response will be determined using laser Doppler fluxmetry. All changes in flux will be normalized and reported as a percentage of maximal flux. The role of oxidative stress and low nitric oxide synthase cofactors will be assessed using infusions of apocynin/allopurinol and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), respectively. These infusions will be given after the first infusion of Mch and before the second infusion of Mch to determine how Mch responsiveness changes with these vasoactive drugs.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals (ages 18-35, both genders) will be recruited from the greater Arlington
             area to participate in the study.

          -  Must self-report both parents as either African American or Caucasian American.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have donated more than 550 ml of blood within the past 8 weeks will
             not have blood drawn from them in this protocol. However, if they remain interested in
             the study, and otherwise meet the inclusion criteria, than we may still opt to proceed
             with data collection.

          -  Individuals with cardiovascular, neurological, and/or metabolic illnesses will be
             excluded from participating as well as individuals with a history of various diseases
             of the microvasculature including Reynaud's disease, cold-induced urticaria,
             cryoglobulinemia, etc.

          -  Subjects currently taking any prescription medications and individuals with a body
             mass index about 30 kg/m2) will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant subjects and children (i.e. younger than 18) will not be recruited for the
             study. Eligible females will be scheduled for days 2-7 of their menstrual cycle to
             account for hormonal effects on blood flow. A regular menstrual cycle is required to
             identify and schedule the study for the low hormone period, therefore females who lack
             a regular cycle will be excluded from the study. Females currently taking birth
             control are eligible, as long as they can be scheduled during a low-hormone &quot;placebo&quot;
             week. If their hormone do not contain a placebo week than these individuals will not
             be eligible for data collection. Females who are breast-feeding will also be eligible
             as there are no systemic or lasting effects of the proposed vasoactive agents.

          -  Given that smoking can affect the peripheral vasculature, current smokers and
             individuals who regularly smoked (&gt;1 pack per two weeks) within the prior 2 years will
             be excluded
