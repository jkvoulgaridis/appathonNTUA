  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare how premature infants who required oxygen for at
      least 28 days during their time in the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) breathe at
      discharge compared to premature infants who did not require oxygen for at least 28 days
      during their time in the NICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work of breathing tests will be performed on premature infants who required oxygen for at
      least 28 days during their time in NICU. These same work of breathing tests will be performed
      in another group of premature infants who did not require oxygen for at least 28 days during
      their time in the NICU. The two groups will be compared.

        Preterm infants born greater than 26 weeks gestation, weighing less than 1500 grams at
        birth. Work of breathing indices will be compared between the group of babies who were
        diagnosed with BPD and the group that was not diagnosed with BPD.
