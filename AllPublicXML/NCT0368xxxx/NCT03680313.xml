  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the role of the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in evaluating
      arterial stiffness changes, the degree of atherosclerosis in patients with hypertension after
      1 year of treatment and analysis the correlation between CAVI and cardiovascular risk
      factors.

        The eligible patients were prospectively monitored to evaluate CAVI in hypertension
        treatment for every 3 months. All participants will be asked directly medical history,
        clinical examination and performed blood pressure measurement thoroughly. All clinical
        information will be retained in medical record.
