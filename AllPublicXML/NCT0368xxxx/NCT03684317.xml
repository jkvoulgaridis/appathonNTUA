  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abuse of analgesics represents an important part of prescription drug abuse. The consequences
      in terms of morbidity and mortality at the population level could reach worryingly high
      levels, as illustrated by the US context. This issue should not focus only on opioid
      analgesics, but must also account for some antiepileptics or antidepressants with abuse
      potential (for example, pregabalin or gabapentin). In France, reports related to tramadol
      abuse are increasing, in particular since dextropropoxyphene withdrawal. Trends of growing
      abuse are also reported for other analgesics. Patients with no history of primary dependence
      constituted a significant proportion of those developing a tramadol abuse. There is therefore
      a need for early identification of these patients and to raise awareness of health
      professionals on this issue, in particular in primary care. Given the extensive use of
      analgesic drugs in France, the problem of primary dependence should not be neglected. Since
      it will affect people who have no history of drug abuse, strategies for identification and
      prevention are differing from a population already using psychotropic products for example.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, prescription drug abuse has been considered in terms of the secondary or tertiary
      prevention, and primary prevention remains poorly explored. By reconstructing the entire
      trajectories of patients having developed primary drug dependence, from the genesis of first
      drug exposures, investigators will identify patients' profiles and early changes in drug use
      that could accurately predict future complications. Pharmacoepidemiological methods are
      particularly relevant in the field of abuse and drug dependence. By definition, specialized
      care seeking can only be achieved after emergence and identification of the problem.
      Outpatients data obtained through medico-administrative database are then the only source of
      evidence that could enable to ascertain accurately history of past drug consumption
