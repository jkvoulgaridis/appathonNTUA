  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      outpatient infants (0-6 months of life), affected by symptoms of upper airways disease will
      be randomly assigned to two type of intervention:

      A: treatment group, receiving resveratrol and carbossimetyl beta glucan; B: control group,
      receiving saline solution.

      Each subject underwent clinical history, objective examination and detection of rinovirus in
      the nasal secretions at enrollment, after 48 hours and after 7 and 30 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive outpatient infants (0 - 6 months) with common cold symptoms were enrolled and
      randomly divided into two groups: resveratrol plus carboxymethyl-Î²-glucan solution or saline
      isotonic solution randomized treatment (3 drops in each nasal fossa, 4 time daily for seven
      days).

      Each patient underwent clinical evaluation at enrollment, after 48 hours and after 7 and 30
      days.

      Common cold symptoms were specifically evaluated according to CARIFS Scale. Nasal swabs for
      HRV research will performed at enrollment, after 48 hours and after 7 and 30 days.

    <description>The CARIFS score consisted of 18 items each answered on a 4-point scale (no problem = 0, minor problem = 1, moderate problem = 2, major problem = 3).
Some CARIFS items such as &quot;headache&quot;, &quot;sore-throat&quot;, &quot;muscle aches or pains&quot; were not applicable to infants. The mean of the point of all applicable items was considered as a measure of child's overall illness level.</description>
