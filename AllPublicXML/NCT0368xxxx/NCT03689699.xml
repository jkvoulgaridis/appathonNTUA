  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MAGIC-8 is a two-arm, multicenter, phase 1b/2 study to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy
      with either Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) or Nivolumab plus BMS-986253 combined with ADT using
      Degarelix (LHRH antagonist) for men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and a rising
      prostate-sepcific antigen (PSA). The purpose of this study is to see whether immunotherapy
      with either Nivolumab alone or Nivolumab plus BMS-986253 combined with Degarelix, which
      suppresses testosterone, is safe and can decrease the chance that the cancer will come back.

      The primary objectives are to 1) determine the rate of PSA recurrence defined as a PSA
      &gt;0.2ng/ml for radical prostatectomy patients or PSA &gt;2.0ng/ml for patients who received
      primary radiation therapy at a time point of 10 months after start of therapy; and 2)
      determine the safety and tolerability of either nivolumab or nivolumab plus BMS-986253 in
      combination with degarelix in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The secondary
      objectives include determining relapse-free survival (RFS) and % change in PSA to
      immunotherapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is common and remains a major cause of death in men. Following local therapy
      with surgery or radiation, a significant number of men recur either with a rising PSA only
      (biochemical recurrence (BCR)) or clear metastatic disease on imaging. Although androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is a frequently used and effective treatment for prostate cancer,
      it is associated with significant side effects including fatigue, hot flashes, decreased
      libido and bone loss. Therefore, new approaches to decrease the time on ADT are crucial to
      improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer.

      Once initiated, ADT can be given either continuously or intermittently. However, even with an
      intermittent approach the ADT-free interval typically decreases with each cycle and most men
      eventually develop castration resistance. Therefore new treatment strategies are needed to
      improve disease control while minimizing ADT exposure for men with early prostate cancer.
