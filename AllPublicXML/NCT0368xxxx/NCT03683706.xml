      Aim of the study is to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of LTP in My Own Way Plus
      with depressed mothers of ID children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Having a child with a chronic medical problem or an intellectual disability increases anxiety
      and depression in parents. There is some growing evidence that families of ID children are
      able to meet the challenges. The purpose of the present study is to adapt LTP in my own way
      plus to test its acceptability and determine if it improves mothers knowledge about their
      child development and reduce their level of distress.

      The study has two phases: quantitative phase and qualitative phase. Quantitative phase: A
      single blind randomised controlled trial in school settings in Karachi Pakistan.

      Objectives:

        1. Help mothers cope better with their depression.

        2. Teach mothers play activities that will stimulate their children's development and
           improve mother-child interaction.

      Qualitative Phase: This will help to determine acceptability of the intervention and identify
      perceived mechanisms of change and any barriers and facilitators to LTP in my own Plus
      intervention. In-depth digitally recorded interviews and focus groups will be conducted with
      the parents and teachers to understand their beliefs, views, and feelings about caring for ID
      children.

    <description>LTP in My Own Way Plus is a 12-session integrated intervention—Learning through Play in My Own Way Plus Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). LTP in My Own Way is the extension of the parent education program called 'Learning Through Play' developed by Toronto Public Health (1993) revised by The Hincks-Dellcrest Centre (2000). LTP aims for the healthy growth of young children (birth to 6 years) using the stages of development incorporating Piaget's theory of cognitive development and Bowlby's theory of attachment. The objective of this program is to strengthen parent-child attachment by encouraging parental involvement and teaching parents how to use play activities to enhance their children's development. Second component of intervention is CBT adapted from Jeanne Miranda manual (Group CBT for Depression, group leaders guide book-2006) focusing on the three areas: thoughts and your mood, activities and your mood, people interaction and your mood.</description>
