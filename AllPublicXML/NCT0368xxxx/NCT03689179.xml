  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Time for Living &amp; Caring&quot; (TLC) intervention is an online, self-administered
      intervention, with the purpose of providing informal family caregivers with resources,
      support, and education to maximize the benefit of their respite time-use (respite is defined
      as planned time away from caregiving; it can be provided by a formal service provider or
      informal arrangements within families/networks). The study will use a full-powered pilot
      sample (n=150) and a randomized waitlist control design to examine feasibility and initial
      efficacy of the TLC intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>This study uses a full-powered pilot sample (n=150) and a randomized waitlist control design to examine feasibility and initial efficacy of the TLC intervention. After an initial orientation/control period (4 weeks), group A will receive access to the TLC intervention for 8 weeks, followed by an optional 8-week control period where they can continue to use the TLC intervention if they choose. After the initial 4-week orientation period, Group B will receive 8 weeks of waitlist (no treatment) control, followed by access to the TLC intervention for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes (defined as anxiety, caregiver burden) will be assessed by electronically delivered surveys every 4 weeks; respite time-use and time-use satisfaction will be assessed using ecological momentary analysis for each respite period taken during the 20-week study period; feasibility will be assessed using fixed-choice and open-ended survey questions collected post-intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Self-report single-item measure to describe ones' experience with respite time-use. Collected via &quot;ecological momentary assessment&quot; (EMA), following each distinct respite period. If you had respite today, how satisfied were you with your respite time?

    <description>Self-report single-item measure to describe ones' evaluation of their respite time-use. Collected via &quot;ecological momentary assessment&quot; (EMA), following each distinct respite period. If you had respite today, did your respite time make you feel positive/ negative about being caregiver? (1, not at all positive to 5, very positive). Higher numbers indicate higher levels of time-use satisfaction.</description>

    <description>&quot;Time for Living &amp; Caring&quot; (TLC) is an online, self-administered intervention. It includes three types of modules: a &quot;virtual coaching&quot; module (defined as a series or prompts, reminders, and suggestions delivered electronically through an interactive calendar website) that guides caregivers through assessment, goal setting, and goal review activities using an interactive calendar for each planned respite period they have. Supplementary modules provide education and resources such as What is Respite?, Why is Respite Important?, How do I Get (More) Respite?, How do I Use Respite?. Optional modules include interactive online forum, peer-to-peer chat functions, and videos or messages to provide daily affirmation, inspiration, and humor for caregivers.</description>
