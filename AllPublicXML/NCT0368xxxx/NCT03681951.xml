  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an unbiased CRISPR screen, RIPK1 was identified as a top gene contributing to
      immunotherapy resistance. In addition, RIPK1 has been reported to drive pancreatic
      oncogenesis. In murine models, inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity in the pancreatic tumor
      microenvironment leads to the replacement of tumor-permissive myeloid infiltrates with innate
      cells that promote an effective antitumor response by adaptive cells. The investigators
      hypothesize that inhibition of RIPK1 in human pancreatic cancer subjects will modulate the
      immune infiltrate to sensitize tumors to checkpoint blockade.

      Study 205013 is a Phase 1 FTIH study of GSK3145095 alone and in combination with other
      anticancer agents including pembrolizumab in subjects with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      (PDAC) and other selected tumors. The study includes up to 4 parts: Part 1 dose escalation
      will be conducted in approximately 30 adult subjects with advanced or metastatic PDAC using
      escalating doses of GSK3145095 as monotherapy only. Part 2 will combine escalating doses of
      GSK3145095 with 200 milligram (mg) pembrolizumab. Dose escalation of GSK3145095 will begin at
      least one level below the highest dose shown to have an acceptable toxicity profile in at
      least 3 subjects in Part 1. Part 2 may be conducted in a broader population of selected solid
      tumors using a combination of escalating doses of GSK3145095 and 200 mg pembrolizumab. Part 3
      will enroll subjects treated with one or more dose levels of GSK3145095 in combination with
      200 mg pembrolizumab. Part 4 will investigate the combination of additional anticancer agents
      with one or more doses of GSK3145095 identified as safe in Part 1. Up to approximately 220
      subjects will be treated in the study. Parts 1 and 2 will each treat up to approximately 30
      subjects. Parts 3 and 4 will treat up to approximately 160 subjects (up to 80 subjects in
      each Part). The total duration of the study is expected to last up to 2 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must provide signed, written informed consent.

          -  Male and female subjects, age &gt;=18 years (at the time consent is obtained). a) Male
             subjects are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the study
             treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the
             last dose of study treatment: Refrain from donating sperm, be abstinent from
             heterosexual or homosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle
             (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent or must
             agree to use contraception/barrier: male condom and female partner to use an
             additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per
             year. b) female subjects are eligible to participate if they are not either pregnant
             or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: is not a woman
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP), is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is
             highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per year), with low user
             dependency during the study treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120
             days (Parts 2-4) after the last dose of study treatment and agrees not to donate eggs
             (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator
             should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the
             first dose of study treatment. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to
             interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive
             method. Therefore, a barrier method is also required for subjects using a hormonal
             option (including hormonal intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive pills/ patch/
             vaginal inserts, and hormonal implants) and both highly effective methods of
             contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 15 days
             (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the last dose of study treatment.If a highly
             effective non-hormonal method is used, then only one method of contraception is
             required (by a female participant or partner of a male participant; in either
             situation the male partner must still use a male condom in addition) during the
             treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the
             last dose of study treatment. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy
             test (urine or serum) as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the
             first dose of study intervention. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative
             (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the
             subject must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.
             If the subject hasn't been on an acceptable method of contraception for at least 2
             weeks prior to start of therapy, pregnancy testing must be done weekly for the first
             month of treatment. Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after
             study treatment. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history,
             menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a
             woman with an early undetected pregnancy.

          -  Histological documentation of locally advanced, recurrent or PDAC (Part 1), non-small
             cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), or melanoma (Part 2)

             for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective, intolerable, or is considered
             inappropriate. Subjects should have received at least one, but not more than 2 prior
             lines of therapy for advanced disease including both standards of care and
             investigational therapies. Subjects whose cancers harbor molecular alterations for
             which targeted therapy is standard of care should have received health
             authority-approved appropriate targeted therapy for their tumor types before
             enrollment.

          -  All subjects in Parts 1 and 2 must consent to provide a fresh biopsy during screening

             lesion. Subjects are encouraged to provide a pre-Baseline scan (within 24 weeks before
             the Baseline scan) to support exploratory investigation of tumor growth kinetics.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

             radiation is required. Investigational therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives (from
             last dose of prior treatment to first dose of GSK3145095), whichever is shorter.

             the opinion of the principal investigators and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor,
             will not affect the evaluation of the effects of this clinical trial treatment on
             currently targeted malignancy, can be included in this clinical trial.

          -  Major surgery &lt;=4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. Subjects must have
