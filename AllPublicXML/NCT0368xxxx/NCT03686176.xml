      This stratified, randomized, controlled trial compared coping and distress between child life
      supported virtual reality engagement and child life support during painful procedures in the
      pediatric emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric emergency rooms and hospitals are anxiety provoking and often painful places for
      pediatric patients and families. Children of all ages present to the Johns Hopkins emergency
      room and are admitted to the hospital for a wide range of medical conditions, many of which
      require medical interventions. Many of these interventions are the source of anxiety and
      pain, including burn debridement or dressing changes, laceration repair, or intravenous (IV)
      line placement. The standard of care to reduce pain and improve coping during pediatric
      procedures ranges from no intervention to support from child life specialists.

      As an adjunct to the existing methods of promoting comfort during painful procedures,
      non-invasive virtual reality (VR) therapy is showing promise as a means of distraction and
      coping with various medical procedures. The user is transported into a relaxing/distracting
      VR environment that diverts user's attention away from pain and anxiety. VR has demonstrated
      efficacy in the reduction of pain and anxiety experienced by individuals undergoing anxiety
      and pain inducing procedures.While there is early data from small or narrow populations that
      show some improvement in pain and anxiety with VR use during pediatric procedures, some
      studies show no improvement. No studies to date have used objective outcome measures of
      coping, which may be more clinically meaningful.

      The investigators propose to fill this gap in the literature with a randomized, controlled,
      un-blinded study of coping and distress between virtual reality engagement and child life
      support in pediatric patients undergoing painful medical procedures.

    <measure>Child and Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale (CAMPIS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-procedure, up to 15minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Coping was measured using a modified CAMPIS-SF in both patients and caregivers.
CAMPIS-SF (Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Short Form) is a behavior rating scale that documents distressing or coping behaviors exhibited in both children and the accompanying adult (parent/guardian). It has been validated to measure coping in children and adults during medical procedures. The CAMPIS-SF study used a 5-point Likert scale to document frequency of each code In order to account for frequency variance due to differences in procedure duration, we used a proportion-based metric validated for CAMPIS-R, and applied this to CAMPIS-SF codes. Proportions were calculated by summing the total number of an event type (e.g. child distress) and dividing by the total number of coded events (child distress plus child coping). This provided a proportion for each event type so that the proportion of child distress plus child coping events add up to 1.0 (range 0-1.0).</description>

        <title>Child and Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale (CAMPIS) Score</title>
        <description>Coping was measured using a modified CAMPIS-SF in both patients and caregivers.
CAMPIS-SF (Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Short Form) is a behavior rating scale that documents distressing or coping behaviors exhibited in both children and the accompanying adult (parent/guardian). It has been validated to measure coping in children and adults during medical procedures. The CAMPIS-SF study used a 5-point Likert scale to document frequency of each code In order to account for frequency variance due to differences in procedure duration, we used a proportion-based metric validated for CAMPIS-R, and applied this to CAMPIS-SF codes. Proportions were calculated by summing the total number of an event type (e.g. child distress) and dividing by the total number of coded events (child distress plus child coping). This provided a proportion for each event type so that the proportion of child distress plus child coping events add up to 1.0 (range 0-1.0).</description>
