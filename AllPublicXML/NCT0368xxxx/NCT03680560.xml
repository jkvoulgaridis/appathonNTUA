  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study to assess safety and determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ACTR T cell product (ACTR707 or ACTR087) in combination
      with trastuzumab, following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in subjects with HER2-positive
      advanced malignancies.
