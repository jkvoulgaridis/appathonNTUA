  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walnuts have been shown to reduce serum lipids in hyperlipidemic individuals with a
      well-controlled feeding trials. Current study have been determined the effects of daily
      walnut consumption on serum lipids, fasting glucose and insulin levels in hyperlipidemic
      individuals.

      In this, randomized controlled trial, mild to moderate hyperlipidemic subjects were randomly
      divided into 2 groups as walnut-enriched (n=20) and control (n=17) groups for 6 weeks. All
      subjects adhered to a medical nutrition therapy as low-fat and low-cholesterol diet. The
      walnut-enriched group was supplemented with 40 g/day of walnuts added to their diets. In
      order to follow nutritional status of subjects, they were visited every 15 days (in total 4
      times). Anthropometric measurements of the subjects were taken and were monitored at each
      visit during the study. Blood samples were measured at the beginning and again at the end of
      the study.
