      Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin for Stroke Patients With Antiphospholipid Syndrome, With or
      Without SLE (RISAPS): a Randomised, Controlled, Open label, Phase II/III, Non-inferiority
      Trial.

      140 patients will be randomised with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either:

        -  Rivaroxaban 15mg twice daily orally for 24 months or

        -  Warfarin (standard of care in the RISAPS trial) to maintain a target INR of 3.5 (range
           3.0-4.0) for 24 months.

      The primary outcome of the trial is the rate of change in brain white matter hyperintensity
      (WMH) volume between baseline and 24 months follow up, assessed on brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), a surrogate marker of ischaemic damage.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RISAPS trial follows on from the RAPS (Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome) study
      that showed that rivaroxaban could offer a potentially effective alternative to warfarin for
      patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who have thrombosis (blood clots) in their
      veins, rather than in their arteries and require standard intensity anticoagulation (blood
      thinning).

      Currently, APS patients who have had an ischaemic stroke (which occurs when blood flow to an
      area of brain is cut off) are treated with warfarin to reduce the risk of a recurrence.
      Warfarin tends to have a variable 'blood thinning' effect in patients with APS, necessitating
      frequent (usually weekly) INR blood tests to monitor the effect of the warfarin, which is
      inconvenient for patients.

      The RISAPS trial will compare higher intensity (higher dose) rivaroxaban versus higher
      intensity warfarin (current standard of care treatment) for 24 months, in APS patients, with
      or without lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus; SLE), requiring higher intensity
      anticoagulation after experiencing a stroke, a 'mini stroke' (also known as a transient
      ischaemic attack) or other ischaemic brain damage (caused by blood clots in the brain
      arteries or smaller blood vessels). Rivaroxaban, unlike warfarin, does not require regular
      blood tests, because it has a more predictable blood thinning effect.

      Furthermore, rivaroxaban does not interact with food or alcohol and has fewer interactions
      than warfarin with other drugs. If rivaroxaban is no worse than warfarin for anticoagulation
      of APS patients with stroke or other ischaemic brain manifestations, it could become the
      standard of care for the treatment of APS patients, with or without lupus, who have
      experienced stroke or other ischaemic brain manifestations and improve patients' quality of
      life.
