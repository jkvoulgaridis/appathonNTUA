      An Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BRCX014
      Combined with Standard-of-Care Treatment in Subjects with Glioblastoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown a possible anti-tumor role for cannabinoids by modulating cell
      signaling pathways, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and overcoming chemotherapy
      resistance. The investigators seek to demonstrate the safety profile of BRCX014, a
      cannabinoid formulation, when given to glioblastoma patients in conjunction with
      standard-of-care therapy.

    <description>Subjects will receive escalating doses of BRCX014 in conjunction with standard-of-care (SOC) treatment. For patients with GBM, following standard chemo-radiation treatment (radiation: 2 Gy per day for a total of 60 Gy; and temozolomide: 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, seven days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), SOC treatment comprises six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for five days during each 28-day cycle), with or without use of alternating electric field therapy (Optune device).</description>
