  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is a randomized controlled study and the subjects included in the study will be
      divided into three groups as virtual reality training, biofeedback training, and conventional
      rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have 3 purposes:

        1. Determine the feasibility of virtual reality training in children with neuromuscular
           disease.

        2. To determine the effect of virtual reality, biofeedback training, and conventional
           rehabilitation on functional levels and balances of children with neuromuscular disease.

        3. To compare the motivation of children with neuromuscular disease to virtual reality,
           biofeedback training, and conventional rehabilitation.

    <measure>The Motor Function Measure-32</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>MFM-32 is a scale developed to evaluate motor functions of children and adults with neuromuscular disease. The scale can be used to evaluate both in children with and without walking problems.The MFM-32 consists of 32 items. Each item is answered with a 4-point likert scale (0 = cannot initiate the exercise or maintain its starting position, 1 = partially completes the exercise, 2 = completes exercises with compensations, slowly or roughly, 3 = completes the exercise in the standard pattern). The scale can be used for the evaluation of individuals aged between 6 and 60 years.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Functional Independence Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>WeeFIM consists of 18 items divided into 6 sub-scales (self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication, social communication). Each item is scored from 1 to 7. A higher score indicates a better functional level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Biodex Balance System</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Biodex Balance System SD allows clinicians to assess a patient's neuromuscular control in a closed-chain, multi-plane test by quantifying the ability of the patient to maintain dynamic unilateral or bilateral postural stability on either a static or unstable surface. With this system, General Stability Index (GSI), Antero-posterior Stability Index (APSI) and Mediolateral Stability Index (MLSI) can be evaluated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vignos Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Vignos Scale has been developed to evaluate the lower extremity functions. The scale allows the lower extremity functions to be scored between 1 (can walk and climb stairs without help) and -10 (bed dependent).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Virtual Reality</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of virtual reality will be examined by laboratory tests. Laboratory tests to be carried out are as follows: Creatine Kinase, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Myoglobin, Serum Electrolytes, C-Reactive Protein levels. These are agents that are indicative of muscle destruction or inflammation. Will be evaluated in order to follow muscle destruction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Motivation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The PMOT is recommended for assessing motivation to rehabilitation program in children aged 8 to 18 years. It comprises six subscales (effort-importance, interest-enjoyment, competence, relatedness, autonomy, and value-usefulness) with total 21 items. While the 19 items of the scale are answered with a 6-point smiley face scale (1 = absolutely false, 6 = absolutely correct), there are 2 open-ended questions on the scale. The high scores in each sub-scales indicate that the child's motivation in that sub-section is high. A higher total score indicates that the motivation is intrinsically arranged and that the child has a high motivation. From this point of view, the scale gives information about both the type of motivation and the amount of motivation of the child.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Minute</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale will be applied to evaluate muscle pain. It has a fixed line between two end adjectives of 100 mm length. The end adjectives in our study will be &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;too much pain&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Functional Reaching Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Minute</time_frame>
    <description>For the Pediatric Functional Reach test, children will be asked to raise their arms 90o in an upright posture position, extending to the maximum possible distance in three directions, forward, right, and left. Reach distances will be measured by pointing the wall with the end point of the third finger, and distances; &quot;start&quot;, &quot;final&quot; and &quot;difference&quot; will be determined in cm using tape measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Minute</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of the fall will be questioned with a chart created by the researchers. The family will be asked to record the children's each fall a week before the study and a week after the treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength Test with Hand Held Dinamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Upper and lower limb muscles strength will be evaluated with hand held dinamometer device. This device allows recording of muscle strength in kilograms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For the time up go test, children will be asked to walk with two walking cones at a distance of 10 meters, at normal walking speeds, and the elapsed time will be recorded in seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stair Climb Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Children will be asked to climb up and down as quickly as they can, without running the steps, on a ladder of 16-20 cm height and 8-14 steps and the elapsed time will be recorded in seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>T-shirt Wear Remove Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For the T-shirt pull-out test, the children will be asked to wear a T-Shirt in the sitting position as soon as possible and the elapsed time will be recorded in seconds; then they will be asked to remove the T-Shirt as soon as possible and the elapsed time will be recorded in seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stand Up from Supine Position Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>From the supine position to stand up, children will be asked to lie on the back of the body, the arms next to the body, the legs as closed as possible, and the head on the midline on a mat. Then, from this position, they will be asked to stand as soon as possible and the elapsed time will be recorded in seconds.</description>
