  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity is defined, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), by
      abnormal or excessive accumulation of adipose or fatty tissue that may be harmful to health.

      Overweight and obesity are therefore important determinants of health, which expose people to
      many pathologies whose consequences for individuals are not only health, but also social:
      stigma, prejudice, discrimination.

      Indeed, most overweight people have a bad image of themselves. For some people, overweight
      can trigger stress, malaise and disgust.

      To break free from this malaise and satisfy the growing desire of women to take care of their
      body, many products are present in the slimming beauty market.

      EFFANACA3GEL is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. 208
      healthy volunteers will be followed for 2 months during which they will use ANACA3 slimming
      gel. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of ANACA3 slimming gel on hip and waist
      circumferences.
