    <textblock>
      Fruquintinib administered at 4 mg once daily in cycle 1 and 5 mg once daily in followed
      cycles (3 weeks on and 1 week off, 4 weeks as 1 cycle) was well tolerated and demonstrated
      encouraging preliminary clinical antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC in phase
      II study.

      This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib in the treatment of
      high risk patients with advanced NSCLC who is &gt; 75 years, or Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) = 2, or without systemic chemotherapy, or with at least
      three lines systemic chemotherapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single arm multi-center phase II study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Fruquintinib in high risk patients with advanced NSCLC who is &gt; 75 years, or ECOG
      PS = 2, or without systemic chemotherapy, or with at least three lines systemic
      chemotherapies.

      After checking eligibility criteria, subjects will take Fruquintinib as below: 4 mg once
      daily in the Cycle 1, administration for 3 weeks followed by 1 week break. 5mg once daily in
      followed cycles, administration for 3 weeks followed by 1 week break.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      Disease Control Rate (DCR) (According to RECIST Version 1.1). Safety and tolerance will be
      evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by
      severity in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

      Objective Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Response (DOR), Progression free survival (PFS),
      Overall Survival (OS) and Quality of Life (QoL).
