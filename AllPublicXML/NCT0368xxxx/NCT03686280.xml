  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recovery of a balance and gait is a primary objective for geriatric, neurological or
      orthopedic rehabilitation. Since the 80s, many walking robots were proposed. Despite
      encouraging results, the use of robotic equipment for gait training remains limited, even if
      they meet a strong social demand. The reasons for this situation are economic, but also
      related to the non consideration of the context of utilization . This project aimed at
      developping a mobile and interactive robot, dedicated to the rehabilitation of balance and
      gait at an early stage. It was intended for patients with impaired walking vascular
      neurological, traumatic or associated with chronic neurological disease. The aim of the study
      is to study the effectiveness of the prototype (interactive walking mobile robot).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 14 items, with a maximum score of 56. Static and dynamic balance tasks of increasing difficulty are performed, with a score per item ranging from 0 to 4, depending on the ability to perform the task evaluated.
This equilibrium scale was initially conceived as a quantitative measure of the balance and the risk of falling in non-institutionalized elderly people (Berg 1989). The psychometric qualities of this scale were then demonstrated in patients after stroke, including fidelity, validity and internal consistency (Berg 1992, Berg 1995, Mao 2002, Wang 2004, Hiengkaew 2012). Sensitivity to change was considered moderate to wide according to the studies (Wood-Dauphinee 1996, Mao 2002, Chou 2006). The Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) varies from 1.5 to 2.9 points depending on the studies (Liston and Brouwer 1996, Stevensen 2001, Flansbjer 2012, Hiengkaew 2012).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FAC</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>FAC is a functional classification of walking that assesses a patient's ability to move. This six-point scale assesses the state of the walk by determining the human support the patient needs to walk, whether or not he / she uses a personal assistive device (Teasell, Foley &amp; Salter, 2011). The psychometric qualities of the FAC were evaluated in post stroke patients by Mehrholz in 2007: excellent fidelity, good sensitivity to change, adequate predictive validity and excellent concomitant validity. However, significant ceiling effects have been reported (Salter 2008).</description>

    <measure>motor skills scores: Motricity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The motricity index, Motricity Index, is an ordinal method of measuring muscle strength developed by Demeurisse in 1980. In the lower limb, 3 movements are tested and performed in a sitting position: hip flexion, knee extension and dorsiflexion. For each movement, the score is 0.9, 14.19, 25 or 33 (same items as the MRC classification on 5). The maximum total score in the lower limb is therefore 99. The evaluation is made on the side of the paretic limb. This scale has excellent fidelity (Collin and Wade 1990, Fayazi 2012) and construct validity (Collin and Wade 1990). The susceptibility to change in the motor index is average, and for example the TDM10m is more sensitive to change than the motor index (Vos-Vromans 2005).</description>

    <measure>SIS</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a quality of life assessment tool. Its latest version, SIS 3.0, contains 59 items (64 for version 2.0) measuring eight domains: strength (4 items), hand functionality (5 items), ADL / IADL (10 items), mobility ( 9 items), communication (7 items), emotions (9 items), memory / thinking (7 items), and social participation (8 items). A final item assessing overall recovery from stroke is requested from the patient (score out of 100).The items are scored using a Likert type scale with five answer options. Patients are asked to complete the instrument according to the difficulty they perceived during the last week. The scores of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 correspond respectively to: '' not difficult at all '', '' a little difficult '', '' rather difficult '', '' very difficult '', and '' extremely difficult ''. The scores are then processed by computer to obtain a total score out of 100, 100 corresponding to the absence of difficulty.</description>

    <measure>PASS</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Postural Assesment Scale:
The PASS, Postural Assesment Scale, assesses balance in a supine, sitting and standing position. this scale has been designed specifically for stroke patients and is suitable for all individuals regardless of postural performance (Benaim 1999). It is an adaptation of the Fugl-Meyer evaluation equilibrium subscale. Initially developed in French, it was later translated into English. This scale consists of 12 items of increasing difficulty.
It includes items not evaluated by the Berg / BBS scale (Blum and Korner-Bitensky, 2008) and demonstrates better psychometric properties than the Berg / BBS scale and the modified balance subscale of the evaluation. Fugl-Meyer (Mao 2002, Hsieh 2002, Wang 2004).</description>

    <measure>WADE</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Wade test, or 10-meter walk test (TDM10m), is designed to evaluate walking speed per second over a short distance. The patient walks for 10 meters, and the time required to cover this distance is measured, and the number of steps is calculated. Most often the patient is started, that is to say he starts a few meters before and he starts the test at constant speed. Three in-line tests must be performed, and the average over the three trials is calculated. The test can be done at comfortable speed or fast speed (must be specified), with or without technical assistance (walking stick, walker), with or without orthosis (foot lifter, orthopedic shoes). The Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) was evaluated at 0.04 m / sec (Perera 2006), and the Minimum Detectable Change-MDC at 0.16 m / sec (Tilson 2010). The cut-off for safe outdoor independent walking has been set at 0.8 m / s (Bowden 2008).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TUG</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TUG, Timed Up and Go Test (Podsiadlo and Richardson, 1991), is an instrument for the overall assessment of mobility, balance, walking ability and risk of falling in the elderly. The patient should stand up from a chair, walk a distance of three meters, turn around, then return to the chair while walking and sitting down. These tasks must be performed at comfortable speed. The measured time begins with the verbal instruction &quot;go&quot; and stops when the client returns to sitting position. It is permissible to use a walking aid, but its use must be indicated. No physical assistance is given. TUG performance is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates &quot;normal functioning&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;severe abnormal behavior&quot;, depending on the individual's perception of risk of falling. The score is the time taken to complete the test, in seconds.</description>

    <measure>Walking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Walking test of 6 minutes:
The six-minute walk test (6MWT / TDM6min) (Butland, Pang, Gross, Woodcock and Geddes, 1982) is a functional walk test in which the distance traveled by the patient in six minutes is evaluated. This test has been validated in different populations including stroke patients (Kosak and Smith, 2005). It is a simple test that requires an indoor, straight, flat, 30m long corridor. Mean normative data vary between 408 and 422 m (Wevers 2011).
Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) has been estimated to be between 12.4 and 18.6 m (Eng 2004, Flansbjer 2005), and the Minimal Detectable Change-MDC at about 35 m for a population chronic stroke (Eng 2004, Flansbjer 2005) and 61 m in the acute phase (Perera 2006). Fidelity has been found by studies to be excellent (Flansbjer 2005, Fulk 2008, Wevers 2011) or adequate (Kosak and Smith 2005). Validity against excellent criteria (Flansbjer 2005, Kosak and Smith 2005, Wevers 2011).</description>
