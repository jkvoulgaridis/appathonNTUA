  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) requires bone reconstruction in case of severe acetabular
      injury, with risk of dislocation, especially postoperatively. Dual-mobility cups have proved
      effective in preventing dislocation in THA revision for instability, but their behavior when
      cemented in a metal reinforcement has been little studied.

      The present study assessed results for a dual-mobility cup cemented in a metal reinforcement,
      in terms of aseptic loosening and postoperative instability.

      A single-center continuous series of 62 patients receiving such an assembly in THA revision
      was assessed retrospectively at a minimum 5 years' follow-up.
