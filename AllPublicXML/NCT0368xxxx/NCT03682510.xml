  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetric hemorrhage is estimated to be responsible for about 30% of all maternal deaths and
      is the leading direct etiology of maternal mortality worldwide . Especially in developing
      countries, hemorrhage is by far the leading cause of mortality and morbidity, with 140,000
      women dying of PPH worldwide each year, which equates to 1 death every 4 min . The United
      Nations Millennium Development Fifth Goal, to reduce 75 % of maternal mortality by 2015 that
      not reached yet, cannot be held without significant improvements in postpartum hemorrhage
      (PPH) related mortality.

      Placenta previa (PP) is an obstetric condition that is closely linked with potentially
      life-threatening hemorrhage with varied incidence approximately four or five per 1000
      pregnancies. Placenta previa is diagnosed when the placenta obstructs part or all the
      cervical os during antenatal ultrasonography. Placenta previa may be subclassified using
      ultrasound scan to be &quot;major or complete&quot; (implanted across the cervix) or &quot;minor&quot; (not
      implanted across the cervix).

      Currently, there is a dramatic increase in the incidence of placenta previa due to the
      increasing rate of cesarean delivery combined with increasing maternal age (6) It is
      considered one of the causes of the increased need for blood transfusion and cesarean
      hysterectomy.

      Various conservative measures have been developed to avoid hysterectomy and preserve
      fertility in patients with PP. Bilateral Uterine artery ligation (BUAL) is one of the
      reported surgical procedures carried out in these cases as it is easy and quick. It can be
      used alone or with adjunctive measures with a fair success rate. The aim is to reduce the
      blood supply to the uterus and to prevent PPH.

      There are a few methods to prevent and treat placenta previa bleeding immediately after
      cesarean delivery and control intra-operative bleeding during the cesarean operation. A safe
      intra-operative maneuver to arrest bleeding due to placenta previa is required. However,
      there is no gold standard treatment of placenta previa hemorrhage. The aims of the study to
      assess the effect of the novel sandwich technique for the control of hemorrhage during
      cesarean section due to placenta previa (double Transverse Compression Suture at the lower
      uterine segment plus Intrauterine inflated Foley's Catheter Balloon, (N&amp;H technique) on
      control of massive bleeding due to central placenta previa in comparison with B-Lynch
      Transverse Compression Suture.

      All participants will undergo a detailed history, general, abdominal and vaginal
      examinations, body mass index (BMI) was calculated and pelvic ultrasound examination was
      undertaken for all participants. The participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were
      explained about the study with the beneficial and possible adverse effects of lidocaine.
      Informed consent was obtained from them after that participant will be randomized into 3
      groups: group 1 [N&amp;H technique], group 2 [N&amp;H technique] and group (3) stepwise
      devascularization Eligible participants will be allocated to one of 3 groups after induction
      of general anesthesia and prior to the operation and before skin incision. The abdomen was
      exposed through Pfannenstiel incision, after skin incision, the subcutaneous fat and
      abdominal fascia were opened crosswise, and the rectus muscle was opened on the midline, the
      parietal peritoneum was opened longitudinally, the visceral peritoneum was opened
      transversely and dissected downwards with the bladder and kept against symphysis pubis by a
      Doyen retractor, followed by transverse incision of the uterus at the upper border of the
      placenta to avoid transplacental incision which provokes severe bleeding . The fetus was
      delivered.

      20 IU oxytocin was given IV infusion after IIAL to prevent premature separation of placenta
      which provoked severe bleeding then placenta delivery was done.

      In the B-Lynch Transverse Compression Suture group, After acceptable control of bleeding from
      the placental bed, uses the suture material 1 VICRYL with a 70mm ½ circle needle mounted on a
      90 cms VICRYL suture. We use the needle blunt ended to puncture the uterus 3 cms above the
      upper margin of the incision posteriorly and behind the vascular bundle.

      The needle is retrieved through the cavity of the uterus and pulled inferiorly with the
      suture material lying on the posterior wall of the uterine cavity. The needle then perforates
      the posterior wall of the uterus 3 cms below the inferior margin of the Caesarean incision
      and exists behind the vascular bundle of the same side of the uterus retrieved and runs on
      the surface of the lower segment below the incision margin parallel to it and taking a 1 cm
      bite of tissue for stabilization running to the other side. After encircling the para-uterine
      vasculature, the needle then perforates the posterior side of the uterus behind the vascular
      bundle entering the uterine cavity. The suture can lie freely on the posterior wall of the
      uterine cavity and exists 3 cms above the upper margin of the Caesarean incision. It exits
      posteriorly and behind the vascular bundle to meet the suture from the other side.

      It is essential that the ureters are identified by palpation or visual observation after the
      bladder is displaced inferiorly and held by traction. Any observed bleeding should be dealt
      with in the usual way. At the end of the suture application and before tying the knots, the
      lower segment is compressed again transversely whilst the suture is held taut to ensure that
      bleeding has ceased by swabbing the vagina again.

      A wide pore drain was then inserted in the Douglas pouch, and the abdominal wall was
      repaired. In the case of conservative treatment protocol failure, cesarean hysterectomy was
      performed
