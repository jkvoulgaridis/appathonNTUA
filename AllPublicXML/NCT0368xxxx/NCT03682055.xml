      VK-2019-001 is a 1/2a trial of the oral EBNA-1 targeting agent VK-2019 in patients with
      EBV-positive recurrent or metastatic NPC to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate the PK profile of VK-2019.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multicenter, first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of VK-2019 in patients with EBV-positive
      NPC.

      This trial is divided into three parts: Phase 1 Dose Escalation, Phase 1 Dose Expansion, and
      Phase 2s Dose Expansion.

      The objectives of the dose escalation part are to determine the safety, tolerability, MTD,
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of orally
      administered VK-2019 monotherapy. Additional objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of VK-2019.

      VK-2019 will be dosed once daily (QD).

             of the Investigator, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy or
             whose control may be jeopardized by the complications of this therapy.

          6. Currently taking drugs that inhibit or induce OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 within 5 half lives
             of that agent. Examples are included in Appendix 2.

          7. Have received a prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

          8. Current non prescription drug or alcohol dependence.

          9. For all female patients, pregnancy or breastfeeding.

         10. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test

         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             the study.
