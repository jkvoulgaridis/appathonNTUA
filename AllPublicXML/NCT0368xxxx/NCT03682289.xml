    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 works alone or in
      combination with olaparib in treating participants with renal cell carcinoma, urothelial
      carcinoma, all pancreatic cancers, or other solid tumors excluding clear cell ovarian cancer
      that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other parts of the body. ATR kinase
      inhibitor AZD6738 and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not known if giving ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 with
      or without olaparib may work better in treating participants with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess objective response rate (ORR) of ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 (AZD6738)
      monotherapy and AZD6738 + olaparib by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      1.1 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median duration of response (DOR) in each study arm. II. To determine the
      median progression-free survival and progression-free survival rate at 6 and 12 months in
      each study arm.

      III. To further characterize the safety and tolerability profile of AZD6738 alone and in
      combination with olaparib.

                  subsequent enrollment of the remaining 10 patients will be required to have
                  evidence of both ATM mutation and loss of ATM expression (&lt; 5% of tumor cells
                  expressing ATM) using CLIA-certified IHC test (Ventana).

          4. Evidence of clinical or radiographic progression prior to study entry (except

             days prior to C1D1 for patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of bone marrow.

          9. Adequate organ function as defined by:

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 10.0 g/dL in the absence of transfusion within 14 days prior

                  Gilbert's disease or UGT1A1 homozygote).

         10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

         11. The effects of AZD6738 and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because ATR and PARP inhibitors as well as other therapeutic drugs
             used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use 2 highly effective forms of contraception prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

               1. Male patients who are sexually active must be willing to use barrier
                  contraception for the duration of the study and for 1 week after the last study
                  drug administration, with all sexual partners. Male patients must use a condom
                  during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) when
                  having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing
                  potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective
                  form of contraception for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) if they
                  are of childbearing potential. True abstinence for either sex is an acceptable
                  form of contraception and must be documented as such.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
                  test within 7 days prior to C1D1 treatment). Evidence of postmenopausal status or
                  non-child bearing status must be documented. Postmenopausal is defined as:

                    -  Aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following
                       cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

                    -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy,
                       bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation,
                       radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt; 1 year ago,
                       chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt; 1 year interval since last menses

                    -  Amenorrhoeic for 12 months and serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
                       luteinizing hormone (LH) and plasma oestradiol levels in the postmenopausal
                       range for the institution for women under 50.

                         -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and able to
                            comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including
                            undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.
