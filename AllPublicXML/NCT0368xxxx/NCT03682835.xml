  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate changes in gastric motility (including gastric accommodation),
      nutrient volume tolerance, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal hormones in healthy
      volunteers after an acute intake of a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil, compared
      to placebo. In addition, the effect of a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil on
      appetite-related sensations and upper gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed.

      Gastric emptying rate will be assessed using a 13C breath test. Intragastric pressure (IGP)
      will be measured using high-resolution manometry in fasted state and during intragastric
      infusion of a nutrient drink (350 mL or until full satiation). Appetite-related sensations
      and gastrointestinal symptoms were rated during IGP measurements. Blood samples were
      collected to assess peptide hormone levels.

      This study aims to investigate changes in gastric motility (including gastric accommodation),
      nutrient volume tolerance, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal hormones in healthy
      volunteers after an acute intake of a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil, compared
      to placebo. In addition, the effect of a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil on
      appetite-related sensations and upper gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed. These
      outcomes will be studied on 2 study days. On study day 1, gastric emptying rate will be
      assessed using a 13C breath test 30 minutes after intake of study medication. This test is
      followed by an intragastric pressure (IGP) measurement during which 350 mL of a nutrient
      drink will be intragastrically infused 30 minutes after intake of study medication. On the
      second study day, IGP will be measured in fasted state for 4 hours after intake of study
      medication. Hereafter, a second dose of study medication will be administered. Thirty minutes
      later, a nutrient drink will be infused until the participant is fully satiated.
      Appetite-related sensations and gastrointestinal symptoms will be rated during IGP
      measurements on a 100mm VAS. Blood samples will be collected to assess peptide hormone
      levels.
