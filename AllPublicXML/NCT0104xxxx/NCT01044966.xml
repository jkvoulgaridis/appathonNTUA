    <textblock>
      Current treatments for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common and malignant primary
      brain tumor are inadequate and as such, the median survival for most patients with GBM is on
      the order of months, even after cytoreductive surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. This study
      aims to develop a new treatment for GBM by suppressing glial progenitor cells that surround
      the ventricular system in patients with these aggressive tumors because it is these regions
      that appear to act as an incubator for future recurrences resulting in patient death.
      Considering the lack of significant treatment options for patients with this uniformly fatal
      disease, this is an important translational clinical study to perform.

    <textblock>
      Despite significant improvements in diagnostic imaging and neurosurgical techniques, the
      current treatment modalities for high-grade gliomas are inadequate. As such, the median
      survival for most patients with GBM is on the order of months, even after cytoreductive
      surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Fewer than 3% of GBM patients are still alive at 5 years
      after diagnosis. A rising incidence has been reported for GBM, and the survival rate for
      patients with GBM has not shown improvement in the last two decades. For this reason
      exploring novel therapies for the treatment of GBM is warranted.

      Neuro-oncology is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift in terms of our accepted
      understanding of the pathophysiology of gliomagenesis. Classic &quot;dedifferentiation&quot;
      hypotheses, modeling the cellular origin of gliomas after neoplastic transformation of
      differentiated glia, are currently being challenged by hypotheses suggesting dysregulated
      glial progenitor cells are responsible for gliomagenesis. Growing evidence exists that glial
      progenitor cells persisting in the adult mammalian brain, lining the lateral ventricles in
      the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus, play a role in gliomagenesis. Gliomas
      frequently occur in close proximity to the ventricular system and SVZ with high-grade lesions
      like GBM &quot;spreading&quot; to midline structures and crossing the corpus callosum to the
      contralateral hemisphere. Glial progenitor cells lining the lateral ventricles in the SVZ and
      dentate gyrus may be the source of &quot;tumor&quot; cells &quot;spreading&quot; to midline structures such as
      the corpus callosum as well as continuously replenishing the tumor bed resulting in local
      recurrences.

      The lack of significant clinical advances in treating GBM may be due to oversight of the SVZ
      component of this disease. It is our hypothesis that successful treatment of GBM will require
      suppression of the SVZ component in addition to the currently accepted modalities of
      hemispheric tumor resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy. This understanding of
      gliomagenesis has not yet been used clinically for the treatment of GBM. We hypothesize that
      the SVZ is the incubator for future recurrences of GBM and propose targeting SVZ progenitor
      cells with intraventricular liposomal encapsulated Ara-C (DepoCyt) in combination with
      systemic metronomic dose temozolomide. Ara-C has been previously demonstrated to inhibit the
      proliferation and migration of SVZ precursor cells in adult animals. Two patients treated
      using this novel regimen have demonstrated significant responses warranting further study of
      this treatment in the Phase I/II clinical trial proposed here. This has also been the basis
      for successful application and granting of Orphan-Drug designation for cytarabine (Ara-C)
      liposome injection (trade name: DepoCyt) for the treatment of gliomas (Designation # 06-2348)

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age Patients must be at least 18 years of age but no older than 85 years.

          -  Diagnosis Patients with the histological diagnosis of recurrent GBM made either by
             biopsy or resection of recurrent disease. Cytological evidence of malignant cells in
             CSF and/or clinical and radiographic evidence of leptomeningeal disease are irrelevant
             in terms of inclusion or exclusion into this study. Bihemispheric extension
             (&quot;butterfly GBM&quot;), multi-focality, and/or subependymal spread are not
             contraindications to enrollment.

          -  Prior therapy Patients must have had an initial diagnosis of &quot;malignant glioma&quot; (WHO
             grade III or IV) and failed initial surgical resection followed by standard adjuvant
             therapy including external beam radiotherapy to a 2cm margin of 60 Gy, and standard
             temozolomide chemotherapy of 150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each
             28-day cycle prior to &quot;recurrence.&quot; Patients must not have received more than one
             other systemic or ITV adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in addition to temozolomide prior
             to enrollment, not including intracavitary Gliadel wafer placement. Prior Gliadel
             wafer placement is not a contradiction to patient enrollment in this trial.

          -  Performance Status Patients must have Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≥ 60%.

          -  Recovery from Prior Therapy Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects
             of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy, prior to entering this
             study and must be without significant systemic illness (e.g. infection unresponsive to
             treatment after 7 days). Such that they are healthy enough to safely undergo tumor
             biopsy and Ommaya reservoir placement. Patients must not have received any systemic
             therapy for recurrent disease within 3 weeks (6 weeks if a nitrosourea), or
             irradiation within 8 weeks prior to treatment on this study.

          -  Hematologic Status Patients must have a platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm3 and ANC &gt; 1500/mm3

             2.0 mg%; ALT, and AST &lt; 4 times normal); adequate renal function (serum creatinine
             &lt;1.6 mg, and BUN &lt; 22); normal serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium,
             magnesium, and phosphorus).

          -  Informed Consent (See Appendix) All patients or their legal guardians must sign a
             document of informed consent indicating their awareness of the investigational nature
             and the risks of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients younger than 18 or older than 85 years of age.

          -  Patients that have received more than one other systemic or ITV adjuvant chemotherapy
             regimen in addition to temozolomide, not including intracavitary Gliadel wafer
             placement.

          -  Patients concurrently receiving other therapies (either brachytherapy or systemic)
             designed specifically to treat the recurrent GBM.

          -  Patients within 8 weeks of receiving stereotactic or external beam irradiation.

             years must have a negative serum pregnancy test.

          -  Patients with a ventricular-peritoneal or ventricular-atrial shunt.

          -  Prisoners will be excluded from this study.

Not at all
A little
Quite a bit
Very much Lower total scores are consistent with better quality of life and changes of greater or equal to 10 points are considered a significant change in quality of life.</description>
