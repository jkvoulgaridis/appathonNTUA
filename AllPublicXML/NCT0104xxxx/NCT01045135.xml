  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the pelvic floor muscles and fascias during delivery and childbirth may lead to
      urinary incontinence (25-45 %), faecal incontinence (11-45%), pelvic organ prolapse (7-23%),
      sexual dysfunction (15-33 %) and chronic pain syndromes (4-15%). Pelvic floor muscle injuries
      are not easy to diagnose as they are not visible when looking at surface anatomy during a
      standard gynaecological examination. The investigators are therefore in urgent need of better
      tools to diagnose these injuries. Having a reliable and easily accessible tool enables
      studies of the consequences of such pelvic floor muscle injuries. It also makes it possible
      for us to explore the effect of interventions such as pelvic floor muscle training and
      surgery in patients with and without pelvic floor muscle injuries. The investigators have
      previously presented data to support the reliability and the validity of the three and four
      dimensional (3 and 4D) ultrasound technique used to define pelvic floor muscle anatomy in
      healthy volunteers and have now a tool to study women before and after delivery. At the
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Akershus University Hospital there are
      approximately 4500 deliveries annually and 1500 women are giving birth for the first time.

      Challenges: The invitation to participate in the study will be given to all women expecting
      their first child fulfilling inclusion criteria. The biggest challenges in the project will
      be logistical. To be able to inform, recruit and follow women having their first child is a
      challenge in it self.

      Applications: If it is possible to identify a risk group for pelvic floor injuries before
      delivery, it might be ethical to recommend a prophylactic caesarean section to avoid
      disabling incontinence and prolapse later in life.

    <description>3-dimensional ultrasound was used to capture the axial plane of the pelvic floor in order to measure LH area. Levator hiatus area was measured at gestational week 21 and 37, at rest, during contraction and during Valsalva maneuver - giving 6 measurements all together.

        <title>Change in Bladder Neck Mobility Measured Via 3D Ultrasound</title>
        <description>3-dimensional ultrasound was used to capture the axial plane of the pelvic floor in order to measure LH area. Bladder neck mobility was measured at gestational week 21 and 37, at rest and during Valsalva maneuver . The change in mobility from rest to valsalva was computed between the two different timepoints.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>We did not examine the women before they were pregnant and therefore do not have information about how the pelvic floor was before pregnancy.
It is therefore possible that we have underestimated the change happening to the levator hiatus.</limitations_and_caveats>
