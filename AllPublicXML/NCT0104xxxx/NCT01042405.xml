  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to develop a simple computer program, evaluating nutritional status
      of HD patients. The programming will enable to perform a nutritional screening, based on
      biochemical measures, taken as part of HD patients' routine care every month. The program
      will identify patients at risk of malnutrition, define the degree of malnutrition, and
      identify patients who at risk for increased morbidity and mortality. Patients who are at risk
      of malnutrition will be treated by a standard nutrition; dietary counseling (high protein
      diet, appropriate calories intake and use of oral supplementation. Intra-dialytic parenteral
      nutrition (IDPN) will be used for patients who fail to improve nutrition status by standard
      nutrition care, as a second line treatment. The effect of IDPN on their nutrition status will
      be evaluated. A sub group of 30 patients will provide blood smample to assess a NIR method
      for Cr determination as creatinine is one of the parameters our nutrition score is based on.

      30 patients will randomly be selected for SGA examination and comparison to the MARK results
      every month. Frequency and duration of hospitalizations within the 5-month collection period
      will documented, mortality will be documented as well. Effect of different nutritional
      supplementations or IDPN will be assessed. The MARK nutrition screening will be used for all
      patients at the beginning of every month. Monthly Biochemical data using a blood sample taken
      immediately before dialysis will be used to calculate a value between 0-100 showing patient's
      monthly nutritional status. Data for the SGA will be collected for the same dialysis patients
      randomly selected at the same month. The nutritional state of the patients according to the
      SGA will be assessed by two investigators. A statistical test will be held for agreement
      between observers (Cohen's k concordant coefficient).

      A sub group of 30 patients will provide blood smample to assess a Near Infra Red (NIR) method
      for Cr determination. Application of chemometric approach will serve for constructing a
      fitting curve between tradtional CR measurment with NIR method.
