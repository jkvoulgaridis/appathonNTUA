  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient Population: Patients with active myeloma (Stage II/III) that have completed induction
      therapy and are eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant.

      Number of Patients: Will treat a total of 32 evaluable patients in a 1:1 randomization of
      aMILs vs aMILs plus vaccine. An evaluable patient is defined as one which has received the
      activated MILs and is at least 6 months post-transplant.

      Study Objectives:

      Disease response as determined by the Blade' criteria will be the primary endpoint of the
      trial at one year.

      Additional study endpoints include progression free survival, parameters of T cell
      reconstitution, anti-tumor immune responses as well as the effect on osteoclastogenesis and
      clonogenic myeloma precursor cells.

Stage 2: Neither stage 1 nor stage 3.
Stage 3: Beta-2 microglobulin &gt;= 5.5 mg/L.
Higher beta-2 microglobulin reflects greater tumor mass. Therefore, a higher stage reflects a worse prognosis.</description>

Complete Response (CR): Defined as negative serum and urine immunofixation and a bone marrow aspirate with &lt; 5% plasma cells.
Near Complete Response (nCR): Defined as negative serum and urine paraprotein, positive serum and/or urine immunofixation, and a bone marrow aspirate with &lt; 5% plasma cells.
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Defined as negative serum and urine paraprotein with positive serum and/or urine immunofixation; or a 90% decrease in serum paraprotein with urine paraprotein &lt; 100 mg/24 hours.
Partial Response (PR): Defined as a 50-89% decrease in serum paraprotein.
Minimal Response (MR): Defined as a 25-49% decrease in serum paraprotein.
Stable Disease (SD): Defined as not falling into any other response category.
Overall response rate (ORR): Total of CR, nCR, VGPR, and PR.</description>
