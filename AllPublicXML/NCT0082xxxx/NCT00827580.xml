      Primary Objectives

        1. To estimate the frequency of HFS following treatment with capecitabine as modulated by
           the unilateral local application of eniluracil containing ointment.

        2. To assess any eniluracil dose response relationship in prevention of HFS.

        3. To evaluate any potential toxicity of eniluracil ointment.

          7. Adequate liver function with SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2.5 times upper limits of normal.

          8. Adequate bone marrow function evidence by WBC &gt; 2500/mm3, PMN &gt;2000/mm3 and platelet
             count &gt; 100,000/mm3.

          9. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine &lt; 1.7 mg/dl.

         10. Recovery from relevant toxicity before study entry.

         11. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days before study entry for women of
             childbearing potential. Effective contraception throughout the course of the study for
             both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists.

        Exclusion Criteria:
