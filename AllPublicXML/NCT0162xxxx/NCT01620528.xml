    <textblock>
      A randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of elagolix in the management of
      moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain in adult premenopausal female participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess
      the safety and efficacy of two doses of elagolix versus placebo in premenopausal 18 to 49
      year old women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain. The study consists of 4
      periods: 1) Washout Period (if applicable); 2) a Screening Period of up to 100 days prior to
      first dose; 3) a 6 month Treatment Period; and 4) a Post treatment Follow-up Period of up to
      12 months (if applicable). An electronic diary will be dispensed and training provided to
      record endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding, and analgesic medication use for
      endometriosis-associated pain on a daily basis. Pregnancy testing will be performed monthly
      throughout the study.
