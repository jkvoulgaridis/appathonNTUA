    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show that first line treatment with concentrated fibrinogen has
      superiority over the conventional therapy with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and
      cryoprecipitate in perioperative management of bleeding after complex cardiac surgery.

      All patients will be recruited from the Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) Health Sciences Center,
      Halifax, Nova Scotia, which is the sole tertiary cardiac surgical referral center in Nova
      Scotia that performs approximately 1000 open heart surgical procedures yearly, including more
      than 700 isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures.

      Inclusion criteria: All patients who are scheduled for elective complex cardiac surgical
      procedures including, double procedures (aortic valve replacement+coronary artery bypass
      graft , mitral valve replacement+coronary artery bypass graft , aortic valve
      replacement+mitral valve replacement), redo-sternotomies, and aortic root repair +/-aortic
      valve replacement.

      Exclusion criteria: Any known congenital or preexisting bleeding disorder, preexisting
      clinically significant abnormal fibrinogen level, severe liver disease (alanine
      aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 150 U/l), inability of providing informed
      consent, emergency surgery, pregnancy or nursing, age under 18 years, intake of anti-platelet
      drugs within the last 2- 5 days before surgery (low dose aspirin is allowed) allergy to
      concentrated fibrinogen or other components in the product, anemia (Hb &lt; 110), diagnosed deep
      venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute stroke or acute myocardial infarction.

      The primary outcome: Cumulative perioperative amount (number of units and total volume) of
      blood components used between the start of surgery and 24 hours after administration of the
      study drug or placebo. 'Blood Components' are defined as all fresh components of blood (RBCs,
      plasma, platelets, and Cryo).

      The secondary outcomes: Fibrinogen levels, hematocrit, prothrombin time (PT), partial
      prothrombin time (PTT), INR, platelet count, Hemoglobin (Hb), Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®,
      clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), Angle, maximum clot firmness (MCF),
      Cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU-stay), Hospital-stay, In-Hospital Mortality,
      Hemoglobin, adverse events (anaphylaxis, stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism,
      and deep vein thromboembolism) and usage of factor VII concentrate and human prothrombin
      complex (factors II, VII,IX, X), total avoidance of transfusion after cardiopulmonary bypass

    <measure>International Normalized Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>24h after infusion of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>International normalized ratio (INR) is calculated based on the prothrombin time (PT) test results.The PT is usually measured in seconds and is compared to a normal range that reflects PT values in healthy individuals. Because the reagents used to perform the PT test vary from one laboratory to another and even within the same laboratory over time, the normal ranges also will fluctuate. To standardize results across different laboratories in the world, a World Health Organization (WHO) committee developed and recommended the use of the Internationalized Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR is calculated with the ratio of the patient's prothrombin time (PT test) to a normal prothrombin time (control) sample (PT normal): INR=PT test:PT normal. The normal range is from 0.9 to 1.2. The higher the value the more is the patient anticoagulated. This means the patient's blood is thinner with a lower concentration of coagulation factors.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours after study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Rotational thrombelastometry (measurement of functional fibrinogen). Rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) is a point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation test. The device provides four channels for simultaneous assays. With the so called &quot;FIBTEM&quot; assay coagulation is activated by a small amount of tissue thromboplastin (tissue factor) and platelets are blocked with cytochalasin D. The resulting clot is therefore only depending on fibrin formation and fibrin polymerisation. The maximum clot firmness (MCF) is the amplitude in mm on the result graph representing the increasing stabilisation of the clot.</description>

        <title>International Normalized Ratio</title>
        <description>International normalized ratio (INR) is calculated based on the prothrombin time (PT) test results.The PT is usually measured in seconds and is compared to a normal range that reflects PT values in healthy individuals. Because the reagents used to perform the PT test vary from one laboratory to another and even within the same laboratory over time, the normal ranges also will fluctuate. To standardize results across different laboratories in the world, a World Health Organization (WHO) committee developed and recommended the use of the Internationalized Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR is calculated with the ratio of the patient's prothrombin time (PT test) to a normal prothrombin time (control) sample (PT normal): INR=PT test:PT normal. The normal range is from 0.9 to 1.2. The higher the value the more is the patient anticoagulated. This means the patient's blood is thinner with a lower concentration of coagulation factors.</description>

        <description>Rotational thrombelastometry (measurement of functional fibrinogen). Rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) is a point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation test. The device provides four channels for simultaneous assays. With the so called &quot;FIBTEM&quot; assay coagulation is activated by a small amount of tissue thromboplastin (tissue factor) and platelets are blocked with cytochalasin D. The resulting clot is therefore only depending on fibrin formation and fibrin polymerisation. The maximum clot firmness (MCF) is the amplitude in mm on the result graph representing the increasing stabilisation of the clot.</description>
