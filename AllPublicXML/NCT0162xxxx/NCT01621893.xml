      Studying long-term changes in a sub-set of patients who undergo the Subchondroplasty
      procedure including changes in pain, function, and overall health.

      This study is designed as a prospective, consecutive series outcomes study. Patients
      presenting with knee pain associated with bone marrow lesions that meet the inclusion
      criteria will be eligible to undergo Subchondroplasty procedure. The subjects will be
      followed for twenty-four (24) months after surgery via office visits and will be contacted
      once per year for up to 5 years post-operatively and asked questions regarding their pain and
      functioning to further understand long-term outcomes.. Seventy (70), a ( minimum of sixty-two
      (62)) patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Up to
      5 sites will participate in this study. The study is intended to provide an estimate of
      one-year and two-year clinical success with minimum bias and with sufficient statistical
      precision to permit meaningful comparison to commonly accepted two-year clinical success
      rates for currently available treatment alternatives. An improvement of 10 points on the Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain Subscore on the KOOS Scoring System from
      baseline to 1-year post-operative is considered minimal perceptible clinical improvement and
      will be used to define the primary clinical success criterion for this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) Pain Subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative KOOS pain subsection score at 1-Year follow-up is improved by at least 10 points. The KOOS is a validated instrument which measures knee pain and function using five subscales: pain, symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation, and quality of life. The instrument consists of 42 standardized questions each having 5 point Likert response scale</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement from baseline in KOOS subsection scores</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a validated instrument which measures knee pain and function using five subscales: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), function in sport and recreation, and quality of life. The instrument consists of 42 standardized questions each having 5 point Likert response scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a validated pain scale. Subjects are asked to rate the amount of pain they have experienced with activity (walking, climbing stairs) for the past week by placing a slash through a 100mm line, which bests describes the pain when 0 is no pain and 100 is worst pain imaginable. Study personnel will measure where the subject placed the mark and transcribe this on an eCRF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Modified Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete the Modified Knee Score pre-operatively and at each follow-up visit. The Modified Knee Score is a validated questionnaire composed of 4 questions to evaluate pain and function primarily before and after knee arthroplasty. The score is based on a maximum 100 points with Excellent = 85-100; Good = 70-84; Fair = 60-69; Poor = &lt;60</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in IKDC</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC Questionnaire is a subjective scale that provides patients with an overall function score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. A score of zero is the lowest level of function or highest level of symptoms to 100, highest level of function and lowest level of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maintenance or improvement in usage (i.e., reduction in usage) of NSAIDs, narcotics, anti-inflammatory medications</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked pre-operatively what medications are taken as part of their knee treatment and at each follow-up visit, medications taken or currently taking as part of their recovery</description>
