  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether attention bias modification training is an
      effective neurobehavioral therapy to improve depressive symptoms.That is whether attention
      bias modification training is superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms over 1 year
      after training.

    <textblock>
      Attentional bias has been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of
      depression. Attentional bias modification training (ABMT), an experimental paradigm that uses
      training to induce adaptive attentional bias, was developed to test the causal model and this
      has therapeutic implications in depression.To test the effect of ABMT on treatment of
      depressive symptoms, a randomized, double-blind, placebo and blank controlled trial is
      conducted in college students who are experiencing mild-to-severe symptoms of depression.

    <measure>Depressive Symptoms Measured by Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>From the baseline to posttraining, 2-, 4-, 8-week, 3-, 7-month follow-ups after training</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II) contains 21 items and rates the depressive symptoms for the past two weeks. Each question provides for a response of 0 to 3. A zero response means the depressive symptom is not present; a 1 means the symptom is present, a 2 means the symptom is moderate, and a 3 means the symptom is severe. The total BDI-II score is the sum of the individual items; total BDI-II scores can range from 0 to 63. Cutoff points developed by Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown (1997) for the total BDI-II are: 0 to 13, nondepressed; 14 to 19, mild depression; 20 to 28, moderate depression; 29 or more, severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety and Rumination Symptoms Measured by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait(STAI-T) and Rumination Response Style（RRS）</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-training, 2-, 4-, 8-week, 3- , 7-month follow-ups after training</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T) measures the anxiety symptoms of the individuals who often feel.It consists of 20 items and each question provides for a response of 1 to 4. A 1 response means the anxiety symptom is not present; a 2 means the symptom is present but a little, a 3 means the symptom is usually present, and a 4 means the symptom lasts all the time. The total STAI-T score is the sum of the individual items; total STAI-T scores can range from 20 to 80. The higher values represent a worse outcome.
The RRS measures ruminative responses to depressed mood. The content of the items is related to depressive cognitions and their possible causes and consequences. The scale consists of 21items and each question provides for a response of 1 to 4. The total RRS scores can range from 21 to 84. The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Attention bias modification training (ABMT) is a modified dot probe task, in which a probe always appears in the location of neutral stimulus after the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were simultaneously presented. In the ABMT,the probability that a probe appears in the location of neutral is 90%, and correspondingly,in the location of depressive stimuli is 10%.
ABMT intervention: Participants complete 8 sessions of attention bias modification training (ABMT) during a two-week period. Each session consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a training session is 12 minutes (4 sessions a week, roughly one session every other day with for each session).</description>

    <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of placebo training(PT) during a two-week period. Placebo training is a classic dot probe task, in which a probe appears after either of the locations that the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were presented, with the same frequencies. In the PT condition, each session also consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a PT session is approximately 10 minutes as well.</description>

        <title>Depressive Symptoms Measured by Beck Depression Inventory-II</title>
        <description>Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II) contains 21 items and rates the depressive symptoms for the past two weeks. Each question provides for a response of 0 to 3. A zero response means the depressive symptom is not present; a 1 means the symptom is present, a 2 means the symptom is moderate, and a 3 means the symptom is severe. The total BDI-II score is the sum of the individual items; total BDI-II scores can range from 0 to 63. Cutoff points developed by Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown (1997) for the total BDI-II are: 0 to 13, nondepressed; 14 to 19, mild depression; 20 to 28, moderate depression; 29 or more, severe depression.</description>

Participants complete 8 sessions of attention bias modification training (ABMT) during a two-week period. Each session consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a training session is 12 minutes (4 sessions a week, roughly one session every other day with for each session).</description>

        <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T) measures the anxiety symptoms of the individuals who often feel.It consists of 20 items and each question provides for a response of 1 to 4. A 1 response means the anxiety symptom is not present; a 2 means the symptom is present but a little, a 3 means the symptom is usually present, and a 4 means the symptom lasts all the time. The total STAI-T score is the sum of the individual items; total STAI-T scores can range from 20 to 80. The higher values represent a worse outcome.
The RRS measures ruminative responses to depressed mood. The content of the items is related to depressive cognitions and their possible causes and consequences. The scale consists of 21items and each question provides for a response of 1 to 4. The total RRS scores can range from 21 to 84. The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Attentional Bias Modification Training</title>
          <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of attention bias modification training (ABMT) during a two-week period. Each session consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a training session is 12 minutes (4 sessions a week, roughly one session every other day with for each session).</description>

          <title>Placebo Training</title>
          <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of placebo training(PT) during a two-week period. Placebo training is a classic dot probe task, in which a probe appears after either of the locations that the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were presented, with the same frequencies. In the PT condition, each session also consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a PT session is approximately 10 minutes as well.</description>
