      Title: Evaluating New Radiation Techniques for Cardiovascular Imaging

      Background:

      - Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans involve the use of radiation to
      create the pictures. Heart and blood vessel CT scans can cause high radiation exposure.
      Different methods of creating CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose.
      Researchers want to see how effective these new methods are in producing accurate CT scans.

      Objectives:

      - To study new ways of taking pictures of the heart or blood vessels using computed
      tomography.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years of age who will be having imaging studies to help detect heart or
      blood vessel problems.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be taken to check kidney function.

        -  Participants will have a CT scan of the heart and blood vessels. A contrast agent may be
           used to improve the quality of the images. The scanning session may last up to 2 hours.

        -  Participants will have follow-up contact 90 days after the scan, and then yearly contact
           for the next 5 years.

      Cardiac CT angiography is associated with radiation exposure. Different methods of creating
      CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose to the subject. The purpose of
      this research study is to learn whether these new imaging methods are accurate or predict
      subject outcomes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Clinical indication for a coronary CT angiography exam

               2. Age equal to or greater than 18 years

               3. Able to understand and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form

               4. Able and willing to provide follow-up information

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Pregnancy

          2. Severe renal excretory dysfunction, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30
             mL/min/1.73m2 body surface area according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
             criteria or as reported by the clinical lab. Glomerular filtration rate will be
             estimated using the MDRD 2005 revised study formula: eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 x
             (standardized serum creatinine)-1.154 x (age)-0.203 x 0.742 (if the subject is female)
             or x 1.212 (if the subject is black)
