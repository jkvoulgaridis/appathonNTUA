  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project allows for the systematic collection and analysis of long-term follow-up
      clinical parameters in children who have received a stem cell transplant. The data collected
      will assist in determining appropriate intervention and treatment plans for patients enrolled
      on this study. In addition, future patients may benefit by having the ability to anticipate
      problems and develop methods of prevention or early intervention.

      Primary Objective: Implement long-term follow-up guidelines for children, adolescents and
      young adults who are survivors of HSCT while establishing a database which captures the
      survivor's lifetime care.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Collect evidence-based data through a structured framework of periodic physical
           examination, laboratory and medical tests to monitor late effects in our HSCT survivors.

        -  Establish standards of care for late effects of therapy post HSCT for malignant and
           non-malignant diagnoses.

        -  Provide early identification and intervention towards recognized problems, as well as
           consistent education to foster a healthy lifestyle to all survivors.

        -  Collect blood and tissue samples to study immune reconstitution of all immune cell types
           and learn more about immune reconstitution and its affect on post-HSCT complications and
           disease free survival.

             transplant (HSCT) for any condition.

          -  Participant may have had a HSCT in another institution than Lucile Packard Children's
             Hospital (LPCH) yet has transferred follow-up long-term care to our institution and is
             being seen through the late-effects clinic from the Pediatric HSCT program.

          -  Participant AND/OR parent/legally authorized representative is able to provide written
             informed consent and assent (as applicable) for participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has relapsed from a malignant diagnosis post HSCT and is not being
