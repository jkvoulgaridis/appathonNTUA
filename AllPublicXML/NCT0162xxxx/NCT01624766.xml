  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of everolimus when given together
      with anakinra or denosumab in treating participants with cancers that have spread to other
      places in the body and have come back or aren't responding to treatment. Everolimus may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Anakinra is
      designated to block a protein that is involved in tumor development, new blood vessels
      growing, and the spread of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as denosumab, may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving everolimus and anakinra or
      denosumab may work better in treating participants with advanced cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      anakinra or denosumab in combination with everolimus in patients with advanced cancers who
      progressed on standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminary assessment of antitumor efficacy of anakinra or denosumab in combination with
      everolimus in patients with advanced cancers.

      II. Assessment of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of anakinra or denosumab in combination
      with everolimus.

      III. Preliminary assessment of biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive everolimus orally (PO) daily and anakinra subcutaneously (SC)
      daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive everolimus PO daily on days 1-28 and denosumab SC on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days.
