  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial collects medical information from patients with head and neck cancer that have
      received or are scheduled to receive proton therapy. Collecting and analyzing medical
      information from patients may provide information on the outcomes and treatment related side
      effects of proton therapy for head and neck cancer and help doctors improve therapy for
      future patients with head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the outcomes in patients who have received treatment for their head and neck
      malignancy with proton radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires over 30 minutes before treatment begins, at each visit
      during treatment, and again at all follow-up visits related to treatment. Patients also have
      their medical records reviewed.

    <description>Chart analysis performed on all patients documented to have head and neck cancer treated with proton therapy from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2014. Overall survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression used to explore predictors of time-to-event outcomes. Mann-Whitney test used to compare continuous parameters between temporal cohorts.</description>
