      This phase II trial studies methylprednisolone, horse anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine,
      filgrastim, and/or pegfilgrastim or pegfilgrastim biosimilar in treating patients with
      aplastic anemia or low or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Horse anti-thymocyte
      globulin is made from horse blood and targets immune cells known as T-lymphocytes. Since
      T-lymphocytes are believed to be involved in causing low blood counts in aplastic anemia and
      in some cases of myelodysplastic syndromes, killing these cells may help treat the disease.
      Methylprednisolone and cyclosporine work to suppress immune cells called lymphocytes. This
      may help to improve low blood counts in aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.
      Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are designed to cause white blood cells to grow. This may help
      to fight infections and help improve the white blood cell count. Giving methylprednisolone
      and horse anti-thymocyte globulin together with cyclosporine, filgrastim, and/or
      pegfilgrastim may be an effective treatment for patients with aplastic anemia or
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hATG (horse anti-thymocyte globulin),
      methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and GCSF (filgrastim) in achieving response (complete
      response [CR], partial response [PR], or hematologic improvement [HI]) in patients with
      aplastic anemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and toxicities of the combination of hATG,
      methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and GCSF in patients with aplastic anemia, or MDS. II. To
      assess time to response, response duration, and overall survival of patients with aplastic
      anemia, or MDS being treated with the combination of hATG, methylprednisolone, cyclosporine,
      and GCSF.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive methylprednisolone intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on days 1-4 and IV or
      orally (PO) with taper over days 5-30. Patients also receive horse anti-thymocyte globulin IV
      over 8 hours daily on days 1-4, cyclosporine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-180, and
      pegfilgrastim or pegfilgrastim biosimilar subcutaneously (SC) on day 5 and/or filgrastim SC
      beginning on day 5 and continuing until absolute neutrophil count recovers. Treatment
      continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the component medications
