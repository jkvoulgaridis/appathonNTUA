        <title>Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) as Measured by Medians in Percent Positive CD8 and Positive CD4 at Baseline and On-treatment Biopsy, Both Using the Mosaic Singleplex IHC Assay</title>
        <description>Biomarkers examined were percent positive CD8 and percent positive CD4, both using the Mosaic Singleplex IHC assay. Analyses are presented with the medians at baseline and on-treatment, rather than the median change because the baseline values differed across groups. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value on or prior to the first dose of study therapy. Biopsies were also collected on treatment.</description>

        <title>Antitumor Activity of Nivolumab and Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab as Measured by the Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized subjects in the population of interest (eg, all treated subjects or response-evaluable subjects). The BOR was defined as the subject's best response designation, over the study as a whole, recorded between the date of first study drug administration and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.1, with subsequent confirmation, or date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurred first in the study.</description>
        <time_frame>Approximately every 8 weeks until disease progression and in follow-up if no progression</time_frame>

        <title>Association Between Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Clinical Efficacy Measures Such as Objective Response Rate (PD-L1 ORR)</title>
        <description>For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels &gt;= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. The association between PD-L1 expression status and/or level and clinical efficacy measures was assessed. The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized subjects in the population of interest (all response-evaluable participants).</description>

        <title>Association Between Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Clinical Efficacy Measures Such as the Duration of Response (PD-L1 DOR)</title>
        <description>For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels &gt;= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. The association between PD-L1 expression status and/or level and clinical efficacy measures was assessed. Median duration of response (mDOR) was calculated for all response-evaluable participants with best overall response of CR or PR only, and is defined as time between the date of first documented objective response and the date of the first subsequent disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, if death occurred within 100 days after last dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Association Between Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Clinical Efficacy Measures Such as Progression Free Survival (PD-L1 PFS)</title>
        <description>For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels &gt;= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. The association between PD-L1 expression status and/or level and clinical efficacy measures was assessed. The progression free survival rate (PFSR) for a subject was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, if death occurred within 100 days after last dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Association Between Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Clinical Efficacy Measures Such as Overall Survival Rate (PD-L1 OSR)</title>
        <description>For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels &gt;= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. The association between PD-L1 expression status and/or level and clinical efficacy measures was assessed. The overall survival rate (OSR) for a subject was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of death for any cause. A subject who had not died was censored at last known date alive</description>

        <title>Antitumor Activity of Nivolumab and Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab as Measured by the Overall Survival Rate (OSR)</title>
        <description>The proportion of subjects surviving to time t, where t is a specific length of time, eg, 12 months, which was determined by the available data for final analysis and was documented in the DPP. The proportion was calculated by the product-limit method (Kaplan-Meier estimate), which takes into account censored data. The overall survival rate (OSR) for a subject was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of death for any cause. A subject who had not died was censored at last known date alive</description>
