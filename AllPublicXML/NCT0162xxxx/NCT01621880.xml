      Bevacizumab may have a better effect on brain necrosis caused by radiotherapy.This randomized
      trial aims to investigate whether bevacizumab may alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis
      in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The effect will be compared with outcomes in
      patients receiving steroid therapy.

    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced brain necrosis is a severe complication of radiotherapy in patients with
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Current neuroprotective therapies show limited benefit in
      ameliorating this complication of radiotherapy. This study is a randomized, single blind
      clinical study. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab can
      alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to
      compare the treating effect between bevacizumab and steroid.

    <description>The primary outcome of the trial was the treatment response rate at two months. The definitions of response and progressive disease were based on both the radiographic changes and clinical symptoms. We defined response as both (1)a reduction in edema volume on FLAIR images by ≥25% and (2)no deteriorating symptoms. Progressive disease was defined as either (1)larger than 10% increase in the volume of the lesions; (2)appearance of any new lesion/site; or (3)clear clinical worsening.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change in Radiological Measures of Lesion Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to evaluation at 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>T1 post-gadolinium imaging was used to measure the enhancement and T2-weighted FLAIR to measure the edema. For lesion measurements, radiologists used manual and semiautomatic approaches to identify the outline of the lesion, and the total volume was estimated with Volume Viewer 2 software(GE Healthcare, AW Suite2.0 6.5.1.z).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have received radiotherapy for histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal
             carcinoma.

          -  Prior irradiation &gt;/= 6 months prior to study entry.

             without tumor recurrence.

          -  Age&gt;/= 18 years. Because on dosing or adverse event data are currently not available
             on the use of bevacizumab in patients &lt;18years old.

          -  No prior bevacizumab therapy.

             inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia; 5) Significant vascular disease (e.g.
             aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection); 6) Clinically significant peripheral
             vascular disease; 7) severe infection.

        <title>Number of Participants With a Treatment Response</title>
        <description>The primary outcome of the trial was the treatment response rate at two months. The definitions of response and progressive disease were based on both the radiographic changes and clinical symptoms. We defined response as both (1)a reduction in edema volume on FLAIR images by ≥25% and (2)no deteriorating symptoms. Progressive disease was defined as either (1)larger than 10% increase in the volume of the lesions; (2)appearance of any new lesion/site; or (3)clear clinical worsening.</description>
