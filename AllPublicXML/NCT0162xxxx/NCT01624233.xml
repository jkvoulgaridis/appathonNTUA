    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving ≥75% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (Efficacy of Ixekizumab in Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis. Measure: PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week (Wk) 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored by itself and the scores were then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Wk 12; Baseline, Wk 24; Baseline, Wk 52</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fingernail unit. The fingernail is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants in matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, then the sum of all fingernails equals the total NAPSI score with a range from range 0 to 80. Higher scores indicated more severe psoriasis.</description>

          <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Total Score</title>
          <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0(no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored by itself and the scores were then combined for the final PASI. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

          <title>Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Total Score</title>
          <description>The NAPSI scale evaluates Ps severity in the fingernail bed and fingernail matrix with each divided into quadrants. Scores range from 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in all 4 quadrants), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of Ps in each quadrant of the fingernail bed or matrix. NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores from each quadrant of the fingernail bed and fingernail matrix (maximum of 8). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of all fingernails and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate more severe Ps.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</title>
        <description>The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fingernail unit. The fingernail is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants in matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, then the sum of all fingernails equals the total NAPSI score with a range from range 0 to 80. Higher scores indicated more severe psoriasis.</description>

        <description>QIDS-SR16 is a participant-administered, 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. A participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days and rate each on a 4-point scale: 0 (best) to 3 (worst). The sum of the 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains [sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance (initial, middle and late insomnia or hypersomnia), decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and psychomotor agitation/retardation] to give a single total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Reported 16 Items (QIDS-SR16) Score [Quality of Life and Outcome Assessments. Measures: Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)]</title>
          <description>QIDS-SR16 is a participant-administered, 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. A participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days and rate each on a 4-point scale: 0 (best) to 3 (worst). The sum of the 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains [sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance (initial, middle and late insomnia or hypersomnia), decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and psychomotor agitation/retardation] to give a single total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
          <population>Participants with Plaque Ps who had QIDS-SR16 at baseline and at least 1 post-dose result. Participants with missing QIDS-SR16 at Wks 12 and 52 were imputed by LOCF.</population>

        <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling, with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored by itself and the scores were then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in NAPSI</title>
        <description>The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fingernail unit. The fingernail is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants in matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, then the sum of all the fingernails equals the total NAPSI score with a range 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate more severe psoriasis.</description>

        <description>QIDS-SR16 is a participant-administered, 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. A participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days and rate each on a 4-point scale: 0 (best) to 3 (worst) scale. The sum of the 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains [sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance (initial, middle and late insomnia or hypersomnia), decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and psychomotor agitation/retardation] give a single total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
