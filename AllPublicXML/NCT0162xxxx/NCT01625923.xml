  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by impaired gastric emptying in the absence of
      obstruction in the proximal GI tract. It is a common condition affecting up to 5 million
      persons in the United States alone. Despite this, metoclopramide is currently the only FDA
      approved medication for the treatment of gastroparesis. However, the evidence supporting
      metoclopramide in gastroparesis is fairly weak and was recently issued a black box warning
      because of potential irreversible side effects. There is clearly an urgent need for newer
      therapeutic options with better efficacy and tolerability. Olanzapine is a second generation
      anti-psychotic that is currently FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar
      disorder. Because of actions at several receptors throughout the body, including dopamine and
      serotonin receptors, Olanzapine may provide anti-nausea and pro-motility effects in the
      stomach. Long-term use of olanzapine may also increase plasma levels of ghrelin. Ghrelin is a
      hormone produced by the gut that stimulates appetite and has also been shown to have
      beneficial effects on gastroparesis. The investigators hypothesize that olanzapine will be
      effective and safe in controlling symptoms as well as stimulate appetite and weight gain in
      gastroparesis. The investigators also hypothesize that olanzapine will stimulate gastric
      motility. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that olanzapine will modulate the secretion
      of ghrelin in gastroparesis. This pilot study may provide further information on the efficacy
      and safety of olanzapine in gastroparesis which could be utilized in a larger randomized,
      prospective study in the future.

    <description>Subjects will initially start on olanzapine 2.5 mg per mouth daily. Subjects will return on days 7 and 14 to determine response to medication and medication dose can be increased to 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on incomplete symptom response (mean change GCSI-DD &lt; 0.5).

Olanzapine: Subjects will initially start on olanzapine 2.5 mg per mouth daily. Subjects will return on days 7 and 14 to determine response to medication and medication dose can be increased to 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on incomplete symptom response (mean change GCSI-DD &lt; 0.5). The total dose of olanzapine will not exceed 10 mg daily during this study and subjects will continue on treatment for a total of 8 weeks.</description>
