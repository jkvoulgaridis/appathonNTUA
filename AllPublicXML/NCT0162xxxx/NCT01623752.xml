  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known from the COMET-trial that patients who start Enbrel treatment early have a great
      chance of reaching clinical remission and radiographic nonprogression. It is still unclear,
      however, how many patients with early arthritis achieve remission and radiographic
      nonprogression under the conditions of routine rheumatologic care and the local
      recommendations of Enbrel treatment (pre-treatment of at least 2 DMARDs, one of them MTX).

      Therefore, no robust x-ray data are available to show/demonstrate

        -  the average extent of x-ray damage in routine patients on Enbrel outside clinical
           studies.

        -  if the outstanding effect on structural damage of Enbrel can be reproduced in routine
           practice.

        -  that the 'Silent Progressor' is an issue relevant not only in clinical trials, but also
           for day-to-day decision making.

        -  the optimal onset of Enbrel treatment in the course of the disease to prevent
           radiographic damage

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 156</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events. AEs were classified according to the severity in 3 categories a)mild: AEs not interfered with participant's usual function b)moderate: AEs interfered to some extent with participant's usual function c)severe: AEs interfered significantly with participant's usual function. Participants may be counted in more than 1 category.</description>

        <description>To assess radiological damage mTSS score was used in participants with rheumatoid arthritis and mTSS adapted score was used in participants with psoriatic arthritis. Radiographs of the hands and feet were assessed by central raters. Total mTSS score range was 0 (no radiological damage) to 448 (extreme radiological damage); and total mTSS adapted score range was 0 (no radiological damage) to 528 (extreme radiological damage), where higher mTSS and mTSS adapted scores indicate a worse health status in participants with rheumatoid arthritis and participants with psoriatic arthritis, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde Total Modified Total Sharp Score or Adapted mTSS at the End of Phase 2 (Week 156): EAS</title>
        <description>To assess radiological damage, mTSS score was used in participants with rheumatoid arthritis and mTSS adapted score was used in participants with psoriatic arthritis. Radiographs of the hands and feet were assessed by central raters. Total mTSS score range was 0 (no radiological damage) to 448 (extreme radiological damage); and total mTSS adapted score range was 0 (no radiological damage) to 528 (extreme radiological damage), where higher mTSS and mTSS adapted scores indicate a worse health status in participants with rheumatoid arthritis and participants with psoriatic arthritis, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Erosion Score at End of Phase 1 (Week 78) and Phase 2 (Week 156)</title>
        <description>Total erosion score as per van der Hejde method consisted of 2 dimensions: a) hands (32 erosion locations, each location graded from 0 [no erosion] to 5 [maximum severity], sum of grading of each location resulted in score of 0 to 160); and b) feet (12 erosion locations, each location graded from 0 [no erosion] to 10 [maximum severity], sum of grading of each location resulted in score of 0 to 120). Sum of erosion scores of hand (0 to 160) and feet (0 to 120) gave a total erosion score as 0 to 280, where 0 was no erosion at all and 280 was worst possible condition, higher scores indicated severe joint destruction.</description>

        <description>FFbH is a self-administered patient questionnaire composed by 18 questions on functional ability in activities of daily living. Each question was answered by the participant as &quot;Yes, I can perform the activity without difficulty&quot; (score assigned =2), &quot;Yes, but with difficulties&quot; (score assigned =1) and &quot;No or only with external help&quot; (score assigned =0). Final FFbH score (%) was then computed according to formula: (Sum of scores*100) divided by (2*number of valid answers), ranging between 0 (no functional capacity) to 100 (full functional capacity); higher scores indicate better daily activities. FFbH functional remission was defined as FFbH functional capacity of &gt;= 83%.</description>

        <description>DAS28 was calculated from swollen joint count and tender joint count using 28 joint count, C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligram per liter (mg/L) and participant global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (good condition) to 100 (worst condition), where higher scores indicate worse health condition). DAS28 total score range: 0 (no disease activity) to 9.4 (maximum disease activity), higher score indicates more disease activity. DAS-28 score of 2.6 to 3.2= low, 3.2 to 5.1= moderate and &gt;5.1= high disease activity. DAS-28 score of &lt;2.6= disease remission. DAS28-4(CRP) = (0.56*sqrt[TJC28] + 0.28*sqrt[SJC28] + 0.36*ln[CRP+1]) + 0.014*GH + 0.96) and DAS28-4(ESR) = (0.56*sqrt[TJC28] + 0.28*sqrt[SJC28] + 0.70*ln[ESR] + 0.014*GH), where sqrt = square root, ln = natural logarithm.</description>

        <description>CDAI was calculated from tender and swollen joints using 28 joint count, participant global assessment (PtGA) and physician global assessment (PhyGA). PtGA and PhyGA both were assessed on 0-100 mm VAS scale, where higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity. CDAI total score ranged from 0 to 76, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity. CDAI score of &lt;=10 indicates low disease activity and a score of &lt;= 2.8 indicates remission.</description>

            <description>Participants with rheumatoid arthritis, who were on Etanercept routine treatment (as per the requirements of the labelling of Enbrel in Germany; dosage and duration of therapy was determined by the physician to meet the participants' individual needs for treatment), were observed for safety and radiological efficacy up to Week 156. During Phase 1 participants were followed up after every 13 weeks up to Week 78 and during Phase 2 participants were followed up after every 16 weeks from Week 78 till Week 156.</description>

        <description>SDAI was calculated from tender and swollen joints using 28 joint count, participant global assessment (PtGA), physician global assessment and (PhyGA) and CRP (in mg/L). PtGA and PhyGA both were assessed on 0-100 mm VAS scale, where higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity. SDAI total score ranged from 0 to 86, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity. SDAI score of &lt;=11 indicates low disease activity and a score of &lt;=3.3 indicates remission.</description>

            <title>Participants With Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
            <description>Participants with rheumatoid arthritis, who were on Etanercept routine treatment (as per the requirements of the labelling of Enbrel in Germany; dosage and duration of therapy was determined by the physician to meet the participants' individual needs for treatment), were observed for safety and radiological efficacy up to Week 156. During Phase 1 participants were followed up after every 13 weeks up to Week 78 and during Phase 2 participants were followed up after every 16 weeks from Week 78 till Week 156.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Rheumatoid Arthritis, With Low Disease Activity Based on Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI)</title>
          <description>CDAI was calculated from tender and swollen joints using 28 joint count, PtGA and PhyGA. CDAI total score ranged from 0 to 76, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity. CDAI score of &lt;=10 indicates low disease activity and a score of &lt;= 2.8 indicates remission. SDAI was calculated from tender and swollen joints using 28 joint count, PtGA, PhyGA and CRP (in mg/L). SDAI total score ranged from 0 to 86, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity. SDAI score of &lt;=11 indicates low disease activity and a score of &lt;=3.3 indicates remission. PtGA and PhyGA both were assessed on 0-100 mm VAS scale, where higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity.</description>

        <description>CDAI was calculated from tender and swollen joints using 28 joint count, PtGA and PhyGA. CDAI total score ranged from 0 to 76, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity. CDAI score of &lt;=10 indicates low disease activity and a score of &lt;= 2.8 indicates remission. SDAI was calculated from tender and swollen joints using 28 joint count, PtGA, PhyGA and CRP (in mg/L). SDAI total score ranged from 0 to 86, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity. SDAI score of &lt;=11 indicates low disease activity and a score of &lt;=3.3 indicates remission. PtGA and PhyGA both were assessed on 0-100 mm VAS scale, where higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity.</description>

            <description>Participants with rheumatoid arthritis, who were on Etanercept routine treatment (as per the requirements of the labelling of Enbrel in Germany; dosage and duration of therapy was determined by the physician to meet the participants' individual needs for treatment), were observed for safety and radiological efficacy up to Week 156. During Phase 1 participants were followed up after every 13 weeks up to Week 78 and during Phase 2 participants were followed up after every 16 weeks from Week 78 till Week 156.</description>

        <description>In this outcome number of participants who participated or not participated in RUDI and PIT and impact of their participation in quality of life parameters using EQ-5D health questionnaire is reported. For participants whom data was not recorded is reported under category &quot;No Data&quot;. EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess generic health status in two parts: single utility score and visual analog scale. For utility score, participants rated their current health state on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression with each dimension having three levels of function: 1 indicates no problem; 2 indicates some problem; 3 indicates extreme problem.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events. AEs were classified according to the severity in 3 categories a)mild: AEs not interfered with participant's usual function b)moderate: AEs interfered to some extent with participant's usual function c)severe: AEs interfered significantly with participant's usual function. Participants may be counted in more than 1 category.</description>
