  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if exemestane and everolimus combined
      with metformin can help to control breast cancer in patients who are obese or overweight and
      post-menopausal with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts
      of the body.

      Exemestane is designed to decrease the ability of estrogen to help cancer cells grow. This
      could cause the cancer cells to die.

      Metformin is commonly used to control blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. It is
      designed to lower insulin levels, which may slow or stop the growth of breast cancer cells.

      Everolimus is designed to block cells from dividing. This may cause cancer cells to die.
      Everolimus may also stop the growth of new blood vessels that help tumors grow.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take an exemestane and
      everolimus tablet by mouth every day. You will also take tablets of metformin by mouth 2
      times a day. The drugs should be taken at about the same time each day.

      The study drugs will be given in 28-day cycles.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may have taken or may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for blood sugar tests. If you have a history of
           diabetes, you will need to fast for 8 hours before these blood sugar tests.

      At Weeks 4 and 12:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may have taken or may be taking.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for blood sugar tests. If you have a history of
           diabetes, you will need to fast for 8 hours before these blood sugar tests.

      At Weeks 8, 16 and then every 2 months after that, and after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may have taken or may be taking.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing (at weeks 8, 16 and 24
           only).

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for blood sugar tests. If you have a history of
           diabetes, you will need to fast for 8 hours before these blood sugar tests.

        -  You will have imaging scans to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      This is an investigational study. Exemestane is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Metformin is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of diabetes. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially
      available to treat metastatic breast cancer, advanced kidney cancer in some patients and a
      certain type of brain tumor. The use of this drug combination is investigational.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

For patients with a best overall response of CR or PR, the duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR to the time of disease progression. Data on the DOR and PFS were censored at the time of a patient's removal from the study. For patients with a best overall response of SD (non-CR/non-PD for patients without measurable disease),the duration of SD (non-CR/non-PD for patients without measurable disease) was defined as the time from study enrollment to the time of disease progression.</description>
