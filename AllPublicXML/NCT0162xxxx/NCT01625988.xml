      The study is comprised of 4 trial periods:

        1. Screening and washout (5-45 days)

        2. Baseline for assessment of the type, frequency, and severity of headaches (28-38 days)

        3. Treatment (12 weeks)

        4. Follow-up (12 weeks)

    <description>The criteria for a migraine headache was adapted from the standard International Headache Society (IHS) International Classification of Headache Disorders II guidelines 1.1 and 1.2 (ICHD-II, Cephalgia 2004). The definition of a migraine headache was a headache with or without aura, of ≥30 minutes (min) duration, and with both (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) required features from the IHS ICHD-II definition. Required feature &quot;A&quot; includes at least 2 of the following headache characteristics: unilateral location, pulsatile quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, or aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity. Required feature &quot;B&quot; includes at least 1 of the following during the headache: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Least square (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline value, treatment, month, and treatment-by-month interaction as fixed effects and participant as random effect.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of calendar days on which a headache lasts ≥4 hours which includes migraines, probable migraines (PM) and nonmigraines. Criteria for migraine headache (MH) was adapted from standard IHS ICHD-II guidelines 1.1 and 1.2 (Cephalgia 2004). Definition of MH was headache with or without aura, of ≥30 min duration, and with both (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) required features from IHS ICHD-II definition. Required feature &quot;A&quot; includes ≥2 of following headache characteristics: unilateral location, pulsatile quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, or aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity. Required feature &quot;B&quot; includes at least 1 of following during headache: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. PM is headache with or without aura, but missing 1 feature needed to fulfill all criteria for MH. LS means were calculated using MMRM with baseline value, gender, treatment, month, and treatment-by-month interaction as fixed effects and participant as random effect.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine attack was defined as beginning on any day a migraine headache day was recorded and ending when a migraine headache-free day occurred. The criteria for a migraine headache was adapted from the standard IHS ICHD-II guidelines 1.1 and 1.2 (Cephalgia 2004). The definition of a migraine headache was a headache with or without aura, of ≥30 minutes duration, and with both (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) required features from the IHS ICHD-II definition. Required feature &quot;A&quot; includes at least 2 of the following headache characteristics: unilateral location, pulsatile quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, or aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity. Required feature &quot;B&quot; includes at least 1 of the following during the headache: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia.

The criteria for a migraine headache was adapted from the standard International Headache Society (IHS) International Classification of Headache Disorders II guidelines 1.1 and 1.2 (ICHD-II, Cephalgia 2004). The definition of a migraine headache was a headache with or without aura, of ≥30 minutes duration, and with both (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) required features from the IHS ICHD-II definition.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Number of Migraine Headache Days in the Last 28-day Period of the 12-week Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The criteria for a migraine headache was adapted from the standard International Headache Society (IHS) International Classification of Headache Disorders II guidelines 1.1 and 1.2 (ICHD-II, Cephalgia 2004). The definition of a migraine headache was a headache with or without aura, of ≥30 minutes (min) duration, and with both (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) required features from the IHS ICHD-II definition. Required feature &quot;A&quot; includes at least 2 of the following headache characteristics: unilateral location, pulsatile quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, or aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity. Required feature &quot;B&quot; includes at least 1 of the following during the headache: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Least square (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline value, treatment, month, and treatment-by-month interaction as fixed effects and participant as random effect.</description>
