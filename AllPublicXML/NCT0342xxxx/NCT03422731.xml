      This pilot clinical trial studies multi-modality imaging and collection of biospecimen
      samples in understanding bone marrow changes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      undergoing total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy. Using mutli-modality imaging and
      collecting biospecimen samples may help doctors know more about how TBI and chemotherapy can
      change the bone marrow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Temporal assessment of treatment impact on bone marrow. II. Relative assessment of bone
      marrow status between total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) and conventional TBI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      imaging with biological samples for cellularity/adiposity.

      II. Feasibility of fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      biomarker as a predictor of treatment response.

      III. Correlation of FLT PET imaging with biological correlate for leukemia. IV. Characterize
      relative distribution of leukemia in bone marrow (BM) environment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (TLMI+FLT/TMLI): Patients may undergo optional fluorothymidine F-18 PET scan over 2
      hours at baseline, on days 30 and 100, at 1 year, and at time of relapse. Patients undergo
      DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30 minutes at baseline, on days 30 and 100, at year 1, and
      at time of relapse. Patients also undergo collection of bone marrow and blood samples at
      baseline, on days 30 and 100, and at 1 year. Patients undergo fluorothymidine F-18 PET, DECT,
      and water-fat MRI as in TMLI+FLT.

      COHORT II (TBI): Patients undergo collection of bone marrow at baseline, day 30, time of
      relapse, and at 1 year.

    <description>A non-parametric smoothing plot will be produced in the first step to view changes in the trend. Measurements will be summarized by mean +/- standard deviation (SD) at each time point. Exploratory within subjects' correlation will be examined using Pearson correlation between adjacent time points. A random-effects model will also be used to investigate whether there is significant time trend. Will use a two-sample t-test for comparing bone marrow cellularity percentage at pre-HCT and 1-year post-HCT between the total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) group and total body irradiation (TBI) group (all cohorts). A paired t-test will also be carried out to examine if there is significant difference in changes of cellularity between these two groups.</description>

    <description>Changes in standardized uptake value (SUV) from fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging uptake will be described.
