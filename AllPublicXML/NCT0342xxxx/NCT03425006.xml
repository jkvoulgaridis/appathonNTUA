             NOTE: If sites chosen for biopsy were previously irradiated, there must be evidence of
             tumor growth/viable tumor as assessed by the investigator.

          -  6. At least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

          -  7. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  8. Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)

             creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR Measured or calculated creatinine
             clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≥50 mL/min for subject
             with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN; Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR
             Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN; AST (SGOT)
             and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases

          -  9. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control
             methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:
