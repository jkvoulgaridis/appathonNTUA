      This study is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the clinical and radiographic
      outcomes of ViBone in patients undergoing ACDF or lumbar interbody fusion. Data will be
      gathered for up to 50 subjects undergoing ACDF surgery and up to 50 subjects undergoing
      lumbar fusion surgery using ViBone. Total enrollment is expected to be approximately 100
      subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes in
      patients who undergo 1-3 level ACDF or lumbar interbody fusion surgery using ViBone. Subjects
      will be followed for 12 months following surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18-80 years of age

          -  For cervical cases - ACDF surgery at 1, 2, or 3 contiguous levels between C2-C7

          -  For lumbar cases - lumbar interbody fusion surgery at 1, 2, or 3 contiguous levels
             between L1-S1

          -  Patient signed Consent Form with HIPAA Authorization

          -  Appropriate candidate for surgery

          -  Patient will adhere to the scheduled follow-up visits and requirements of the protocol
             including routine patient exams - pre-operative, operative, and at least two post-
             operative visits (6 and 12 months post-surgery). Pre-operative and post-operative
             visits include X-ray (required) and CT scan (if available).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Long term use of medications that are known to inhibit fusion or bone metabolism or
             immune suppressants 6 months prior to surgery (i.e., steroids, chemotherapy, DMARDs,
             etc.)

          -  Treatment with radiotherapy

          -  Acute or chronic systemic or localized spinal infections

          -  Instability associated with major reconstructive surgery for primary tumors or
             metastatic malignant tumors of the cervical (for ACDF patients) or lumbar (for TLIF,
             PLIF, ALIF, or LLIF patients) spine

          -  Previous pseudoarthrosis at any level of the cervical (for ACDF patients) or lumbar
             (for

          -  TLIF, PLIF, ALIF, or LLIF patients) spine

          -  Nursing mothers or women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the course
             of the study

             (bone density score of ≤-2.5).

          -  Other medical or surgical conditions which would preclude the potential benefit of
             surgery, such as congenital abnormalities, immunosuppressive disease, elevation of
             sedimentation rate unexplained by other diseases, elevation of white blood count
             (WBC), or marked left shift in the WBC differential count.

          -  Active local or systemic infection or is undergoing adjunctive treatment for local or
             systemic infection.
