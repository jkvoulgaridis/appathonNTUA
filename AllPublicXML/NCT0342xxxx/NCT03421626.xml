      The objective of this study is to establish the performance of an assay that detects mRNA
      transcript levels in patients diagnosed with CML. The study is conducted at locations within
      the United States. Testing is performed on peripheral blood specimens provided by eligible
      enrolled patients. Results from this study will not be used for patient management decisions.
