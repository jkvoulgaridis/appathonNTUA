  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative anxiety usually lead to increased anesthetics during the surgery. The precise
      sedative requirement which can keep adequate sedative state and avoid adverse effects caused
      by excessive drugs still needs further study. Therefore, our purpose was to confirm the
      sedative effect of butorphanol and to explore the relationship between pre-operative anxiety
      and intra-operative butorphanol requirement to evaluate the precise sedative requirement
      which can keep adequate sedation for patients by pre-operative anxiety score.

      A total of 142 patients (aged 18-75 years) who were scheduled for elective low limb
      orthopedic procedures under spinal anesthesia were included in this study. Patients were
      divided into two groups based on pre-operative anxiety score evaluated by the Amsterdam
      pre-operative anxiety and information scale before the surgery. And intramuscular midazolam
      0.05mg/kg as a premedication in preoperative room was given to patients before shifting into
      operation room. Patients in each group were randomly divided into butorphanol group and 0.9%
      saline group. The sedation score, the duration of reaching adequate sedation state and
      postoperative recovery were recorded.

    <measure>preoperative anxiety score assessed by the Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale (APAIS)&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>before the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>evaluate the preoperative anxiety score before the surgery, APAIS contains 6 items rated on a five-point Likert scale, which represents two scales: anxiety (items 1, 2, 4, and 5) and need for information (items 3 and 6) Accordingly, the maximal score of the entire APAIS (APAIS-T) is 30 and the one expressing the patient's need for information (APAIS-I) is 10. The maximal score of the two items concerning anxiety about anesthesia (APAIS-A-An) and surgery (APAIS-A-Su) is also 10 each, resulting in a maximal score of 20 for total preoperative anxiety (APAIS-A-T). And APAIS-A-T &gt; 10 was used as a cut-oﬀ to deﬁne patients with high anxiety, the higher the score, the more serious the pre-operative anxiety is</description>
