    <measure>Trans epidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Trans epidermal water loss is an objective skin measurement that is measures the evaporation of water on the skin surface using a probe (DermaLab).The trans epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always aloss of water from the skin due to evaporation. When the skin barrier is damaged this evaporation of water increases. Thus, transepidermal water loss can be used to assess skin damage</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are currently receiving or have within the past 2 months received radio-and/or
             chemotherapy (low doses chemotherapy are allowed for other indications than cancer,
             e.g. below 15 mg methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis)

          2. Are currently receiving or have within the past month received topical steroid
             treatment in the peristomal skin area, e.g. lotion or spray. Systemic steroid
             treatment (e.g. injection, or tablet) are allowed.

          3. Are pregnant or breastfeeding

          4. Are participating in other interventional clinical investigations or have previously
             participated in this investigation 4.1. Exception: Participation in other Coloplast
             in-house clinical investigations are accepted under the circumstances that the subject
             has paused the activities in the investigation and are otherwise complying with the
             inclusion and exclusion criteria of this (CP264) protocol.

          5. Are currently suffering from peristomal skin problems i.e. bleeding and/or broken skin
             (assessed by the investigator)

          6. Have known hypersensitivity towards any of the products used in the investigation
