      A multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate Autonomic Regulation Therapy
      with the VITARIA system in patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection
      fraction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ANTHEM-HFrEF is a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial with an
      adaptive design. Patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced LVEF will be enrolled
      and randomized 2:1 to receive VITARIA system implantation on the right cervical vagus nerve
      in addition to stable guideline-directed medical therapy (therapy), or to continue receiving
      stable guideline-directed medical therapy alone (control arm).

      Subjects in the therapy arm will receive continuous, periodic VNS stimulation after surgery
      is completed, and will undergo visits for VNS up titration over a period of 3 months.
      Subjects in the control arm will also undergo scheduled visits at a similar frequency as the
      titration visits that are scheduled for subjects in the therapy arm. Data for safety and
      efficacy assessments will be collected for both study arms at 4 weeks post-randomization,
      every 3 months for the first 12 months, and every 4 months thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 or above

          2. Willing and capable of providing informed consent

          3. Capable of participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation

          4. Stable, guideline-directed medical therapy for at least 4 weeks before subject
             screening. Unrestricted changes in diuretics are allowed during the 4 weeks, as long
             as the subject remains on a diuretic. If the use of an ARNI is being contemplated for
             a study subject, ARNI should be administered, and GDMT optimized, before the subject
             is randomized. No more than a 100% increase or 50% decrease of the dosage of any
             medication other than a diuretic is permitted. For these medications, medication
             changes within a class are allowed, as long as the equivalent dosage is within these
             specified limits

          5. Stable symptomatic heart failure NYHA class III; or NYHA class II with a heart failure
             hospitalization in the previous 12 months. HF hospitalization may include an overnight
             hospital or hospital-based observation unit stay with a primary diagnosis of HF, or an
             emergency department visit with a primary diagnosis of HF, and will in either case
             include documentation of intravenous HF therapy administration or other intervention
             for HF

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) â‰¤ 35% and left ventricular end-diastolic
             diameter (LVEDD) &lt; 8.0 cm, as confirmed by the core echocardiography laboratory during
             screening

          7. N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) level of at least 800 pg/mL, as determined by the core
             laboratory; or NT-proBNP level of at least 1200 pg/mL, as determined by the core
             laboratory, for patients with permanent atrial fibrillation or reporting signs or
             symptoms of atrial fibrillation at the time that the NT-proBNP sample is drawn

          8. Received a standard cardiac assessment, including history, physical exam, and
             electrocardiogram, and determined by a heart failure cardiologist and study surgeon to
             be an appropriate candidate for the study's surgical procedure

          9. Physically capable and willing to perform repeated 6-minute walk tests associated with
             the study, and having a baseline distance of between 150 and 450 meters. Symptoms
             limiting the duration of the 6 minute walk test must be due primarily to heart failure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractory symptomatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg)

          2. Pacemaker therapy that utilizes unilateral ventricular pacing with a right ventricular
             lead for complete AV block

          3. Currently implanted vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device, baroreceptor activation
             therapy (BAT) device, other nerve stimulator, artificial or donor heart, or
             ventricular assist device (VAD)

          4. Heart failure of non-ischemic origin for less than 6 months, or due to congenital
             heart disease, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative cardiomyopathy
             (e.g. amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)

          5. Moderate (3+) or severe (4+) aortic valve or mitral valve stenosis; moderate (3+) or
             severe (4+) aortic valve insufficiency; or severe (4+) mitral valve insufficiency

          6. Symptomatic uncontrolled bradycardia

          7. Involvement in any concurrent clinical study with an investigational therapy
