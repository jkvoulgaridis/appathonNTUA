    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects of combination chemotherapy, total body
      irradiation, and donor blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with primary or
      secondary myelofibrosis. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, fludarabine
      phosphate, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and filgrastim work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving combination chemotherapy and total body
      irradiation before a donor blood stem cell transplant helps to stop the growth of cells in
      the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of reduced-intensity (FM) haploidentical
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (Haplo-HCT) followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide
      (PTCy) in patients with advanced myelofibrosis (MF), as assessed by the evaluation of
      toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To summarize and evaluate hematologic (neutrophil and platelet) recovery. II. To estimate
      graft failure-free survival (GFS) at 100-days post-transplant. III. To estimate overall
      survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and cumulative incidence (CI) of
      relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days, 1-year, and 2-year post
      transplant.

      IV. To estimate the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), grade
      II-IV, at 100-days post-transplant (per Keystone Consensus modification of the Glucksberg
      criteria).

      V. To estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD at 1-year and 2-year post transplant
      (per National Institute of Health [NIH] Consensus Criteria).

      VI. To characterize the severity and extent of acute and chronic GvHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5, fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2. Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) on
      day -1 and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) on day 0. Patients then receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 4. Beginning on day 5, patients receive
      tacrolimus IV continuously for approximately 2 weeks, then orally (PO) for 6 months followed
      by a taper, mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) until day 100, and filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) daily from day 7 until continued until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;
      1,500/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression
      or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24
      months.

             The Principal Investigator is the final arbiter for comorbidity;

          -  Patients can be in chronic phase (CP) with BM blast count &lt;/= 10% or after progression
             to AML and achieved &lt;/= 5% BM blasts (morphologic CR prior to transplant);

          -  Lack of an HLA matched donor or need to proceed fast to transplantation when a patient
             does not have an immediately available matched unrelated donor (typed by
             high-resolution in the registry);

          -  Performance status &gt;/=70% (Karnofsky); patients &gt; 50 years should have adequate

             Geriatrician/Neurologist;

          -  Adequate organ function: ALT/AST/billirubin &lt;/= 5X UNL, creatinine clearance &gt;
             50mls/min (calculated with Cockroft-Gault formula); LVEF &gt;/= 50%, DLCOc &gt;/= 50%;

          -  Prior treatment with JAK2 inhibitor therapy is not excluded. Patients on a JAK2
             inhibitor may continue through conditioning until Day -3 then tapered at the
             discretion of the investigator.

          -  Evidence of portal hypertension with varices, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy;

             progression to AML;

          -  HIV positive; active hepatitis B or C;

          -  Patients with active infections. The PI is the final arbiter of the eligibility;

          -  Liver cirrhosis;

          -  Prior CNS involvement by tumor cells;

          -  Severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT) (On echo or right side cardiac catheterization);

          -  History of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3
             years (the following are exempt from the 3-year limit: non-melanoma skin cancer, fully
             excised melanoma in situ [Stage 0], curatively treated localized prostate cancer, and
             cervical or breast carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on
             PAP smear);

          -  Positive Beta HCG test in a woman with child bearing potential defined as not
             post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization;

          -  Noncompliance - Inability or unwillingness to comply with medical recommendations
             regarding therapy or follow-up, including smoking tobacco. Smoking cessation is a
             standard teaching practice prior to admission for all patients undergoing stem cell
             transplant. Any patient who refuses to stop smoking prior to transplant will not be
             eligible for this study.
