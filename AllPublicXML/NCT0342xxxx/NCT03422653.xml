  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after each
      dialysis session. The study includes a 12-week Double-blind Phase and a 52-week Open-label
      Extension Phase.

  <detailed_description>

      Double-blind Phase The Double-blind Phase of the study will consist of a Screening Visit, a
      7-day Run-in Period, a 12 week Double-blind Treatment Period, and a 2-week Discontinuation
      Period. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.
      The Screening Visit will occur within 7 to 28 days prior to randomization to assess
      eligibility.

      Open-label Extension Phase Patients who received at least 30 doses of study drug (either
      active or placebo) during the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period and continue to meet
      other eligibility criteria will have the option to receive open label CR845 for an additional
      52 weeks. The Open-label Extension Phase will be comprised of the Open-label Treatment Period
      and the Follow-up Period.

      The last dose of open-label study drug will be administered at the last dialysis visit on
      Week 52, or Early Termination. A final safety Follow up Visit will be conducted 7-10 days
      after the End of Treatment/Early Termination Visit.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS used to indicate the intensity of the worst itching over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;worst itching imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in itch-related quality of life as assessed by the change from baseline in 5-D Itch Scale score at the end of Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Itch Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past 2 weeks. The questions cover five dimensions of itch including the degree, duration of itch/day, direction (improvement/worsening), disability (impact on activities such as work), and body distribution of itch. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in itch-related quality of life as assessed by the change from baseline in total Skindex-10 Scale score at the end of Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Skindex-10 Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past week. The questions cover 3 domains: disease, mood/emotional distress, and social functioning domain. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS used to indicate the intensity of the worst itching over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;worst itching imaginable&quot;.</description>

        To be eligible for inclusion into the Double-blind Phase of the study, a patient must meet
        the following criteria:

          -  Has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been on hemodialysis 3 times per week for
             at least 3 months prior to the start of screening;

          -  Has at least 2 single-pool Kt/V measurements ≥1.2, or at least 2 urea reduction ratio
             measurements ≥65%, or 1 single pool Kt/V measurement ≥1.2 and 1 urea reduction ratio
             measurement ≥65% on different dialysis days during the 3 months period prior to
             screening;
