  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies how well exercise intervention with or without
      internet-based cognitive behavior therapy works in reducing fatigue in participants with
      prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment. Exercise intervention and internet-based cognitive behavior
      therapy may help to improve feelings of tiredness in participants with prostate cancer.

      The study originally included both prostate cancer and breast cancer participants, but due to
      low accrual of breast cancer participants, the breast cancer cohort was closed and the study
      continued with prostate cancer participants only.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the change in fatigue as assessed with the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue 7a questionnaire with 12 weeks of exercise +
      internet-based intervention + usual care compared to exercise + usual care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the change in other patient-reported measures (e.g., insomnia, pain severity,
      physical function) as assessed with the PROMIS Profile 29 questionnaire with 12 weeks of
      exercise + internet-based intervention + usual care compared to exercise + usual care.

      II. To compare the change in activity level and associated parameters (e.g., graded exercise
      test) with 12 weeks of exercise + internet-based intervention + usual care compared to
      exercise + usual care.

      III. To examine associations between change in fatigue and change in activity level.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo POWER exercise intervention consisting of supervised exercise
      training sessions over 50 minutes every 7 days for a total of 12 sessions and 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity exercise weekly for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo POWER exercise intervention consisting of supervised exercise
      training sessions over 50 minutes every 7 days for a total of 12 sessions and 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity exercise weekly for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo PROSPECT
      internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention over 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 2 years.

    <description>Participant fatigue levels will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks,12 weeks, and 24 weeks using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue 7a questionnaire.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 weeks post intervention (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 Profile v2.0. This questionnaire assesses depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. Raw scores range from 4-20, with higher scores indicating lower quality of life in that area, except for the sleep disturbance sub-section, where higher scores indicate better sleep.</description>
