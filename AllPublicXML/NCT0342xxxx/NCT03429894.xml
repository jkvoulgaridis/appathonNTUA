    <textblock>
      The DynamX (Bioadaptor) study is a prospective, consecutive enrollment study designed to
      enroll up to 50 patients requiring treatment of a single, de novo lesion ≤ 24 mm in length
      located in a vessel ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter. All patients be followed clinically at
      30 days, 6 and 9 months, and 1, 2 and 3 years.

      All patients will undergo imaging (angiography and IVUS) follow-up with approximately
      one-half of the patients returning for follow up at 9 months and approximately one-half
      returning for follow up at 12 months.

      The DynamX (Bioadaptor) study is a prospective, consecutive enrollment study designed to
      enroll up to 50 patients requiring treatment of a single, de novo lesion ≤ 24 mm in length
      located in a vessel ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter. All patients be followed clinically at
      30 days, 6 and 9 months, and 1, 2 and 3 years.

      All patients will undergo imaging (angiography and IVUS) follow-up with approximately
      one-half of the patients returning for follow up at 9 months and approximately one-half
      returning for follow up at 12 months.

      At select centers, a subset of approximately 20 patients will undergo FFR pressure wire
      measurement at baseline and at follow-up (or at a minimum follow-up) in conjunction with the
      IVUS imaging, and will also undergo OCT imaging at 9 or 12 months.

      The primary safety endpoint is Target Lesion Failure at 6 months. TLF is a composite endpoint
      defined as cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically-indicated target lesion
      revascularization.

      The primary imaging/efficacy endpoints for those patients undergoing imaging follow-up is the
      change in mean in-device area and mean lumen area at 9 or 12 months compared to
      post-procedure as measured by IVUS.

      Co-primary imaging/efficacy endpoints for those patients undergoing imaging follow-up is late
      lumen loss as measured by QCA and IVUS at 9 or 12 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Patient is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment
             alternatives of receiving the DynamX Novolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (CSS) and
             he/she provides written informed consent, as approved by the appropriate Ethics
             Committee of the respective clinical site, prior to any clinical study related
             procedure.

          3. Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia, positive functional study or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes
             consistent with ischemia)

          4. Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery

          5. Patient must agree to undergo all clinical study required follow-up visits,
             angiograms, and IVUS testing

          6. Patient must agree not to participate in any other clinical study for a period of one
             year following the index procedure.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria - Target Lesion/Vessel

          1. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a nominal vessel
             diameter of ≥ 2.5 and ≤3.5 mm assessed visually or by online QCA

          2. Target lesion must measure ≤ 24 mm in length

          3. Target lesion must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis
             of ≥ 50% and &lt; 90% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 2

          4. The lesion must be successfully pre-dilated (less than 35% DS) prior to enrollment

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria - non-Target Lesion/Vessel Treatment

        1. Treatment of a single, non-target lesion located in a separate major epicardial vessel
        (defined as LAD with septal and diagonal branches, LCX with obtuse marginal and/or ramus
        intermedius branches and RCA and any of its branches) attempted during the index procedure
        must be completed first using an approved 'olimus drug eluting stent. The segment must be
        located such that any injury that might occur during intervention can be clearly
        attributable to the treated non-target vessel. If the procedure is deemed uncomplicated and
        optimal, treatment of the target lesion with the DynamX stent can be considered.

        Optimal lesion/vessel treatment defined as:

             polymers or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

         12. Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will
             require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel or other P2Y12 inhibitors.

             associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year)

         20. Patient is already participating in another clinical study which has not reached the
             primary endpoint (long-term follow-up is not an exclusion)
