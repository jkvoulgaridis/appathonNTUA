  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well ficlatuzumab with or without cetuximab work
      in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that has come back or spread
      to other places in the body and resistant to cetuximab treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as ficlatuzumab and cetuximab, may block growth signals that lets a tumor cell survive and
      reproduce, and helps the immune system recognize and fight head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of ficlatuzumab, with or without concurrent cetuximab, in patients
      with cetuximab-resistant, recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
      as measured by progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe toxicity and patient-reported quality of life. II. To evaluate response rate
      and overall survival in both treatment arms. III. To evaluate the relationship between
      clinical outcomes (PFS, response rate [RR]) and candidate tumoral, genomic, peripheral, and
      immune biomarkers, including: HGF/cMet, EGFR/EGFR, and EGFR/HER2 dimers; mutations in PIK3CA,
      PTEN, and HRAS; peripheral serum biomarkers including VeriStrat, HGF, soluble HGF, and IL6;
      peripheral lymphocyte populations; archived and baseline immune infiltrate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ficlatuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60 -120 minutes and ficlatuzumab IV over 30-60
      minutes every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

             setting.

          -  The patient is not an acceptable candidate for platinum chemotherapy due to medical
             comorbidities, in the judgment of the local investigator.
