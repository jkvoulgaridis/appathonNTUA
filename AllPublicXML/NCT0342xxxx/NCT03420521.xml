  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open-label design study looking at Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in patients
      with Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors. Patients will be dosed Nivoluma 240mg IV over 60 minutes
      every 2 weeks and Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV over 30 minutes every 6 weeks. Once cycle will include
      3 doses of Nivolumab and 1 dose of Ipilimumab. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      objective response rate of combination nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced,
      well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Durability of response, and PFS will also be
      described.

        Inclusion Criteria:

                  lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented
                  (radiographic) disease progression in that site after the completion of radiation
                  therapy.

               -  Prior therapy, including everolimus, octreotide, surgery, chemoradiation, is all
                  permitted after being properly noted. This prior therapy must have been completed
                  at least 28 days prior to study enrollment.
