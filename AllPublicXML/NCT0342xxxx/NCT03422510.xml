    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, randomized study investigating two dose titration regimens
      of CXA-10 in subjects at least 18 years of age with primary FSGS.

      The study will be performed at approximately 25 study centers across the United States of
      America (USA). The recruitment period is anticipated to be up to approximately 16 months.
      Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to ensure 26 subjects complete the study. An
      optional 9 month open label is available

      The study will be performed at approximately 25 study centers across the United States of
      America (USA). The recruitment period is anticipated to be up to approximately 16 months.
      Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized.

      Study participation for each subject will last up to 5 months. The study will consist of a
      screening period not to exceed 30 days (1 month), 90-day (3 month) treatment period, and an
      approximate 28-day (1 month) follow-up period after the last dose of study medication. An
      optional 9 month open label is available.

         24. Any other condition and/or situation that causes the Investigator to deem a subject
             unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to expected study medication non-compliance,
             inability to medically tolerate the study procedures, or a subject's unwillingness to
             comply with study-related procedures).

         25. The subject has known hypersensitivity to CXA-10, its metabolites, or formulation
             excipients.

         26. The subject has had treatment with any investigational drug or device within 30 days
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Screening (Visit 1) (this includes
             investigational formulations of marketed products, inhaled and topical drugs), or
