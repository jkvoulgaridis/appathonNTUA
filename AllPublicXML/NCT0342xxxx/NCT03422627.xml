          -  Steroid refractory cGVHD, defined as having persistent signs and symptoms of cGVHD
             despite &gt; 4 weeks of prednisone (or equivalent) dosed at &gt; 0.25 mg/kg/day (or &gt; 0.5
             mg/kg every other day).

          -  Moderate to severe cGVHD (in accordance with 2014 cGVHD NIH Consensus Criteria
             [Jagasia, 2015; Appendix 9]) at screening with involvement of at least one of the
             following organs at the screening and baseline visits: skin, mouth, eyes,
             gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, lungs, and joint and fascia. 105 Subject has
             received no more than 3 previous treatments for cGVHD, excluding topical agents.

          -  Treatment with corticosteroids is considered a treatment for cGVHD and should be
             included in determining the number of previous treatments.

          -  Lines of therapy consisting of concurrent medications or interventions (eg, tacrolimus
             and corticosteroids; ECP and corticosteroids) count as 2 separate treatments.

          -  If cGVHD has worsened during a taper of immunosuppressive agents, restoring the agents
             to therapeutic level is permitted and does not count as an additional treatment. 106
             Subject may be receiving corticosteroid therapy provided that the dose is &lt; 1
             mg/kg/day of systemic prednisone or equivalent and has been stable for at least 2

             107 Subject may be receiving other non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapies
             provided that the immunosuppressant dose is stable for at least 2 weeks prior to first
             dose of AMG 592. Adjustments to dose of calcineurin inhibitor or sirolimus are allowed

             liver biopsy will not be mandated. 111 Subject must have adequate pulmonary function
             defined as: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt; 50% or hemoglobin-adjusted
             diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO Hb) &gt; 40% of predicted, unless pulmonary
             dysfunction is deemed to be due to cGVHD.

             112 Subject must have adequate renal function defined as: a calculated glomerular
             filtration rate of &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the MDRD formula. 113 Subject must have

             opinion of the investigator requires further cardiovascular evaluation, including
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. 114 Subject must have adequate
             bone marrow function indicated by ANC &gt; 1.00 x 109/L and platelets &gt; 50 x 109/L

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications. Further details are available at the link below.</ipd_access_criteria>
