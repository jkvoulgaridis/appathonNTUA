      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cord blood-derived expanded
      allogeneic natural killer cells (donor natural killer [NK] cells) and also how well they work
      when given together with cyclophosphamide and etoposide in treating children and young adults
      with solid tumors that have come back (relapsed) or that do not respond to treatment
      (refractory). NK cells, white blood cells important to the immune system, are
      donated/collected from cord blood collected at birth from healthy babies and grown in the
      lab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and etoposide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving NK cells together with cyclophosphamide
      and etoposide may work better in treating children and young adults with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of cord
      blood-derived expanded allogeneic natural killer cells (expanded allogeneic cord donor
      natural killer [NK] cells) following chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the persistence of adoptively-transferred cord NK cells after solid tumor
      directed chemotherapy.

      II. Preliminarily define the antitumor activity to adoptively transferred NK cells following
      the study preparative regimen in the confines of a phase I study.

      III. Determine the immunophenotype and function of the infused NK cell product. IV.
      Preliminarily evaluate for any correlate of phenotype, killer cell immunoglobulin-like
      receptor (kir) haplotype, and function with overall response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cord blood derived allogeneic NK cells.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 30 minutes and
      etoposide IV QD over 60 minutes on days 1-5 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive cord blood derived allogeneic NK cells IV on day 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 days, and then every
      week for 30 days.
