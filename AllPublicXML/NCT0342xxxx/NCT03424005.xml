  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of multiple immunotherapy-based treatment combinations in patients with
      metastatic or inoperable locally advanced TNBC.

      The study will be performed in two stages. During Stage 1, two cohorts will be enrolled in
      parallel in this study: one cohort will consist of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive
      participants who have received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic or inoperable locally
      advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (first-line [1L] PD-L1+ cohort), and one cohort
      will consist of participants who had disease progression during or following 1L treatment
      with chemotherapy (e.g., paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin) and have not received
      cancer immunotherapy (CIT) (second-line [2L] CIT-naive cohort). In addition, participants in
      the 2L CIT-naive cohort who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or
      unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to continue treatment with a different
      treatment combination (Stage 2), provided Stage 2 is open for enrollment.
