      This is a phase Ib/II, open-label multicentre study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of AZD9150 plus durvalumab alone or in
      combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced, solid tumours and subsequently in
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This international, multicenter study was originally intended to be conducted in four parts,
      designated as Parts A, B, C, and D. The protocol was amended in December 2018 to remove Parts
      B and C. Parts B and C were intended to evaluate patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      Stage IV NSCLC; however, these parts of the study will not be conducted.

      Part A of this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and AZD9150 with
      and without selected chemotherapy regimens, and will include patients with advanced solid
      malignancies that are refractory to standard therapy or for whom no standard of care (SOC)
      regimen currently exists.

      Part D will compare the relative bioavailability of the AZD9150 subcutaneous (SC) versus
      intravenous (IV) formulations in patients with confirmed solid malignancies that are
      refractory to standard therapy or for whom no SOC regimen currently exists. Approximately 50
      to 62 PK-evaluable patients will be enrolled in Part D. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      either SC or IV AZD9150. For Part D, the PK Analysis set will include all patients who
      receive both study drugs (both AZD9150 and durvalumab) and have at least one PK sample
      collection.

      A complementary anti-tumour strategy will be used in this study with 2 immuno-therapeutics
      applied to restore effective anti-tumour immunity at 2 distinct stages: promoting the
      effector function of T-cell responses with an anti-PD-L1 mAb, durvalumab, while hindering
      immune escape in the tumour bed with AZD9150. In addition, chemotherapy will be added to this
      combination to investigate possible future enhancement of response. In preclinical models,
      conventional platinum-based chemotherapy has been shown to induce T-cell activation through
      the release of tumour-specific antigens during cancer cell death. The elimination of
      persistent tolerogenic tumour antigen environment via chemotherapy-induced debulking may also
      play a role in generating an effective immune response. In this setting, immunotherapy has
      the potential to mount an ongoing and dynamic immune response that can kill tumour cells for
      an extended time.

      Part A of the study will be conducted in five arms, designated Arms A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.
      The primary objective of Part A is to assess the safety and tolerability, and determining the
      maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of AZD9150 plus durvalumab in
      patients with advanced solid malignancies. In addition, another primary objective is to
      assess the safety and tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended
      phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of AZD9150 plus durvalumab in combination with standard chemotherapy
      regimens in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Approximately 30 to 78 DLT-evaluable
      patients will be enrolled in Part A.

      In Arm A1, patients will receive AZD9150 by (IV) infusion Q2W + durvalumab by IV infusion
      Q4W. Chemotherapy will not be given in Arm A1.

      Arm A2 patients will receive AZD9150 IV QW + durvalumab IV Q3W, cisplatin by slow IV infusion
      over 1-4 hours on Day 1 + 5-fluorouracil (5FU) by continuous IV infusion over 96 hours (Days
      1 through 4, repeated every 3 weeks for up to 18 weeks). In Arm A2 there will be a AZD9150 +
      chemotherapy lead-in period prior to durvalumab dosing. The last chemotherapy dose will be
      given in Week 15. After discontinuation of chemotherapy the regimen will include AZD9150 IV
      QW + durvalumab IV Q4W. Administration of durvalumab will continue Q3W through Week 19, at
      which time the schedule will switch to Q4W (e.g., Week 23, 27, 31, etc.).

      Depending on the results from Arm A2, Arm A3 may not be conducted. If the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC) decides to open Arm A3, the SRC will determine the starting dose. Patients
      will be administered one of the following 4 chemotherapy regimens in combination with AZD9150
      and durvalumab appropriate for their tumour type:

        -  In Arm A3, patients will receive cisplatin by slow IV infusion over 1-4 hours on Day 1 +
           5FU by continuous IV infusion over 96 hours (Days 1 through 4, repeated every 3 weeks
           for up to 18 weeks).

        -  In Arm A4, patients will receive gemcitabine by IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1
           and 8 every 3 weeks for 12 to 18 weeks, plus either:

             -  for cisplatin-eligible patients: cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 (every 3
                weeks for up to 12 to 18 weeks); or

             -  for cisplatin-ineligible patients: carboplatin IV over 30 to 60 minutes on Day 1
                (every 3 weeks for up to 12 to 18 weeks).

        -  In Arm A5, patients will receive carboplatin at AUC 5 IV over 30 to 60 minutes on Day 1
           + nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 to 40 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 (every 3 weeks for up to
           12 to 18 weeks).

      There will be an AZD9150 7-day lead-in period (termed Week 0) in all arms in all parts of the
      study. AZD9150 will be given IV on Days 1,3, and 5 of the lead-in week. When chemotherapy is
      administered, the dosing of chemotherapy will also commence during the lead-in period with
      AZD9150. In Arm A2 of Part A, dosing with AZD9150 IV, durvalumab, and chemotherapy will
      commence on Day 1 of Week 0. In Part D, dosing with AZD9150 IV or SC will commence on Day 1
      of Week 0.

             failure, active cardiomyopathy, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             uncontrolled hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

         18. As judged by the Investigator, has any evidence of severe or uncontrolled diseases, or
             has an active viral infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma
