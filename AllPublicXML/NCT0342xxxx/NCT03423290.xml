      A prospective, multicenter, observational evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the FRED®
      device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center observational study. Treatment and follow-up visits will be done as
      per standard of care.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that use of the FRED/FRED Jr Embolic device in
      intracranial aneurysm treatment is safe and effective when assessed at 1, 6 and 12 month post
      procedure.

      100 patients will be enrolled over an 18-month recruitment period. All patients will be
      followed for 12 months.

               -  for which use of FRED or FRED Jr has been deemed appropriate

               -  being the only one to require treatment over the period of the study

               -  and optionally previously treated by surgery (clipping) or with an intrasaccular
                  device: aneurysm recanalized

          3. Patient with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2

          5. The aneurysm to be treated has a stenosis of its parent artery

          6. Patient has another aneurysm previously treated with a stent or a flow diverter

               -  on the same parent vessel at any time (except in the case of the proximal carotid
                  if the treatment occurred more than 3 months prior to the procedure)

               -  on a different parent vessel, less than 3 months prior to the procedure

          7. Patient has another aneurysm requiring treatment within the study period

          8. Patient with a known allergy to antiplatelet, to heparin, to contrast products or
             nickel titanium

          9. Patient with a contra-indication to antiplatelet or heparin
