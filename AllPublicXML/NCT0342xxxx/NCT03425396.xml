    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized to receive 7 days of treatment of either omadacycline or
      nitrofurantoin. The End of Treatment visit, Post Therapy Evaluation visit, and Final
      Follow-up visit was planned within 2 days following the last dose of study drug, on Day 14
      (+/- 2 days) after the first dose of study drug, and within 30 to 37 days following the first
      dose of study drug, respectively. The study followed a double-dummy design. To maintain the
      study blinding, participants assigned to omadacycline received active omadacycline tablets
      and over-encapsulated nitrofurantoin placebo tablets. Participants assigned to the
      nitrofurantoin arm received omadacycline placebo tablets and over-encapsulated active
      nitrofurantoin capsules.

    <description>Clinical response was determined by the investigator at the PTE visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the clinical outcome of Clinical Success, Clinical Failure, or Indeterminate. Clinical Success was defined as sufficient resolution of cystitis signs and symptoms at the PTE visit such that no additional systemic antimicrobial therapy was required for the current infection. Clinical Failure was defined as no apparent response to therapy or persistence of signs and symptoms of infection or reappearance of signs and symptoms at or before the PTE visit such that use of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy for the current infection was required. The clinical outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the PTE visit was not completed.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 14 (A PTE occurred on Day 14 ± 2 days after the participant's first dose of study drug)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded their assessments using the UTI Symptoms Assessment (UTISA) questionnaire, a 14-item questionnaire that assessed the levels of 'severity' and 'bothersomeness' for seven UTI signs and symptoms: Frequency, Urgency, Pain/burning on urination, Incomplete voiding, Pain in pelvic area, Low back pain, and Blood in urine. The sub-scale responses were recorded as 'did not have', 'mild', 'moderate', and 'severe' for 'severity'; and 'not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', and 'a lot' for 'bothersomeness', both scored 0-3. Total scores were calculated by summing the non-missing scores of the 7 items, divided by the number of non-missing items, and then multiplied by 7. For each sub-scale, the total score ranged from 0 (least Severe/ least bothersome) and 21 (worst severity/most bothersome). Number of participants with resolution of all symptoms, without occurrence of new symptoms is reported. Resolution was defined as absence of all baseline symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response at the Post Therapy Evaluation (PTE) Visit (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Clinical response was determined by the investigator at the PTE visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the clinical outcome of Clinical Success, Clinical Failure, or Indeterminate. Clinical Success was defined as sufficient resolution of cystitis signs and symptoms at the PTE visit such that no additional systemic antimicrobial therapy was required for the current infection. Clinical Failure was defined as no apparent response to therapy or persistence of signs and symptoms of infection or reappearance of signs and symptoms at or before the PTE visit such that use of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy for the current infection was required. The clinical outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the PTE visit was not completed.</description>

        <description>Clinical response was determined by the investigator at the EOT visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the clinical outcome of Clinical Success, Clinical Failure. Clinical Success was defined as sufficient resolution of cystitis signs and symptoms at the EOT visit such that no additional systemic antimicrobial therapy was required for the current infection. Clinical Failure was defined as no apparent response to therapy or persistence of signs and symptoms of infection at the EOT visit such that use of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy for the current infection was required. The clinical outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the EOT visit was not completed.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With an Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response at the FFU Visit (Micro-ITT Population)</title>
          <description>Clinical response was determined by the investigator at the FFU visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the clinical outcome of Clinical Success, Clinical Failure, or Indeterminate. Clinical Success was defined as sufficient resolution of cystitis signs and symptoms at the FFU visit such that no additional systemic antimicrobial therapy was required for the current infection. Clinical Failure was defined as no apparent response to therapy or persistence of signs and symptoms of infection at the FFU visit such that use of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy for the current infection was required. The clinical outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the FFU visit was not completed.</description>
          <population>The micro-ITT population consisted of all randomized participants who had a study-qualifying pre-treatment baseline urine culture. A study-qualifying pretreatment Baseline culture was defined as a culture from a clean-catch urine sample which grew at least 1 and no more than 2 bacterial isolates at ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL each.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Microbiological Response at the EOT Visit (Micro-ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Microbiological response was determined programmatically at the EOT visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the microbiological outcome of Favorable, Unfavorable, or Indeterminate. Favorable microbiological outcomes included eradication and presumed eradication i.e., urine specimen showed absence of the original baseline pathogen or the baseline pathogen grew at &lt;10^4 CFU/mL at visit. Unfavorable microbiological outcome included persistence i.e. urine culture showed continued presence (defined as ≥10^4 CFU/mL) of the original baseline pathogen(s) at visit. The microbiological outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the urine specimen was not available to culture or the culture result was not interpretable.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Microbiological Response at the EOT Visit (ME-EOT Population)</title>
        <description>Microbiological response was determined programmatically at the EOT visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the microbiological outcome of Favorable or Unfavorable. Favorable microbiological outcomes included eradication and presumed eradication i.e., urine specimen showed absence of the original baseline pathogen or the baseline pathogen grew at &lt;10^4 CFU/mL at visit. Unfavorable microbiological outcome included persistence i.e. urine culture showed continued presence (defined as ≥10^4 CFU/mL) of the original baseline pathogen(s) at visit. For the ME population, the microbiological outcome was not deemed as indeterminate response.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Microbiological Response at the PTE Visit (ME-PTE Population)</title>
        <description>Microbiological response was determined programmatically at the PTE visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the microbiological outcome of Favorable or Unfavorable. Favorable microbiological outcomes included eradication and presumed eradication i.e., urine specimen showed absence of the original baseline pathogen or the baseline pathogen grew at &lt;10^4 CFU/mL at visit. Unfavorable microbiological outcome included persistence i.e. urine culture showed continued presence (defined as ≥10^4 CFU/mL) of the original baseline pathogen(s) at visit. For the ME population, the microbiological outcome was not deemed as indeterminate response.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Resolution of All Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Signs and Clinical Symptoms at PTE Visit (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Participants recorded their assessments using the UTI Symptoms Assessment (UTISA) questionnaire, a 14-item questionnaire that assessed the levels of 'severity' and 'bothersomeness' for seven UTI signs and symptoms: Frequency, Urgency, Pain/burning on urination, Incomplete voiding, Pain in pelvic area, Low back pain, and Blood in urine. The sub-scale responses were recorded as 'did not have', 'mild', 'moderate', and 'severe' for 'severity'; and 'not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', and 'a lot' for 'bothersomeness', both scored 0-3. Total scores were calculated by summing the non-missing scores of the 7 items, divided by the number of non-missing items, and then multiplied by 7. For each sub-scale, the total score ranged from 0 (least Severe/ least bothersome) and 21 (worst severity/most bothersome). Number of participants with resolution of all symptoms, without occurrence of new symptoms is reported. Resolution was defined as absence of all baseline symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With No Worsening and Absence of New UTI Signs and Clinical Symptoms at PTE Visit (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Participants recorded their assessments using the UTI Symptoms Assessment (UTISA) questionnaire, a 14-item questionnaire that assessed the levels of 'severity' and 'bothersomeness' for seven UTI signs and symptoms: Frequency, Urgency, Pain/burning on urination, Incomplete voiding, Pain in pelvic area, Low back pain, and Blood in urine. The sub-scale responses were recorded as 'did not have', 'mild', 'moderate', and 'severe' for 'severity'; and 'not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', and 'a lot' for 'bothersomeness', both scored 0-3. Total scores were calculated by summing the non-missing scores of the 7 items, divided by the number of non-missing items, and then multiplied by 7. For each sub-scale, the total score ranged from 0 (least Severe/ least bothersome) and 21 (worst severity/most bothersome). Number of participants with no worsening and absence of new UTI signs and clinical symptoms is reported. No worsening meant that each question score is same or better at post baseline.</description>

        <population>The ITT population consisted of all randomized participants regardless of whether or not the participant received study drug. Participants who completed the PTE visit were analyzed for this end point.</population>
