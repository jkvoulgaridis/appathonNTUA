  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Many people suffer from drug addiction. But currently, treatments are not very effective. One
      group of patients in this study are enrolled in addiction treatment through physician health
      programs (PHPs). About 70% of these patients are able to stop using drugs for extended
      periods of time. By studying this specific group of patients, researchers want to understand
      the difference between those who may or may not respond to treatment. They want to study the
      brain while people do thinking and feeling tasks and when they relax. They will study brain
      chemicals, a stress hormone, and certain genes. The results may help them understand the
      brain basis for addiction and recovery.

      Objectives:

      To use brain imaging to find differences between people with and without drug addiction. To
      see if these differences help predict addiction.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 25-65, enrolled in a physician health program or those with
      no history of addiction and with at least 16 years of education

      Design:

      Participants enrolled in a PHP will be screened under this study and participants with no
      history of addiction will be screened under another study.

      At the study visit, participants will:

      Have a routine check-up, including tests for pregnancy, drugs, and alcohol.

      Give 11 blood samples.

      Rate their cravings.

      Test their frustration with stressful situations by responding to questions on a screen.

      Practice the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tasks:

      Shock task. Two electrodes placed on a foot will deliver brief, low-strength electrical
      shocks that get gradually stronger, but not painful. Participants will see drug or neutral
      images. They will rate their discomfort.

      Thinking tasks. Participants will answer questions about pictures, numbers, and money. They
      will press buttons in response to things they see.

      Do the MRI tasks in 2 sessions (morning and afternoon) in the scanner. Participants will lie
      in an MRI machine which will take pictures of the brain while doing these tasks.

      Some participants will repeat the visit twice over a year at set intervals.

      Meals will be provided, and visits will include meal breaks and smoking breaks for those who
      smoke.

      Objective:

      Despite recent advance in addiction neuroscience, achieving a breakthrough in predicting
      addiction treatment outcome has been difficult and long-term abstinence success unacceptably
      low. The aim of this study is to create a biomarker using various neuroimaging metrics that
      can predict treatment outcome in opioid and alcohol use disorder patients.

      Study Population:

      The study population will include up to five hundred (500) participants to reach three
      hundred fifty (350) completers (50 per group) based on their addiction status (1) healthy,
      non-drug using control participants (CON) (2) Early-in-treatment, healthy prescription opioid
      use disorder participants currently enrolled in physician health program (PHP) within 2 month
      of starting treatment (POUD-E), (3) Long-term-in-treatment, healthy prescription opioid use
      disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP more than 2 months and less than 5 years
      (POUD-L), (4) Early-in-treatment, healthy alcohol use disorder participants currently
      enrolled in PHP within 2 month of starting treatment (AUD-E), (5) Long-term-in-treatment,
      healthy alcohol use disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP more than 2 months and
      less than 5 years (AUD-L), (6) Early-in-treatment, healthy dual prescription opioid and
      alcohol and use disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP within 2 month of starting
      treatment (POAUD-E), (7) Long-term-in-treatment, healthy dual prescription opioid and alcohol
      use disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP more than 2 months and less than 5 years
      (POAUD-L).

      Design: Two studies will run simultaneously:

        1. Cross-sectional study that will include participants enrolled at a PHP over the past 5
           years and have been in treatment for more than 2 months. Three target groups, in
           addition to the control group, will be included in this study [POUD-L, AUD-L, and
           POAUD-L]. Each participant will complete a screening evaluation session (approximately
           3-4 hours) and a second online session for study consent review (approximately 1-2
           hours) at home or at the PHP through secure communication. These online sessions will
           include the screening consent process, administration of a structured psychiatric
           interview and a semi-structured assessment, instructions for the completion of detailed
           self-administered questionnaires to characterize clinical phenotype and physical
           condition, and consent review for the study. Participants subsequently cleared for and
           enrolled in the cross-sectional study will be invited to come to NIDA IRP for one
           imaging visit that will take approximately 8-10 hours.

           The aim of the cross-sectional study is to identify imaging based brain differences
           between control group and drug using groups and to examine correlations between brain
           imaging markers at different stages of recovery and (1) severity of drug use (duration
           and quantity), (2) duration of abstinence, and (3) number of relapses in drug using
           groups.

           The primary outcome measure for the cross-sectional study will be differences in
           functional connectivity and BOLD signal activation in executive and impulsive
           neurobehavioral decision systems at various stages of sobriety in relation to controls.

        2. Longitudinal study that will include all participants enrolled at PHP within two months
           of starting treatment. Three groups, in addition to the control group, will be included
           in this study [POUD-E, AUDE, and POAUD-E]. Each participant will complete the screening
           evaluation session as described in the cross-sectional study and three imaging visits at
           NIDA; 1) first (baseline) visit within 2 months of eligibility determination, (2) second
           (mid-year) visit within 4-8 months from baseline visit and (3) third (one-year) visit
           within 10-14 months from baseline visit. Each imaging visit will take approximately 8-10
           hours.

           The aim of the longitudinal study is to measure brain imaging changes over time in
           abstinent and relapsing addicts and to identify brain imaging markers that differentiate
           between abstinent and relapsing participants at 6 months and at 1 year. The rationale
           behind the mid-year visit is that most relapses take place early (within the first 6
           months) during treatment and by one year some of those who relapsed earlier achieve
           abstinence. We chose one year follow up in order to compare brain imaging changes
           between abstinent and relapsing participants after relatively long sobriety and to add
           clinical value to our prediction model. By including both these visits, we will preclude
           a contaminated sample of both abstinent without early relapse and abstinent with early
           relapse which could confound our results.

           The primary outcome measure for the longitudinal study will be differences in baseline
           and changes over time in functional connectivity circuits, BOLD signal activation in
           executive and impulsive neurobehavioral decision systems between abstinent and relapsing
           addicts that can predict treatment response at 6 and 12 months. Most importantly, we
           will use imaging, behavioral and genetic measures at the onset of treatment in a
           machine-learning framework in an attempt to predict subsequent treatment success in this
           cohort of participants.

        3. Secondary outcome measures for both studies will be phenotypic (performance on
           behavioral tasks, self-reported measures of cravings, impulsivity and personality
           traits), genotypic and imaging (structural and spectroscopy) differences between
           different addiction groups.

        Cross-sectional study will include participants enrolled at a PHP over the past 5 years and
        have been in treatment for greater than 2 months. Longitudinal study will include
        participants who are enrolled at a PHP within about two months of starting treatment. No
        preferences in participant recruitment will be made on the bases of gender, race, or ethnic
        background. Efforts will be made to include minorities in proportion to their presence in
        the local population of the PHP. The demographic profile for the PHP cohort is about 60%
        males, predominantly Caucasian; 89% and about 4% Asian, 3% Hispanic, 1.5% African American
        and 1.5% other races. The matching control group will be recruited from NIH employees and
        from the major metropolitan Baltimore area.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants: (CON), (POUD-E), (POUD-L), (AUD-E), (AUD-L), (POAUD-E), (POAUD-L):

          -  Males and females between 25-65 years of age will be enrolled in the study.
             Justification: The lower age cut off is chosen because the sample consists of addicted
             physicians who are all above 25 years of age. The upper age cut off is chosen because
             of aging-related brain changes that could confound the results. Assessment tool:
             Participants self-report their demographic information, including date of birth.

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent. Justification: It is important
             for subjects to understand and agree to all the procedures, time-commitments and
             expectations entailed in this study. Assessment tool: Verbal confirmation of
             willingness to consent and a score of 80% or more on consent quiz.

          -  Must be right-handed. Justification: Some of the neural processes assessed in this
             protocol may be lateralized in the brain. In order to reduce potential variance,
             participants will be required to be righthanded. Assessment tool: Edinburgh Handedness
             Inventory.

          -  Participants must be in good health. Justification: Many illnesses may alter fMRI
             signals as well as neural functioning. Assessment tool(s): Control participants will
             undergo a medical history and physical examination. Experimental group participants
             will provide a brief health history during phone/internet screening. Written physician
             health records will also be obtained to verify health status of the experimental
             groups.

        HEALTHY CONTROL PARTICIPANTS (CON) IN ADDITION TO ALL PARTICIPANTS' INCLUSION CRITIERIA:

          -  Free of lifetime DSM-5 substance use disorders except for tobacco use disorder.
             Justification: the presence of substance use disorder in the control group will
             confound the results. Please note we exempted tobacco use disorder in order to match
             the experimental group participants. Assessment tool(s): The MINI and clinical
             assessment.

          -  16 years of education or more Justification: To match the educational status of the
             experimental group. Assessment tool: Participant will provide educational history.

        Early-in-treatment, prescription opioid use disorder (POUD-E) participants- in addition to
        all participants inclusion criteria:

          1. Recently (within about 2 months) enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or
             equivalent at time of enrollment in the study Justification: The two months interval
             was chosen because we wish to longitudinally follow participants from very early
             abstinence to long-term abstinence/relapse at one year. Importantly, participants are
             allowed to leave residential treatment centers and go home for weekends or short
             holidays after two months of starting treatment, so inviting enrolled participants to
             travel to NIDA IRP for one-day visit after two months of treatment is not expected to
             increase their risk of relapse. Assessment tool: addiction treatment records.

          2. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe opioid use disorder (OUD) for at
             least 2 years prior to enrollment and in full remission for at least 2 months at time
             of imaging. Justification: The hypothesized differences in measured brain imaging
             parameters are more likely to be detected in severe OUDs compared to mild or moderate
             OUDs. Assessment tool: DSM 5 Opioid Use Disorder

        Checklist.

        Early-in-treatment, alcohol use disorder (AUD-E) participants- in addition to all
        participants inclusion criteria:

          1. Recently (within about 2 months) enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or

             allowed to leave residential treatment centers and go home for weekends or short
             holidays after two months of starting treatment, therefore, inviting enrolled
             participants to travel to NIDA IRP for one-day visit after two months of treatment is
             not expected to increase their risk of relapse. Assessment tool: addiction treatment
             records.

          2. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) for at
             least 2 years prior to enrollment and in full remission for at least 2 months at time

             parameters are more likely to be detected in severe AUDs compared to mild or moderate
             AUDs. Assessment tool: DSM 5 Alcohol Use Disorder

        Early-in-treatment, dual prescription opioid and alcohol use disorder (POAUD-E)
        participants- in addition to all participants inclusion criteria:

          1. Recently (within about 2 months) enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or

             not expected to increase their risk of relapse. Assessment tool: addiction treatment
             records.

          2. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for either severe opioid or severe alcohol use
             disorders and a minimum of 4/11 DSM-5 for either moderate opioid or moderate alcohol
             use disorder at least 2 years for each substance prior to enrollment and in full
             remission for at least 2 months at time of imaging. Justification: The hypothesized
             differences in measured brain imaging parameters are more likely to be detected in
             severe SUDs compared to mild or moderate SUDs, so at least one of the two dual
             addictions should be severe and the second one can be moderate. Assessment tool: DSM 5

          1. Enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or equivalent for more than 2 months and
             less than 5 years at time of enrollment in the study Justification: The more than two
             months and less than 5 years interval was chosen because we wish to study brain
             changes (compared to non-drug using controls) at different stages of abstinence.
             Assessment tool: addiction treatment records.

          2. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe opioid use disorder for at least 2

             Opioid Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder Checklists.

        EXCLUSION CRITIERIA:

        All participants: (CON), (POUD-E), (POUD-L), (AUD-E), (AUD-L), (POAUD-E), (POAUD-L):

          1. Females must not be pregnant or lactating. Justification: The impact of exposing
             pregnant females to MRI and stress paradigms is unknown. Including lactating females
             will confound the results because of the effect of lactation-associated hormonal
             changes on the brain. Assessment: medical history and negative urine pregnancy test
             prior to each MRI visit (and at screening for control participants).

          2. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI of the
             head (e.g. pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some
             types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,
             implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments) or fear of enclosed spaces.
             Justification: The presence of ferromagnetic objects poses risk of injury during MRI.
             Assessment tool: medical history and MRI screening form.

          3. Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus. Justification: individuals with noise-induced
             hearing problems may be particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by MRI
             scanner. Assessment tool: medical history and MRI safety screening.

          4. Head trauma with loss of consciousness or significant sequelae for more than 30
             minutes. Justification: The presence of head injury could result in subtle alterations
             in brain structure or function and could confound the results. Assessment tool:
             medical history and physical exam (controls).

          5. Current or past DSM-5 diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder that required
             hospitalization other than detoxification (any length), or chronic medication
             management for more than three months, (except for stable doses of antidepressants, or
             low dose (up to 100mg/day of Quetiapine or equivalent - see appendix 31 for
             antipsychotic dose equivalent conversion table to 100mg of Quetiapine) of
             antipsychotics (experimental groups only) for at least one month prior to the time of
             a scanning visit) and that could impact brain function at the time of the study based
             on study MAI s discretion. Current or past tobacco use disorder or nicotine use,
             opioid use disorder in opioid use disorder participants, alcohol use disorder in
             alcohol use disorder participants, and both opioid and alcohol use disorders in the
             dual opioid and alcohol use disorder group is not exclusionary. Justification: The
             presence of severe or unstable comorbid psychiatric conditions could be associated
             with brain alterations that could confound the results. Assessment tool: history, MINI
             clinical assessment, as well as review of medical records, including clinical exam,
             for experimental group.

          6. Currently (at time of imaging sessions) using any medications that are known to alter
             BOLD signal such as stimulant or stimulant-like medications (amphetamine,
             methylphenidate, modafinil); anorexics (sibuteramine); antianginal agents;
             antiarrhythmics; antiasthma agents that are systemic corticosteroids;
             anticholinergics; anticonvulsants; antineoplastics; antiobesity;; hormones
             (exceptions: thyroid hormone replacement, oral contraceptives, and estrogen
             replacement therapy); insulin; lithium; herbal products with known psychotropic
             effects (e.g. Gingko biloba, or St. John s Wort) and other medications based on study
             MAI s discretion. Justification: Concomitant intake of medications that could alter
             BOLD signal could confound the results. Note that stable low dose antipsychotics are
             allowed for the experimental groups for two reasons: (1) anecdotal data suggest that a
             large number of PHP participants are prescribed low doses of antipsychotics to
             attenuate some of the mood instability, irritability, and insomnia that is commonly
             experienced as a result of abstinence. If we exclude these participants, it will be
             difficult to get to the targeted recruitment number. (2) The effect of low dose
             antipsychotics on BOLD signal in patients with substance use disorder is largely
             unknown. Most of the literature on the effects of antipsychotic medications on fMRI
             BOLD signals focuses on schizophrenic and bipolar populations taking high dose
             antipsychotics. Among individuals with schizophrenia, the literature suggests that the
             effect of antipsychotics on BOLD signals is variable (Roder et al. 2010; Roder et al.
             2013). Conversely, a review of medication effects on neuroimaging in bipolar disorder
             found that antipsychotics generally had a normalizing effect on BOLD signals (Hafeman
             et al. 2012). Since antipsychotics differentially effect these populations, it is
             difficult to extend these findings to our study population. Assessment tool: medical
             history for experimental groups; controls will also have a comprehensive urine
             toxicology screen.
