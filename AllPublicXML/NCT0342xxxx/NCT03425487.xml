  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess and compare the benefits of twopsychological interventions
      added to the usual treatment of patients whocome to mental health. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to the followingconditions: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR),
      Attachment-BasedCompassion Therapy (ABCT) and a Treatment As Usual (TAU) Group.
      Theparticipants in the two psychological intervention groups will also receive
      usualpsychological/psychiatric treatment managed by their specialist. Mindfulnessand
      Compassion groups will be composed of 33 participants each, and TAU group will be composed of
      64 participants (total sample n = 130).

      The principal hypothesis is that 'ABCT + TAU' will be more effective than'MBSR + TAU' for
      treating depressive and/or anxiety symptoms in patients attending mental health settings.
      Secondary hypothesis are: 1) 'MBSR + TAU'and 'ABCT + TAU' will be more effective than 'TAU
      alone' for treatinganxiety and/or depressive symptoms in patients attending mental health
      settings; 2) mindfulness will be a mediator of the 'MBSR + TAU' program improvements, while
      self-compassion will be a mediator of the corresponding'ABCT + TAU'; and 3) 'ABCT + TAU' will
      present more cost-effectiveness than 'MBSR + TAU' and both ABCT + TAU' and 'MBSR + TAU'
      programs will present more cost-effectiveness than TAU alone.

    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the MBSR based intervention group. This scale is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The range for each subescale is 0-21 (But this scores will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score). This questionnaire also gives us a one-dimensional global measure of emotional distress that will be considered as the main study outcome. It is composed by all the 21 items configuring a general factor, and it will be taken as a continuous dimensional variable that ranges from 0 to 126.</description>

    <description>In the MBSR based intervention group. This scale is currently the only self-report instrument to measure self-compassion. The SCS is divided into six subscales: 4-item Self-Kindness; 4-item Self-Judgment; 4-item Common Humanity; 4-item Isolation; 4-item Mindfulness; and 4-item Over-Identification. The items can be rated on a five-point likert scale with 1 indicating almost never and 5 indicating almost always. After reversing the negatively formulated items, a total score can be calculated, which may range from 24 to 120, with higher scores indicating greater self-compassion.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the MBSR based intervention group. The EuroQol-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The construct &quot;health status&quot; is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level scale.</description>
