      A prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study. The study will enroll up to 85 subjects to
      be enrolled and treated with the Optilume BPH Prostatic DCB Dilation Catheter System at up to
      8 clinical sites. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment at Foley removal, and up to 1
      year. The subjects may choose to be followed-up annually for 5 years or until study close,
      whichever comes first.

      Study device is Optilume™ BPH Prostatic Drug Coated Balloon Dilation Catheter System.

      Study primarily outcomes are measured by 1). Change in IPSS score at 3-month post-procedure
      follow-up; 2). Major device or procedure related complications at 3-month post-procedure
      follow-up.
