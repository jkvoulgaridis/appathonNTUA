  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CHARM (Cancer Health Assessment Reaching Many) study will assess the utility of clinical
      exome sequencing and how it affects care in diverse populations. The study population
      includes adults at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes.

      The primary objective is to implement a hereditary cancer risk assessment program in healthy
      18-49 year-olds in primary care settings within a vertically integrated health delivery
      system (Kaiser Permanente) and a federal qualified health center (Denver Health). The
      investigators will assess clinical exome sequencing implementation and interpretation, as
      well as tailored interactions for low health literacy including a contextualized consent
      process, and a modified approach to results disclosure and genetic counseling. The
      investigators will also assess the clinical utility (healthcare utilization and adherence to
      recommended care) and personal utility of primary and additional results from clinical exome
      sequencing, and evaluate the ethical and policy implications of considering personal utility
      of genomic information decisions for health care coverage.

      Aim 1. Implement a hereditary cancer risk-assessment program in healthy 18-49-year-old adults
      in primary care settings, with stakeholder input, and offer exome sequencing to clarify risk.

      Aim 1A. Identify and recruit 880 adult participants at-risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome.

      Aim 1B: Generate medical exome sequence data and interpret variants. Aim 1C: Disclose
      findings from medical exome sequencing, incorporate results into the electronic medical
      record (EMR), and facilitate downstream patient management and coordination of care with the
      provider.

      Aim 1D. Engage stakeholders to tailor and optimize the program in diverse populations.

      Aim 2. Evaluate and tailor for diverse populations the critical interactions in the program,
      including the consent process, choices for reporting additional findings, and the response to
      results disclosure.

      Aim 2A. Design, implement, and assess a contextualized consent process to support informed
      decision-making about participation in research about medical exome sequencing.

      Aim 2B. Design, implement, and compare a novel decision aid in the second half of the study
      for selecting the optional categories of additional findings with the approach we developed
      in CSER1 that offered a category checklist.

      Aim 2C. Design, implement, and compare a modified (communication-focused) approach to results
      disclosure, genetic counseling, and decision making with a standard (information-focused)
      approach.

      .

      Aim 3. Evaluate the clinical utility (including personal utility) and cost of using exome
      sequencing to diagnose individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes and provide additional
      findings.

      Aim 3A: Measure the yield of reportable findings for hereditary cancer syndromes and
      additional findings.

      Aim 3B: Evaluate subsequent healthcare utilization for all study participants and adherence
      to recommended care among individuals who are identified with a hereditary cancer syndrome in
      diverse settings.

      Aim 3C. Assess the personal utility of exome sequencing, including primary and additional
      findings.

      Aim 4. Address pragmatic and ethical challenges to the integration of genomic medicine into
      clinical and health systems decision-making.

      Aim 4A: Develop and pilot a system that integrates genomic, clinical, and healthcare
      utilization data to inform clinicians and patients acting on genomic information and to
      reduce care gaps in patient management.

      Aim 4B: Advance the analysis of the ethical and policy implications of incorporating personal
      utility of genomic information into the decision framework for healthcare coverage.
