      Primary objectives:

        1. To comprehensively characterize steady state stereoselective pharmacokinetics of
           bupropion and its primary and secondary metabolites in healthy volunteers

        2. To prospectively determine the time course (onset), extent and offset of CYP2D6
           inhibition in relation to the pharmacokinetic profiles of bupropion and metabolites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female (approximately 1:1) volunteers between the age of 18 and 55 years old
             and within 32% of your ideal body weight.

          -  Judged healthy without any significant medical condition as determined by and decided
             from a pre-enrollment screening session that include medical history, laboratory tests
             such as blood and urine tests, and an electrical tracing of the heart beat
             (electrocardiogram, EKG).

          -  Individuals who agree to refrain from taking any prescriptions medications,
             over-the-counter medications, and herbal, dietary, and alternative supplements that
             may interact with the metabolism of those study drugs at least 2 weeks prior to the
             start of the study and until study completion.

          -  Nonsmoker or individuals willing to refrain from smoking or use of tobacco or
             marijuana for at least two weeks prior to and until the completion of the study (the
             entire study lasts for approximately 32 days).

          -  Willing to commit the time requested for this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they:

          -  Are underweight (weigh less than 52 kg or 114 lb) or overweight [body mass index (BMI)
             greater than 32].

          -  Have laboratory results that do not fall in a healthy range (e.g., blood hemoglobin
             less than 12.0 mg/dl).

          -  Have baseline EKG readings that are abnormal that could place the patient at the
             higher risk as decided by the study medical doctor (MD)

          -  Have history of intolerance, allergic reactions (e.g. rash) or other forms of
             hypersensitivities to any of the study medications (dextromethorphan and bupropion).

          -  Have current alcohol (more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day on a regular basis) or drug
             abuse.

          -  Have history or current gastrointestinal (digestive) disorders such as persistent
             diarrhea or malabsorption that would interfere with the absorption of orally
             administered drugs

          -  Have history or current seizures, hypertension and heart disease or any other
             cardiovascular disorders

          -  Have history or current psychiatric (mental or brain) disorders (e.g., feeling sad or
             unhappy, loss of interest in normal activities, worried) such as depression, anxiety,
             or suicidality or suicide attempts.

          -  Have significantly compromised liver and/or kidney functions.

          -  Have participated in a research study involving intensive blood sampling or have
             donated blood within the past two months

          -  Are unable or unwilling to stop taking other substances that may interfere with the
             metabolism of the study drugs (bupropion and dextromethorphan) two weeks prior to and
             during the entire study period, including prescription medications, over-the-counter
             medications, herbal or dietary supplements, and alternative medicines.

          -  Are employees or students under supervision of any of the study investigators.

          -  Cannot state a good understanding of this study including risks and requirements; are
             unable to follow the rules of this study.

          -  Cannot commit the time requested for this study.
