  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research proposal is to establish a mechanism to develop tools that will
      allow the investigators to measure the impact of magnetic resonance (MR) acquisition
      correction sequences for attenuation correction on positron emission tomography (PET)
      quantitation accuracy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Participant can be a male or a non-pregnant female.

          -  Successful completion of MRI screening form

          -  Participant must have undergone a PET/CT examination with injection of a standard dose
             of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or other PET tracer with a half-life greater than one
             hour either for clinical or research purposes within 3 hrs of the proposed PET-MRI
             examination.

          -  Participant will be fully informed and has personally signed and dated the written
             Informed Consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
             provisions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom exposure to a strong magnetic field would be a health risk (e.g.,
             subjects with cardiac pacemakers or non-MR compatible metallic implants)

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who require sedation to participate will be excluded.

          -  Patient/participant has a medical condition which in the judgment of the investigator
             might make supine positioning for the duration of the scan unsafe, such as (but not
             limited to) congestive heart failure or significant pulmonary disease.
