  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) have shown positive results delaying
      skeletal muscle fatigue and improving the status of biochemical markers related to skeletal
      muscle damage when these therapies were applied before exercise. The aim of this project is
      to verify the effects of PBMT in improvement of skeletal muscle performance and skeletal
      muscle recovery in healthy male subjects. This project aim also to validate the concept that
      simultaneous use of three wavelengths and light sources lead to optimized action
      independently of time-window between irradiation and the exercise.

      This is a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty healthy untrained male
      subjects will be randomly allocated to six experimental groups: Placebo, Control, PBMT 5
      mins, PBMT 3h, PBMT 6h and PBMT 24 hours. PBMT will be applied precisely two minutes after
      baseline MVC test. Then, after five minutes, 3, 6 hours or 1 day (24 hours) of PBMT the
      eccentric exercise protocol will be performed. We will analyze maximum voluntary contraction
      (MVC), creatine kinase (CK) activity and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Assessments
      will be performed at baseline, immediately after (1 minute), 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after
      the eccentric exercise protocol.

    <intervention_model_description>Sixty participants will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be randomized in six groups:
Control: Participants will receive no intervention; Placebo: Participants will receive placebo PBMT; 5 minutes: Participants will perform the eccentric exercise protocol 5 minutes after PBMT.
3 hours: Participants will perform the eccentric exercise protocol 3 hours after PBMT.
6 hours: Participants will perform the eccentric exercise protocol 6 hours after PBMT.
24 hours: Participants will perform the eccentric exercise protocol 24 hours after PBMT.
Assessments will be performed at baseline, after 1 minute, 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after the end of exercise protocol.</intervention_model_description>
