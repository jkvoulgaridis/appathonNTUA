  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies how well a continuous positive airway pressure device or
      deep inspiration breath hold works in reducing tumor movement in patients undergoing
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for lung cancer. The continuous positive airway
      pressure device works by blowing air into the lungs while patients wear a face mask or nozzle
      to help expand their airways and lungs. Deep inspiration breath hold is a standard technique
      that uses active breath-holding to restrict movement of the body. Using a continuous positive
      airway pressure device may work better than deep inspiration breath hold in lowering the
      amount of tumor movement during stereotactic radiation body therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the two methods of tumor motion management, continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) and deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) and to estimate the decrease in tumor motion
      from free breathing for CPAP and DIBH.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if CPAP is a more time-efficient option for tumor motion management than is
      DIBH.

      Ia. Determine if CPAP is better tolerated by patients than is DIBH. Ib. Determine the
      reproducibility of lung expansion and tumor motion reduction by CPAP.

      Ic. Determine if the dosimetric coverage of the tumor and the sparing of the normal tissues
      with CPAP is comparable to that with DIBH.

      Id. Measure treatment time differences between CPAP and breath hold (DIBH) treatments.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo free-breathing, DIBH, and CPAP CT simulation scans. If patient has
      difficulty exhaling on CPAP, then patient undergo biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP)
      CT simulation. The attending physician then compares all 3 simulation treatment plans
      (free-breathing, DIBH, and CPAP/BiPAP) and determines which method to use during SBRT. If
      CPAP/BiPAP is chosen as preferred method, patients wear CPAP/BiPAP over 1 hour prior to SBRT,
      then again during SBRT over 30-60 minutes. All other patients complete free-breathing or DIBH
      during SBRT over 30-60 minutes.

    <description>Paired t-test will be used to compare continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) in the decrease of tumor motion from free breathing.
