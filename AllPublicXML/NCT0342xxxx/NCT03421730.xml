  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate budesonide levels in the blood following
      inhalation of single doses of VR647 Inhalation Suspension in children with wheezing, reactive
      airway disease or mild asthma using a nebulizer, the VR647 Inhalation System. Secondary
      objectives include the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of VR647 Inhalation
      Suspension administered using the VR647 Inhalation System.

      The study consists of four visits; a screening visit (Visit 1), two dosing days (Visits 2 and
      3) and a follow-up visit (Visit 4). On each dosing day a single dose of treatment will be
      administered. Treatment allocation at Visits 2 and 3 is determined by a balanced incomplete
      block design.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label, randomized, balanced, incomplete block design trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 12 treatment sequences (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,A), (B,C), (B,D), (C,A), (C,B), (C,D), (D,A), (D,B) or (D,C), corresponding to the following treatment regimens:
(A) 5 breaths of VR647 Inhalation Suspension delivered by the VR647 Inhalation System
(B) 10 breaths of VR647 Inhalation Suspension delivered by the VR647 Inhalation System
(C) 20 breaths of VR647 Inhalation Suspension delivered by the VR647 Inhalation System
(D) 1 mg/2 mL Pulmicort Respules delivered by a conventional jet nebulizer nebulized to empty
The treatment period comprises 2 dosing visits. Each subject will receive their first treatment regimen during Visit 2 and their second treatment regimen during Visit 3.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices. The modified PASAPQ consists of 10 questions. The first 8 questions generate the total score domain. Data from this questionnaire were listed by subject and summarized by treatment. The results from Questions 1 through 8 were added for each subject to generate the Total Score (n = Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5+Q6+Q7+Q8) and expressed as percentage of maximum total score (i.e., (n/56)*100). Questions 1 to 8 were answered using scores from 1 (i.e., very dissatisfied) to 7 (i.e., very satisfied).</description>

    <measure>Mean Modified PASAPQ Performance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Following dosing on Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 8 (Visit 3).</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices; it was originally a 15-item questionnaire, with performance assessed over 7 items. The modified PASAPQ (mPASAPQ) has 10 questions, including only 4 from the performance domain; the 3 questions not included were dropped from the mPASAPQ as they were not applicable to patient population and device under study. Questions 1, 2, 6, and 7 were assessed, covering satisfaction with nebulizer reliability, ease of inhalation, use and treatment time. Although specified in the protocol, the mPASAPQ performance score was not summarized in the efficacy analysis. The results for each question are presented below, however it was not considered appropriate to analyze the performance domain, as it is not possible to verify the validity of the questionnaire utilising only 4 of the original 7 questions. Questions were answered using scores from 1 (i.e., very dissatisfied) to 7 (i.e., very satisfied).</description>

    <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices. The modified PASAPQ consists of 10 questions.

    <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices. The modified PASAPQ consists of 10 questions. Question 10 asks about willingness to continue with the device(s) used in the trial.

      <pre_assignment_details>Seventeen subjects were enrolled and randomized to 1 of 12 crossover treatment sequences AB, AC, AD, BA, BC, BD, CA, CB, CD, DA, DB or DC. However, data were analyzed (and presented) by individual treatment only (i.e. A, B, C and D), not per treatment sequence. Fifteen subjects received at least 1 study treatment; 13 subjects completed the trial.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Modified Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire (PASAPQ) Total Score (Q1 to Q8).</title>
        <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices. The modified PASAPQ consists of 10 questions. The first 8 questions generate the total score domain. Data from this questionnaire were listed by subject and summarized by treatment. The results from Questions 1 through 8 were added for each subject to generate the Total Score (n = Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5+Q6+Q7+Q8) and expressed as percentage of maximum total score (i.e., (n/56)*100). Questions 1 to 8 were answered using scores from 1 (i.e., very dissatisfied) to 7 (i.e., very satisfied).</description>

        <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices; it was originally a 15-item questionnaire, with performance assessed over 7 items. The modified PASAPQ (mPASAPQ) has 10 questions, including only 4 from the performance domain; the 3 questions not included were dropped from the mPASAPQ as they were not applicable to patient population and device under study. Questions 1, 2, 6, and 7 were assessed, covering satisfaction with nebulizer reliability, ease of inhalation, use and treatment time. Although specified in the protocol, the mPASAPQ performance score was not summarized in the efficacy analysis. The results for each question are presented below, however it was not considered appropriate to analyze the performance domain, as it is not possible to verify the validity of the questionnaire utilising only 4 of the original 7 questions. Questions were answered using scores from 1 (i.e., very dissatisfied) to 7 (i.e., very satisfied).</description>

          <title>Mean Modified PASAPQ Score Indicating Willingness to Continue With the Device (Q10).</title>
          <description>The PASAPQ is a validated multi-item measure of satisfaction and preference with inhaler devices. The modified PASAPQ consists of 10 questions. Question 10 asks about willingness to continue with the device(s) used in the trial. Parents/legal guardians were asked to indicate how willing they would be for their child to use the nebulizer used during the study, providing a number between 0 (unwilling) and 100 (willing).</description>
          <population>Safety set included 15 (88%) subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.</population>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) and adverse device effects were monitored throughout the trial, until resolution. The total duration of participation for each subject was approximately 47 days, which included a 30-day screening period, two dosing visits with a washout period of 4 to 10 days between each dose, and a follow-up assessment approximately 7 days after last nebulization.</time_frame>
      <desc>Any changes from baseline (pre-dose value on Day 1) in vital signs and physical examination findings that were judged to be clinically significant were recorded as AEs.</desc>
