      Studies has shown an increasingly infection rate after splenectomy, and there is a potential
      correlation between microbiota and immune system. investigators suppose that increasingly
      infection can be associated with the alteration composition of the gut microbiota after
      splenectomy. It's investigators' aim to discover if any difference of gut microbiota is exist
      in patients who suffer from traumatic splenectomy compared with normal people, ultimately aim
      toreduce and mitigation infection rate through controlling gut microbiota.

      The spleen is crucial in regulating immune homoeostasis through its ability to link innate
      and adaptive immunity and to protect against infections. Asplenia refers to the absence of
      the spleen, a disorder that is rarely congenital and is more frequently as a result of
      surgery. Splenic hypofunction, as a result of asplenia can lead a series of changes in body
      systems. Recent study has show an increasingly infection rate after splenectomy including
      abdominal infection, pulmonary infection and cranial cavity infection.

      The gastrointestinal tract plays host to a diverse and metabolically complex community of
      microorganisms. Recent literature suggests that organisms in the gastrointestinal tract,
      referred to collectively as gut microbiota, play an indispensable role in the maintenance of
      host's homeostasis. Study has proved a potential correlation between microbiota and immune
      system. Lymphocyte, in either peripheral circulation or mesenteric lymph node, altered can
      lead to an composition change in microbiota.

      Investigators suppose that this phenomenon can be associated with the alteration of the
      resident commensal microenvironment after splenectomy compared to commensal communities. It's
      investigators' aim to discover if any difference of gut microbiota is exist in patients who
      suffer from traumatic splenectomy compared with normal people, ultimately aim toreduce and
      mitigation infection rate through controlling gut microbiota.
