  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol aims to comprehensively define the phenotype of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and to
      identify potential genetic factors, which may play a role in the variability of the disease's
      outcomes. The first aim involves a physical exam, a neurological exam, collection of medical
      history information, a clinical genetic evaluation, blood work and neuropsychological
      assessments. If clinically indicated, the protocol collects information from medical tests.
      These medical tests may include electrocardiography, echocardiography, renal ultrasonography,
      and renal ultrasound.

    <textblock>
      Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) or 22q13 Deletion syndrome, caused by a loss of one copy of
      the SHANK3 gene, is characterized by global developmental delay/intellectual disability,
      motor skills deficits, delayed or absent speech, and autism spectrum disorder. The goal of
      this study is to understand more about the PMS phenotypic outcomes and the biological
      pathways associated in the disorder, and to establish the foundation for future clinical
      trials in PMS and in other ID/ASD-associated disorders that share signaling pathways with
      PMS.

      Individuals with PMS will be asked to participate in this study if they are 22 years of age
      or older with pathogenic deletions or mutations of the SHANK3 gene at time of enrollment.
      Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study
      participation, individuals' primary communicative language must be English. Parents and
      unaffected siblings may also be asked to consent to have blood drawn for analysis.

      For this study, there is only one study visit. Study visit involves a physical exam, medical
      history questions, blood work and neuropsychological assessments. Individuals who have
      certain clinically indicated procedures (i.e. MRI, EEG, etc.) due will have them done as part
      of the research study
