  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of repeat-dose administration of
      brigatinib 180 milligram (mg) once daily (QD) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      midazolam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 20 participants to achieve approximately 15 PK-evaluable
      participants for assessment. This study will consist of 2 parts: Part A of the study will
      evaluate the effect of repeat-dose administration of brigatinib on the single-dose PK of
      midazolam. Part B of the study is exploratory and will allow participants to continue
      brigatinib until disease progression (PD). All participants will receive study drug via the
      oral route. Participants will be assigned to: Midazolam 3 mg + Brigatinib 90 mg.

      The overall time to participate in this study is 26 months. Participants will have a 28-day
      PK cycle in Part A and a maximum of 23 cycles in Part B, and a 30-day follow-up period after
      end of treatment.

Participants escalating to brigatinib 180 mg once daily will also receive midazolam 3 mg, orally, once on Day 21 of Part A Cycle 1. After completion of Part A, participants will continue into Part B. Participants in Part B will receive brigatinib up to 180 mg (or at the highest tolerated dose in Part A), orally, once daily in a 28 day treatment cycle, up to a maximum of 23 cycles or until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
