  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this clinical investigation is to establish the performance of the
      GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay on the revogene. This will be achieved by comparing the test to a
      conventional method for detection of Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and pyogenic
      Group C and G β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GCS/GGS) in throat swab samples.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay will be performed using the revogene™ instrument. The revogene
      instrument, used in conjunction with appropriate reagents, is capable of automated cell
      lysis, dilution of nucleic acids from multiple sample types as well as automated
      amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences.

      A dual swab sample is collected when ICF is signed by patient. One of the swab will be tested
      on the revogene™, and the second swab will be tested with standard microbiology method at a
      Reference Center.

    <description>To establish the performance characteristics of the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay for its use in determining the presence of Strep A, C/G in throat swab samples obtained from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis infection.
Sensitivity will be estimated as the proportion of positives that are correctly identified by the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay when compared to the Reference Method.
Specificity will be established as the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified by the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay when compared to the Reference Method.</description>

    <description>To establish the Positive and Negative Predictive Values (PPV and NPV) of the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay.
PPV will be calculated as the proportion of positive results with the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay that are true positive results when compared to the Reference Method.
NPV will be calculated as the proportion of negative results with the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay that are true negative results when compared to the Reference Method.</description>
