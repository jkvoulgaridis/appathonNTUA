  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of allogeneic adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes (donor T cell therapy) and to see how well they work in treating patients with a
      weakened immune system (immunocompromised) and adenovirus-related disease. Allogeneic
      adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are made from donated blood cells grown in the
      laboratory and are designed to kill viruses that can cause infections in immunocompromised
      patients with adenovirus-related disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of administering most closely human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched adenovirus specific T cell lines generated by ex vivo expansion as therapy of
      asymptomatic adenovirus viremia or adenovirus-related disease in immunocompromised hosts.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data about the efficacy of administering most closely HLA-matched
      adenovirus specific T cell lines generated by ex vivo expansion as therapy of adenovirus
      viremia or adenovirus-related disease.

      II. To assess the persistence of the administered cells in the patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Within two weeks of enrollment, patients receive allogeneic adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes (CTLs) intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients may receive additional
      allogeneic adenovirus-specific CTL infusions at the discretion of the investigator in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

          -  Patients with criteria of probable or definitive adenoviral diseases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving prednisone &gt; 0.1 mg/kg/day or equivalent at time of enrollment, or
             who have received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) within 14 days or have received donor
             lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or Campath within 28 days of enrollment.

             have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week prior to enrollment. Progressing
             infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new
             symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection.
