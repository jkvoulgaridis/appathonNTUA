  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to provide 16-week efficacy, safety and tolerability data
      versus placebo to support the use of secukinumab 150 mg by subcutaneous (s.c.)
      self-administration with or without a loading regimen and maintenance dosing using pre-filled
      syringe (PFS) and to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability up to 2 years in subjects with
      active PsA despite current or previous NSAID or DMARD therapy

    <measure>Number of Participants With American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR20 response is defined by at least 20% decrease in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 criteria:
Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, pain score on a visual analog scale, patient global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)]. ACR20 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Activity Score (DAS-C28-CRP) Score Change From Baseline Using MMRM at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-CRP score change from baseline using MMRM up to Week 16. DAS-CRP values range between 2.0 and 10. The higher the score, the higher the disease severity.
n: Number of subjects with measures at both baseline and the corresponding post baseline visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriatic Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a measure of disease activity based on extent of the disease, severity of erythema, scaling and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. PASI75 is an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% compared to baseline. PASI75 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Score (SF-36-PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from Baseline= post-Baseline - Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR50 response is defined by at least 50% decrease in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 50% improvement in 3 of the following 5 criteria: Health Assessment Questionnaire, pain score on a visual analog scale, patient global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)].
ACR50 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.

PASI75 is an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% compared to baseline. PASI75 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.

        <title>Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Score (SF-36-PCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from Baseline= post-Baseline - Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Score (SF-36-PCS)</title>
          <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from Baseline= post-Baseline - Baseline value.</description>

ACR50 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.
