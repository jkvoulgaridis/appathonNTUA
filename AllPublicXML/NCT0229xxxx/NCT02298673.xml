      Mucolipidoses (ML) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases in which both
      glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and another group of substances called sphingolipids build up in
      the body. GAGs are long, repeating chains of complex sugar molecules, and sphingolipids are
      fats. ML disorders may also be referred to as &quot;targeting defects&quot; because affected
      individuals are lacking the enzyme (a protein that produces chemical reactions in the body)
      that &quot;targets&quot; other enzymes to the lysosome (a sac-like structure found in a cell).

      Symptoms of ML can be congenital (present at birth) or begin in early childhood or
      adolescence. Early symptoms can include vision problems and developmental delays. Over time,
      many children with ML develop poor mental capacities, have difficulty reaching normal
      developmental milestones, and, in many cases, eventually die of the disease.

      Changes in specific genes results in the deficiency or absence of the targeting enzyme. The
      ML disorders are categorized into four groups based on the clinical features and enzyme
      deficiencies. ML-II and ML-III are the more common forms of ML. An individual is usually
      suspected of having an ML disorder based on clinical features. The diagnosis is further
      confirmed by laboratory testing.

      The mucolipidoses are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, that is, they occur only
      when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. When both
      parents carry a defective gene, each of their children faces a one in four chance of
      developing one of the MLs. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of
      inheriting only one copy of the defective gene. People who have only one defective gene are
      known as carriers. These individuals do not develop the disease but they can pass the
      defective gene on to their own children. Because the defective genes involved in certain
      forms of ML are known, tests can identify people who are carriers in some instances.

      The four types of ML are Sialidosis (sometimes referred to as ML I), and types II, III, and
      IV.

      • Mucolipidosis type I (Sialidosis) The Sialidoses are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
      disorders resulting from mutations in the NEU1 gene (6p21.3) which lead to an intracellular
      accumulation of glycoproteins containing sialic acid residues. Both types I and II are caused
      by mutations in the same gene.

      ML1 (NEU1 deficiency) is a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive deterioration of
      muscle and central nervous system functions. Myoclonus, mental deterioration,
      hepatosplenomegaly, muscle weakness and atrophy are common. The defect in neuraminidase
      activity leads to abnormal amounts of sialyl-oligosaccharides in the urine. Spinal
      deformities such as kyphosis are common. Deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Ataxia and
      hearing loss may be present. Coarse facies, a barrel chest, and short stature are
      characteristic. Hepatic cells contain numerous vacuoles and numerous inclusions.

      A cherry red spot is may be seen in late childhood or early adolescence. It occurs in nearly
      100% of patients with type I while only 75% of type II patients have this feature possibly
      because their early death from the more severe systemic disease prevents full ascertainment.
      Visual acuity is reduced, sometimes severely. Some but not all individuals have corneal and
      lens opacities. A subtle corneal haze has also been seen. Nystagmus has been reported.

      Sialidosis types I and II are both caused by mutations in the neuraminidase gene. Type I is
      associated with milder disease than type II which has an earlier age of onset and may present
      in infancy or even begin in utero. Early death within two years of age is common in the
      congenital or infantile forms. There is, however, significant variability in age of onset and
      the course of disease among types.

      • Mucolipidosis type II (I-Cell Disease) I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is a rare
      inherited metabolic disorder characterized by coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities
      and mental retardation. The symptoms of I-cell disease are similar to but more severe than
      those of Hurler syndrome. The symptoms associated with this disorder typically become obvious
      during infancy and may include multiple abnormalities of the skull and face and growth
      delays.

      This disorder belongs to a group of diseases known as lysosomal storage disorders. Lysosomes
      are particles bound in membranes within cells that break down certain fats and carbohydrates.
      Multiple enzyme deficiencies associated with I-cell disease lead to the accumulation of
      certain fatty substances (mucolipids) and certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides)
      within the cells of many tissues of the body.

      I-cell disease is caused by a mutation in the GNPTAB gene that leads to a deficiency in the
      enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucoseamine-1-phosphotransferase. I-cell disease is inherited as an
      autosomal recessive genetic trait.

      • Mucolipidosis type III (Pseudo-Hurler Polydystrophy) Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta is a
      slowly progressive disorder that affects many parts of the body. Signs and symptoms of this
      condition typically appear around age 3.

      Individuals with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta grow slowly and have short stature. They also
      have stiff joints and dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal abnormalities
      seen on x-ray. Many affected individuals develop low bone mineral density (osteoporosis),
      which weakens the bones and makes them prone to fracture. Osteoporosis and progressive joint
      problems also cause pain in people with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta, which becomes more
      severe over time.

      People with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta often have heart valve abnormalities and mild
      clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Their facial features become slightly
      thickened or &quot;coarse&quot; over time. Affected individuals may also develop frequent ear and
      respiratory infections. About half of people with this condition have mild intellectual
      disability or learning problems. Individuals with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta generally
      survive into adulthood, but they may have a shortened lifespan.

      Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta is a rare disorder, although its exact prevalence is unknown. It
      is estimated to occur in about 1 in 100,000 to 400,000 individuals worldwide Mutations in the
      GNPTAB gene cause mucolipidosis III alpha/beta. This gene provides instructions for making a
      part (subunit) of an enzyme called GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme helps prepare
      certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within the
      cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be
      reused by cells. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is involved in the process of attaching a
      molecule called mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) to specific digestive enzymes. Just as luggage is
      tagged at the airport to direct it to the correct destination, enzymes are often &quot;tagged&quot;
      after they are made so they get to where they are needed in the cell. M6P acts as a tag that
      indicates a digestive enzyme should be transported to the lysosome.

      Mutations in the GNPTAB gene that cause mucolipidosis III alpha/beta result in reduced
      activity of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. These mutations disrupt the tagging of digestive
      enzymes with M6P, which prevents many enzymes from reaching the lysosomes. Digestive enzymes
      that do not receive the M6P tag end up outside the cell, where they have increased activity.
      The shortage of digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate.
      Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, including mucolipidosis III
      alpha/beta, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis
      III alpha/beta are most likely due to the shortage of digestive enzymes inside lysosomes and
      the effects these enzymes have outside the cell.

      Mutations in the GNPTAB gene can also cause a similar but more severe disorder called
      mucolipidosis II alpha/beta. These mutations completely eliminate the function of
      GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta and mucolipidosis II alpha/beta
      represent two ends of a spectrum of disease severity.

      • Mucolipidosis type IV Mucolipidosis type IV (caused by mutations in the MCOLN1 gene) is an
      inherited disorder characterized by delayed development and progressive vision loss. The
      severe form of the disorder is called typical mucolipidosis type IV, and the mild form is
      called atypical mucolipidosis type IV.

      Approximately 95 percent of individuals with this condition have the severe form. People with
      typical mucolipidosis type IV have delayed development of mental and motor skills
      (psychomotor delay). Motor skills including: sitting, standing, walking, grasping objects,
      and writing. Psychomotor delay is moderate to severe and usually becomes apparent during the
      first year of life. Affected individuals have intellectual disability, limited or absent
      speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that gradually turns
      into abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), and problems controlling hand movements. Most
      people with typical mucolipidosis type IV are unable to walk independently. In about 15
      percent of affected individuals, the psychomotor problems worsen over time.

      Vision may be normal at birth in people with typical mucolipidosis type IV, but it becomes
      increasingly impaired during the first decade of life. Individuals with this condition
      develop clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea) and progressive breakdown of the
      light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (retina). By their early teens, affected
      individuals have severe vision loss or blindness.

      People with typical mucolipidosis type IV also have impaired production of stomach acid
      (achlorhydria). Achlorhydria does not cause any symptoms in these individuals, but it does
      result in unusually high levels of gastrin in the blood. Gastrin is a hormone that regulates
      the production of stomach acid. Individuals with mucolipidosis type IV may not have enough
      iron in their blood, which can lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). People with
      the severe form of this disorder usually survive to adulthood; however, they may have a
      shortened lifespan.

      About 5 percent of affected individuals have atypical mucolipidosis type IV. These
      individuals usually have mild psychomotor delay and may develop the ability to walk. People
      with atypical mucolipidosis type IV tend to have milder eye abnormalities than those with the
      severe form of the disorder. Achlorhydria also may be present in mildly affected individuals.

      Mucolipidosis type IV is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 people. About 70 percent of
      affected individuals have Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

      Mutations in the MCOLN1 gene cause mucolipidosis type IV. This gene provides instructions for
      making a protein called mucolipin-1. This protein is located in the membranes of lysosomes
      and endosomes, compartments within the cell that digest and recycle materials. While its
      function is not completely understood, mucolipin-1 plays a role in the transport
      (trafficking) of fats (lipids) and proteins between lysosomes and endosomes. Mucolipin-1
      appears to be important for the development and maintenance of the brain and retina. In
      addition, this protein is likely critical for normal functioning of the cells in the stomach
      that produce digestive acids.

      Most mutations in the MCOLN1 gene result in the production of a non-functional protein or
      prevent any protein from being produced. A lack of functional mucolipin-1 impairs transport
      of lipids and proteins, causing these substances to build up inside lysosomes. Conditions
      that cause molecules to accumulate inside the lysosomes, including mucolipidosis type IV, are
      called lysosomal storage disorders. Two mutations in the MCOLN1 gene account for almost all
      cases of mucolipidosis type IV in people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. It remains unclear
      how mutations in this gene lead to the signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis type IV.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the Disorder earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment. Examining blood samples will allow determining whether
      measurement is feasible in blood samples and will further promote early detection of
      mucolipidosis disorder type I, II, III or IV.
