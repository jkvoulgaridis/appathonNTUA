    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety, as well as subject satisfaction will be evaluated after single
      treatment with Azzalure/Dysport alone or Restylane/Emervel filler alone followed by repeated
      combined treatment with Azzalure/Dysport, Restylane/Emervel filler and Restylane Skinbooster.
      Subjects will be followed for up to 18 months after initial treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Improvement in Global Facial Aesthetic Appearance</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects showing superior global facial aesthetic appearance at month 7 compared to month 1.
Assessment of global facial aesthetic appearance was based on blinded evaluations of subject's youthful appearance (e.g. lack of facial volume loss, lack of static wrinkles and fine lines, good skin quality, and satisfactory result after aesthetic treatment).
The blinded evaluators retrospectively reviewed photographs from visit for each subject and answered the following question: &quot;At which set of photographs does the subject show superior global facial aesthetic appearance?&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>1, 7 and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects showing superior &quot;Global facial aesthetic appearance&quot; at 1, 7 and 13 months.
Assessment of global facial aesthetic appearance was based on blinded evaluations of subject's youthful appearance (e.g. lack of facial volume loss, lack of static wrinkles and fine lines, good skin quality, and satisfactory result after aesthetic treatment).
The blinded evaluators retrospectively reviewed photographs from visit for each subject and answered the following question: &quot;At which set of photographs does the subject show superior global facial aesthetic appearance?&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Improved on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) as Assessed by Blinded Evaluator</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 7, and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-graded GAIS was used to assess the facial aesthetic improvement from Baseline by responding to the question: &quot;How would you describe the subject's global facial aesthetic appearance compared to the photographs taken before treatment at Baseline?&quot;.
The following rating was used: Very much improved, Much improved, Somewhat improved, No change, or Worse.
Criteria for improvement met for those subjects that were assessed as Very much improved, Much improved, or Somewhat improved.
GAIS score was assessed by three blinded evaluators at Months 1, 7, and 13 (1 month after single treatment, 1 month after first combined treatment, and 1 month after second combined treatment). The blinded evaluators performed the evaluations retrospectively using 2D-photographs from each follow-up visit and from Baseline (Visit 1).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Satisfied With Facial Appearance</measure>
    <time_frame>7 and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects were asked to answer the question &quot;How satisfied are you today with the appearance of your face?&quot; with &quot;Very/somewhat satisfied&quot;, &quot;Neither/nor&quot;, or &quot;Very/somewhat dissatisfied&quot;. Satisfied criteria is fulfilled for those subjects that answered &quot;&quot;Very/somewhat satisfied&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants for Which the Investigator is Satisfied With the Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>7 and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigators answered the question &quot;How satisfied are you with the overall facial aesthetic outcome for the subject?&quot; with &quot;Very/somewhat satisfied&quot;, &quot;Neither/nor&quot;, or &quot;Very/somewhat dissatisfied&quot;. Satisfied criteria met for those subjects that the Investigator answered &quot;Very/somewhat satisfied&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Improved in Wrinkle Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>7 and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The wrinkle severity of the Azzalure/Dysport treated glabellar lines at maximum frown was evaluated by the Investigator.
A validated 5-graded photonumeric grading scale was used, where each severity grade was illustrated by a set of photographs.
0 = No glabella lines
= Mild glabella lines
= Moderate glabella lines
= Severe glabella lines
= Very severe glabella lines Improvement means going from higher score to lower score.</description>

The blinded evaluators retrospectively reviewed photographs from visit for each subject and answered the following question: &quot;At which set of photographs does the subject show superior global facial aesthetic appearance?&quot;.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Improved on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) as Assessed by Blinded Evaluator</title>
        <description>The 5-graded GAIS was used to assess the facial aesthetic improvement from Baseline by responding to the question: &quot;How would you describe the subject's global facial aesthetic appearance compared to the photographs taken before treatment at Baseline?&quot;.
The following rating was used: Very much improved, Much improved, Somewhat improved, No change, or Worse.
Criteria for improvement met for those subjects that were assessed as Very much improved, Much improved, or Somewhat improved.
GAIS score was assessed by three blinded evaluators at Months 1, 7, and 13 (1 month after single treatment, 1 month after first combined treatment, and 1 month after second combined treatment). The blinded evaluators performed the evaluations retrospectively using 2D-photographs from each follow-up visit and from Baseline (Visit 1).</description>
