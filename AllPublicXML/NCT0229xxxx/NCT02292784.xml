  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and outcomes of infants and
      children who were exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero in the Phase III spontaneous
      preterm labor (SPTL) treatment studies, to provide assurance that treatment is not associated
      with significant adverse outcomes in early childhood. The enrolled infants and children will
      be followed at pre-specified intervals until they reach 24 months chronological age. This
      study does not require medical interventions or study visits to an investigational site,
      instead, parents or legal guardians will be prompted at certain time points to complete
      developmental questionnaires and other data on their children's health status via an
      electronic device. Data collected during the infant and child follow up study will be managed
      by a centralized research coordinating center (RCC). Regionally based pediatricians will
      serve as study principal investigators (referred to as RCC-PIs) for this study. All
      communications the RCC-PI has with the parent/legal guardian or the child's health care
      provider (HCP) will occur remotely; there will be no clinic visits.

    <description>A congenital anomaly is a condition present at birth that results from malformation, deformation, or disruption in 1 or more parts of the body, a chromosomal abnormality, or a known clinical syndrome. Congenital anomaly serious adverse events (SAEs) were examined by the birth defect evaluator. Events were coded per centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) Metropolitan Atlanta congenital defects program (MACDP) criteria and/or European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) criteria. Predefined defect codes specified whether the defect was face and neck, a cleft lip or palate, cardiovascular, respiratory, upper gastrointestinal, female genitalia, male genitalia, renal and urinary system, other musculoskeletal defects, skin, a chromosome anomaly, other organ systems, or a specified syndrome. Number of infants and children with newly diagnosed congenital anomalies reported up to 1 year of chronological age and reported after 1 year of chronological age are presented.</description>

    <description>The CBCL/1.5 to 5 questionnaire is a parent-completed questionnaire used for assessing behavioral problems and social competencies. It included approximately 100 items that described specific kinds of behavioral, emotional, and social problems that characterized preschool children between the ages of 1.5 and 5 years. Each question could be answered as &quot;not true scored as&quot;0&quot;,somewhat or sometimes true scored as&quot;1&quot;or very true or often true scored as &quot;2&quot;. There were 6 questions related to attention and hyperactivity problems. The responses to those 6 questions were summed (ranged 0 to 12). Total score of 0 to 9 indicated normal, 10 indicated borderline and 11 to 12 indicated significant attention and hyperactivity problems. Scores above the 97th percentile are in the significant range of clinical concern. Number of infants with CBCL/1.5 to 5 score above 97th percentile for subset of pre-specified questions related to attention and hyperactivity problems at 24 months is reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Infants and Children With Newly Diagnosed Congenital Anomalies (After 28 Days Post Estimated Date of Delivery)</title>
        <description>A congenital anomaly is a condition present at birth that results from malformation, deformation, or disruption in 1 or more parts of the body, a chromosomal abnormality, or a known clinical syndrome. Congenital anomaly serious adverse events (SAEs) were examined by the birth defect evaluator. Events were coded per centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) Metropolitan Atlanta congenital defects program (MACDP) criteria and/or European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) criteria. Predefined defect codes specified whether the defect was face and neck, a cleft lip or palate, cardiovascular, respiratory, upper gastrointestinal, female genitalia, male genitalia, renal and urinary system, other musculoskeletal defects, skin, a chromosome anomaly, other organ systems, or a specified syndrome. Number of infants and children with newly diagnosed congenital anomalies reported up to 1 year of chronological age and reported after 1 year of chronological age are presented.</description>

At 9 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for communication was 13.97, gross motor was 17.82, fine motor was 31.32, problem solving was 28.72 and personal social skills was 18.91. Total score was derived by taking mean of all 5 components. Any infant who scored below the cut-off, a score more than or equal to 2 standard deviations below the mean score (that is Black zone in the score chart) in any of the 5 areas of the ASQ-3 was to be referred to a developmental specialist for a formal neurodevelopmental assessment. Number of infants with ASQ-3 scores for any domains in the black zone at 9 months is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Infants With Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) Score in the Black Zone for Fine Motor Skills</title>
        <description>The ASQ-3 included 6 questions in each area, designed to assess 5 areas of development: communication skills, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving skills, and personal social skills. Parents answered either yes (10 points), sometimes (5 points) or not yet (0 points) to each question to complete ASQ-3. At 9 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for fine motor skills was 31.32. At 18 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for fine motor skills was 34.32. At 24 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for fine motor skills was 35.16. Any infant who scored below the cut-off, a score more than or equal to 2 standard deviations below the mean score (that is Black zone in the score chart) in any of the 5 areas of the ASQ-3 was to be referred to a developmental specialist for a formal neurodevelopmental assessment. Number of infants with ASQ-3 scores for fine motor skills in the black zone at 9, 18 and 24 months is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Infants With Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) Score in the Black Zone for Problem Solving Skills</title>
        <description>The ASQ-3 included 6 questions in each area, designed to assess 5 areas of development: communication skills, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving skills, and personal social skills. Parents answered either yes (10 points), sometimes (5 points) or not yet (0 points) to each question to complete ASQ-3. At 9 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for problem solving skills was 28.72. At 18 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for problem solving skills was 25.74. At 24 months, the pre-defined cut-off score for problem solving skills was 29.78. Any infant who scored below the cut-off, a score more than or equal to 2 standard deviations below the mean score (that is Black zone in the score chart) in any of the 5 areas of the ASQ-3 was to be referred to a developmental specialist for a formal neurodevelopmental assessment. Number of infants with ASQ-3 scores for problem solving skills in the black zone at 9, 18 and 24 months is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Infants Referred for Developmental Evaluation Using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III)</title>
        <description>Any infant who scored below the cut-off i.e., a score greater than or equal to 2 Standard Deviations (SDs) below the mean score (i.e., black zone in the score chart) in any of the 5 domains of the ASQ-3 was referred to a developmental specialist for a neurodevelopmental evaluation using the BSID-III. It scaled scores for cognitive, language (receptive and expressive), motor (fine and gross motor). The language and motor areas each have a composite score, with a mean of 100, a SD of 15 and a range of 40 to 160. Scores lower than 70 indicated moderate or severe impairment. In the cognitive area, the infant scored &quot;1&quot; if they could do an activity and &quot;0&quot; if they could not. Total score was derived by taking mean of all the components. Number of infants referred for developmental evaluation using BSID-III is presented.</description>

          <title>Number of Infants Referred for Developmental Evaluation Using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III)</title>
          <description>Any infant who scored below the cut-off i.e., a score greater than or equal to 2 Standard Deviations (SDs) below the mean score (i.e., black zone in the score chart) in any of the 5 domains of the ASQ-3 was referred to a developmental specialist for a neurodevelopmental evaluation using the BSID-III. It scaled scores for cognitive, language (receptive and expressive), motor (fine and gross motor). The language and motor areas each have a composite score, with a mean of 100, a SD of 15 and a range of 40 to 160. Scores lower than 70 indicated moderate or severe impairment. In the cognitive area, the infant scored &quot;1&quot; if they could do an activity and &quot;0&quot; if they could not. Total score was derived by taking mean of all the components. Number of infants referred for developmental evaluation using BSID-III is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Infants With Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition Score Greater Than 2 Standard Deviation Below the Mean Score for the Fine Motor Scale (Less Than 4)</title>
        <description>Any infant who scored below the cut-off i.e., a score greater than or equal to 2 SDs below the mean score (i.e., black zone in the score chart) in any of the 5 domains of the ASQ-3 was referred to a developmental specialist for a neurodevelopmental evaluation using the BSID-III. It scaled scores for cognitive, language (receptive and expressive), motor (fine and gross motor). The language and motor areas each have a composite score, with a mean of 100, a SD of 15 and a range of 40 to 160. Scores lower than 70 indicated moderate or severe impairment. In the cognitive area, the infant scored &quot;1&quot; if they could do an activity and &quot;0&quot; if they could not. Number of infants with BSID-III score greater than 2 SD below the mean score for the fine motor scale (less than 4) is presented.</description>

        <description>The CBCL/1.5 to 5 questionnaire is a parent-completed questionnaire used for assessing behavioral problems and social competencies. It included approximately 100 items that described specific kinds of behavioral, emotional, and social problems that characterized preschool children between the ages of 1.5 and 5 years. Each question could be answered as &quot;not true scored as&quot;0&quot;,somewhat or sometimes true scored as&quot;1&quot;or very true or often true scored as &quot;2&quot;. There were 6 questions related to attention and hyperactivity problems. The responses to those 6 questions were summed (ranged 0 to 12). Total score of 0 to 9 indicated normal, 10 indicated borderline and 11 to 12 indicated significant attention and hyperactivity problems. Scores above the 97th percentile are in the significant range of clinical concern. Number of infants with CBCL/1.5 to 5 score above 97th percentile for subset of pre-specified questions related to attention and hyperactivity problems at 24 months is reported.</description>

          <title>Number of Infants With a Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 Years (CBCL/1.5 to 5) Score Above the 97th Percentile for a Subset of Prespecified Questions That Relate to Attention and Hyperactivity Problems</title>
          <description>The CBCL/1.5 to 5 questionnaire is a parent-completed questionnaire used for assessing behavioral problems and social competencies. It included approximately 100 items that described specific kinds of behavioral, emotional, and social problems that characterized preschool children between the ages of 1.5 and 5 years. Each question could be answered as &quot;not true scored as&quot;0&quot;,somewhat or sometimes true scored as&quot;1&quot;or very true or often true scored as &quot;2&quot;. There were 6 questions related to attention and hyperactivity problems. The responses to those 6 questions were summed (ranged 0 to 12). Total score of 0 to 9 indicated normal, 10 indicated borderline and 11 to 12 indicated significant attention and hyperactivity problems. Scores above the 97th percentile are in the significant range of clinical concern. Number of infants with CBCL/1.5 to 5 score above 97th percentile for subset of pre-specified questions related to attention and hyperactivity problems at 24 months is reported.</description>

        <description>The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent-reported autism screening tool designed to identify children 16 to 30 months of age who received a more thorough assessment for possible early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay. The M-CHAT-R/F consisted of 20 questions that were answered with either &quot;yes, scored as 0&quot; or &quot;no, scored as 1&quot;. Total scores (ranged 0 to 20) on the M-CHAT-R/F between 0 and 2 indicated a low risk, scores between 3 and 7 indicated a medium risk and triggered administration of the follow-up questionnaire, and scores between 8 and 20 indicated a high risk. Number of infants who needed further evaluation as per the M-CHAT-R/F at 18 and 24 months is presented.</description>
