    <textblock>
      Will a primary care-based behavioral intervention for patient activation and engagement and
      self-management, for patients with chronic pain who are taking opioid pain medication, result
      in better patient outcomes than Usual Care?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic pain (PWCP) typically have multiple chronic conditions, and many points
      of contact with the health system. They can feel disempowered, and experience fragmented care
      and poor outcomes. PWCP report concerns about under-treatment of pain, difficulties in
      obtaining medication, and stigma. Prescription opioids are a very common, and controversial,
      pain treatment. PWCP often lack the skills and knowledge to talk to their physicians about
      their pain and opioid use, and to navigate the health care system. The study's aims compare
      the effectiveness of an innovative behavioral Patient Activation plus Usual Care (PA+UC)
      intervention to Usual Care (UC) only on patient-centered outcomes among PWCP. While most
      studies have focused on chronic opioid users, this takes an upstream approach, focusing on
      patients as they start regular opioid use. The overarching research question is: Can
      patients' increased activation improve their quality of life? With our stakeholder group of
      patient, clinical, and operational advisors, we propose a pragmatic, randomized trial to
      examine the comparative effectiveness of a group-based PA intervention in two large primary
      care clinics in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). We will randomize 324 PWCP to
      either the PA+UC arm or UC only arm. The curriculum will cover patient activation and
      empowerment, how to talk to doctors about prescription opioid use, and self-management of
      chronic pain, including how to navigate the health care system and a patient portal. We will
      further develop the study questions, intervention curriculum, outcome measures, and
      dissemination plan with our stakeholder groups. We will examine effects over 12 months using
      follow-up patient interviews combined with electronic health records and a mixed effects
      modeling approach. Patient outcomes include patient-reported activation, quality of life,
      prescription opioid use, pain severity and function, patient-provider communication, patient
      satisfaction, knowledge of opioid use risks and benefits, self-care, including use of health
      information technology, and service utilization.

    <measure>Patient Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 and 12 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 13-item instrument for measuring patient beliefs, knowledge and confidence for engaging in a wide range of health behaviors.Each item is rated 1-4 (strongly disagree =1 to strongly agree=4) and a total raw score is generated (0-52). Raw scores are converted to activation scores using a published conversion table. PAM scores are reported on a 1-100 scale, with higher scores associated with positive health outcomes such as participation in health care and treatment adherence.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life: Physical Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 and 12 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Global Health score was used to assess general perceptions of health and quality of life. The 10 items that comprise the Quality of Life scale are reported as two dimensions, mental health and physical health. Raw scores for PROMIS Global Physical Health were converted to standardized T-scores using published conversion tables.T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A high score always represents more of the concept being measured. Thus, a person who has T-score of 60 is one standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population.</description>

    <measure>Pain Coping</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The 42-item Chronic Pain Coping Inventory (CPCI) is used to assess behavioral and cognitive pain coping strategies. It contains 8 subscales: Guarding, Resting, Asking for Assistance, Relaxation, Task Persistence, Exercising/Stretching, Coping Self-Statements, and Seeking Social Support. For each subscale, patients were asked the number of days (0-7 days) he/she performed each task (4-7 tasks). The mean score for each subscale is reported, with possible range of scores 0-7. The CPCI was developed to assess the behavioral coping strategies that are taught and encouraged during treatment (eg, relaxation, exercising, task persistence), ones that are discouraged (eg, guarding, resting, asking for assistance), and one neutral strategy (seeking social support). Active strategies are defined as adaptive coping responses (eg, staying busy or active), and higher scores are associated with positive coping.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life: Physical Health</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Global Health score was used to assess general perceptions of health and quality of life. The 10 items that comprise the Quality of Life scale are reported as two dimensions, mental health and physical health. Raw scores for PROMIS Global Physical Health were converted to standardized T-scores using published conversion tables.T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A high score always represents more of the concept being measured. Thus, a person who has T-score of 60 is one standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population.</description>

        <title>Opioid Misuse SOAPP</title>
        <description>The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients in Pain (SOAPP-5) is a 5 item survey used to identify aberrant behaviors related to long-term opioid treatment. Each item is rated 0 to 4 (with 0=never and 4=very often); ratings are added for all 5 items resulting in a range of possible scores 0-20. A higher score indicates greater risk for patients on long term opioids, and a score of =&gt; 4 is considered positive. Results reported are the number and % of participants who score =&gt; 4.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 6 and 12 months post randomization</time_frame>
        <population>The numbers at 6/12 months are lower than at baseline due to lost to follow up/withdrawals. In addition, the denominators for 6/12 month SOAPP are lower than other outcomes because questions were ONLY asked if participants took opioids at 6/12 (therefore, 36 excluded at 6 months, n=19 INT, n=17 UC, and 44 excluded at 12 months, n=25 INT, n=19 UC).</population>

        <title>Opioid Misuse COMM</title>
        <description>The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is used to identify aberrant behaviors related to long-term opioid treatment. It is a clinical screening tool for monitoring patients for opioid overuse and misuse in six areas. The COMM contains 17 items with total score range of 0-68, and a score of 9 or greater is considered positive. It uses a low cut off value as it is intended to over-identify misuse. Results reported are the number and % of participants who score =&gt; 9.</description>

        <title>Pain Coping</title>
        <description>The 42-item Chronic Pain Coping Inventory (CPCI) is used to assess behavioral and cognitive pain coping strategies. It contains 8 subscales: Guarding, Resting, Asking for Assistance, Relaxation, Task Persistence, Exercising/Stretching, Coping Self-Statements, and Seeking Social Support. For each subscale, patients were asked the number of days (0-7 days) he/she performed each task (4-7 tasks). The mean score for each subscale is reported, with possible range of scores 0-7. The CPCI was developed to assess the behavioral coping strategies that are taught and encouraged during treatment (eg, relaxation, exercising, task persistence), ones that are discouraged (eg, guarding, resting, asking for assistance), and one neutral strategy (seeking social support). Active strategies are defined as adaptive coping responses (eg, staying busy or active), and higher scores are associated with positive coping.</description>

        <description>Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) is an established 10-item measure of pain self-efficacy that is widely used in clinical settings to assess confidence in one's ability to work and lead a normal life despite pain. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale with 0= not at all confident and 6=extremely confident. A total score is calculated by summing the scores for each of 10 items, yielding max score of 60. A higher score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

Average number of visits are reported for 6 month period prior to baseline, for 3 months prior to 6 month interview, and 6 months prior to 12 month interview. For all three time periods, active membership in Kaiser health plan is required for 4 of 6 months, and 3 of 3 months for the 3-month period used in 6 month analysis.</description>

          <description>Primary care services (number of non-urgent outpatient visits) and acute care services (number of emergency room (ER) visits and inpatient stays) within KPNC as extracted from the electronic health records are reported. Average number of visits are reported for 6 month period prior to baseline, for 3 months prior to 6 month interview, and 6 months prior to 12 month interview. For all three time periods, active membership in Kaiser health plan is required for 4 of 6 months, and 3 of 3 months for the 3-month period used in 6 month analysis.</description>
          <population>EHR data were extracted for all study participants who remained active Kaiser members in the follow-up period, regardless of whether they completed the follow-up surveys or not. Due to incomplete membership in the follow-up period, 13 people were excluded from the 6-month EHR outcomes, and 16 people were excluded from the 12-month EHR outcomes.</population>

        <description>Use of Kaiser's online portal (kp.org) was reported by participants on questionnaire at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Participants were asked different ways in which portal was used, and if they used kp.org's health and wellness resources (healthy lifestyle programs, wellness coaching, audio podcasts, recipe blogs, tools/calculators, videos). Results reported here are number and % of patients who reported using Kaiser's online health and wellness resources during specified time period (&quot;ever&quot; at baseline, and &quot;past 6 months&quot; at 6/12 months).</description>

        <title>Prescription Opioid Use (EHR)</title>
        <description>Opioid prescription dispensations were extracted from electronic health records and converted into morphine milligram equivalent (MME), by multiplying the quantity of each prescription by the strength of prescription (milligrams of opioid/unit dispensed). The resulting product is then multiplied by the conversion factor for MMEs. We calculated the average daily MME dispensed for the relevant time periods. Results are reported for 3 time periods: 1) 6 months prior to baseline, 2) 3 months prior to 6 month interview, and 3) 6 months prior to 12 month interview. For all 3 time periods, active membership in Kaiser health plan is required for 4 of 6 months, and 3 of 3 months for the 3-month period used in 6 month analysis.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked about 9 categories of substance use in past 3 months, based on NIDA-modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Results are reported as number and percent for three categories: prescription/street opioids, cannabis and sedatives/sleeping pills. Remaining categories (cocaine, methamphetamines, stimulants, inhalants) were collapsed into &quot;other&quot; category.</description>

        <population>Due to the small number of participants who withdrew, or lost to follow up, the number of participants interviewed at 6/12 months is lower than number at baseline. Categories do not add up to number analyzed because answer were &quot;check all that apply&quot; and multiple answers per respondent were allowed.</population>
