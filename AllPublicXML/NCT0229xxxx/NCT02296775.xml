    <textblock>
      This study will compare the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and the change in disease activity
      score in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis following treatment with two 1000 mg doses
      of DRL_RI or one of two sources of rituximab (Rituxan® or MabThera®). Patients will also be
      monitored for safety, B cell depletion and recovery, and for the development of immune
      responses to the administered study drugs

    <measure>Mean Change in Disease Activity Score-C Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) From Baseline Per Unit Time at Weeks 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In clinical studies, Disease Activity Score (DAS) is used to assess improvement in disease activity in RA patients over time. The assessment involved an examination of 28 joints for swelling, tenderness, blood C-reactive protein (CRP), and a one on one consultation between the patient and healthcare professional. The results were combined to produce a score which indicated how active the RA was at that particular time. The disease activity is interpreted as low (DAS &lt;2.6), mild (2.6 to &lt;3.2), moderate (3.2 to &lt;5.1), and severe with DAS &gt; 5.1. A DAS score between 0 and 2.6 corresponds to remission. The analysis of DAS28-CRP was based on a generalized estimating equation model in RA patients with DAS28 score &gt; 3.2. The mean change was calculated from two time points (Value at 4 weeks minus baseline value).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) was assessed at Week 24. The disability assessment component of the HAQ, the HAQ-DI, assessed a patient's level of functional ability and included questions about fine movements of the upper extremities, locomotor activities of the lower extremities, and activities that involved both upper and lower extremities. There were 20 questions in 8 categories of functioning which represented a comprehensive set of functional activities-dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. The stem of each item asked over the past week &quot;Were you able to&quot; perform a particular task. The patient's responses were made on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). Each category contained at least 2 specific component questions.
Physical function was measured using the HAQ-DI Scores, which range from 0-3, with lower scores reflecting better physical function and thus, less disability.</description>

          <title>Disease Activity Score-C Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP)</title>
          <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS) is used to assess improvement in disease activity in RA patients over time. The disease activity is interpreted as low (DAS &lt;2.6), mild (2.6 to &lt;3.2), moderate (3.2 to &lt;5.1), and severe with DAS &gt; 5.1. A DAS score between 0 and 2.6 corresponds to remission. The analysis of DAS28-CRP was based on a generalized estimating equation model in RA patients with DAS28 score &gt; 3.2.</description>
          <population>All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug and provide at least the baseline (pre-infusion of infusion and one post-baseline assessment of PD endpoints will be included in the PD population. Patients with relevant protocol deviations thought to affect the evaluations of PD endpoints will not be included in the PD population.</population>

        <title>Mean Change in Disease Activity Score-C Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) From Baseline Per Unit Time at Weeks 4</title>
        <description>In clinical studies, Disease Activity Score (DAS) is used to assess improvement in disease activity in RA patients over time. The assessment involved an examination of 28 joints for swelling, tenderness, blood C-reactive protein (CRP), and a one on one consultation between the patient and healthcare professional. The results were combined to produce a score which indicated how active the RA was at that particular time. The disease activity is interpreted as low (DAS &lt;2.6), mild (2.6 to &lt;3.2), moderate (3.2 to &lt;5.1), and severe with DAS &gt; 5.1. A DAS score between 0 and 2.6 corresponds to remission. The analysis of DAS28-CRP was based on a generalized estimating equation model in RA patients with DAS28 score &gt; 3.2. The mean change was calculated from two time points (Value at 4 weeks minus baseline value).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 24.</title>
        <description>The health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) was assessed at Week 24. The disability assessment component of the HAQ, the HAQ-DI, assessed a patient's level of functional ability and included questions about fine movements of the upper extremities, locomotor activities of the lower extremities, and activities that involved both upper and lower extremities. There were 20 questions in 8 categories of functioning which represented a comprehensive set of functional activities-dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. The stem of each item asked over the past week &quot;Were you able to&quot; perform a particular task. The patient's responses were made on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). Each category contained at least 2 specific component questions.
Physical function was measured using the HAQ-DI Scores, which range from 0-3, with lower scores reflecting better physical function and thus, less disability.</description>
