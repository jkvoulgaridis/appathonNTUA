  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best dosing strategy when using Excimer Laser
      to treat plaque-type psoriasis. In this study, half of the body's psoriasis will be treated
      with a new dosing strategy, and the other half will be treated with the conventional method.
      We hope to show that the new dosing strategy will result in faster improvement of psoriasis.

      This is a randomized, assessor-blinded clinical trial to determine whether a novel
      plaque-based dosimetry strategy can improve the speed of response to excimer laser treatment
      in patients with plaque psoriasis. Each patient will receive plaque-based dosing on one side
      of the body and conventional dosing on the contralateral side. This design is based on the
      assumption that psoriasis usually affects patients in a symmetric distribution (e.g., knees
      and elbows) and the effect of excimer laser phototherapy is limited to the treated plaque.
      The side of the body treated with plaque-based dosimetry will be assigned using a table of
      random numbers. The assessor will be blinded to the treatment group. Each patient will be
      treated 1-2 times per week at the discretion of the investigator for a maximum of 10
      treatments.

          5. Fitzpatrick Skin Type I

          6. Subject has received ultraviolet B phototherapy or any topical anti-psoriatic therapy
             within two weeks prior to starting the study.

          7. Subject has received systemic or topical psoralen-ultraviolet A photochemotherapy
             within four weeks prior to starting the study.
