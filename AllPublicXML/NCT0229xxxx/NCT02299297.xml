  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study of tofacitinib taken daily for 6 months in the treatment of
      moderate to severe AA, and alopecia totalis or universalis, followed by 6 months follow-up
      off drug to assess the incidence and timing of recurrence of disease or documentation of
      delayed response to treatment. There will be the option of increasing the treatment duration
      up to an additional 6 months beyond the initially scheduled 6 months of treatment, if
      clinically indicated, and at the discretion of the investigator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disease of the immune system, known as an &quot;autoimmune&quot;
      disease. In the disease, the immune system mistakenly destroys the hair follicle, causing
      hair to fall out. Despite many people having this disease, research into its cause and new,
      better ways to treat AA has lagged far behind other similar diseases of the immune system.
      Currently, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved drugs for AA.

      Tofacitinib (made by Pfizer) is an intervention known to effectively treat a disease of the
      joints, known as rheumatoid arthritis. It is also being studied in the treatment of
      psoriasis, another &quot;autoimmune&quot; disease, by fighting inflammation. There are some genetic and
      chemical similarities between those with active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and
      AA,suggesting that treatment with the same drug is likely to be effective. In mice specially
      designed for testing drugs for the treatment of human alopecia, this medication worked to
      prevent the disease AA from starting in mice that would have otherwise developed the disease.
      To test Tofacitinib, we are going to treat 15 patients with moderate to severe AA for up to 6
      months. This is an &quot;open label&quot; study, meaning that there will not be a placebo group; all
      patients enrolled in the study will receive the active medication. The effectiveness of the
      medication will be measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined by physical exam and
      photography, as well as by patient and physician scoring. After the treatment period of up to
      6 months is completed, There will be the option of increasing the treatment duration up to an
      additional 6 months beyond the initially scheduled 6 months of treatment, if clinically
      indicated, and at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will be followed for another 6
      months off of the drug to see if the effects of treatment last and if there is delayed
      response. The safety of the medication, Tofacitinib, in patients with AA will also be
      evaluated. Blood work will be collected before medication is started, during the treatment
      period and after Tofacitinib is stopped in order to monitor for adverse effects of the
      medication. Small scalp biopsies and peripheral blood will be taken at the beginning of the
      study before treatment and at weeks 4 and 24. Additional, optional scalp biopsies and blood
      draws may be suggested at other important time points. The chemical analysis of these skin
      samples and blood will help us to understand how the disease happens, how the treatment
      works, and even guide us to better treatments in the future.

    <description>This is defined as 50% or greater hair re-growth from baseline as assessed by the Severity of ALopecia Tool (SALT) score after up to 24 weeks/6 months to 72 weeks/18 months of treatment. This is a relatively strict definition for defining responders and non-responders and was chosen to minimize the potential for spontaneous remission, in which fewer than 10% are expected to achieve this magnitude of hair regrowth spontaneously.</description>

    <description>To assess the durability of responses, patients who achieve 50% regrowth from baseline during the first 6 to 18 months, will continue to be followed for an additional 6 months post-treatment or until it is determined that relapse has occurred. Durability of response was measured by comparing SALT scores from baseline to 24 weeks after treatment.</description>

          -  Patients have &gt;30% and &lt;95% total scalp hair loss at baseline as measured using the
             SALT score to qualify as moderate to severe patch type AA; and 95-100% scalp hair loss
             to qualify as alopecia totalis or universalis.

          -  Duration of hair loss greater than 3 months without an upper limit of duration as long

          -  No evidence of significant active ongoing regrowth present at baseline.

          -  Patients with a history of alopecia totalis/universalis can be included as long as the
             current episode of hair loss meets the criteria of 30 to 95% hair loss (i.e. they are
             not currently AT or AU), and as long as in the opinion of the investigator there does

             totalis/universalis may be included in this study.

          -  Vaccinations should be up to date in agreement with current immunization guidelines

          -  Target Disease Exceptions

               1. Patients with current alopecia totalis/universalis (i.e. 100% scalp or 100% scalp
                  and body loss, respectively) may be enrolled.

                  or seborrheic dermatitis.

               3. Patients in whom the diagnosis of alopecia areata is in question or in whom the
                  pattern of hair loss is such that quantification of hair loss and assessment of
                  regrowth is difficult. E.g patients with diffuse alopecia areata. This assessment
                  is at the investigator's discretion.

               4. Patients with active medical conditions or malignancies (except adequately
                  treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma) that in the opinion of the investigator
                  would increase the risks associated with study participation, including patients
                  with a history of recurrent infections.

               5. Patients with hemoglobin levels &lt;9 g/dL, lymphocyte count &lt;500 cells/mm3,

               2. Patients receiving one or more concomitant medications that result in both
                  moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g.,
                  fluconazole).

               3. Patients known to be HIV or hepatitis B or C positive.

               4. Patients with evidence of infection or active/untreated skin cancer.

                  hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, or
                  cerebral disease, which, in the opinion of the investigator, might place a
                  subject at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

               8. Female patients who have had a breast cancer screening that is suspicious for
                  malignancy and in whom the possibility of malignancy cannot be reasonably
                  excluded by additional clinical, laboratory, or other diagnostic evaluations.

                  skin cell cancers cured by local resection or carcinoma in situ. Existing
                  non-melanoma skin cell cancers should be removed, the lesion site healed, and

                  first dose of study medication. Subjects may not receive live vaccine
                  concurrently with tofacitinib.

              14. Patients with a history or symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation or
                  disorders that might increase the risk of GI perforation such as gastric ulcers
                  or diverticulitis.

              15. Patients who take NSAIDs at high dose or on a frequent basis, which in the
                  investigator's opinion might increase the risks of gastrointestinal perforation.

              16. Patients with any serious bacterial infection within the last 3 months, unless
                  treated and resolved with antibiotics, or any chronic bacterial infection (e.g.,

Patients will then be followed for 6 months off the drug to assess the incidence and timing of recurrence of disease or documentation of delayed response to treatment.
