  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of blood clots are at risk of developing additional clots in the
      future. Doctors use a tool called a clinical decision rule to tell them how likely it is that
      a patient has a blood clot and if they should have further testing to look for the clot. This
      tool may cause doctors to over-diagnosis a recurrent clot because the symptoms may be left
      over from the previous clot. Correctly diagnosing a recurrent blood clot is very important
      since there are risks associated with both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis. If a recurrent
      blood clot is missed (under-diagnosis) the patient is at risk of death from a clot in the
      lungs. If blood thinners are prescribed when they are not needed (over-diagnosis), the
      patient may have to take blood thinners for their lifetime and risk having serious bleeding.

      Several tools have been developed to standardize the diagnostic management of a suspected
      first blood clot. One of these tools is the use of a clinical decision rule. Clinical
      decision rules have been designed to help clinicians make diagnostic and therapeutic
      decisions at the bedside. A score is computed on the presence of some criteria from the
      patient's medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. The score provides the probability of
      a blood clot. The rules can be used in combinations with a simple blood test - called D-dimer
      - to identify patients at low risk who don't require diagnostic imaging testing. Benefits
      include reduced costs, length in hospital and radiation exposure.

      Patients with prior blood clots have been shown to be less likely to benefit from the
      non-invasive testing. Therefore, they often need to undergo imaging tests, which are
      frequently difficult to interpret in patients with prior blood clots since residual clots are
      often present and are difficult to distinguish from a recurrent clot.

      The objective of this study is to try to prospectively assess the role of existing clinical
      decision rules in patients with prior blood clots, and to attempt to improve them in order to
      increase the yield of non-invasive testing and to reduce the risk of over-diagnosis with
      imaging tests.

      With respect to this study, clots within the deep veins of the legs are called deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT), while clots in the lungs are called pulmonary embolism (PE).
