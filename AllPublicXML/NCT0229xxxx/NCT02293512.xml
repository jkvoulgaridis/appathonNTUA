  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus (i.e., ringing in the ears) is currently the most prevalent disability among
      Veterans. A range of clinical interventions has been created to systematically address the
      range of issues caused by tinnitus. While numerous interventions purport to promote coping
      strategies for tinnitus-related problems, few studies directly target and measure coping
      outcomes. The present pilot study proposes a comparison of coping outcomes after 3
      psycho-educational groups: a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, a Coping
      Effectiveness Training (CET) intervention, or an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      intervention among Veterans with tinnitus. These groups will be compared to a usual care
      group among Veterans and civilians with tinnitus. The proposed study will be the first
      application of CET to tinnitus. The primary goals of this study are to develop a CET protocol
      for tinnitus and to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT, CET, and ACT interventions to a usual
      care group. The long-term goal of this study is to improve the quality of life among
      individuals with tinnitus.

      Tinnitus (i.e., ringing in the ears) is currently the most prevalent disability in the VA
      system. Numerous clinical interventions have been created to systematically address the range
      of issues caused by tinnitus. Only a few tinnitus interventions have focused on coping
      strategies. Coping strategies are cognitive, affective, and behavioral attempts to master new
      events, such as the onset of a disability or an impairment like tinnitus, that are
      overwhelming to an individual, and that because of their newness, an individual does not
      necessarily have automatic, adaptive responses. Evidence suggests that CET is effective in
      facilitating adaptive coping strategies among individuals with several types of impairments
      or disabilities. The proposed study will be the first application of CET to a tinnitus
      population.

      The present study proposes a development of a CET protocol for tinnitus and a pilot study
      that assesses the effectiveness of the CET and ACT interventions compared to the current
      clinical practice of using a CBT intervention. All 3 psycho-educational interventions will be
      compared to a usual care group. The overarching goal of the proposed pilot study is to gain
      information that can be used to provide individuals with tinnitus with the best care for
      helping them to more successfully cope with tinnitus.

      The aims of this research are to: 1) develop a CET protocol for tinnitus by means of
      information gathered from two focus groups and from CET consultants; 2) to examine whether a
      3-session CET psycho-educational intervention is more effective than a 3-session CBT
      psycho-educational intervention or a 3-session ACT psycho-educational intervention, as
      compared to a usual care, in increasing coping strategies among individuals with tinnitus.

    <description>The Brief COPE scale (Carver, 1997) is a widely-used 28-item short form of the COPE Inventory (Carver, Scheier et al., 1989). This instrument measures 14 coping subscales. Each item is scored using a 1-4 frequency scale (i.e., 1= &quot;I haven't been doing this it at all&quot; to 4= &quot;I've been doing this a lot&quot;), where higher scores reflect greater use of the coping strategy. A three-factor structure was used as follows: (a) Engagement coping (EC), including active coping, positive reframing, planning, accepting, and use of humor (items n = 12; score range 12-48); (b) disengagement coping (DC), including self-distancing, denial, behavioral disengagement, and self-blame (items n = 6; score range 6-24); and (c) social support coping (SS), including instrumenal support, emotional support, venting, and religion (items n = 8; score range 8-32).</description>

    <description>Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) is provided in a 3-session intervention to facilitate coping strategies among individuals with tinnitus. The CET psychoeducational intervention teaches coping skills to increase understanding of stress and coping with tinnitus, and to help individuals better know how to match appropriate coping strategies, based on whether the stressful situation is changeable or not.</description>

        <title>Coping</title>
        <description>The Brief COPE scale (Carver, 1997) is a widely-used 28-item short form of the COPE Inventory (Carver, Scheier et al., 1989). This instrument measures 14 coping subscales. Each item is scored using a 1-4 frequency scale (i.e., 1= &quot;I haven't been doing this it at all&quot; to 4= &quot;I've been doing this a lot&quot;), where higher scores reflect greater use of the coping strategy. A three-factor structure was used as follows: (a) Engagement coping (EC), including active coping, positive reframing, planning, accepting, and use of humor (items n = 12; score range 12-48); (b) disengagement coping (DC), including self-distancing, denial, behavioral disengagement, and self-blame (items n = 6; score range 6-24); and (c) social support coping (SS), including instrumenal support, emotional support, venting, and religion (items n = 8; score range 8-32).</description>
