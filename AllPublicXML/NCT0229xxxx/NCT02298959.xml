  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ziv-aflibercept when given
      together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      places in the body (advanced). Ziv-afibercept works by decreasing blood and nutrient supply
      to the tumor, which may result in shrinking the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ziv-aflibercept
      together with pembrolizumab may be a better treatment for patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dosing for the combination
      of ziv-aflibercept plus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with unresectable stage III or
      stage IV melanoma, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, or sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of progression-free survival at 6 months. II. To obtain
      preliminary estimates of the rate of 1-year overall survival. III. To obtain preliminary
      estimates of the response rate. IV. To obtain preliminary estimates of time to progression.
      V. To perform correlative sciences that provide information regarding the mechanisms of
      action for this combination treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose expansion study of ziv-aflibercept.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and
      ziv-aflibercept IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 12 weeks.

             initial restaging from initiation of treatment, as evidenced by progression by RECIST
             1.1; acquired resistance would be a subject who had a best overall RECIST response of
             stable disease, partial response, or complete response confirmed radiographically by a

          -  Patients with carcinomatous meningitis should also be excluded

          -  Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are
             stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 3 months prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline),
             have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for

             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents; patients with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; patients that

             excluded from the study; patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or ziv-aflibercept (prior treatment
             with bevacizumab is not an exclusion criteria)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  If pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment; pregnant women are excluded
             from this study because MK-3475 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study; MK-3475 may have
             adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475 has
             transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm; patients are excluded from this
             study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within
             the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening
             visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment

          -  Men and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to
             use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive; highly
             unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a
             woman who is &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years will
             be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the
             study; the two birth control methods can be barrier method or a barrier method plus a
             hormonal method to prevent pregnancy; patients should start using birth control from
             study visit 1 throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study
             therapy; the following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception:
             diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide;
             appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed
             contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including
             oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents); patients should continue
             contraceptive measures for 6 months from the last dose of all study medications;
             patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks
             to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in order to
             participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described
             above) for the duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined; if there
             is any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for
             contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study; pregnancy: If a
             patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-3475, the patient
             will immediately be removed from the study; the site will contact the patient at least
             monthly and document the patient's status until the pregnancy has been completed or
             terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported without delay and within 24
             hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion,
             congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother
             or newborn); the study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to
             follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn;
             if a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must
             be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed; it is unknown whether
             MK-3475 is excreted in human milk; since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and
             because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients
             who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment

          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they
             meet the following eligibility requirements:

               -  They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy
                  from an HIV perspective

               -  They must have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count of greater than 250
                  cells/mcL

               -  They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection

          -  Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is
             detected)

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  History within 6 months prior to treatment of myocardial infarction, severe/unstable
             angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke or transient ischemic
             attack (TIA)

          -  History within 3 months prior to treatment of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal (GI)
             bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or
             gastritis, infectious or in
