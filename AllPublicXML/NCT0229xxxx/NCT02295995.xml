      The purpose of this study is to examine whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms
      impact adherence to a 12-week physical activity program and whether exercise can help improve
      PTSD symptoms and health outcomes in older Veterans. Veterans over the age of 60 with PTSD
      were be recruited to participate in a 12-week physical activity program consisting of aerobic
      and strengthening activities. 54 participants were randomized to an intervention arm (n=36)
      or usual care wait-list control (n=18).

    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence that physical inactivity contributes to poorer physical health
      outcomes in older adults. There is a paucity of work examining physical activity in Veterans
      with PTSD. Consequently, the efficacy of exercise as a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the
      treatment for PTSD symptoms and related health sequelae has not been established. Methods:
      Approximately 50 Veterans 60 years and older with PTSD will be recruited to participate in a
      12-week physical activity program consisting of aerobic and strength-training activities.
      Participants will be randomized to an intervention arm or usual care wait-list control.
      Outcomes: Changes in physical function, PTSD symptom severity, and aerobic endurance will be
      assessed between the two study arms. Summary: This pilot trial will extend the investigators'
      understanding of the physical and psychological benefits of physical activity in Veterans
      with PTSD. The results from this study will be used to be used to develop a larger,
      randomized controlled exercise trial for Veterans with PTSD. Once new, effective exercise
      therapies for Veterans with PTSD are established, we can augment traditional PTSD therapy
      with exercise therapy to promote the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases common in
      this vulnerable population.
