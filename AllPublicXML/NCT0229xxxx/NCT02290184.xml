  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial intervention to improve lifestyle behaviors
      (physical activity and health diet) for Filipino Americans with type 2 diabetes on metformin.
      If the PilAm Go4Health intervention demonstrates potential efficacy, it may identify
      effective intervention strategies to significantly reduce risks for heart disease risks
      (i.e., metabolic syndrome) in Filipino Americans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Filipino Americans are the second largest Asian population and fastest growing racial group
      in the United States. They have one of the highest rates of insulin resistance (type 2
      diabetes = T2DM) and central obesity (fat distributions primarily in the abdominal region).
      T2DM and central obesity are two of five major risk factors for metabolic syndrome that lead
      to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Key factors contributing to obesity and T2DM in
      Filipinos are their physical inactivity, and a diet high in fat and soda intake. However,
      there are very few research studies on improving health behaviors to reduce risks for
      metabolic syndrome in Filipino Americans. To help reduce the risk of developing metabolic
      syndrome in overweight/obese Filipino Americans with T2DM, the proposed project will test a
      culturally appropriate health behavior intervention program to reduce weight and waist
      circumference, through increasing physical activity, and lowering fat and sugar sweetened
      beverage intake. This intervention uses a mobile phone health app and social networking to
      encourage adherence to target health behaviors. The goals are to:

        1. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the culturally appropriate PilAm Go4Health
           Weight Loss Program

        2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of the intervention on weight

        3. To conduct post-program process evaluations too improve the intervention relevancy for
           the target population.

      <pre_assignment_details>During the 2-week run-in, eligible participants are asked to wear Fitbit pedometer every day for 10 hours/day, take photos with their smart phone of each meal for 3 consecutive days, and email these photos to research study email.
Those who pass the physical exam, serum lab test, and run-in period are then randomized to one of two study groups.</pre_assignment_details>
