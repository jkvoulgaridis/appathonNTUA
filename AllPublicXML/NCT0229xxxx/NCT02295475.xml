    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the safety and effectiveness of two blood thinners,
      apixaban and warfarin, for the prevention of blood clots in patients who have a higher risk
      of blood clots than the general population, a condition called &quot;antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;.

  <detailed_description>

      This study is a prospective, open-label, blinded event, pilot study that will randomize
      patients with a history of venous thrombosis and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) already
      receiving anticoagulation to either warfarin or apixaban. The study will assess the safety
      and efficacy of apixaban compared with adjusted dose warfarin for the prevention of recurrent
      thrombosis (defined as the aggregate of arterial or venous thrombosis) and vascular death.
      The primary efficacy outcome will be confirmed upon adjudication by a panel blinded to the
      treatment arm. The primary safety outcome will be major bleeding and clinically relevant
      non-major bleeding events. Patients who consent to study participation will be randomized to
      anticoagulation with adjusted dose warfarin sodium or apixaban 5 mg by mouth twice daily.
      This pilot study will also provide information and experience identifying, recruiting,
      enrolling and randomizing patients with APS and a history of venous thrombosis to
      anticoagulation with apixaban or warfarin for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis.

    <description>Major bleeding is clinically overt bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 2 g per deciliter or more, transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red cells, bleeding at a critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intraarticular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal), or fatal bleeding. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as clinically overt bleeding that does not satisfy the criteria for major bleeding and that led to hospital admission, physician-guided medical or surgical treatment, or a change in antithrombotic therapy.</description>

        Resonance Imaging (MRI). A brain MRI without contrast including weighted imaging and
        fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) will be performed as a study procedure to rule
        out prior stroke. If the patient has radiographic evidence of prior stroke on this MRI,
        then the patient will not be randomized, and will not be included in future study
        procedures or study analyses.
