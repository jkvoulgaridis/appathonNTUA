    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if pre-operative neuropsychological characteristics,
      apolipoprotein E4 status and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biomarkers can predict
      those most at risk of post-operative delirium. Patients over the age of 65 years undergoing
      elective primary hip or knee arthroplasty in Musgrave Park Hospital are invited to take part.
      Participants undergo a pre-operative neuropsychological assessment which is repeated 6-12
      weeks post-operatively at the time of surgical review appointment. At the time of surgery
      advantage is taken of the necessary venous cannulation and spinal anaesthetic to gain venous
      blood and CSF samples respectively. Venous blood is also sampled post-operatively. Patients
      are assessed daily for delirium, using the Confusion Assessment Method, until discharge.
