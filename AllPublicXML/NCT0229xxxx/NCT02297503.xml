    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety, as well as subject satisfaction will be evaluated after single
      treatment with Azzalure alone or Restylane/Emervel filler alone followed by repeated combined
      treatment with Azzalure, Restylane/Emervel filler and Restylane Skinbooster. Subjects will be
      followed for up to 18 months after initial treatment.

    <measure>Number of Participants Improved on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) as Assessed by Blinded Evaluator</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, Month 7, and Month 13</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-graded GAIS is used to assess the facial aesthetic improvement from baseline by responding to the question: &quot;How would you describe the subject's global facial aesthetic appearance, compared to the photographs taken before treatment at baseline?&quot; The scale grades are Very much improved, Much improved, Somewhat improved, No change, Worse. Improved subjects are those graded as Very much improved, Much improved, and Somewhat improved.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had Improvement in Wrinkle Severity Score of Treated Glabellar Lines (Validated Photo Scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 7 and Month 13</time_frame>
    <description>The wrinkle severity of the glabellar lines at maximum frown was evaluated by the investigator at baseline before first treatment and at follow-up visits. Validated photonumeric grading scales were used where each severity grade is illustrated by a set of photographs. The investigator performed the assessment live or by using 2D photographs from the present visit, together with the respective photo guide: 0 No glabella lines, 1 Mild glabella lines, 2 Moderate glabella lines, 3 Severe glabella lines, 4 Very severe glabella lines. Improved criteria is thus fulfilled for subjects receiving a lower score compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Perceived Age of Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 7 months, and 1 and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate First impression and perceived age of subjects by evaluation of photos.
Change between timepoints are reported. A negative value indicates that the participant is assessed to be younger at the specified visit compared to the assessment made at 1 month after single treatment.</description>

        <description>The wrinkle severity of the glabellar lines at maximum frown was evaluated by the investigator at baseline before first treatment and at follow-up visits. Validated photonumeric grading scales were used where each severity grade is illustrated by a set of photographs. The investigator performed the assessment live or by using 2D photographs from the present visit, together with the respective photo guide: 0 No glabella lines, 1 Mild glabella lines, 2 Moderate glabella lines, 3 Severe glabella lines, 4 Very severe glabella lines. Improved criteria is thus fulfilled for subjects receiving a lower score compared to baseline.</description>
