  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhoea is the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) associated with Lapatinib
      treatment, and is also commonly associated with Capecitabine treatment. Although these events
      are generally mild to moderate in severity, diarrhoea adversely affects the tolerability of
      cancer treatment, and in severe cases diarrhoea has the potential to affect the efficacy of
      treatment due to poor compliance, or treatment interruption or withdrawal. The efficacy of
      Octreotide in the management of cancer treatment-associated diarrhoea has not been
      extensively evaluated in large, well-controlled studies. This is a randomised, multi-centre,
      open-label Phase II study in subjects with Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer which has progressed following prior therapy, which
      must have included anthracyclines and taxanes and therapy with Trastuzumab in the metastatic
      setting. This study is not placebo controlled, and there is no active comparator. The study
      evaluates whether the prophylactic use of Octreotide Long Acting Release (LAR) offers a
      clinically meaningful benefit by reducing the frequency and severity of diarrhoea associated
      with treatment with Lapatinib and Capecitabine. Study completion for a subject is defined as
      the completion of 24 weeks of treatment with Lapatinib and Capecitabine, or progression of
      cancer or the death of the subject during treatment, whichever occurs first. Approximately
      140 subjects were planned to be randomized out of which 70 were planned to receive octreotide
      and 70 were planned to receive no Octreotide.

Two 20mg intramuscular injections were given to deliver a total dose of 40mg. The Octreotide is uniformly distributed within the microspheres which are made of a biodegradable glucose star polymer, D,L-lactic and glycolic acids copolymer.
