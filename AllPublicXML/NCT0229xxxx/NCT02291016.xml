  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare drug delivery and lung function after treatment with
      formoterol from a nebulizer versus a dry powder inhaler (DPI) in patients recovering from
      severe exacerbations of COPD. This is to determine if one device is superior in providing
      better lung function and drug deposition in this clinical setting.

    <time_frame>Measured at visit 1 and again at the end of visit 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Shortness of Breath Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale The scale goes from 0-10, zero meaning no difficulty breathing and ten meaning maximal difficulty.

        <title>Change in FEV1 as a Percentage of Predicted Normal After Inhalation of Formoterol</title>
        <description>Change in FEV1 from Baseline through 4 hours post formoterol dose. This was completed at visit 1 and visit 2.
Steps:
A baseline (pre-dose formoterol) FEV1 was recorded.
Subjects were dosed with formoterol.
Serial FEV1 assessments were completed at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, and 4 hour post dose of formoterol and serial FEV1 values were recorded.
A percentage of change from baseline FEV1 to each serial measurement of FEV1 was collected. The % of change at each time point was then used to get a measure of overall percentage change of the predicted FEV1 value.</description>

            <title>Formoterol With Dry Powder Inhaler and Placebo With Nebulizer</title>
            <description>Formoterol: One dosing of 12 µg via dry powder inhaler at either visit 1 or visit 2 depending on randomization assignment, which is detailed below.
Randomization:
Group A: Received formoterol via DPI and placebo via nebulizer at treatment visit #1, and formoterol via nebulizer and placebo via DPI at treatment visit 2.
Group B: Received formoterol via nebulizer and placebo via a DPI at treatment visit #1, and formoterol via a DPI with placebo via nebulizer at treatment visit 2.
Placebo: Comparison of drug administered via a nebulizer versus a dry powder inhaler. The placebo used will be sterile, preservative free, normal saline for inhalation for the nebulizer and a matched capsule without active drug for the dry powder inhaler. All patients will receive 2 ml of normal saline with the nebulizer to match the volume of nebulized formoterol solution. Patients will receive formoterol and placebo at both study visit #1 and visit #2.</description>

          <title>Change in Dyspnea Based on the Borg Dyspnea Scale for Shortness of Breath (Pre-dose Administration and 60 Minutes After Inhalation of Formoterol With a Nebulizer or a DPI)</title>
          <description>The Shortness of Breath Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale The scale goes from 0-10, zero meaning no difficulty breathing and ten meaning maximal difficulty. A decrease of score indicates an improvement. Patients were asked to complete the scale pre-dose and again one hour post formoterol dose. This was completed at both visit 1 and visit 2. The value recorded was the difference between the baseline value and the post 60 minute value.</description>
