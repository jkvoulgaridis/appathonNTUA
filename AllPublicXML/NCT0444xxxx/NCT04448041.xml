      Aims: The CRANE feasibility study (A mixed methods study of malnutrition and sustainable
      nutritional intervention for patients undergoing cancer surgery in low- and middle-income
      countries) aims to investigate the identification of pre-operative malnourishment, data
      collection methods and acceptability of a nutritional intervention for a future trial to
      improve outcomes after cancer surgery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

        1. To identify and validate the most relevant nutritional screening tool for patients in
           LMICs undergoing surgery for cancer;

        2. To identify a low cost sustainable nutritional intervention for patients in LMICs
           undergoing surgery for cancer;

        3. To establish the feasibility of delivering a randomised trial of a sustainable
           nutritional intervention for patients in LMICs undergoing surgery for cancer.

      Design: A mixed-methods study comprising of qualitative work including focus groups and
      interviews, trial of data collection and validation to test feasibility in clinical practice

      Participants: Patients undergoing elective surgery for suspected cancer in LMICs

      Outcomes Work package (WP) 1: The primary deliverable is the identification of a relevant,
      pragmatic, and acceptable nutritional screening tool.

      WP 2: The primary deliverable is the identification of a low-cost and sustainable nutritional
      intervention. Focus groups and interviews will be held with patients and clinicians to
      explore the sustainability, implementation and acceptability of screening and interventions.

      WP 3: The primary outcome will be to determine feasibility and acceptability of trial design.
      A number of outcome assessments and data collection instruments will be evaluated for
      feasibility, including anthropometric parameters and patient outcomes (30-day mortality,
      major post-operative complications, length of hospital stay and quality of life). A final
      study design, analysis plan, and health economic plan will be developed.

      Sample size: For this feasibility study, the investigators will conduct multidisciplinary
      focus groups and interviews, perform and validate malnutrition screening in 200 patients
      across four countries and record patient 30-day outcomes. This will also include the time
      taken to collect data on 200 eligible patients. This sample size has been informed from
      previous malnutrition data originating from a large prospective international multicentre
      observational cancer study (GlobalSurg 3).
