      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of Lenvatinib
      (MK-7902/E7080) in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid

Participants will score each category on a scale from 1-7 ranging from super bad (score = 1) to super good (score = 7).
