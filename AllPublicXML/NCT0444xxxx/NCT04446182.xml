  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, Phase II trial designed to assess the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      itacitinib in combination ECP and efficacy of the combination after 24 weeks of therapy. The
      trial will consist of two parts: Part One will assess the RP2D. For dose-finding purposes,
      the DLT evaluation period will be defined as the time from the first dose of itacitinib
      lead-in (7-day lead-in) to the last day of cycle one combination therapy. Part Two will
      further describe and characterize the safety and efficacy of the regimen. The RP2D will be
      determined by a 3+3 dose de-escalation design. Should dose level one be deemed intolerable,
      enrollment will proceed at dose level -1. The RP2D will be affirmed according to the rules of
      the 3+3 dose de-escalation scheme (Section 4.2). Once an RP2D has been confirmed, Part 2 will
      open as an expansion cohort.

                  screening and negative urinary test before the first dose on Day 1 and who agrees
                  to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty)
                  from screening through safety follow-up. Permitted methods that are at least 99%
                  effective in preventing pregnancy should be communicated to the subject and their
                  understanding confirmed.

               -  Men who agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering children (with
                  at least 99% certainty) from screening through safety follow-up. Permitted
                  methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy should be
                  communicated to the subject and their understanding confirmed.

          -  Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             sclerodermatous skin changes.

          -  Participants have uncontrolled manifestations of acute GVHD.

          -  Treatment with any investigational medication within ≤ 30 days or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer, before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Patients who have received any previous systemic treatment for chronic GVHD, including
             glucocorticosteroids, prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

        Note: Prior and concomitant use of Calcineurin-Inhibitors (CNIs), as well as
        topical/inhaled steroids, is acceptable.

          -  Received prior JAK inhibitor therapy for any indication ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day
             1.

             administered for pre-emptive treatment of malignancy recurrence. Participants who have
             received a scheduled DLI as part of their transplant procedure and not for management
             of malignancy relapse are eligible.

          -  Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper gastrointestinal tract that

             investigator's discretion.

          -  Subject has a concurrent illness which in the opinion of the investigator may
             interfere with the treatment and evaluation of the subject.

          -  Pregnant or currently breast-feeding. Note: INCB039110 is a JAK1 inhibitor with the
             potential for serious or life-threatening birth defects or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with INCB039110, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with INCB039110. These potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study.

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease
                  present for more than 3 years prior to Screening and felt to be at low risk for
                  recurrence by the treating physician.

               -  Adequately treated non-melanomatous skin cancer or lentigo maligna melanoma
                  without current evidence of disease.

                  disease.

          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including,
             but not limited to, the following conditions:

               -  Any uncontrolled active systemic infection or active infection requiring systemic
                  treatment that was ongoing ≤ 7 days before screening. Subjects with acute
                  infections requiring treatment should delay screening/enrollment until the course
                  of therapy has been completed and the event is considered resolved. Prophylactic
                  antibiotics will be permitted.

               -  Cholestatic disorders, or unresolved sinusoidal obstructive syndrome/
                  veno-occlusive disease of the liver (defined as persistent total bilirubin &gt; 2

             (i.e., positive HBsAg). Participants with negative HBsAg and positive total HBc
             antibody may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable at the time of screening.
             Participants who are positive for HCV antibodies are eligible only if PCR is negative
             for HCV RNA. Participants whose immune status is unknown or uncertain must have
             results confirming immune status before enrollment. Serology results performed less
             than or equal to 6 months prior to the first planned dose of itacitinib are acceptable
             for determining eligibility.

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade ≥ 3).

          -  Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full
             participation in the study, including administration of study drug/treatment and
             attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or
             interfere with the interpretation of study data.

          -  Unable to understand the purpose and risks of the study and to provide a signed and
             dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health
             information (in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations) per
             the investigator's assessment.
