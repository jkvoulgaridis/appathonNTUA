  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) employs a small fiber which can be passed
      through a biopsy needle to enable real time microscopic imaging of cells. With resolution of
      3.5 microns it is possible to identify key features consistent with malignancy and pulmonary
      fibrosis. (Wijmans, et al., 2019). The effectiveness of nCLE with intravenous fluorescein has
      been demonstrated in central lung cancers using esophageal ultrasound guided needle placement
      (Wijmans, et al., 2019). In this study, the proposed nCLE lung cancer criteria had high
      accuracy for lung cancer detection and were consistently recognized by multiple raters. Probe
      based confocal microscopy (pCLE) has also been used in conjunction with a radial probe EBUS
      in evaluating solitary pulmonary nodules with a diagnostic accuracy of 79.2%. (Hassan, et
      al., 2017) Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) has not previously been used in
      conjunction with robotic navigational bronchoscopy.

    <description>Patients who are scheduled to undergo Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy for a peripheral lung lesion will be enrolled. During bronchoscopy, confocal images will be captured using Cellvizio 100 Series Confocal Laser Imaging systems and their Confocal Miniprobes (Mauna Kea Technologies Paris, France). The Cellvizio system and miniprobes are FDA approved by 510(k) for use in through the respiratory tracts by endoscopy or endoscopic accessories. Only images and needle aspiration/ biopsy results from the expansion phase (20 patients) will be analyzed</description>
