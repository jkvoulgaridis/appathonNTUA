  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study will be to identify multidisciplinary fall risk factors in
      persons with stage 3 idiopathic Parkinson's Disease compared to age and sex-matched healthy
      adults. Both the relative contribution of each independent factor, as well as the interaction
      between these factors, will be examined. The study will include multidisciplinary
      assessments, including locomotor, speech, auditory, vestibular and opthalmologic assessments.
