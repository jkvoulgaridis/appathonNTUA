  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a study about the usability of PointCheck a novel non-invasive technology for monitoring
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

      The study will include patients with cancer visiting the outpatient hematology clinic for
      their standard of care chemotherapy administration. A final sample size of 90 oncologic
      outpatients will be enrolled and studied with the technology.

      The main objective is to evaluate the usability of PointCheck. Secondary outcomes include a
      preliminary assessment of PointCheck diagnostic accuracy and precision.

      For this, study subjects will be tested twice with PointCheck during the same session and the
      usability in an at-home simulated environment by naïve users will be evaluated
