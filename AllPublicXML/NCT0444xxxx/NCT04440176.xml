          -  Available for the entire study period and can be reached by telephone.

          -  Healthy participant as determined by medical history, physical examination, and
             judgement of the investigator.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for all female participants; pregnancy test is not
             applicable to male participants.

             contraindicate intramuscular injection.

          -  A known or suspected defect of the immune system that would prevent an immune response
             to the vaccine, such as participants with congenital or acquired defects in B-cell
             function, those receiving chronic systemic (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular)
             corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  History of microbiologically proven disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis or
             Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

          -  Significant neurological disorder or history of seizure (excluding simple febrile
             seizure).

          -  Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including, but no limited to,
             transverse myelitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.

          -  Participants receiving any allergen immunotherapy with a nonlicensed product or
             receiving allergen immunotherapy with a licensed product and are not on stable
             maintenance doses.

          -  Receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin, within 6 months before the
             first study vaccination.

          -  Current use of systemic antibiotics with no foreseeable date of discontinuation prior
             to anticipated date of enrollment (first vaccination).
