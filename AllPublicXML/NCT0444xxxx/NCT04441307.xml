  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand if a parenting program that helps couples learn to parent as a
      team and maintain a healthy lifestyle, such as maintaining safer levels of alcohol use,
      promotes parent and child health and well-being. Programs will be delivered prenatally and
      postnatally and will include both group classes and individualized sessions. A comprehensive
      assessment is administered during pregnancy and then at 6 and 12 months of child age. It is
      hypothesized that targeting intervention during the naturally motivating transition to
      parenthood may not only provide opportunities for long lasting behavioral change for parents,
      but also initiate a cascade of protective processes that ultimately reduce risk for negative
      emotional and behavioral outcomes for children.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>In both arms, couples will experience a parenting program for expecting first time parents. In one arm, parents will receive an adapted Family Foundations program. In the other arm, parents will receive an empirically supported community parenting program.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will be asked to participate in a parenting program but will not be informed about which arm of the study they have been assigned. To avoid bias in the evaluation of the interventions, outcome assessors will not be informed about which arm of the study participants have been assigned.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Couple Relationship/Co-parenting</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months of child age</time_frame>
    <description>Couple relationship will be evaluated through the Co-parenting Relationship Scale. For overall coparenting quality, average responses range from 0 (not true of us/never) to 6 (very true of us/very often). Lower scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Adjustment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months of child age</time_frame>
    <description>Parent adjustment will be assessed with self-report on mental health screenings. The Brief Symptom Inventory is a widely used mental health screening measure. Average responses to the listed symptoms range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) based on how distressing symptoms have been. Higher scores indicate greater intensity of symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Alcohol Use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months of child age</time_frame>
    <description>Quantity-frequency of alcohol use (Quantity Frequency Index) and frequency of binge drinking (4 or 5 or more on a single occasion) based on the NIAAA standard drink will be assessed. Higher scores indicate greater quantity and frequency of alcohol use and binge drinking, with moderate drinking being defined as up to 1 standard drink per day for women and up to 2 standard drinks per day for men.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent-infant Interactions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months of child age</time_frame>
    <description>Parent-child relations will be measured through the coding of play interaction sessions. Parental warmth, sensitivity, and harshness will be coded during parent-infant interactions. Parents will be asked to spend some time with their infants as they normally would at 6 months. At 12 months, parents will be asked to spend some time with infants as they normally would for the first 5 minutes, and given a series of problem-solving tasks to do with their infants for the next 5 minutes. Warmth (positive affective involvement), sensitivity (e.g., flexibility and contingent responsiveness), and harshness (e.g., intrusive and negative behaviors such as angry/hostile mood and voice, disapproval, and criticism) will be coded based on the global 5-point rating scales of the Early Relational Assessment (Clark, 1999). Higher scores on the rating scales indicate higher frequency of warmth, sensitivity, and harshness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant Self-Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months of child age</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ-R, Gartstein &amp; Rothbart, 2003) will be used to obtain parent reports of infant reactivity/regulation at 6 and 12 months of infant ages. The scale measures three broad dimensions of behavior Surgency/Extraversion, Negative Affectivity, and Orienting/Regulation. The Surgency/Extraversion dimension includes approach, vocal reactivity, high intensity pleasure, smiling and laughter, activity level, and perceptual sensitivity. The Negative Affectivity dimension includes sadness, distress to limitations, fear, and low falling reactivity. The Orienting/Regulation dimension includes low intensity pleasure, cuddliness, duration of orienting, and soothability. Scores range from 1-7 and higher scores on each dimension reflect higher surgency, negative affect, and regulation. Average of maternal and paternal scores on these three broad dimensions will be included as the final outcome measures.</description>
