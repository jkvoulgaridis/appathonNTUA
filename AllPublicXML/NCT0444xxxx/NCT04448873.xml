      This randomized controlled trial aims to compare guided discontinuation with maintenance
      treatment of sirolimus in pediatric patients with KHE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare vascular tumor that occurs in infants and
      children. KHE is characterized by sheets of spindle cells with an infiltrative pattern in the
      dermis, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. It is locally aggressive and can cause Kasabach-Merritt
      phenomenon, a serious life-threatening coagulopathy characterized by profound
      thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia. Sirolimus, one of the mTOR inhibitors, has become a
      new and very effective treatment, which is especially reliable for KHE with KMP and has
      acceptable side effects. However, there is yet no strong evidence on the best practice of
      treatment length of sirolimus. This randomized controlled trial aims to compare guided
      discontinuation with maintenance treatment in pediatric patients with KHE in order to provide
      a basis for the optimal treatment duration of sirolimus, as well as the clinical
      characteristics of pediatric patients who can safely reduce the dose till withdrawal.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Only the outcome assessors are blinded, neither clinicians nor patients, because they should be attentive of the risk of relapse in the discontinuation group. Also, it seems unethical if researchers were not to discover the group of patients in the maintenance group who can discontinue sirolimus without relapsing. Clinicians should be given the possibility to adjust dose and ensure the benefits of patients. Therefore, this trial only includes assessors blinding.</masking_description>

    <description>After at least 2 years of remission of KHE, the discontinuation measurement should be guided by the clinician with the following principles:
10% monthly reduction of the previous dose at most.
At least 5 half-lives between each reduction (2 weeks).
Blood concentration should be monitored monthly. Adjustment can be suggested according to the linear relationship between the dose and the blood concentration.
At least 6 months for the duration of guided discontinuation.
Regular assessments and evaluations should be done.
If the condition relapses or worsens during this process, dose of sirolimus should be adjusted to the previously effective dose. After a 3-month stabilization phase, 5% monthly reduction of the previous dose could be considered.</description>
