  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a study about the usability of PointCheck a novel non-invasive technology for monitoring
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The study will include patients with cancer visiting the
      outpatient hematology clinic for their standard of care chemotherapy administration. A final
      sample size of 60 oncologic outpatients will be enrolled and studied with the technology.

      The main objective is to evaluate the usability of PointCheck. Secondary outcomes include a
      preliminary assessment of PointCheck diagnostic accuracy and precision.

      For this, study subjects will be tested twice with PointCheck during the same session and the
      usability in an at-home simulated environment by naïve users will be evaluated.

        The study will be conducted in participants with malignancies who are scheduled to receive
        cytotoxic chemotherapy agents with any risk of neutropenia (e.g. antimetabolites, platins,
        taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors, Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, among others).
        Participants will be in an ambulatory stable condition as described in the criteria below
        and according to the investigator's assessment.
