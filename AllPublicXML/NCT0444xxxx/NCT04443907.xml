  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate two genome-edited, autologous, hematopoietic stem and progenitor
      cell (HSPC) products - OTQ923 and HIX763 - each reducing the biologic activity of BCL11A,
      increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and reducing complications of sickle cell disease.
