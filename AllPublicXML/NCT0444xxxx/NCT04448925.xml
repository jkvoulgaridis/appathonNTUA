  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal recovery duration depends on the intensity of exercise and in the present study
      the intensity was maximal power for 4-s while cycling an 'Inertial Load' ergometer (ILE).
      Recovery duration of 15, 30 and 45-s were given between 30 successive sprints.

      All subjects completed an informed consent for this study that was approved by the
      Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas at Austin.

      Study Overview. A randomized, cross-over experimental design was conducted. Each participant
      visited the laboratory on four occasions which were separated by two to five days.
      Measurement of body mass, familiarization with experimental procedures and cycling peak
      oxygen consumption test (VO2peak) were performed on the first visit. Participants took part
      in inertial-load exercise (ILE) on the remaining test days. On each separate session, a
      different inter-sprint recovery duration was employed (i.e. 15, 30 or 45-s). Cycling power
      output, pulmonary gas exchange, vastus lateralis de-oxygenation status, heart rate and blood
      lactate were measured.
