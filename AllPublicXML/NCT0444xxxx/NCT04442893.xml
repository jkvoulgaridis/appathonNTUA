      This study will explore the effect of Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy on
      depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia for three months. A randomized controlled
      trial is conducted in a psychiatric center in northern Taiwan. All participants are
      randomized to two groups using blocked randomization. The experimental groups are provided
      with a 6- session RFCBT program for 12 weeks (60-90 mins, once every two weeks), while the
      control groups receive a 6- session Health Education program for 12 weeks (60-90 mins, once
      every two weeks). All participants who suffered from depressive symptoms at both baseline and
      3-month follow-up will be evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory(BDI-II), Chinese
      Response Style Questionnaire-short form revised(CRSQ-10), Internalized Stigma of Mental
      Illness (ISMI) Scale, and Herth Hope Index Chinese Version(HHI).

      Background:

      Depressive symptoms are one of the core symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but the
      effect of depressive symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. Severe depressive symptoms in
      patients with schizophrenia are not only affecting the quality of life but also the risk
      factors of suicide.

      Aim:

      The investigators hypothesize that Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy(RFCBT)
      could have significant effect of depressive symptoms. Therefore, in this study, the
      investigators will explore the effect of Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behaviour
      Therapy(RFCBT) on depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

      Methods:

      The study is conducted as a two-arm, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial in a
      psychiatric center in northern Taiwan. Participants are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to
      two groups using blocked randomization. The experimental groups are provided with a 6-
      session RFCBT program for 12 weeks (60-90 mins, once every two weeks), while the control
      groups receive a 6- session Health Education program for 12 weeks (60-90 mins, once every two
      weeks) .

      Participants and demographic data:

      Participants who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria took
      part in the study after informed consent is obtained. All participants are 20 years of age or
      older and are receiving a stable dosage of antipsychotics, and have no history of cognitive
      impairment. The participants are able to express themselves and to individually complete the
      Beck Depression Inventory(BDI-II), Chinese Response Style Questionnaire-short form
      revised(CRSQ-10), Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) Scale, and Herth Hope Index
      Chinese Version(HHI).

      Measures:

      The demographic characteristics include five continuous variables (age, age at onset,
      duration of disease, years of education, chlorpromazine equivalent dose (Andreasen, Pressler,
      Nopoulos, Miller, &amp; Ho, 2010) and four categorical variables (sex, marital status, work
      status, antidepressants).

      Procedure and Data collection:

      All procedures are approved by both national Ying Ming university(IRB YM108038F) and the
      psychiatric center (IRB 1080009-01). Following informed consent, each participant will fill
      out a demographic questionnaire and complete the BDI-II, CRHQ-10, ISMIS, and HHI once at
      baseline and twice an interval of three months. A well-trained and licensed psychiatric nurse
      will perform the data collection and assists the participants if there were difficulties
      reading or understanding the questionnaires.

      Statistical analysis:

      This study will employ Predictive Analytics Suite Workstation (IBM SPSS 24.0) to analyze the
      collected data. The data analyses will include demographic variables and the scores of
      BDI-II, CRHQ-10, ISMIS, and HHI at the interval of three months of all of the participants.

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a 21-item self-report depression screening measure (Beck, Steer, Ball, &amp; Ranieri, 1996). Each item is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3, which with possible scores ranging from 0 to 63. The BDI-II has been translated into a Chinese version (Chen, 2000). Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms, and a score of &gt;16 points is considered suggestive of the presence of clinically significant depressive symptom intensity (Lu, Che, Chang, &amp; Shen, 2002).
In this study, the investigators will explore the change of BDI-II score between baseline and three-month follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Chinese Response Style Questionnaire-short form revised (CRSQ-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese Response Style Questionnaire-short form revised (CRSQ-10) is a self-report measure of rumination, comprising ten items and describing the factors of brooding and reflection (Chow, 2008). Each item is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), which with possible scores ranging from 10 to 40. The CRSQ-10 has been used to evaluate the intensity of ruminative responses to depressed mood.
In this study, the investigators will explore the change of CRSQ-10 score between baseline and three-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) Scale is a 29-item self-report questionnaire measuring self-stigma among persons with psychiatric disorders (Ritsher, Otilingam, &amp; Grajales, 2003). Each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), which with possible scores ranging from 29 to 116. The ISMI Scale has been translated into a Chinese version (Chang, Wu, Chen, Wang, &amp; Lin, 2014). Higher scores indicating greater self-stigma.
In this study, the investigators will explore the change of ISMI Scale score between baseline and three-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Herth Hope Index Chinese Version(HHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Herth Hope Index (HHI) comprises 12-item self-report measure of hopefulness (Herth, 1992). Each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), which with possible scores ranging from 12 to 48. The HHI has been translated into a Chinese version (Chen, &amp; Wang, 1997). Higher scores indicating greater hopefulness.
In this study, the investigators will explore the change of HHI score between baseline and three-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(RFCBT) is based on a differentiation between functional and dysfunctional styles of perseverative thinking with the helpful style characterized as a concrete, process-focused and specific style of thinking and the idea that rumination is a habit maintained by negative reinforcement. In line with the theoretical assumptions, RFCBT combines strategies from behavioral activation with strategies to foster concrete, process-focused and specific thinking.</description>
