  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of multiple
      ascending iv doses of MEDI341 in male and female subjects with Parkinson's Disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include up to 3 cohorts, with 12 subjects in each, for a total of up to 36
      randomised subjects.

      The study comprises a screening period of up to 49 days, an 8-week double-blind treatment
      period, and a 13-week follow-up period. Each subject will receive three 60 minute iv
      infusions of MEDI1341 or placebo during the 8-week treatment period, with 4 weeks between
      infusions. The overall study duration (enrolment, treatment, and follow-up periods) will be
      up to 28 weeks per subject.

      A Dose Escalation Committee will review data from each cohort to allow progression to the
      next higher dose cohort in the study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects must be aged 40 to 85 years, inclusive, on the day of randomization.

          2. Meet criteria for a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD according to the
             United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria (Hughes et al 1992)

          3. PD should be stage 1 to 3 using the Hoehn and Yahr scale as modified (Goetz et al
             2004).

          4. Subjects receiving medications for PD should have been on a stable dosing regimen of
             their medication(s) for ≥ 1 month before randomization, with no expectation of a need
             to change the medications or dosing regimen for the duration of the study, barring
             unforeseen circumstances. (For subjects who are not currently receiving medications to
             treat PD, there should be no expectation of a need to initiate these for the duration
             of the study).

          5. Subjects must have a body weight of 45 to 120 kg, inclusive, and a body mass index of
             18 to 34 kg/m2, inclusive at screening and at check-in for the first infusion.

          6. Subjects may be male or female. Female subjects must of non-childbearing potential
             (postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile.

          7. Postmenopausal women must have had ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] concentration ≥ 26 mIU/mL in women ≤ 60 years of
             age; women &gt; 60 years of age do not require an FSH test) and must have had a negative
             serum pregnancy test result at screening.

             Surgically sterile women are defined as those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             ovariectomy (oophorectomy), salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation. Women who are
             surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative report,
             ultrasound, or other verifiable medical documentation.

          8. Men who are biologically capable of fathering children must agree and commit to use an
             adequate form of double-barrier contraception for the duration of the treatment period
             and for 5 half lives (100 days) after the last administration of study intervention. A
             male subject is considered capable of fathering children even if his sexual partner is
             sterile or using contraceptives.

             Men who are biologically capable of fathering children must also agree to refrain from
             sperm donation for the duration of the treatment period and for 5 half-lives or 90
             days (whichever is longer) after the last administration of study intervention.

          9. Subjects must, in the investigator's opinion, understand the nature of the study and
             must provide signed and dated written informed consent before the conduct of any
             study-related procedures.

         10. Subjects must, in the opinion of the investigator, be able to participate in all
             scheduled evaluations, likely to be compliant, and likely to complete all required
             tests, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans and lumbar punctures
             (LPs). (Note: The investigator should assess the physical and functional needs of the
             subject at screening, as participation in the study may be contingent upon the
             availability and willingness of a caregiver to attend with the subject at all study
             visits.)

         11. Subjects must be able to read, write, and speak fluently in English and/or Spanish.

         12. Subjects must agree not to post any personal medical data related to the study or
             information related to the study on any website or social media site (eg, Facebook,
             Twitter, Instagram, etc) until the study has been completed.

         13. Subjects must have a MoCA total score of ≥ 24.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. In the opinion of the investigator, a recent clinically significant illness (other
             than PD), infection, medical/surgical procedure, or significant trauma within 30 days
             prior to screening, or between screening and randomization, that is likely to
             deteriorate, compromise the subject's safety or ability to complete the study, or
             compromise the interpretation of the study results

          2. Presence of a serious or unstable clinically significant illness, including hepatic,

             which, in the judgment of the investigator, is poorly controlled or otherwise likely
             to deteriorate, compromise the subject's safety or ability to complete the study, or
             compromise the interpretation of the study results

          3. Significant neurological disease affecting the CNS (other than PD) that, in the

             parkinsonism, metabolic diseases with parkinsonian signs and symptoms (eg, Wilson
             disease, manganese exposure) or other secondary forms of Parkinsonism, and ischemic or
             traumatic brain injury (including multiple episodes of head trauma, or head trauma

             between screening and randomization)

          4. Brain MRI scan that shows clinically significant evidence of malignant, ischemic,

             stimulation, fetal tissue transplantation) or has undergone any other brain surgery at
             any time, even for non-PD conditions

          6. History of epilepsy or seizures, except febrile childhood seizures

             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V; APA 2013) or symptom if,
             in the judgment of the investigator, the psychiatric disorder or symptom is likely to
             confound interpretation of the study results, affect motor function assessment, or
             affect the subject's ability to complete the study

          9. A diagnosis of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or mental

         17. History of allergy/hypersensitivity to immunizations or immunoglobulins

         18. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, makes the
             subject unsuitable for the study

         19. Requires treatment with another monoclonal antibody

             eyes, skin, or body; claustrophobia that would contraindicate a brain MRI scan

         28. Brain MRI findings (or historical radiologic reports, if available) that show evidence
             of clinically significant structural brain disease which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, contraindicates performance of LP

         29. Any spinal abnormality or other aspects (eg, tattoos) or other clinical findings
             (papilledema seen with ophthalmoscopy) that may complicate or contraindicate LP, as

             or otherwise well-controlled). Other immunosuppressive drugs are contraindicated.

             (vii) Mature cataracts (Grade ≥4 per the Lens Opacities Classification System III) or
             lower grade cataracts that are otherwise considered by the examining ophthalmologist
             to prevent adequate examination of the uveal tract or posterior ocular segment. (Note:
             An age-related cataract with age-appropriate lens opacification and no other important
             identified secondary causes (eg, diabetes, corticosteroids, vitamin deficiencies,
