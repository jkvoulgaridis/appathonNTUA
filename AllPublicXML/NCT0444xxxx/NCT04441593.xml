  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to provide effect size estimates and test feasibility of a novel,
      integrated behavioral approach to reduce heavy drinking and chronic pain among patients in
      HIV-care delivered via internet-based videoconferencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a between-groups design to compare a novel integrated behavioral video
      telehealth intervention for heavy drinking PLWH with chronic pain to a control condition.
      Forty-eight heavy drinking patients in HIV-care with moderate or greater pain will be
      recruited for the study. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomly
      assigned to either intervention or control conditions. Participants will complete assessment
      measures of heavy drinking and pain interference/severity at 3 and 6 months post-baseline.
      Secondary alcohol outcomes will include alcohol-related consequences
