  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of implanting small 24-K gold fiducial
      markers around a bladder tumor site, so that a Radiation Oncologist can identify the original
      tumor location at the time of radiation treatment. Other goals of the study include assessing
      whether a new MRI imaging technology can help with detection of bladder cancer earlier and
      more accurately when evidence of bladder cancer is not visible by scope.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of primary
             urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Subjects with mixed histology are required to
             have a dominant TCC pattern.

          -  Clinical stage T2-T4a, Nx, M0 considered appropriate for, and electing to receive,
             chemoradiation of the bladder

          -  Planned TURBT as part of the normal course treatment, to take place prior to the
             initiation of chemo irradiation

          -  Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL OR calculated CrCl &gt; 30ml/min

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to study entry, during study participation, and for 90 days after study
             treatment discontinuation

               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
                  partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with primary TCC of the ureter, urethra, or renal pelvis, without TCC of the
             bladder, are not allowed

          -  Known distant metastatic disease (e.g. pulmonary or hepatic metastases)

               -  Subjects with malignant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis considered
                  appropriate for radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy with the goal of complete
                  resection of all malignant disease are allowed

          -  Patients with bladder abnormalities that preclude safe placement of fiducial markers
             (i.e. abundant large diverticuli or cellules, active or recurrent urinary infection)

          -  Planned (or prior history of) definitive bladder irradiation

          -  Intravesical chemo- or biologic therapy within 6 weeks of first treatment

          -  Any planned neoadjuvant systemic immunotherapy. Note that prior BCG is not an
             exclusion

          -  Clinically significant active infection or uncontrolled medical condition that would
             preclude participation in study

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded

          -  Previous malignancy other than TCC that, in the opinion of the treating investigator,
             is likely to interfere with protocol treatment

          -  Individuals with severe renal failure and cannot receive MRI contrast
