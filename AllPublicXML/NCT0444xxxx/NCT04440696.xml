      The aim of the study is:

      to evaluate the tolerance of lanthanum polystyrene sulfonate powder in patients with chronic
      kidney disease and hyperphosphatemia with multi-dose and multi-dose ; to evaluate the
      pharmacodynamics of lanthanum polystyrene sulfonate in patients with chronic kidney disease
      and hyperphosphatemia; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lanthanum polystyrene sulfonate
      powder in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperphosphatemia with multiple doses and
      multiple doses.

    <textblock>
      In this study, 48 patients with hyperphosphatemia were enrolled in four incremental dose
      groups (1.5g, 3g, 4.5g, 6g), which were randomly divided into experimental group, control
      group and placebo group.In this study, sentinel group was used. Two subjects in the same dose
      group were first given lanthanum polystyrene sulfonate powder , after 96 hours of
      observation, the remaining subjects were randomly given the test drug, positive control group
      or placebo in the proportion of 3:1:1; the subjects in different dose groups were
      successively enrolled in the group, and after the end of the former group, whether to carry
      out multiple dose studies in the higher dose group would be determined according to the
      tolerance results and pharmacokinetic characteristics.
