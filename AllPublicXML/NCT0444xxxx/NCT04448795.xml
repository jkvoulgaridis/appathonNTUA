    <textblock>
      This study investigated the impact of highest drain fluid amylase (DFA) level on
      postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) severity and outcomes of patients undergoing
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with POPF. Patient demographics of biochemical POPF and
      clinically relevant POPF (CR-POPF) were compared. Predictive factors were assessed using
      binary logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to
      determine the optimal cutoff value of highest DFA (beyond 3 days post-PD). The investigators
      compared length of hospital stay, surgical mortality rates, and need for postoperative
      interventions by highest DFA level.
