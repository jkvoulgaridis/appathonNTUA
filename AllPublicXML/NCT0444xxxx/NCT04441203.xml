  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that a virtual Heart Failure Clinic (HFC) based on patient self-management
      using Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP) monitoring is superior to usual care of HFC, leads to
      decreased: hospital admissions for heart failure (HF), emergency department consultation
      and/or unplanned intravenous heart failure therapy and cardiovascular death, compared to a
      regular HFC, has low device-related complications and is cost-effective, in New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) class III and II (requiring diuretics) patients.

      This will be a single center, prospective, randomized, open-label blinded-endpoint (PROBE)
      trial in which the treatment group will be implanted with a CardioMEMS HF sensor and managed
      using remote access to hemodynamics compared to a non-implanted control group. Patients with
      at least one hospitalization for HF (≥1) in the previous year (12 months) will be randomized
      into two groups, regardless of LVEF:

      Usual care with the specialized multidisciplinary HF clinic team (Non-implanted Control) or
      Hemodynamic monitoring, less intense HF clinic follow-up, and remote follow-up by a nurse
      clinician and patient empowerment with access to the PAP data (CardioMEMS group).

      Primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between groups after 12 months of follow-up
      and within groups comparing baseline parameters with 12 month follow-up measurements.
