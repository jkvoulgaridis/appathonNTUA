  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading global cause of mortality counting for 6.5 million deaths per
      annum. The global prevalence of stroke is increasing with an estimated prevalence of 33
      million per year, affecting 1 out of 6 individuals during their lifetime. The international
      data suggests the overall economic burden in Asia is projected to be increased to 1.3 Billion
      by 2050. Therefore, the appropriate and timely stroke intervention is required to save
      healthcare costs and reduce the burden of the disease. Studies have reported the
      effectiveness of VR intervention not only in cognitive abilities but it has found to be
      simultaneously effective in improving other domains as attention and coordination with motor
      retraining. VR combined with a newly developed concept of motor priming has shown encouraging
      results in improving motor control and task execution in stroke patients. Further studies are
      needed to analyze the impact of motor priming with VR in stroke patients on varied
      neurological domains; hence the present study aims to investigate the impact of VR based
      motor priming on sensorimotor, functional and cognitive outcomes among sub-acute stroke
      patients rehabilitation.

      A total 62 patients will be recruited in the study. After voluntary consent, all the patients
      will be randomly divided into Group-A and B through the envelope method of simple random
      sampling. Patients in Group-A will be receiving VR based motor priming intervention while
      Group-B patients will be receiving Motor-Relearning Program as conventional therapy. Whereas,
      both the groups will be given 16 sessions of their respective protocol, comprising of 45
      minutes, 4 times/week for the duration of 4 weeks. Pre and post assessment will be performed
      for each patient on all three quantitative outcome measures i.e. FMA-UE, CAHAI-13, and MoCA.
      A trial will be terminated, if the patient reported fatigue of &gt;8 out of 10 on the Visual
      Analogue Scale, unable to execute movements, reports pain, eye strain, or signs of volitional
      fatigue in hemiplegic or non-hemiplegic extremities.
