    <textblock>
      The aims of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a protocol of manual therapy on
      the static balance, dynamic balance, functionality and mood states in health participants.
      This study will consist of a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be healthy
      subjects divided into 2 groups, being an experimental group that will receive a manual
      therapy session and a control group without treatment. It will be evaluated at the start of
      the study, after treatment and one week later.

      Background

      Evidence suggest that the application of manual therapy could be effective in multiple
      pathologies, but there are few studies which have investigated the effectiveness of manual
      therapy in to balance, functionality and mood states.

      Objective To compare the effectiveness of a protocol of manual therapy on the static balance,
      dynamic balance, functionality and mood states in health participants.

      Metods

      This is a randomized controlled trial which will be carried out with young adults. The sample
      will be divided into 2 groups: a) experimental group that will receive a manual therapy
      session; b) a control group without treatment. All subjects signed the informed consent and
      confidentiality of the data was reserved according to the Helsinki declaration. The
      treatments were carried out in the laboratories of the University of Valencia and the project
      was approved by the institution's ethics committee.

      The experimental group to receive manual therapy (Bilateral manipulation lumbosacral, hip
      joint gapping, stretching the hip rotators with hip and knee flexion, femorotibial gapping,
      decompression of connective tissue of the patellofemoral region, internal and external joint
      line opening in laterality, mobilization of the base of the fibula, tibiofibular-talus
      gapping, and muscle strengthening). The control group will not receive treatment and only
      evaluations will be performed.

      Outcomes

      The evaluations will consist of the following variables: Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT),
      Unipedal Stance Test (UPST), Time Up and Go (TUG), Sit To Stand (STS), Patient Global
      Impression of Change (PGIC) and POMS (Profile Of Mood States). Evaluations will be carried
      out at three times: at the beginning of the study, after treatment and one week later.

    <measure>Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of reaching the lower limb as much as possible, in a standing position, while the other lower limb is kept on a stable support base, at a certain point. The reaches of the leg are evaluated using three determined directions, such as the anterior, the postero-medial and the postero-lateral.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unipedal Stance Test (UPST)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of a test to measure static balance. Subjects who focus on a fixed point that is marked on the wall and perform the single-legged support. Before lifting the lower limb to be assessed, which will determine the start of the test, the subjects have to cross their arms at chest level, placing their hands on the opposite shoulders. When the subject is ready, close the eyes and raise the lower limb, and the time it is capable of holding is measured with a stopwatch. It is performed later with the other leg</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>is a reliable and valid test to quantify functional mobility, and can also be useful for monitoring clinical change at a specific time. To do the test a chair is required, with the characteristics corrected above, and a mark on the floor 3 meters from it. The patient should get up from the chair as soon as the story ends and the examiner says, go to the mark at 3 meters, so to walk quickly but without running, turn at this mark with a 360 degree turn, and end the test by sitting down again. The result is given with seconds and milli seconds measured with a stopwatch. Time begins to count when the patient rises from the chair, and ends when the subject sits down again.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit To Stand (STS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate functionality with common actions of daily life such as getting up and sitting in a chair. The same chair is used to do this. The test consists of getting up and sitting three times, finishing the sitting test, all as fast as possible and time is measured with a stopwatch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>reflects the patient's belief about the effect of the treatment applied. This tool evaluates this perception on a scale that ranges from 1 (the patient is much better) to 7 (the patient is much worse). It also consists of a visual analog scale that classified the improvement from 0 to 10, with the first value being a very good improvement and the second being a significant worsening after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>POMS (Profile Of Mood States)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS is a questionnaire which aims to measure the state of mind. It consists of 58 items, valued using a Likert-type format, with 5 possible response alternatives. From this test, a general index of mood alteration and thirst can be extracted, partially measured: Tension, Depression, Cholera, Vigor, Fatigue and Confusion. Although the POMS has been described as a redundant ladder, it appears to be a multidimensional instrument, with high internal consistency and a relatively stable factor structure.</description>
