      This phase II trial investigates the rate of complications of x-ray therapy versus proton
      beam radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy in treating patients
      with breast cancer. X-ray therapy is a form of radiation therapy that uses high-energy
      radiation from x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Proton beam radiation therapy is
      a type of radiation therapy that uses high-energy beams to treat tumors. It is not yet known
      what level of complications x-ray therapy or proton beam radiation therapy have in treating
      patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the 24-month complication rate of 5 fraction radiotherapy compared to 25
      fraction radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate acute toxicity that occur up to 180 days after radiation. II. To evaluate late
      toxicity that appear or persist 180 days after radiation. III. To estimate the 5-year
      locoregional control, invasive disease-free survival, disease-free survival, cause-specific
      survival and overall survival.

      CORRELATIVE AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patient-reported quality of life outcomes through Mayo Breast Survey, Mayo 10
      (Patient-Reported Outcomes [PRO]-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]), and
      Mayo Patient Survey.

      II. To evaluate clinical features, treatment technique, dose-volume parameters, histologic
      and genetic variants associated with fair and poor cosmetic outcomes or unplanned surgical
      intervention.

      III. To evaluate the costs and comparative effectiveness of treatment. IV. Compare the use of
      photon therapy with spot scanning proton therapy hypo-fractionated whole breast or
      post-mastectomy chest wall with regional nodal irradiation.

      V. To evaluated cosmetic outcome with patient-reported measures with elements from the Mayo
      Breast Patient Survey and panel assess cosmetic outcome with blinded photographs, and the
      Harvard/National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)/Radiation Therapy
      Oncology Group (RTOG) Cosmesis Scale.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Within 12 weeks of the last breast cancer surgery or last dose of adjuvant
      chemotherapy and no sooner than 14 days since the last chemotherapy, patients undergo x-ray
      therapy over 25 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Optionally, patients may then receive a 4-fraction boost of x-ray therapy.

      ARM II: Within 12 weeks of the last breast cancer surgery or last dose of adjuvant
      chemotherapy and no sooner than 14 days since the last chemotherapy, patients undergo proton
      beam radiation therapy over 5 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Optionally, patients may receive a concurrent 5-fraction boost of proton beam
      radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 weeks, at 6, 12, 24, and
      36 months, and then at 5 years.

    <time_frame>At 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as the percentage of women evaluable at 24 months who develop one or more of these events: grade 3 or higher late adverse event or unplanned surgeries for cosmetic or treatment related events, including surgeries to remove implant. The complication rate will be estimated using a binomial estimator in both experimental arm and control arm, and a one-sided 90% confidence interval of the difference will be computed with normal approximation.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 180 days post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of acute adverse event will be recorded for each patient. Data will be summarized as frequencies and relative frequencies by treatment arm. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. Rates will be compared between arms using chi-squared tests.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as any adverse event that occurred or persisted after the first 180 days post-radiation therapy and up to 5 years post-radiation therapy. The maximum grade for each type of late adverse event will be recorded for each patient. Data will be summarized as frequencies and relative frequencies by treatment arm. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. Rates will be compared between arms using chi-squared tests.</description>

    <measure>Locoregional control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence will be estimated using a competing risks method by treatment arm. The competing risks will be distant breast cancer recurrence and death. Comparison between arms will employ Fine-Gray regression.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Elements of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events will be used for patient self-reporting of toxicities. The Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale will be used to measure patient reported functional status (pain, mobility). The Mayo Breast Patient Survey and Mayo Patient Survey will also be used. These surveys will be used to report patient reported measures such as fatigue, breast pain, breast shape, and arm related morbidity. They will be summarized as the mean +/- standard deviation and median (minimum value, maximum value). Mixed models will be used to estimate changes at fixed time points as well as compare outcomes between arms.</description>
