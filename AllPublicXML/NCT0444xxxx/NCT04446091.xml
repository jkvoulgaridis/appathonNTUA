  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, phase Ⅱ trial to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of using the combination treatment of Camrelizumab with anti-angiogenic drugs and
      Chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma(MAC).

      Colorectal cancer contains multiple pathological types, and one of the more special
      pathological types is mucinous adenocarcinoma. The prognosis of patients with mucinous
      adenocarcinoma is not ideal.Some molecular and genetic factors may be related to the
      characteristics of mucinous adenocarcinoma, in which microsatellite instability and loss of
      mismatch repair proteins are a focus of current research. Microsatellite instability is often
      associated with poor differentiation and higher tumor stage. Adenocarcinoma that secretes a
      large amount of mucus in pathological features.so,In this study, the incidence of ORR and AEs
      was the main endpoint, and the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with
      anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of advanced colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma were
      observed and evaluated.
