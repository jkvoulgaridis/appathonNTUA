    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reveal the effectiveness and safety of integrative Korean
      medicine for Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament(OPLL) by observation inpatients
      treated with integrative Korean medicine.

      This study is a prospective observational study. The subjects for study are patients
      diagnosed with OPLL and who have been admitted to four Jaseng Hospital of Korean medicine
      (Gangnam, Bucheon, Daejeon, and Haeundae) for 2016.04.01-2019.12.31.

      Medical records of selected patients will be analyzed, and telephone surveys will be
      conducted for each patient. The survey questions are Numeric ratinc scale (NRS), Vernon-Mior
      Neck Disability Index (NDI), quality of life, and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC),
      etc.

    <measure>Numeric rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by September 2020</time_frame>
    <description>NRS uses an 11-point scale to evaluate current neck pain and radiating pain where no pain is indicated by '0', and the worst pain imaginable by '10'. NRS was assessed at admission, 2 weeks after admission, discharge, and long term follow up.</description>

    <measure>Vernon-Mior Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by September 2020</time_frame>
    <description>NDI is a 10-item questionnaire developed to evaluate the degree of disability for neck back pain. Each item is divided into 6 levels, and 0 to 5 points are awarded. The higher the score, the greater the degree of disability. We will conduct an validated Korean NDI questionnaire</description>

    <measure>The five level version of EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Finish survey by September 2020</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is most widely used as a method of indirectly calculating the quality of life from various aspects. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 questions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression) that ask about the current state of health, and answers each question with 5 likert. (1=I have no problems about, 2=I have slight problems about, 3=I have moderate problems about, 4=I have severe problems about, 5=I am unable to about) In this study, the validated Korean version questionnaire will be used.</description>

    <time_frame>Finish survey by September 2020</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is an indicator that evaluates the improvement of patients in 7 steps, and the subject responds with improvement of functional limitation after treatment with 7 likert. (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse).</description>
