      This study investigates the association of genetic effects of rs7903146 and dietary intake on
      type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) risk in a healthy population. T2DM risk was assessed through
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration in 73 subjects. Dietary intake was assessed using
      a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic linked to 1.6 million deaths in 2016.
      Diet, lifestyle and environment contribute significantly to T2DM-risk. Genome-wide
      association studies identify the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 (C/T) gene
      as one of the most important associated with T2DM-risk. The T-allele is associated with a
      two-fold increase in relative risk of T2DM across different populations. However, most
      studies associating genetic effects of dietary intake on rs7903146 and T2DM-risk utilised
      volatile instantaneous measures of glucose(5) and focussed on individual macronutrients.
      Understanding the association of rs7903146 and overall macronutrient intake using a stable
      blood homeostasis marker may provide a fuller insight into T2DM-risk.

      The study included data for all variables (participant characteristics: sex (female/male),
      age (years), height (cm), weight (kg), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), body fat percentage
      (%), fat mass (kg), lean mass (kg), waist/hip (ratio), dietary intake, HbA1c (mmol/mol and %)
      and physical activity (hours/week). All data was collected at St Mary's University between
      April to July 2019. Participants was genotyped and allocated into two groups: major allele
      (C) homozygote versus minor allele (T) homozygote plus heterozygote. T2DM-risk was assessed
      through their value of HbA1c and participants were classified as follows: normal
      (&lt;42mmol/mol/ &lt;6.0%), pre-diabetic (42 to 47 mmol/mol/ 6.0% to 6.4%), diabetes (48mmol/mol
      /6.5% or over).

        condition and free from medication affecting glycated haemoglobin levels.

        Exclusion criteria: Individuals with HbA1c levels ≥48 mmol/mol or ≥6.5% were excluded due
