      Presentation &amp; Pre-screening of the control group / reminiscence group Patient/resident
      pre-screening team meeting for the study Explanation and proposal of the study to patients
      and their families Signature of resident/patient and family consents Audit of inclusion and
      non-inclusion criteria Inclusion Medical advice for VR Clinical interview with the family or
      legal guardian for an accurate life history + an anamnesis interview (psychologist or doctor)
      with the patient or resident.

      Creation of video contents Creation of personalized video contents Clinical scales review
      Evaluation of the number of psychotropic molecules prescribed (coordinating doctor, general
      practitioner, geriatrician)

        -  Pre-test phase with the patient for the use of the VR headset

        -  Randomisation

        -  Session procedure As previously mentioned, the virtual reality sessions will take place
           in a quiet setting twice a week in the living or hosting residence. The sessions will be
           hold over a period of time of 6 weeks.

      Each subject of the reminiscence group will have two personalised virtual surroundings (after
      data being collected from team and/or families).

      The virtual environment will change every 3 weeks in order to avoid the phenomenon of
      habituation.

      The subjects of the control group will be exposed to two generic virtual settings (beach,
      mountain etc.) with a different virtual environment every 3 weeks.

      During the session, note will be taken on the subject's speech. The session will also be
      filmed and/or recorded with a prior signed agreement by the patient or his representative.
