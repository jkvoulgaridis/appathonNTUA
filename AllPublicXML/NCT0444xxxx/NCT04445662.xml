  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This community-based randomized controlled trial will test the effect of contingent financial
      rewards on smoking abstinence among homeless-experienced adult cigarette smokers.
      Participants will be recruited from 3 Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP)
      locations - a shelter clinic, a day center, and a medical center clinic. All participants
      will receive free transdermal nicotine patches and in-person tobacco coaching. In addition,
      incentive arm participants will receive financial rewards for biochemically-verified smoking
      abstinence. Embedded qualitative interviews will explore the mechanisms of on-treatment and
      post-treatment effects of financial incentives on smoking abstinence in the context of
      homelessness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homeless people have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in comparison to
      non-homeless people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3- to 5-fold
      higher rates of tobacco-attributable death. Homeless smokers want to quit, but studies have
      not yet uncovered the optimal approach to help them do so. In an 8-week pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP), we found that
      financial incentives for smoking abstinence were associated with 7-fold higher odds of brief
      smoking abstinence in comparison to a non-incentivized control condition. These results
      suggest that financial incentives are a promising approach for reducing smoking in this
      vulnerable population, but further investigation in a larger sample is needed to improve the
      duration of on-treatment abstinence, assess post-treatment effects, and better understand
      mechanisms of action and contextual factors that may influence treatment response.

      To address these gaps, we will conduct a community-based RCT of financial incentives for
      smoking abstinence among adult smokers at BHCHP. We will recruit 400 participants from 3
      BHCHP sites and randomize them to receive guideline-concordant standard care with (N=200) or
      without (N=200) financial incentives for smoking abstinence. Standard care will consist of 12
      weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and 5 sessions with a tobacco coach who will
      provide behavioral counseling, distribute NRT, and coordinate referrals to existing tobacco
      treatment resources. Incentive arm participants will additionally receive a 24-week schedule
      of 20 debit card payments contingent on short-term abstinence based on exhaled carbon
      monoxide levels, augmented with 16 interspersed payments contingent on longer-term abstinence
      based on urine anabasine levels. We will use an embedded-experiment mixed methods design,
      where qualitative data collection is embedded within a larger quantitative RCT with the
      following aims:

      Aim 1. To determine the effect of the financial incentives intervention on anabasine-verified
      7-day smoking abstinence at A) the end of treatment (24 weeks) and B) 24 weeks after
      treatment (48 weeks).

      We hypothesize that incentive arm participants will have greater abstinence at both
      timepoints.

      Aim 2. To assess why, how, and under what circumstances homeless smokers A) achieve
      abstinence in response to financial incentives and B) maintain abstinence after incentives
      are stopped.

      To accomplish this aim, we will interview selected participants at 24 and 48 weeks, probing
      cognitive, procedural, and contextual dimensions of their response to financial incentives to
      generate hypotheses about mechanisms for on-treatment and post-treatment effects and to
      inform future work in this area.
