  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early ambulation of inpatients has been shown to be a key driver of decreased LOS and also
      reduced adverse events such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). We will test if a patient
      wearable device (pedometer) measuring steps and ambulation sessions decreases hospital LOS
      (primary outcome), decreases hospital LOS index (LOSI), decreases time to first ambulation,
      decreases time to first bowel movement (BM), decreases incidence of VTEs, and decreases costs
      (secondary outcomes). In a pilot randomized control trial, we will randomize 150 total adult
      patients admitted to UF Health Jacksonville in a 1:1 fashion to usual care and wearable
      pedometer or usual care. Patients randomized to the study intervention will receive a
      wearable pedometer upon admission, to be worn for the duration of their inpatient stay. Study
      outcome measures to be compared between the pedometer and no pedometer group include hospital
      LOS (primary outcome), hospital LOSI, time to first ambulation, time to first BM, incidence
      of VTEs, patient experience, and costs (secondary outcomes).
