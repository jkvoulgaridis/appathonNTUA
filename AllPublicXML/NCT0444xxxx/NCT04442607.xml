  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, unblinded, non-randomized interventional study, comparing the
      investigational artificial intelligence tool with the current &quot;gold standard&quot;: Data
      acquisition will be obtained during one scheduled colonoscopic procedure by a trained
      endoscopist. During insertion, no action will be taken, colonoscopy is performed following
      the standard of care. Once withdrawal is started, a second observer (not a trained
      endoscopist but person trained in polyp recognition) will start the bedside Artificial
      intelligence (AI) tool, connected to the endoscope's tower, for detection. This second
      observer is trained in assessing endoscopic images to define the AI tool's outcome. Due to
      the second observer watching the separate AI screen, the endoscopist is blinded of the AI
      outcome. When a detection is made by the AI system that is not recognized by the endoscopist,
      the endoscopist will be asked to relocate that same detection and to reassess the lesion and
      the possible need of therapeutic action. All detections are separately counted and
      categorized by the second observer. All polyp detections will be removed following standard
      of care for histological assessment. The entire colonoscopic procedure is recorded via a
      separate linked video-recorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated non-randomized prospective interventional trial to validate
      the performance of a novel state-of-the-art computer-aided detection (CADe) tool for
      colorectal polyp detection implemented as second observer during routine diagnostic
      colonoscopy and to evaluate its feasibility in daily endoscopy. Consecutive patients referred
      for a screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy will be included.

      Patients will undergo a standard colonoscopy performed by a trained endoscopist. A second
      observer, who is not a trained endoscopist, will follow the procedure on a bedside AI-tool to
      count the number of detections made by the AI system and categorize the results into positive
      or negative results as follows (1) true positive, (2) false negative or (3) false positive.
      In case of a detection of the AI-system that was not seen by the endoscopist or unclear to
      the second observer, the second observer will ask to re-evaluate the indicated region to
      determine whether after second look the endoscopist has to take extra action. The entire
      procedure will be recorded.

      There are no additional risks specific to the use of the AI tool to be taken into account.
      General risk of colonoscopy (i.e.: perforation, bleeding or post-polypectomy syndrome) could
      occur with the same frequency as that of a colonoscopy without the use of this AI tool.

      All patients will receive a standard of care protocol during their colonoscopy. The AI system
      can only have a beneficial outcome for the patient, a better polyp detection, as it has shown
      to be non-inferior in terms of accuracy when compared to high detecting endoscopist in our
      pilot trial
