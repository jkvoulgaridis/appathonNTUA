      The purpose of the research study is to collect preliminary data to which future outcomes
      after implementing quality improvement projects or research will be compared. There will be
      observation of the labor and delivery services received and resulting outcomes of women and
      infants who deliver at private health facilities in urban Malawi. Data will be collected at
      admission, delivery, and discharge from women and providers on patient characteristics, labor
      and obstetric characteristics, delivery factors, and pregnancy outcomes that result during
      the course of the hospitalization. This will include the vital status of the mother and the
      infant. The overall hypothesis is that cesarean birth rates will be higher than the
      ecologically supported 10% cesarean birth rate, and that there may be cesareans that are
      performed without clear medical indication.

      Background Cesarean birth is the most commonly performed surgery in the world. It is a major
      abdominal procedure that can save maternal and perinatal lives when properly indicated, but
      when performed without medical necessity, is associated with adverse outcomes. Global
      cesarean birth rates are increasing, but there has been a less pronounced rise in sub-Saharan
      Africa (SSA) where rates tend to be below 5.0%. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and
      other low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), there is a recognition that significant
      in-country disparities in the use of cesarean birth exist. Rates are higher in urban
      settings, and there is evidence that they are higher in private versus public facilities.

      Objective and Aims The main objective of this prospective, cross-sectional, observational
      study is to observe the use of cesarean birth at three private health facilities in urban
      Malawi by the end of the study. This will be achieved by getting an understanding of the
      current delivery practices and patient characteristics, as well as associated outcomes of
      women who choose to deliver at these private facilities in order to understand how and under
      what circumstances the surgery is being used.

      Aim 1: Observe prevalence of and indications for cesarean birth in three private health
      facilities in urban Malawi in the overall cohort and in ten mutually exclusive subgroups
      defined by the WHO-endorsed Robson Classification for cesarean birth

      Aim 2: Determine risk factors associated with cesarean birth among Robson subpopulations of
      women at study sites, and the distribution of adverse pregnancy outcomes across those
      subgroups

      Aim 3: Identify target modifiable risk factors or areas for potential quality improvement or
      prospective research studies to optimize the use of cesarean birth within these facilities
      that may have generalizable implications
