      This study will be conducted to assess the effect of different preventive regimens using
      herbal toothpaste versus fluoride toothpaste on the management of remineralization and caries
      risk in high caries risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a major universal health problem with multiple etiological factors, so
      looking for economical and accurate plans for recognizing high-risk persons, and multiple
      risk factors to reduce the risk, in addition to caries management, using a caries risk
      assessment to detect the person who will develop caries, and provide them with suitable
      preventive and treatment regimens to disruption the disease procedure.

      The treatment should evade invasive treatments and a large emphasis on prevention (using
      fluoride toothpaste, solutions, patient education, and so on), to achieve the aim of new
      dentistry (minimal intervention). The application of such a regimen to manage initial caries
      lesions allows the dentist to reverse initial lesions with the minimal victim of healthy
      dental tissues.
