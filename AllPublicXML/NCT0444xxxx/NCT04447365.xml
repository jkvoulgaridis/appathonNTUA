  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 30 subjects recruited from the electrophysiology device clinic at the
      VA medical center. All patients will have a pre-existing implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator and a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy with left ventricular systolic function of
      35% or less by echocardiogram done within 1 year of the time of enrollment. 10 patients who
      have had no device-monitored ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia for the 3
      months prior to recruitment will comprise a group of controls. 20 patients will comprise a
      group of patients with high burden of ventricular arrhythmias, defined as patients with at
      least one sustained episode of VT/VF requiring ICD therapies in the 3 months preceding study
      enrollment. This information will be obtained from device interrogation at the time of
      recruitment. Patients will provide a fecal sample for analysis at the time of enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit patient from the VA pacemaker/ICD clinic. Patients with ICDs will be
      identified before scheduled clinical visit. They will be approached and educated about the
      study rationale and their involvement. Patient will be consented for participation in the
      study after their approval. They will be educated about donating fecal samples. Patients will
      be given fecal sampling kits to collect and subsequently mail in those samples to the
      University of Florida physiology laboratory where there will be processed in a HIPAA
      compliant way. These samples will be subjected to laboratory analysis which will be
      outsourced. Fecal samples will be analyzed by shotgun metagenomics to characterize the
      taxonomy of the gut flora and compare the taxonomic and physiologic differences between the
      groups.

           year prior to enrollment

      Inclusion criteria for control group:

      • no VT/VF on device interrogation for a period of at least 3 months preceding study
      enrollment

      Inclusion criteria for high ventricular arrhythmia burden group:

      • at least one episode of sustained VT/VF or VT/VF requiring ICD therapies within the
      preceding 3 months as assessed on device interrogation at the time of study enrollment

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  currently pregnant or have been pregnant in the last 6 months

        -  antibiotic treatment within 5 months of study enrollment (i.e. antibiotic therapy in the
           two months prior to the 3-month period of analysis for VT/VF)

        -  chronic use of medications/supplements that can potentially affect gut microbiota (i.e.
           probiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, glucocorticoids, other immune modulating
           medications, antacids or proton pump inhibitors)

        -  history of intestinal surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, lactose
           intolerance, chronic pancreatitis, or other malabsorption disorder

        Differences in gut microbiome in patients prone to clinically significant ventricular
        arrhythmias compared with matched controls with no ventricular arrhythmias. Evaluate
        potential clinical implications of the gut microbiome as it relates to ventricular
        arrhythmia burden and severity. Patients with an ICD and underlying cardiomyopathy to
        analyze fecal samples. The patients with high burden will be re-tested after undergoing a
        period of treatment for their arrhythmias and demonstrating a 3 month period wherein there
        are no recurrent device therapies. Fecal analysis of the groups will be compared.
