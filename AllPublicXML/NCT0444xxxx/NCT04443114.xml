  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this projects is to test the effectiveness of a tailored educational
      intervention in increasing knowledge about organ donation among Muslim Americans. More
      specifically, using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as a conceptual framework, the
      workshop's goal is to enhance attendee knowledge of the benefits and risks (behavioral
      beliefs and attitude), understanding of religious arguments for and against (normative
      beliefs and subjective norm), and procedural knowledge about the process and types of
      (control beliefs and perceived control) living organ donation.

      The study consists of two workshops (control and experimental) and an optional follow-up
      interview.

      The study contains 2 intervention arms based on the order in which the organ donation
      workshop is delivered at the mosque: early and late. The early arm will receive the
      experimental organ donation workshop first, followed by the control workshop (on end-of-life
      care). The late arm will receive the workshops in the opposite order (end-of-life care
      workshop followed by the organ donation workshop).

      To address varied adult learning styles, the workshops will incorporate didactic teaching,
      moderated panel presentations, and facilitated small group discussions led by a trained peer
      educator. Workshops will also involve self-administered surveys.
