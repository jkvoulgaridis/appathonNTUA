  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging methods bring new possibilities for describing the brain plasticity processes that
      underly the improvement of clinical function after physiotherapy in people with multiple
      sclerosis (pwMS). The study determined whether facilitation physiotherapy could enhance brain
      plasticity, compared two facilitation methods, and looked for any relation to clinical
      improvement in pwMS.

      The study was designed as parallel group randomized comparison of two kinds of
      physiotherapeutic interventions referred to healthy controls.

      MS patients were examined by fMRI (primary outcomes) and clinical tests (secondary outcomes)
      at the beginning of study. Then, they were randomly divided into two groups (by drawing lots
      in a 1:1 ratio). The first group underwent Vojta reflex locomotion (VRL), and the second
      Motor Program Activating Physiotherapy (MPAT). The length and intensity of treatment was the
      same in both groups (two months, one hour twice a week). After the treatment, a clinical and
      fMRI examination was performed. Healthy volunteers underwent an fMRI examination that was
      considered to be a control.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. The PASAT is presented using audio record to ensure standardization in the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The score for the PASAT is the total number correct out of 60 possible answers.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The T25-FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. The score for the T25-FW is the average of the two completed trials.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The MPAT was chosen for our clinical experience - it was developed and verified by our team. In this therapy, patients are corrected into a postural position where the joints are functionally centred. Then somatosensory (manual and verbal) stimuli are applied to activate motor programs in the brain, which then lead to the co-contraction of the patient's whole body when the patient is lying, sitting, standing up or moving forward. Activated programs are repeated under various conditions and in different situations and environments to teach the patients to use the acquired motor skills automatically in daily life.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Vojta Reflex Locomotion (VRL)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>VRL was developed by prof. Vojta and is standardly used in the Czech Republic. In this therapy, patients should be set up into the precisely given initial position with defined angular setting of extremities. In each position (supine, prone, lying on the side, and low kneeling position), activation points (zones) are stimulated with precise localization and pressure direction. Such stimulation activates one of the global movement patterns (reflex turning and reflex creeping) corresponding to the initial position. In addition to motor involuntarily reaction, also sensory and autonomic response is activated.</description>
