  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All across surgery specialties, wound or implant infections constitute rare, yet potentially
      severe complications of surgical procedure. It is considered, that glucose metabolism
      disorders, e.g. diabetes, are one of the main risk factors of such condition.

      Aim of the study The aim of the study is a prospective evaluation of glucose blood level and
      its variability during 2 weeks before hospitalization and 2 weeks of postoperative period in
      patients, that will undergo elective orthopaedic surgeries, and its impact on number of
      cardiovascular and orthopaedic complications.

      Materials and methods To this study, patients qualified for elective total knee or hip
      replacement in the single orthopedic center will be recruited. 100 patients will be included
      in this study. Every patient will be evaluated on the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in
      10 years time and on the risk of death in 10 years due to the cardiovascular events. 14 days
      before procedure patients will have continuous glucose level measurement sensor implemented
      in subcutaneous tissue. After 14 days, during standard visit for stitches removal, the sensor
      will be removed and glycemia data will be collected. Next, patients will have their casual
      glucose blood level checked and surgery outcome, cardiovascular events or surgery
      complication risk evaluated in 3-, 6- and 12 month follow-up visits.

      Expected benefits of the study Results of this study may allow to define impact of
      orthopaedic treatment on glycemia and possible necessity to modify treatment of hyperglycemia
      in perioperative period in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2). Moreover it will
      allow to specify change of glucose levels and possibly implicating a need to monitor
      perioperative glycemia in patients without carbohydrate metabolism disorders. Additionally,
      the study will help to evaluate corelation between perioperative glucose blood level and the
      risk of cardiovascular events or surgical complications in 1-year after the procedure, which
      may decrease the risk of such incidents in the future (e.g. by adequate control and effective
      treatment of hyperglycemia), hence may result in reduction of mortality and lesser lowering
      of the quality of life in patients with DM2 or high risk of it.

      In every surgical subspeciality surgical site or implants infections are not common but
      potentially devastating for patients health. One of the most known risk factors of such state
      is glucose metabolism disorders. Such pathologies, containing diabetes mellitus, are
      considered one of the most epidemic health-related problems in XXI century.

      Diabetes is a civilization disease, caused mainly by obesity, unhealthy eating habits and
      lack of physical activity. It was concerning about 108 million people in 1980, while in next
      40 years this number grew 4-times and is expecting to reach almost 600 million people in
      2035.

      Total joint arthroplasty is considered the most effective way of treating the end-stage
      osteoarthritis of hip and knee joints. It is estimated that every year more that one million
      total joint replacements are performed in Europe. It is believed that our community is
      getting older and that is the reason why the number of total joint replacements will be
      growing, as well as patients expectations towards it. Even though total knee and hip
      replacement have wonderful outcome and are improving significantly patients life and its
      quality, there are several potential side effect that might lower patients limb function.

      There were several studies confirming increased risk of surgical site or implants infections
      in patients undergoing total joint replacements such as knee or hip, who had perioperative
      poor glycemic control or had treated diabetes mellitus. However, there is lack of literature
      concerning analysis of continuous glycemia measurements before and after hospital stay. There
      are some promises that glycemic disturbances during postoperative period might also increase
      risk of cardiovascular events in this time and more frequent periods of hypoglycemia, which
      might result in higher risk of unconsciousness and falls. What is more higher cardiovascular
      risk is corelated with higher risk of disability and death.

      Results of this research will allow to investigate influence of orthopedic surgery on
      glycemia and possible modifications of hyperglycemia treatment in perioperative period in
      patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance. What is more it will allow to investigate
      changes of glycemia in patients with normal glycemia metabolism, potentially protecting them
      from hypoglycemia during hospital stay and increasing their awareness of potentially
      suffering diabetes mellitus in the future. Additionally, this study will allow to corelate
      perioperative glycemia levels with risk of cardiovascular events in one year follow-up, and
      its influence on surgical site and implants complications. Thanks to these findings surgeons
      will be able to lower the risk of such complications in the future, hence lowering mortality
      and quality of life, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus and from the group with
      high risk of developing this disorder.

      Nowadays, with technological development concerning our every day life, also devices used in
      medicine are getting more and more sophisticated and are making patients lifes easier. One of
      the most prominent examples of such device are the &quot;discs&quot; implanted into the subcutaneous
      tissue which might measure patients glycemia level. Thanks to it patients no longer need to
      measure it with traditional glucometers, which action relayed on blood samples collected from
      the tip of the finger. It was associated with every day unpleasant needling. Nowadays modern
      solution allow patients to get the result from their devices on their smartphones by only
      sliding it above the place of the implanted device.

      Taking into considerations, such a wide spread of diabetes mellitus in our population it is
      obvious, that among patients qualified for total hip or knee arthroplasty many of them will
      have this disease. Adding to it common risk factors of diabetes and osteoarthritis, such as
      obesity, it seems that number of patients with such diseases is much bigger than it seems.
      According to the literature mentioned above it is obvious that microangiopathic changes, as
      well as hyperglycemia, have negative influence on wound healing, surgery itself and might
      increase the risk of periprosthetic infections. It is worthy to look for ways to optimize
      patients care in perioperative period.

      Additional good side of this study is a fact, that it contains patients without recognized
      diabetes mellitus to assess their glycemia fluctuations, without carbohydrate metabolism
      disorders. Such knowledge might improve and allow to develop the algorithm of perioperative
      care for the high number of patients, who in such demanding for their body period are exposed
      to significant glycemia fluctuations.

      What is more, it must be admitted that this study has unique model (described below), in
      which glycemia monitoring will contain both pre- and postoperative period of every included
      patient. Such way of analyzing patients allows to produce &quot;perfect control group&quot;, because
      every measurements after the surgery has its counterpart before the surgery.

      The aim of this project is to prospectively evaluate the level of glycemia and its
      variability in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgeries during one month (two weeks
      before the surgery and two weeks postoperatively) and its influence on the number of
      cardiovascular and orthopedic complications. What is more the investigators want to evaluate
      its influence on objective functional outcome of the surgery in one year follow-up. It seems
      that long bone surgery as a stress factor might increase the risk of developing diabetes or
      glucose intolerance, what might increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and number of
      complications.

      To this prospective observational study, patients qualified for elective total knee or hip
      replacement in the Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation in Miedzyleski Specialist
      Hospital in Warsaw will be recruited. 100 patients will be included.

      There were several studies confirming increased risk of surgical site or implants infections
      in patients undergoing total joint replacements such as knee or hip, who had perioperative
      poor glycemic control or had treated diabetes mellitus. However, there is lack of literature
      concerning analysis of continuous glycemia measurements before and after hospital stay. There
      are some premises that glycemic disturbances during postoperative period might also increase
      risk of cardiovascular events in this time and more frequent periods of hypoglycemia, which
      might result in higher risk of unconsciousness and falls. What is more higher cardiovascular
      risk is corelated with higher risk of disability and death.

      Results of this research will allow to investigate influence of orthopedic surgery on
      glycemia and possible modifications of hyperglycemia treatment in perioperative period in
      patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance. What is more it will allow to investigate
      changes of glycemia in patients with normal glycemia metabolism, potentially protecting them
      from hypoglycemia during hospital stay and increasing their awareness of potentially
      suffering diabetes mellitus in the future. Additionally, this study will allow to corelate
      perioperative glycemia levels with risk of cardiovascular events in one year follow-up, and
      its influence on surgical site and implants complications. Thanks to these findings surgeons
      will be able to lower the risk of such complications in the future, hence lowering mortality
      and quality of life, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus and from the group with
      high risk of developing this disorder.

        Power analysis was performed to assess how many patients should be included in the study.
        Determining effect size was hindered by lack of literature comparing mean values and
        standard deviations (SD) between groups with and without complications. The effect size can
        be deemed &quot;large&quot;, described numerically as 0.8 by Cohen. However, we decide to be more
        conservative and used effect size of 0.6, located between &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;large&quot; in Cohen's
        scale. Standard p value of 0.05, beta value of 0.8 and allocation ratio of 1/1 were used,
        resulting in total needed sample size of 90 patients. Taking into consideration that 10 %
        of patients might drop off the follow-up predicted number of participants is 100.
