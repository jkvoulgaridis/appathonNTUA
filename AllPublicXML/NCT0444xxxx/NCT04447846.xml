  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the utility of cannabidiol (CBD/ Epidiolex)
      for improving the treatment of cognitive impairments in Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to gain an understanding of the utility of pharmaceutical grade CBD
      used for the treatment of cognitive impairments in SWS in this open-label study. Anecdotal
      evidence from a phase I trial investigating the use of CBD for medically refractory seizures
      suggests CBD may also have a beneficial effect on cognition, mood, and behavior. The
      investigators hypothesize that CBD/ Epidiolex will improve SWS brain function resulting in
      improved cognitive function, social interactions, mood, motor function and behavior, as well
      as reduced migraines. This is an open-label prospective oral drug trial of Epidiolex in 10
      subjects. Assessments will be done at baseline and repeated after 6 months on study drug.
