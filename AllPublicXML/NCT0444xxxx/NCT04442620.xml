  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized trial evaluates the role of customized dietary and physical
      activity intervention on the progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in
      patients with obesity and presenting at least three of the main Metabolic Syndrome traits.

      The project proposes a personalized nutritional intervention based on a Mediterranean
      customized diet which introduces plenty of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactive
      components, coupled with physical activity promotion to prevent and reverse NAFLD among obese
      patients with metabolic syndrome. This will be compared with two more dietary strategies
      including a Mediterranean Diet intervention with seven meals a day and the conventional
      dietary approach proposed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
      (AASLD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no licensed pharmacological treatment for reversing Non-Alcoholic Fatty
      Liver Disease (NAFLD), this is why nutritional and lifestyle strategies are pivotal to
      ameliorate risk factors and prevent disease progression. Weight loss achieved by a weight
      loss diet and exercise is certainly the principal treatment for the amelioration of fatty
      liver, nevertheless quality of diet composition could also play a crucial role. Since
      oxidative stress and inflammation have been cited among the mechanisms involved in NAFLD,
      foods containing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactive components should be considered
      when designing a nutritionally sound diet. The Mediterranean Diet, naturally rich in
      antioxidants and antinflammatory foods, together with personalised physical activity could
      have a variety of positive health effects, including the slowing down of degenerative
      diseases such as liver steatosis.

      The present study aims to compare and evaluate the efficacy of three interventions on the
      pathophysiological mechanisms that may affect changes in liver fat deposits and progression
      of NAFLD in patients with obesity and presenting at least three of the main Metabolic
      Syndrome traits.

      The first intervention group receives a caloric restricted Mediterranean Diet coupled with
      physical activity (delivered through guided gym classes); the second group receives a caloric
      restricted Mediterranean Diet distributed over 7 meals and advise to walk 10.000 steps a day;
      the third group receives the conventional diet proposed by the American Association for the
      Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and advise to walk 10.000 steps a day.

    <description>The primary outcome is to measure the change of liver steatosis (expressed as percentage of liver steatosis) after applying a different intervention to each group (PA-MD; HMF-MD; or CD) of participants with metabolic syndrome.
It will be measured (at baseline, and after 6, 12 and 24 months of intervention) by means of a 1.5-T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Signa Explorer 1.5T, General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois., U.S.A) by using a 12-channel phased-array coil.</description>

It will be measured (at baseline, and after 6, 12 and 24 months of intervention) by using Shear Wave Measurement (SWM) (Hitachi Ltd, Japan) and the echograph Arietta V70 (Hitachi Medical System Europe Holding AG, Steinhausen, Switzerland).</description>

    <arm_group_label>1st group: Physical Activity and Mediterranean Diet (PA-MD)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A first group of participants will be advised to reduce their caloric intake by 25-30% with a macronutrients distribution of 35-40% fat, 20% proteins, and 40-45% carbohydrates. Healthy fats (a maximum of 8-10% from saturated fats, &gt;20% from monounsaturated fats, &gt;10% from polyunsaturated fats and &lt;300 mg/day of cholesterol) and low glycaemic index foods rich in fibre (not less than 30-35g /day) are strongly advised, together with foods rich in antioxidants, namely fruits and vegetables. Such diet reflects the traditional Mediterranean Diet described in the PREDIMED (Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet)-Plus study.
As for physical activity, patients the participants will be recommended a 35 minutes interval training session three times a week. Physical activity sessions of 35 minutes will consist of 5 minutes warm-up, 20 minutes interval training, and 10 minutes breathing and stretching.</description>

Participants will be advised to consume 7 meals a day, gradually reducing the caloric content at each main meal, and to walk 10.000 steps a day.</description>

Meal frequency will be of 3-5 meals a day. Moreover, the participants will be advised to walk 10.000 steps a day.</description>
