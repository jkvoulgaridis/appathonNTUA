  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2/3 study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of the combination of
      selinexor and R-GDP (SR-GDP) in patients with RR DLBCL who are not intended to receive
      hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T)
      therapy. The Phase 2 portion of the study will assess the two doses of selinexor (40
      milligram [mg] or 60 mg) in combination with R-GDP, for up to 6 cycles (21-day per cycle),
      followed by 60 mg selinexor single agent continuous therapy for those who have reached a
      partial or complete response. The Phase 3 portion of the study will evaluate the selected
      dose of SR-GDP (identified in Phase 2) versus standard R-GDP + matching placebo, for up to 6
      cycles (21-day per cycle), followed by placebo or 60 mg selinexor single agent continuous
      therapy for those who have reached partial or complete response.
