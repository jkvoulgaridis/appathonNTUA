  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Blocking the femoral nerve (or
      saphenous nerve) in the adductor canal is increasingly used for knee analgesia. It carries
      potential benefits that encourage anesthesiologists to do it. It has a motor sparing
      property. Injection of local anesthetics in this lengthy canal that contains a variable
      amount of connective or fibrous tissue might lead to a patchy distribution of local
      anesthetics. Thus, the possibility of incomplete block of the saphenous nerve (most important
      nerve in knee innervations) cannot be excluded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of the adductor canal block to the combined
      adductor canal block and saphenous nerve block at the distal third of thigh in the
      intermuscular plane between Vastus Medialis and Sartorius muscles in pain relief following
      knee arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament repair.

      After written informed consent, patients will be randomized in three groups:

      Group (Adductor 20): Ultrasound guided adductor canal block will be performed with injection
      of 20 ml bupivcaine 0.5%.

      Group (Adductor 30) Ultrasound guided adductor canal block will be performed with injection
      of 30 ml bupivacaine 0.5%. Group (Adductor/saphenous ): Ultrasound guided adductor canal
      block will be performed by injection of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5%, combined with ultrasound
      guided saphenous

    <description>It will be performed at the midthigh level, approximately halfway between the superior anterior iliac spine and the patella, a high-frequency linear ultrasound (US) transducer 5-12 MHz probe. Underneath the sartorius muscle the femoral artery was identified, with the vein just inferior and the saphenous nerve just lateral to the artery. From the lateral side of the transducer a 10-cm, 18-gauge Tuohy needle (Braun Medical, Melsungen, Germany) was inserted in plane, through the Sartorius muscle. With the tip of the Tuohy needle placed just underneath the vasto-adductor membrane and lateral to the artery and the saphenous nerve, 20 ml local anesthetic mixture will be injected to expand the adductor canal. the volume of local anesthetic will be selected according to the studied group</description>

    <description>It will be performed at the intermuscular plane between the sartorius and the vasus medialis muscles at the lower third of the thigh.
The US probe will be positioned on the front of the lower part of the thigh immediately above the patella to see both the patella (hyperechoic curved line) and vastus medialis infront of it (closer to skin). The probe is then moved medially over the vastus medialis till we see the end of the muscle and we see an intermuscular plane between it and Sartorius muscle. A 20 guage spinal needle will be then passed in an in plane direction within the substance of vastus medialis muscle and then pass within the vastus medialis until it faces the intermuscular plane between VM muscle and Sartorius. Once the needle tip is located in close proximity to the target structures, gentle aspiration will be performed followed by 20 ml local anesthetic will be injected.</description>

    <description>General anesthesia was induced by propofol 1-2 mg/kg fentanyle 100micg and laryngeal mask was inserted. Maintanace of anesthesia was performed by sevoflurane 2-3%.
Then the surgical procedure started. All patients had arthroscopic knee surgery( ACL repair) surgery under tourniquet control.
Immediately after end the surgical procedure, either ACB or combined ACB and saphenous nerve block distal to adductor canal were performed according to randomization.</description>
