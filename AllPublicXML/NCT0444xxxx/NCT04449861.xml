          3. Histologically or cytologically documented extensive stage SCLC (stage IV [T any, N
             any, M1 a/b], or with T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too extensive or have
             tumor/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan,
             according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage 8th edition).

             study entry.

          4. Patients must be considered suitable to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen
             as 1st line treatment for the ES-SCLC. Chemotherapy must contain either cisplatin or

             Status of 0 to 2 at enrollment.

             6.1Note: Patients with PS2 will be limited to a maximum of 20% of the total study
             population; once this limit is met, additional enrolled patients must have PS 0-1.

          7. Body weight &gt;30 kg.

          8. Baseline CT/MRI results of the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands)
             within 28 days prior to the treatment initiation.

          9. No prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy including, but not limited to, other
             anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-programmed cell death ligand 2
             (anti-PD-L2) antibodies, excluding therapeutic anticancer vaccines.

             10.1 Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL. 10.2 Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/L (use of
             granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is not permitted at screening).

             10.3 Platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L. 10.4 Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × the upper limit of
             normal (ULN). 10.5 In patients without hepatic metastasis: ALT and AST ≤2.5 × ULN.
             10.6 In patients with hepatic metastases, ALT and AST ≤5 × ULN. 10.7 Measured or
             calculated creatinine clearance: &gt;60mL/min for patients planned to be treated with
             cisplatin and &gt;40mL/min for patients planned to be treated with carboplatin

         11. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous IP assignment in the present study.

          2. Medical contraindication to etoposide-platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin)-based
             chemotherapy.

          3. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (non-interventional) clinical study or during the follow-up period of an
             interventional study.

          4. Received prior systemic therapy for ES-SCLC.

             evaluation of the study drug or interpretation of patient safety.

          6. Planned consolidation chest radiation therapy. Radiation therapy outside of the chest
             for palliative care (ie, bone metastasis) is allowed but must be completed before
             first dose of the study medication.

          7. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of IP. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is
             acceptable.

          8. History of allogeneic organ transplantation.

          9. Has a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) of autoimmune nature, requiring systemic treatment
             (systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents) or has a clinical symptomatology
             suggesting worsening of PNS.

         10. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including
             inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis with the
             exception of diverticulosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome, or
             Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypophysitis, and uveitis, etc]). The following are exceptions to this
             criterion:

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, active interstitial lung disease,
             serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement,
             substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient
             to give written informed consent.

         12. History of active primary immunodeficiency.

         13. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen [HbsAg]
             result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).
             Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B
             core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HbsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is
             negative for HCV RNA.

         14. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of durvalumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:

         15. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP.
             Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and
             up to 30 days after the last dose of IP.

         16. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from
             Screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab.
