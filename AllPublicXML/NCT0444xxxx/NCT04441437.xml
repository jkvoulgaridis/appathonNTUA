    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was designed to study the efficacy of dynamic
      hand splinting on spastic hemiparetic patients due to stroke or traumatic brain injury.

    <textblock>
      Subjects were recruited from both inpatients and outpatients who received rehabilitation
      programs in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at a regional teaching
      hospital in Taiwan. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: the splint group
      and the control group. The subjects in the splint group received 1-hour task-oriented
      training with wearing a customized dynamic hand splint, totally 15 times in a duration of one
      month plus conventional rehabilitation programs. The subjects in the control group received
      the same treatments but without splint used. Evaluations including Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS), active range of motion (AROM), grip strength, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Motor
      Activity Log 30(MAL), and F/M ratio were performed at baseline, post-training, and 2 months
      later after the intervention finished, and the evaluators were blinded to the grouping of the
      subjects.

    <time_frame>Performed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was made in sitting position with the palm of the affected side placed at the edge of table. Then his or her 2nd to 5th fingers was moved by the examiner from maximum possible flexion to maximum possible extension over a duration of about one second. All of the four fingers were done at once. The participant's wrist and elbow were then also tested in the same manner. The lowest score was zero and the highest score was 415. For statistical purposes, the MAS score '1+' is considered as 2, '2' as 3, and so on until 5.</description>

    <time_frame>Performed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>For the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FMA), a 3-graded scale with 0 as minimum and 2 as maximum was applied for grading of sensorimotor function.19 The testing procedure was conducted in a standardized manner according to the written instructions originally published and some additional general guidelines.20, 21 For motor function assessment, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE) was used. Clear and precise instructions were given to a seated participant for each movement. The unaffected side simulated first and then the affected side was evaluated. Each activity was repeated 3 times and the highest score was recorded. The maximum total score was 66. For sensory function assessment, the Modified Fugl-Meyer sensory assessment (FMA-sensory) was used. This included tests of the light touch, temperature, tactile localization and position sensation of the upper arm, forearm, hand, thigh, calf and foot of the affected side. The maximum total score was 44.</description>

    <measure>F/M ratio of ulnar nerve</measure>
    <time_frame>Performed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>An electrophysiological examination was performed with an active recording surface electrode (G1) placed over the belly of the abductor digiti minimi of the affected side, a reference electrode (G2) placed on the phalanx of the little finger, and a ground electrode placed on the back of the hand between the stimulating and recording electrodes. Supra-maximal stimulations at the wrist 8 cm away from G1 was performed to obtain the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and F wave of the ADM muscle with the cathode distal and proximal to the anode, respectively. The stimulation was given less than 1 Hz to avoid influences from the previous stimulus. The ratio of amplitude of the mean and the maximal F-wave to the CMAP (F/M ratio) were then calculated.</description>
