  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains as one of leading causes of maternal morbidity and
      mortality, with postpartum period carries the greatest risk. Perinatal thromboprophylaxis is
      often administered based on risk-factor assessment. Low molecular weight heparin has a proven
      safety profile in obstetrics population, however its porcine derived content may lead to
      reduced uptake amongst certain religious groups. The investigators aimed to evaluate the
      safety of fondaparinux as an alternative postpartum thromboprophylaxis.

      The investigators planned a prospective, single arm, open label study. Women who fulfilled
      the criteria for post natal thromboprophylaxis based on the 2015 RCOG guidelines were
      recruited. Each patient would receive subcutaneous injection of Fondaparinux, 2.5mg daily for
      10 days. The investigators would conduct a telephone interview on day 10 post delivery and
      six week outpatient review in clinic.

      All women were taught the injection technique and counselled regarding the symptoms of
      bleeding and VTE, prior to discharge. All patients were also advised to wear compression
      stockings and ensure adequate hydration at home

      The primary outcome measure was occurrence of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis
      suggestive by clinical symptoms and assessment. Secondary outcome measures were allergic
      reaction and bleeding tendency such as secondary post-partum haemorrhage, spinal site
      bleeding and wound haematoma. Allergic reaction and bleeding tendency in neonates were also
      recorded.
