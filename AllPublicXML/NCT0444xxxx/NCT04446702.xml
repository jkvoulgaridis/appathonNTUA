    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the long-term use of abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®) in
      adult subjects affected with upper limb spasticity (ULS) +/- lower limb spasticity (LLS) who
      received treatment with Dysport® for a minimum of three injections cycles at the Instituto de
      Medicina Física e Reabilitação do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da
      Universidade de São Paulo (IMREA HC FMUSP) in Brazil.

    <description>The MAS is a six-point scale to grade muscle tone in the injected muscle from 0 (no increase in tone) to 4 (affected parts rigid in flexion or extension).

    <description>Subscales and total scores of FIM will be measured. The FIM is a method for categorising patients on a seven-point scale (range 1 to 7). It comprises of 18 items, grouped into 2 subscales (motor and cognition). The motor subscale includes: eating, grooming, bathing, dressing upper body, dressing lower body, toileting, bladder management, bowel management, transfers - bed/chair/wheelchair, transfers - toilet, transfers - bath/shower, walk/wheelchair and stairs. The cognition subscale includes: comprehension, expression, social interaction, problem solving and memory. The Scores are summed to obtain a total score that can range between 18 and 126.</description>

    <description>Adverse events will be assessed according to incidence, intensity/grade (mild, moderate and severe), causality (related and not related to the product), outcome (the overall association between an exposure to a drug and an outcome) and action taken. All Adverse Events (AEs) (including fatal events and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)) and special situation (pregnancy, overdose, off-label use) will be reported with the number and proportion of events.
