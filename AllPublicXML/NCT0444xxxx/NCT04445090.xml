        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure
             (BP), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature (T)), 12-lead ECG, and
             clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

             accordance with GCP and local legislation

          -  Male subjects who meet any of the following criteria from at least 30 days before the
             first administration of trial medication until 30 days after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods (of female
                  partners) plus condom: implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal

               -  Postmenopausal female partner, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous
                  amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with follicle stimulating
                  hormone (FSH) above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance, in particular, hepatic parameters (alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin) or renal parameters
             (creatinine) exceeding the upper limit of normal (ULN) after repeated measurements

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or any unexplained
             blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  A positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and/ or any
             clinical symptom suggestive for this disease at screening and on Day -3.

        Further exclusion criteria apply.
