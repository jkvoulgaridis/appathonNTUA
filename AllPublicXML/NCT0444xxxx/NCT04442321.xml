  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylalgia is a common musculoskeletal condition that approximately affects 1-3%
      of the general population. Several authors have found greater mechanical pain sensitivity in
      the radial nerve when compared with healthy subjects. Radial tunnel syndrome exhibits a
      similar clinical presentation to lateral epicondylalgia. Percutaneous electrical stimulation
      has shown reduce pain in several conditions. Percutaneous electrical stimulation on the
      radial nerve could cause an important relief in lateral epicondylalgia.

      Hypothesis: Percutaneous electrical stimulation on radial nerve plus exercise therapy in
      patients with lateral epicondylalgia is better than sham percutaneous electrical stimulation
      plus exercise.

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using Percutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (PENS). PENS is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, mid and long-term
      of PENS on intensity of pain as measured by numeric pain rating scale and disability as
      measured by Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) in patients with lateral
      epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS plus exercise program or Sham
      PENS plus exercise program.

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, medium and
      long-term of PENS on disability as measured by DASH questionnaire, and psychological factors
      (fear and avoidance and catastrophism) and Global Rating of Change (GRoC) in patients with
      lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS plus exercise program
      or Sham PENS plus exercise program.

    <description>Measured with Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire. It includes 30 items assessing (1) degree of difficulty during the preceding week in performing several physical activities because of problems in a upper extremity (21 items), (2) severity of each of the symptoms of pain, activity related pain, tingling, weakness, and stiffness (5 items), and (3) the problem's effect on social activities, work, and sleep and its psychological impact (4 items). Each item is answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (no difficulty to perform, no symptom, or no impact) to 5 (unable to do, very severe symptom, or high impact). The responses to the 30 items are summed to form a raw score that is then converted to a scale from 0 to 100 with a formula. A higher score reflects greater disability.</description>

    <description>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia. To assess the fear of movement and pain-related fear. The 11 items are scored 1-4, with total scores ranging from 11 to 44. The addition of all the points obtained from each of the items results in the level of kinesiophobia, with higher scores indicating greater perceived kinesiophobia</description>

    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). This tool is a 13-item questionnaire designed to measure the three components of pain-related catastrophizing: rumination, magnification, and helplessness, resulting in a unique score. Each item is responded to on a 5-point scale (0 not at all, 4 all the time) relating the degree to which the individual experiences a thought or feeling of a painful situation.</description>
