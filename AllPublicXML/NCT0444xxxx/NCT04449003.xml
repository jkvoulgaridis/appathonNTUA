  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a cross-sectional, observational pilot study to explore the prevalence
      of stress among adolescents with Tourette syndrome. Investigators will recruit adolescents
      with TS aged 13-17 years of age presenting for routine clinical care. Questionnaires and
      semi-structured clinical interviews with participants and a parent/caregiver will be
      collected. Specifically, this battery of questionnaires and interviews will both screen for
      and quantify the extent of tics, stress, and mental health symptoms prevalent in TS,
      including anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette syndrome (TS) is a multi-faceted neurodevelopmental disorder with wide-ranging
      impact on adolescent quality of life (QOL). Comorbid psychiatric and psychological factors
      exert greater influence on QOL than tics in TS, but the specific role of stress has been
      largely overlooked, despite the fact that this component of mental health has a profound
      effect on current and future QOL in those with chronic disease. Investigators propose a
      cross-sectional, observational pilot study to explore the prevalence of stress among
      adolescents with Tourette syndrome. The primary goal of this study is to collect sufficient
      data for hypothesis-generation and power analysis refinement in planning of a larger scale
      study.

      Investigators will recruit adolescents with TS aged 13-17 years of age presenting for regular
      care at the Vanderbilt Pediatric Neurology Clinic. Questionnaires and semi-structured
      clinical interviews with participants and a parent/caregiver will be collected. Specifically,
      this battery of questionnaires and interviews will both screen for and quantify the extent of
      tics, stress, and mental health symptoms prevalent in TS, including anxiety, depression,
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The
      battery can be completed by the child and caregiver in parallel and is anticipated to take
      50-60 minutes to complete. The study plans to enroll subjects over a 12-month time frame.
