      This study evaluate the effect of latent infection of tuberculosis on the pregnancy outcome
      of IVF-ET in infertile patients with radiographic lesions suggesting old healed tuberculosis

      China is one of the countries with high burden of tuberculosis (TB) defined by WHO. IVF-ET is
      an effective method to treat infertility. Chest X-ray is a routine examination before IVF-ET,
      which can exclude active tuberculosis. However, for patients with chest X-ray showing old
      healed tuberculosis, the relationship between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and
      pregnancy outcomes is unknown. In this study, a prospective cohort study was carried out in
      infertile women who were planning to receive IVF-ET. IGRA were tested in patients with old
      tuberculosis in chest X-ray. A cohort of IGRA positive and IGRA negative was constructed. The
      pregnancy outcomes were followed up prospectively and the relationship between latent
      infection of tuberculosis and pregnancy outcomes was analyzed. The primary outcome was
      clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate. Secondary outcomes were
      tuberculosis reactivation during pregnancy period and in 3 months after delivery.

        Participants were recruited between January 1, 2019, and December 30, 2020, at Peking
        University Third Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in Beijing, China. A
        board-certified radiologist reviewed CXRs and, if available, chest computed tomography (CT)
        scans, of women who referred to the reproductive center for IVF-ET. The patients who had
        chest imaging abnormalities consistent with old healed TB were admitted or referred to the
        respiratory clinic and enrolled.
