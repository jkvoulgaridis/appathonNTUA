    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent form.

          -  Ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Have documented previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia according to iwCLL /
             WHO criteria.

          -  Require treatment of CLL per iwCLL guidelines.

          -  CIRS score ≤ 6.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate hematologic function (unless caused by underlying disease, as established by
             extensive bone marrow involvement or as a result of hypersplenism secondary to the
             involvement of the spleen by CLL per the investigator) defined as follows:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL without transfusion support, unless anemia is due to marrow
                  involvement of CLL.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L.

               -  Platelet count ≥ 30 x 109/L; in cases of thrombocytopenia clearly due to marrow
                  involvement of CLL (per the discretion of the investigator), platelet count
                  should be ≥ 10 x 109/L if there is bone marrow involvement.

          -  Adequate renal function, as indicated by modified Cockcroft-Gault equation (eCCR; with
             the use of ideal body mass [IBM] instead of mass) of &gt; 70mL/min

          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by:

               -  AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (or ≤ 5 x ULN for patients with documented Gilbert
                  syndrome).

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of
             venetoclax or 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, whichever is longer.

               -  Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.

               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt; 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper
                  intrauterine devices.

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined
             below:

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90
                  days after the last dose of venetoclax or 18 months after the last dose of
                  obinutuzumab, whichever is longer. Men must refrain from donating sperm during
                  this same period.

               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom for the
                  duration of the pregnancy to avoid exposing the embryo.

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.
