      Part 1: A first-in-human, open-label, Phase I dose escalation study of DSP107 monotherapy and
      combination therapy with atezolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Part 2: Preliminary efficacy assessment of DSP107 single agent treatment and DSP107 in
      combination with atezolizumab in second line treatment of non small cell lung cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first time that DSP107 is administered to human subjects. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      preliminary efficacy of DSP107 monotherapy and combination therapy in a two-part design.

      Part 1 will involve DSP107 monotherapy dose escalation in subjects with advanced solid tumors
      that are not amenable to surgical resection or other approved therapeutic options that have
      demonstrated clinical benefit. Additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled to establish
      a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab.

      Part 2 will comprise a single expansion cohort consisting of two treatment arms in which
      subjects will be treated either with DSP107 monotherapy or DSP107 in combination with
      atezolizumab. This part of the study will enrol subjects with non small cell lung cancer who
      have progressed following first line treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents having
      previously achieved a best response of stable disease or better.

    <intervention_model_description>Part 1 will involve sequential enrolment of patient cohorts to investigate the safety of up to 7 potential dose levels. Dose escalation will commence with up to 3 single subject cohorts before moving to a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose.
Up to 3 additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled in parallel to the monotherapy dose escalation to establish a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab. These dose-finding combination arms will start at least one dose level below a DSP107 monotherapy dose that has already been deemed safe.
Part 2 information will be updated on completion of Part 1.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
