  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-labelled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the induction treatment of patients with
      locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who were judged surgically
      unresectable or appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy. The objective response rate
      (ORR) and safety will be evaluated as the primary endpoints, the 2-year overall survival (OS)
      rate and progression free survival (PFS) rate will be the second endpoints.

          2. Clinical stage of III-IVb (AJCC 2018);

          3. Surgically unresectable and/or refuse surgery or appropriate for non-surgical
             definitive therapy;

          4. Measurable disease;

          5. Eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ECOG PS) score: 0-1;

          6. Blood routine: white blood cells&gt; 3,000/mm3, hemoglobin&gt; 8g/L, platelets&gt;
             80,000/mm3；Liver function: Alanine Transaminase/Aspartate Transaminase &lt;2.5 times the
             upper limit of normal, bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal; Renal function:
             serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal;

          7. Sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with poor-controlled arterial hypertension (systolic pressure ≥ 140 mmHg
             and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) despite standard medical management;

          2. Suffered from grade II or above myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction,
             uncontrolled arrhythmias (including QT interval male ≥ 450 ms, female ≥ 470 ms). Grade
             III-IV cardiac insufficiency according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria
             or echocardiography check: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&lt;50%;

          3. Has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for cervical
             cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of the
             skin;

          4. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

          5. Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents;

          6. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

          7. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
