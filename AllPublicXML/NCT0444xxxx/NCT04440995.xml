  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectoral nerve blocks (PECS blok) are used in postoperative analgesia after breast surgery in
      nowadays. Many studies shows that pectoral nerve blocks is effective for reducing pain and
      postoperative opioid consumption undergoing mastectomy. This study was planned to evaluate
      the efficacy of intraoperative PECS block for postoperative analgesia after robot breast
      surgery and immediate breast reconstruction.

    <textblock>
      Sixty patients were randomly allocated into two groups by computerised process, each
      including 30 patients. PECS group (P) received general anesthesia and pectoral nerve
      block(PECS block) with 025% ropivacaine after surgical resection of breast by operator.
      Control group(C) only received general anesthesia.

      A Patient -controlled analgesia(PCA) device provides fentanyl for postoperative pain control.

      The Primary outcome measures total dose of fentanyl consumption during the postoperative 24
      hours, and secondary outcome measures pain scores at rest and movement.

    <description>Patients received standardized general anesthesia. PECS block were applied under vision using blunted tip cannula(27G, 30mm) after surgical resection of breast by operator. 0.25% ropivacaine 10ml was injected into fascia between pectoralis major and minor muscles. 0.25% ropivacaine 20ml was injected into fascia between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles at the level of the third rib.
