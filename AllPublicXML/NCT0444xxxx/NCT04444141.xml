  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104，an anti- PD-1 and
      CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, in subjects with relapsed or refractory peripheral T cell
      lymphoma. The subject will receive AK104 450mg Q2W until unacceptable toxicity, confirmed
      disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or for a maximum of 24 months.
