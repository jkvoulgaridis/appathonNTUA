  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of optic disc swelling at the fundus is a non-specific clinical sign that can
      occur in many ophthalmologic, neuro-ophthalmologic or encephalic pathologies. The diagnostic
      range is vast, including inflammatory pathologies of the optic nerve, infiltrative or
      compressive orbital pathologies, idiopathic or secondary intracranial hypertensions, not to
      mention the pseudo optic disc swelling found in dr√ºsens.

      MRI is increasingly being used as a first-line examination to obtain an etiologic diagnosis
      in a patient with optic disc swelling. It allows a rapid diagnosis to be made in cases of
      inflammatory pathology or compressive or infiltrative pathology. It can provide very
      suggestive elements in the case of intracranial hypertension. It appears to be potentially
      useful in diagnosing ischemic optic neuropathy or in directing towards an etiological
      diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis.

      The development of new high-resolution MRI sequences has made it possible to obtain extremely
      fine resolutions of a few hundred microns in the plane. Apart from a few clinical cases and
      small series, there is no precise evaluation of the interest of these new sequences in the
      positive and etiological diagnosis of ophthalmological, neuro-ophthalmological and encephalic
      pathologies responsible for the presence of optic disc swelling.

      The objective of our study is therefore to evaluate the diagnostic contribution and the gain
      in diagnostic confidence provided by these new sequences in the context of pathologies
      manifesting as optic disc swelling.
