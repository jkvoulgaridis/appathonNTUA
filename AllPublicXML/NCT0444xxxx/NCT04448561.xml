  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses
      of ASP8062 or placebo alone and in combination with a single dose of morphine.

      This study will also assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between ASP8062 and
      morphine.

      Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to first investigational product
      administration. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and
      will be residential for a single period of 17 days/16 nights.

      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 16 on the condition that all
      required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer
      stay in the clinical unit.

    <time_frame>Up to day 25</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study Investigational Product (IP), whether or not considered related to the study IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study IP. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if, the event: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation to hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other medically important event.</description>
