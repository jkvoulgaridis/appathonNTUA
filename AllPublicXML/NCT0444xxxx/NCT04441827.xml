      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pranayama and deep breathing exercise in
      reducing fatigue and insomnia in patients receiving radiotherapy due to breast cancer. The
      randomized controlled interventional study was carried out with 60 patients divided into the
      pranayama (20), deep breathing exercise (20) and control group (20). Data were collected with
      the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS).

      Study sample The study population consisted of patients diagnosed with breast cancer, who
      received radiotherapy in the radiation oncology unit of a hospital in Ankara, between June
      01, 2017 and January 31, 2019.

      At least three additional volunteers (16%) for each group were added, considering monitoring
      and data loss during the follow-up. Thus, the number of subjects was determined as 63
      individuals (21 for each group).

      Of the 63 patients, one wanted to interrupt the treatment and two did not want to continue in
      the study, hence the study was concluded with 20 patients in each group (60 patients).

      Instruments Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) Insomnia Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) Score Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Questionnaire on Patients'
      Opinions of the Exercises Patients in the pranayama, deep breathing exercise and control
      group were evaluated six times in terms of fatigue and insomnia VAS scores. PFS and PSQI were
      evaluated once prior to and after the 25-day session of radiotherapy treatment.

      Interventions Protocols for pranayama and deep breathing exercises were prepared Pranayama
      and Deep Breathing Exercise Groups: The patients were taught pranayama and deep breathing
      exercises by the researcher before the radiotherapy started. The patients were observed
      performing these exercises for 10 minutes after each radiotherapy session (25 days)
      accompanied by the researcher in a quiet room within the radiotherapy unit containing two
      couches and a chair.

      Control Group: The patients in this group did not receive any intervention.
