  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, single arm, open-label study in Japanese subjects with DIPSS
      intermediate or high-risk PMF, post-PV or post-ET MF. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1
      part to determine safety and tolerability and a RP2D. The Phase 1 portion of the study will
      explore one or more drug doses for fedratinib (300 mg and 400 mg) using a mTPI-2 design.
      Following completion of dose escalation and determination of MTD and/or a RP2D, the study
      will progress into the Phase 2 part to further evaluate the efficacy and safety.

      The study will consist of 3 periods: a Screening Period, a Treatment Period including a
      30-day follow-up after last dose visit and a survival follow-up period.

             recent local pathology report

          4. Subject has a Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) Risk score of
             Intermediate-1 with symptom(s), Intermediate-2 or High

          5. Subject has a measurable splenomegaly during the screening period as demonstrated by
             spleen volume of ≥ 450 cm3 by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
             (CT) scan or by palpable spleen measuring ≥ 5 cm below the left costal margin.

          6. Subject must meet at least one of the following criteria of (a or b).

             Note: reason to discontinue ruxolitinib treatment (lack of efficacy and/or
             intolerability, etc) and physician decision as to the study participation as being
             appropriate should be recorded in the case report form:

               1. Previously received ruxolitinib treatment for PMF or post-PV MF or post-ET MF for
                  at least 14 days (exposure of &lt; 14 days is allowed for subjects who discontinued
                  ruxolitinib due to intolerability or allergy).

               2. Never received ruxolitinib treatment and is expected to derive clinical benefit
                  from this study participation based on the clinical judgement of the Investigator
                  Only those subjects who previously received ruxolitinib treatment are eligible
                  for the Phase 1 part of the study to avoid overestimating tolerability of
                  fedratinib.

          7. Subject must have treatment-related toxicities from prior therapy resolved to Grade 1
             or pretreatment baseline before start of last therapy prior to starting the fedratinib
             treatment.

          8. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          9. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

         10. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:

               1. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator during screening
                  prior to starting fedratinib treatment. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy
                  testing during the course of the study, and after end of fedratinib treatment.
                  This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual
                  contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use and be able to
                  comply with highly effective contraception** without interruption, -14 days prior
                  to starting investigational product, during the fedratinib treatment (including
                  dose interruptions), and for 30 days after discontinuation of fedratinib
                  treatment.

               3. If breastfeeding, agree to stop breastfeeding prior to the participation in the
                  study and not to resume breastfeeding for at least 30 days after treatment
                  discontinuation of the fedratinib treatment.

             Note: A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved
             menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy,
             or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy or
             amenorrhea due to other medical reasons does not rule out childbearing potential) for
             at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
             consecutive months).

         11. A male subject must:

        Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a
        condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential
        while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 30 days
        following fedratinib discontinuation, or longer if required by local regulations, even if
        he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

        True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
        of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation
        methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).

        Agreement to use highly effective methods of contraception that alone or in combination
        resulting in a failure rate of a Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used
        consistently and correctly throughout the course of the study. Such methods include
        combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral),
        progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral),
        placement of an intrauterine device, placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system,
        bilateral tubal occlusion, and vasectomized partner.
