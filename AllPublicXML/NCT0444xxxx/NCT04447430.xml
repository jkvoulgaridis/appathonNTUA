      Depression during pregnancy is a common and high impact disease.Children who are exposed to
      maternal depression during pregnancy have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as
      low birth weight, and more often show cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems.Therefore,
      early detection and prompt treatment of depression during pregnancy can benefit both mother
      and child.However, the window of opportunity in pregnancy is small and from the perspective
      of the child postponement is in fact non-treatment. Psychotherapy might take a long time to
      be effective and do not work for all people. Further, the safety of pharmacological treatment
      for pregnant women with depression is still a big concern .Psychiatric medication use for
      depression in pregnancy may also pose a risk of fetal growth retardation and preterm
      delivery, as well as withdrawal symptoms in the new born. Therefore, investigating
      non-pharmacological approaches to treating depression during pregnancy is urgent and
      relevant, for both mother and child. Preliminary evidence shows that bright light therapy
      (BLT) is an effective treatment for pregnant women with depression based on several
      theoretical and clinical considerations, with effect size around 0.45 and without adverse
      effects to the new born. In this study we aim to investigate the effectiveness of BLT on
      pregnant women with major depression.
