    <textblock>
      Open-label, long-term safety study of ARQ-154 foam 0.3% in subjects with seborrheic
      dermatitis involving up to 20% total Body Surface Area (BSA). Study medication will be
      applied by the qualifying subjects topically once daily for 24 weeks. Cohort 1 subjects are
      rollover subjects from the ARQ-154-203 trial. Cohort 2 include treatment naive subjects.
      Periodic clinic visits will include assessments for clinical safety, application site
      reactions, and disease improvement or progression.
