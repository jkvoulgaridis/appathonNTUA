  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled exploratory phase II trial will test the hypothesis that oral
      dronabinol improves nightmares (primary outcome) and other PTSD symptoms (secondary outcomes)
      to a greater extent than placebo over a ten week intervention phase in a parallel group
      design.
