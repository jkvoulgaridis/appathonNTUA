      The Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ) was originally developed in English to
      assess physical activity level particularly people with mental illnesses. The purpose of this
      study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SIMPAQ into Turkish and investigate its
      psychometric properties.

      The Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ) was originally developed in English to
      assess physical activity level particularly people with mental illnesses. The purpose of this
      study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SIMPAQ into Turkish and investigate its
      psychometric properties. Eighty individuals with mental illnesses (major depression, bipolar
      disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol and substance addiction) will include. For
      cross-cultural adaptation and validation procedure, developers' manual in the official site
      will be followed (http://www.simpaq.org/). Within a 5-to-7-day period after the first
      assessment, the participants completed the Turkish version of the SIMPAQ to evaluate
      test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (α) was used to assess internal consistency. The
      correlations with the Turkish version of the International Physical Activity-Short Form
      (IPAQ-SF) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Turkish version of the DSM-5
      Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Scale-Adult Version (DSM XC) will determine to check
      the validity.

    <description>The SIMPAQ is a reliable and valid tool to assess physical activity in people with mental illness. The 5-item SIMPAQ was designed to capture activity over a representative 24-h period from the previous 7-days. Time spent in bed overnight, time sedentary, including napping, time spent walking, time spent exercising and time engaged in incidental activity are questioned and the sum of them should be approximately 24 h. This structure of the SIMPAQ provides interviewers to understand under or over-reporting. For an estimate of total self-reported moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time, time spent walking and exercising were combined to provide total MVPA (hours per week).</description>

    <description>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a valid 18-item quantitative scale for assessing psychopathology and its severity. Each item is measured on a five-point scale (0 = none to 4 = very severe), with lower scores meaning a lower severity of the symptom.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure-Adult (DSM XC) comprises 23 self-rated symptoms that capture 13 mental health domains. Respondents indicate how much (or how often) they have been bothered by each symptom in the prior two weeks using a five-point response scale (none, not at all to severe, nearly every day). A score of 2 or higher in most domains, except substance use (score of 1 or higher) is suggestive of clinically-relevant mental health problems.</description>
