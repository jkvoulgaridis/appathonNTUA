  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at risk for respiratory dysfunction in the
      perioperative environment. The study is designed to evaluate if point-of-care-ultrasound
      (POCUS) measurements of upper airway anatomy may identify patients with OSA and their
      severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent collapse of the pharyngeal airway
      during sleep, resulting in substantially reduced (hypopnea) or complete cessation (apnea) of
      airflow despite ongoing breathing efforts. OSA has long been recognized as a heterogeneous
      disorder with potentially multiple contributing pathophysiological causes but with
      significant impact to perioperative morbidity. Various OSA phenotypes exist but, the
      predominant feature is a narrow and collapsible upper airway anatomy and is an interplay
      between pharyngeal soft tissue, genioglossus muscle tone and the bony anatomy and accounts
      for upto two-thirds of the variation in the AHI. Identification of moderate-severe OSA is
      crucial to prevent potential life-threatening cardiopulmonary complications
      perioperatively.(1) However, a large proportion of patients with OSA remain undiagnosed at
      the time of surgery.(2) Current screening tools are mainly questionnaire based and are
      largely sensitive but not specific (3) resulting in many false positives, unnecessary
      increased resource utilization, cost burden, and legal implications. Gold standard laboratory
      polysomnography(PSG) study is expensive and not widely available. Point-of-care ultrasound
      (POCUS) is a readily available, portable, noninvasive tool that has been used for airway
      evaluation and may be useful for OSA screening.(4-8) We want to evaluate the various POCUS
      measures of OSA in the perioperative population and correlate these measurements with the PSG
      based severity of OSA (based on apnea-hypopnea index -AHI) to find out the best measure or a
      combination of measures to diagnose the incidence and severity of OSA.

    <description>The study is designed to assess if there is a correlation of one or a combination of point-of-care-ultrasound measurements with the severity of OSA as denoted by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from previous sleep study and/or STOP-Bang scores noted for the presence of OSA in screening exam prior to surgical procedures that require intubation.
STOP-Bang denotes Snoring, Tired, Observed (anyone observed you stop breathing), Pressure (high blood pressure), Body mass index (more than 35 kg/m2), Age (older than 50), Neck size, Gender</description>
