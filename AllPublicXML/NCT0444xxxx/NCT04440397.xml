  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The correlation between painful symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dysparonia, dysuria, chronic pelvic
      pain) symptoms and endoplasmic reticulum stress was investigated in 86 patients diagnosed
      with endometriosis. For this, xbp-1 (x box binding protein-1) level was measured in patients.
      XBP-1 is an endoplasmic reticulum stress indicator and is known to be involved in pain
      pathogenesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women between the ages of 18-50 who were diagnosed with endometriosis by surgery and
      ultrasound, without known rheumatological or metabolic diseases were included in the study.
      Most of the patients are composed of newly diagnosed patients.
