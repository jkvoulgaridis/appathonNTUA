      Sixty children were selected from the department of dermatology, Banha University Hospital.
      Patients were randomly assigned to (Group- A):- 20 children Patients, aged between 6-16 years
      old. be treated with Phototherapy, for 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks Plus the traditional
      medical treatment. which is the betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% &quot; diprolene for 2 times a
      day for 8 weeks. (Group B): 20 children Patients, in Group-B are treated with tap water
      iontophoresis, for 8 weeks, 3 sessions /week: the intensity were increased according to the
      patient's tolerance, for 20 minutes. Plus the traditional medical treatment. (Group -C) the
      control group will treated by only the traditional medical treatment which is the
      betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% &quot; diprolene&quot; cream, two times a day for 8 weeks Skin
      thickness by ultrasonography and Patient Oriented Eczema Measure(POEM) are measured before
      and after 8 weeks of treatment.
