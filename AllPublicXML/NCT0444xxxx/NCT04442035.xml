      The study is a prospective controlled trial. Sixty-four patients were divided randomly into
      two groups. Patients were randomly divided into the treatment group and the control group,
      namely, the music treatment group and the health education group. The treatment group was
      given at least 30 minutes of individual music therapy and group music therapy every 3 weeks.
      Instead, the control group was given every 3 weeks of health education preach. It will take
      12 weeks for treatment and observation. The efficacy was evaluated by observing the beginning
      and end of the trial of the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale score, the Self-Rating Depression Scale
      score, and the Breast Cancer Patients' Quality of Life Scale. At the end of the treatment, we
      take software packages SPSS 20.0 for management and statistical analysis.
