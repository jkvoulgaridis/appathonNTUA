  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the immunologic noninferiority of MenABCWY to licensed
      vaccines Trumenba and MenACWY-CRM (Menveo) by assessing the safety and immunogenicity of
      MenABCWY and the comparators in both ACWY-naïve and ACWY-experienced healthy participants ≥10
      to &lt;26 years of age.

             function, those receiving chronic systemic (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular)
             corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects in the
             United States with terminal complement deficiency are excluded from participation in
             this study.

          -  Significant neurological disorder or history of seizure (excluding simple febrile
             seizure).

          -  Current chronic use of systemic antibiotics.

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) or investigational
             vaccine(s) within 28 days prior to study entry and/or during study participation.

          -  Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including, but not limited to,
             transverse myelitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.
