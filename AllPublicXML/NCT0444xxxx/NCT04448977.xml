  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of MS Disease
      modifying medications on cognitive fatigue in persons with relapsing remitting multiple
      sclerosis (RRMS). Cognitive fatigue is the kind of fatigue that occurs after intense mental
      concentration as after a session of problem solving.

      The researchers aim is to investigate the effects of disease modifying treatments on
      cognitive fatigue and on specific brain areas that have been shown to underlie cognitive
      fatigue in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The researchers will investigate the
      effects on the cognitive fatigue that develops during the performance of a demanding task,
      and also on how cognitive fatigue changes as a function of duration of treatment.

    <description>Participants with MS will be divided into two treatment groups: those who will begin to take Ocrevus (the &quot;early Ocrevus&quot; group (EO), and those who plan to be begin treatment with Glatimer acetate SC (Copaxone) (EC). Both groups will be matched to the EO group for age, gender and education. The HC group will be free of neurological disease or injury and will be matched to the EO group for age, gender, and education.</description>
