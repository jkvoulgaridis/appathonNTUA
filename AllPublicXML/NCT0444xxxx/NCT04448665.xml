  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital infections comprise about half of all undesirable complications related to hospital
      treatment. In case of bacterial infection administration of antimicrobial agent is a therapy
      of choice. For maximum effectiveness, antimicrobial agents should be administered quickly in
      optimal doses. Moreover, the therapeutic concentration of properly selected drugs should be
      achieved as soon as possible. The relation between delays in the administration of
      antibiotics and increased mortality is well known. That is why proper empiric therapy is so
      important. Before antimicrobial investigation is completed, which may last up to 72 hours, a
      wide-spectrum antimicrobial should be administered according to the type of infection, its
      origin, and the characteristics of the local pathogens.

      The objective of this study is to compare the initial choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy
      and the results of both microbiological identification and susceptibility/resistance analysis
      of isolated pathogens.

      This project was designed as a prospective cohort study. Analysis was performed in a large
      multidisciplinary academic hospital and trauma center. All decisions on empiric therapy with
      antimicrobial used in infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, that are made in
      different hospital wards except intensive care, are required by hospital procedures to be
      confirmed by intensivists. In our analysis, the initial choice of empiric therapy in the
      hospital wards other than the critical care unit was compared with the results of
      microbiological investigations and susceptibility/resistance analyses of isolated pathogens.

      Accurate microbial identification was performed with a VITEK® 2 automatic testing system. The
      microbroth dilution method with VITEK® 2 AST cards was used for the antibiotic susceptibility
      testing of isolated pathogens.

      Microbiological analyses were performed between 2018 and 2020 according to the regulations of
      the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility (EUCAST, version 9.0, 2019) and the
      National Reference Centre for Susceptibility Testing (NRCST, Warsaw, Poland).
