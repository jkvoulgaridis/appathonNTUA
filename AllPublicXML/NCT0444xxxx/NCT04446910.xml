  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project will focus on conducting a trial of whether a tailored SMS
      text-messaging intervention is efficacious in improving justice-involved youths' substance
      use or dual diagnosis treatment attendance and engagement.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will demonstrate how delivery of text messages for appointment reminders and
      motivational/coaching message to justice-involved youth and their caregivers will lead to
      greater youth substance use treatment attendance and engagement. The study will start with
      identifying the feasibility and acceptability of the SMS text-messaging intervention with
      community-supervised justice-involved youth. Then, the study will determine whether the
      tailored dyadic (youth and caregiver) SMS text-messaging intervention improves
      justice-involved youth substance use or dual diagnosis treatment attendance and engagement
      relative to standard of care (not receiving text messaging appointment reminders and
      motivational/coaching messages). Finally, the study will characterize patterns of key justice
      and behavioral health system-level factors that promote or hinder eventual adoption and
      sustainability of mHealth technology as a tool to improve treatment attendance for
      justice-involved youth.

    <description>Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener (GAIN-SS) is used to identify people with recent and lifetime internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders, substance use disorders and crime/violence problems. GAIN-SS responses are given in terms of the recency of the problem described in the questions: 3 = past month; 2 = 2 to 12 months ago; 1 = 1+ years ago; 0 = never. The number of past-month symptoms (number of 3s) is used as a measure of change; the number of past-year symptoms (number of 3s or 2s) is used to identify who is likely to have a current diagnosis; and the number of lifetime symptoms (number of 3s, 2s, or 1s) is used as a covariate measure of lifetime severity.</description>
