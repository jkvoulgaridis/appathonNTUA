  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential molecule in human body. It acts as an antioxidant, a
      co-factor for energy conversion in mitochondria and has anti-inflammatory effects capable of
      improving endothelial function. Our goal is to investigate whether CoQ10 is capable to reduce
      the incidence of acute kidney injury/failure following cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery is
      major risk factor for acute kidney injury/failure (AKI/F).

    <measure>Difference in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery indicating kidney injury.</measure>

    <measure>Difference in urinary low molekular weight alpha 1 microglobulin as an indicator of kidney tubular injury.</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily urine output during the 72 hours postoperatively.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/h during 6 hours indicates increased risk of developing AKI.</description>

    <measure>Length of stay in intensive care unit</measure>

    <description>Length of stay in intensive care unit will be compared between an intervention and placebo arm of trial.</description>

    <measure>Advanced glycation endproducts</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Elevated advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) in skin, measured using skin autofluorescence, are reliable predictors of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Elevated levels before cardiac surgery should also predict increased risk of intraoperative morbidity, mortality and postoperative complications.</description>
