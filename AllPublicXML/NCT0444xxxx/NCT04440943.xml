  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study in
      patients with selected solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety, tolerability and activity of CDX-527.

      Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of several dose levels of CDX-527. The dose-escalation part of the study will determine
      the safety profile of CDX-527 and determine which dose(s) of CDX-527 will be studied in the
      expansion part of the study.

      The expansion part of the study will enroll eligible patients with certain solid tumors to be
      treated at dose(s) identified during dose-escalation

      Up to 96 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely
      monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side
      effects that may occur.
