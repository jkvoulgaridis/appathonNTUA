    <textblock>
      This study is evaluate the superior efficacy of a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)-based
      advisory system in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), as compared to Sensor Augmented Pump
      (SAP) therapy, and with characterizing the impact of psycho-behavioral factors on system
      performance, which will enable system individualization and lead to automated adaptation of
      advice delivery to optimize glycemic control and reduce the system's psychological impact.

    <textblock>
      Four cohorts of about 25 participants each (expected retention 20 per cohort). Each cohort
      will continue for ~7 months. Following recruitment, screening, and a run-in period of SAP,
      participants will be randomized into one of two groups: escalation vs. de-escalation of
      devices and function. Each treatment modality (SAP - Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy, PF -
      Personalized Feedback, DSS - Decision Support Systems) will continue for about 8 weeks, with
      the last 4 weeks used to assess glucose variability (GV) from CGM data.

          -  A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any
             carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication
