      This is a phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ. The phase I is a single-center study. The main objective is to evaluate
      the safety of IM19 CAR-T cell therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive
      invasion of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The phase Ⅱ is a multi-center study,The main goal is to
      evaluate the efficacy of IM19 CAR-T cells in the treatment of patients with relapsed or
      refractory CD19-positive invasion of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
