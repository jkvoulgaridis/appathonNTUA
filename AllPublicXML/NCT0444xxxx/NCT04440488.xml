      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ARALAST NP A1PI augmentation therapy
      120 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) body weight (BW)/week compared with an external placebo
      comparator on the loss of emphysematous lung tissue measured by lung density change in

    <measure>Annual Rate of the Physiologically Adjusted Lung Density Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Annual rate of the physiologically adjusted lung density change will be measured as the 15th percentile of the lung density measurements (PD15) as assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) densitometry at total lung capacity (TLC). CT lung density at the 15th percentile (PD15) is the threshold below which 15 percentage (%) of the voxels have lower densities and is used as the parameter for estimating the rate of lung density decline. Annual rate of the physiologically adjusted lung density change will be tested in a fixed comparision sequence 1. ARALAST NP 120 mg/kg BW/week group versus (vs) external placebo group, 2. ARALAST NP120 mg/kg BW/week vs 60 mg/kg BW/week, 3. ARALAST NP 60 mg/kg BW/week group vs external placebo group.</description>

    <measure>Number of Moderate or Severe Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>COPD exacerbations are defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy and will be assessed according to the classification in GOLD criteria (2020) as follows: Moderate (treated with short acting bronchodilators [SABDs] plus antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids) and Severe (required hospitalizations or a visit to the emergency room).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE's)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of the study drug administration up to End of the study (up to Week 105)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this IP or medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with an IP or medicinal product or any existing event that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the IP or medicinal product. TEAE's will include related, serious adverse events (SAEs), suspected adverse reactions plus adverse reactions of interest, temporally-associated adverse events (AEs) with onset during infusion or within 24 hours following the end of IP infusion, and AEs resulting in changes to infusion dose.</description>
