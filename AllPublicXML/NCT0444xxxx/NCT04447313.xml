  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares telephone delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to
      standard behavioral therapy for improving weight loss in overweight or obese participants.
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy focuses on increasing willingness to experience physical
      cravings, emotions, and thoughts while making values-guided committed behavior changes.
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may work better at improving weight loss compared to
      standard behavioral therapy.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive ACT telephone coaching over the course of 12 months, calls 1-16
      weekly, calls 17-23 biweekly, and calls 24-25 monthly. Call 1 is 30 minutes in duration,
      while calls 2-25 are each 15-20 minutes in duration.

      ARM II: Participants receive SBT telephone coaching over the course of 12 months, calls 1-16
      weekly, calls 17-23 biweekly, and calls 24-25 monthly. Call 1 is 30 minutes in duration,
      while calls 2-25 are each 15-20 minutes in duration.

      Participants are followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months after randomization.
