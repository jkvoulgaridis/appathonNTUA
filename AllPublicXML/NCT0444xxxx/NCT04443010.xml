  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety profile and establish a recommended dose
      (RD) for phase II of the antibody-cytokine fusion protein L19TNF plus standard TMZ
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      The study will be conducted in three consecutive parts: a dose finding part to determine the
      RD of L19TNF in combination with chemoradiotherapy, followed by a signal seeking part that
      investigates first signs of activity and then an activity evaluation part that studies the
      efficacy of L19TNF in combination with chemoradiotherapy against chemoradiotherapy alone.
