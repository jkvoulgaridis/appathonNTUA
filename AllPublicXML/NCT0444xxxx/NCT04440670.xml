  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first and largest randomized, controlled, blinded trial that evaluates the
      efficacy of autologous cord blood mononuclear cells infusion as a prevention therapy for BPD.
      The results of this trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for recommendations on the
      management of BPD in extremely preterm infants. In this prospective, randomized controlled
      double-blind multi-center clinical trial, 200 preterm neonates less than 28 weeks are
      randomly assigned to receive intravenous autologous cord blood mononuclear cells infusion
      (5×107cells/kg) or placebo ( normal saline) within 24 hours after birth in a 1:1 ratio using
      a central randomization system. The primary outcome is survival without bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home. The secondary outcomes will
      include mortality rate, other common preterm complication rate, respiratory support duration,
      the length and cost of hospitalization and long term outcomes after two years follow up post
      infusion.

      Study design and settings:

      This present study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center
      trial to be conducted at 14 medical centers in tertiary hospitals with Neonatal Intensive
      Care Unit that were selected by the expert committee. A total of 200 neonates fulfilling the
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Subsequently, the participants will be randomly
      divided into two groups (ACBMNC infusion group and control (placebo) group ) in a ratio of
      1:1.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective： The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of ACBMNC
      infusion in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or
      discharge home in extremely preterm infants.

      Secondary objectives：

        -  To compare the mortality rate at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age.

        -  To compare the rate of other common preterm complications included intraventricular
           hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP),
           respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxic
           ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), late onset sepsis (LOS) and anemia.To compare the
           duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy in two groups

        -  To determine re-intubation rate and time return to BW

        -  To compare the duration of antibiotic usage

        -  To determine the long term outcomes after two years follow up

      Participants:

      Inclusion criteria:

      Infants fulfilling all the following inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this trial: 1.
      born at study hospital; 2. singleton birth; 3. less than 28 weeks GA 4.Signed informed
      consent obtained; 5. had available umbilical cord blood (UCB).

      Exclusion criteria:

      Those infants are excluded if they were 1. with severe congenital abnormalities; 2.with
      maternal clinical chorioamnionitis 3. the mother was positive for hepatitis B (HBsAg and/or
      HBeAg) or C virus (anti-HCV), syphilis, HIV (anti-HIV-1 and -2) or IgM against
      cytomegalovirus, rubella, toxoplasma and herpes simplex virus.

      Trial treatment methods:

      Eligible Inborn Infants were observed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Guangdong
      Women and Children Hospital until discharge home. All patients in the study were given
      intensive care therapy in accordance with departmental guidelines which included therapies
      including positive pressure mechanical ventilatio，non-invasive respiratory support, oxygen
      therapy, and exogenous surfactant (Curosurf,. Chiesi, Parma, Italy) replacement. Chest
      radiographs were performed at admission and 8 hours after CBT on the first day of life in all
      surviving patients. Blood gas was monitored every 24 hours until weaning from ventilation.
      All clinical diagnoses was defined according to a standard reference17. Soon after the
      preterm infant was deliveried, written consent was signed by the parents, and autologous cord
      blood infusion was applied to the baby in addition to routine pulmonary surfactant
      replacement, and mechanical ventilation support as indicated. Those assigned to the ACBMNC
      group received an infusion of ACBMNC with 24 h after birth. Those in control group received
      an infusion of a placebo solution which is normal saline with the same volume. Cell dose for
      all patients was targeted at 5×107 cells per kilogram.
