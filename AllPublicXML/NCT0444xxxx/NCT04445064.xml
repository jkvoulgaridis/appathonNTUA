      The purpose of this project is to realize a randomized open-label study (EudraCT number:
      2020-000120-19) to evaluate the safety and the anti-tumor activity of peptide(s)-based
      immunotherapy in an umbrella window pre-operative opportunity phase II study in patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      This proof of concept study will start with one control arm and one vaccine arm. The target
      of the first studied vaccine &quot; IO102 &quot; is the enzyme Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The
      vaccine is a amino acid peptide from indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase. We are planning to add
      several other arms when other vaccines become clinically available.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the T-cell peptide-specific response to the vaccine in a interferon(INF)-γ
           ELISpot assay.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the vaccine.

        -  To investigate the decreased action of the IDO enzyme in evaluating the increased
           tumoral infiltration by CD8+ T-lymphocytes and by measuring the serum levels of
           kynurenin, tryptophan,...

        -  To evaluate the anti-tumor effect (objective response rate, overall survival, disease
           free- survival, disease specific survival).

        -  To evaluate the pre-operative activity of peptide vaccine using MRI (Magnetic Resonance
           Imaging), DWI-MRI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI) and MRS (Magnetic Resonance
           Spectroscopy) to visualize possible significant tumor modifications.
