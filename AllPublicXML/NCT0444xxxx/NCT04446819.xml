  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel has greater efficacy and favorable safety profile than
      standard paclitaxel. However, rate of neuropathy caused by nanoparticle albumin-bound
      paclitaxel is higher than standard paclitaxel, and is one of its dose-limited toxicities.
      Previously, compression therapy by surgical gloves has shown effectiveness in preventing
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. We designed this multi-center prospective self-control phase
      III study to investigate the efficacy of compression gloves to reduce albumin-binding
      paclitaxel induced sensory and motor neurotoxicity of upper extremities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are diagnosed with pathologically confirmed solid tumors.

             cycles anticipated) by physicians' choice.

          -  Patients should have baseline Grade 0 peripheral sensory and motor neurotoxicity
             (NCI-CTCAE 5.0).
