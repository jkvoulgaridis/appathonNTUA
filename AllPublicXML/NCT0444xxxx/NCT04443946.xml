      This prospective open-label randomized study, patients were having elective urological
      surgery scheduled to last longer than 1 h under necessitating general anesthesia.Group-P:
      (Propofol group): 3 mg kg-1 min-1 propofol was pumped continuously after endotracheal
      intubation. Group-PAS: (Propofol and after 20 min adding Sevoflurane group): 3 mg kg-1 min-1
      propofol were pumped continuously and add 1% end-tidal sevoflurane 20 minutes after
      endotracheal intubation. Group-PS: (Propofol and Sevoflurane group): 3 mg kg-1 min-1 propofol
      were continuously pumped after endotracheal intubation, and 1% sevoflurane was inhaled
      continuously at the same time. Group-S: (Sevoflurane group): 1% sevoflurane continued to
      maintain anesthesia after endotracheal intubation. Group-PSu: (Propofol and Sufentanil
      group): 3 mg kg-1 min-1 propofol, 0.01 μ g kg-1 min-1 sufentanil were pumped continuously at
      maintain phase

      group): 3 mg kg-1 min-1 propofol, 0.01 μ g kg-1 min-1 sufentanil were pumped continuously at
      maintain phase. Due to the ethical requirements of adequent analgesia, 0.3 μ g kg-1 min-1
      remifentanil was continuously pumped as background input dose during anesthesia maintenance
      in all groups.
