  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with lewy bodies (DLB) are dementia syndromes
      that overlap in many clinical features, making their diagnosis difficult in clinical
      practice, particularly in advanced stages. We propose a machine learning algorithm, based
      only on non-invasively and easily in-the-clinic collectable predictors, to identify these
      disorders with a high prognostic performance.

      The algorithm will be develop using dataset from two specialized memory centers, employing a
      sample of PDD and DLB subjects whose diagnostic follow-up is available for at least 3 years
      after the baseline assessment. A restricted set of information regarding clinico- demographic
      characteristics, 6 neuropsychological tests (mini mental, PD Cognitive Rating Scale, Brief
      Visuospatial Memory test, Symbol digit written, Wechsler adult intelligence scale, trail
      making A and B) was used as predictors. Two classification algorithms, logistic regression
      and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NNs), will be investigated for their ability to predict
      successfully whether patients suffered from PDD or DLB.

        the PDD group comprised of patients fulfilling the Criteria for probable PDD and the DLB
        group.Patients will be enrolled from the register-based database of two clinics. The
        following data were collected: gender, age, education, hand dominance, Disease duration
        (years) and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD). The burden of disease will be assess by
        the Movement Disorders Society-United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III
        in the Off medication state and the following six cognitive/behavioral tests: Mini-Mental
        State Examination (MMSE), PD- Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS), Brief Visuospatial Memory
        test (BVMT-TR), Symbol digit written (SDMT), Trail making test (TMT A,B), Wechsler
        adultintelligence scale (WAIS-V). All patients will undergo brain MRI and blood test to
        exclude secondarycauses of dementia.
