  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of vortioxetine versus desvenlafaxine
      after 8 weeks of treatment in patients that have tried one available treatment without
      getting the full benefit
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 14 days before the Baseline Visit,
      followed by an 8-week Treatment Period with vortioxetine or desvenlafaxine. A Safety
      Follow-up Visit will be performed approximately 4 weeks after the Primary Outcome/Withdrawal
      Visit.

      At Baseline, patients will be equally randomised (1:1) to 1 of the 2 treatment groups for an
      8-week, double-blind Treatment Period.

    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>DSST assesses psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the patient to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-s period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (&lt; normal functioning) to 133 (&gt; normal functioning).</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The EEfRT is a computerized task which measures reward motivation in which participants are presented with a series of repeated trials during which they choose between performing a ''hard-task'' or an ''easy-task'' in order to earn varying amounts of monetary rewards.</description>

The scores indicated the following: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The score ranged from 1-7, where 1 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The FAST is a valid and reliable instrument, easy to apply which requires a short period of time to administer. Evaluates functioning taking into account the last 15 days. It was developed for the clinical evaluation of the main difficulties presented by psychiatric patients, and has been validated in several languages for patients with bipolar disorder. The FAST scale consists of 24 items which allow the assessment of six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in FAST sub-domain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The FAST is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess difficulty in functioning. The FAST consists of 24 items in 6 specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships, leisure time. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 72 with higher scores reflecting more serious difficulties.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a primary diagnosis of single or recurrent MDD, diagnosed according to

          -  The patient has a MADRS total score ≥24 at screening and baseline.

          -  The patient has had the current MDE for ≥3 months and &lt; 12 months.

          -  The patient has been treated with an SSRI as monotherapy (citalopram, escitalopram,
             paroxetine, sertraline) for at least 6 weeks at licensed dose for the current MDE with
             a partial response and is a candidate for a switch in the investigator's opinion.

          -  The patient wants to switch antidepressant treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any other disorder for which the treatment takes priority over
