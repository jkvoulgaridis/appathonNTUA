  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single injection of
      autologous adipose-derived SVF produced using the GID SVF-2 device system for treatment of
      pain with concomitant improvement in function associated with osteoarthritis of the knee
      joint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel groups, double blind,
      multi-center, interventional study of subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. Subjects will
      be randomized to receive an injection of LR (placebo) or SVF derived from their own adipose
      tissue (experimental).

    <description>The WOMAC is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 14 items divided into 3 subscales, pain, stiffness and function. The primary efficacy will be achieved if the SVF dose group is shown to have a clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function at 6 months post-treatment, using the percent change in WOMAC score from baseline as the primary variable. The overall WOMAC score is normalized to a range of 0 to 100 points with a lower score indicating less symptoms of osteoarthritis.</description>
