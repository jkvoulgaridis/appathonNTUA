    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib, open label, multi-center study of to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of JMT101 combined with EGFR-TKIs (Afatinib or Osimertinib) in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion
      mutations.

    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JMT101 combined with
      EGFR-TKIs (afatinib or osimertinib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
      with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.

      This study consists of two parts (Stage I and Stage II). Stage I was a dose escalation study,
      and Stage II was a dose expansion study.
