  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) is a bypass method performed on the working
      heart. Pain is a frequently seen side effect experienced following this surgery. Erector
      spinae plane block is our analgesia method that the investigators routinely perform prior to
      the surgery to overcome this problem. In this method, analgesic medication is given via a
      needle in between the two superficial muscle groups (erector spinae muscles) located in
      participants back. The investigators believe this method not only provides pain relief, but
      also is beneficial (dilating) on the vessels that will be used for bypassing the clogged
      vessels during the surgery. The investigators aimed to measure some parameters in this
      routine procedure before and after performing the analgesic method with an ultrasound
      (imaging with sound waves).

    <intervention_model_description>The study is planned as prospective. Aged between 18-65, ASA III risk group and are undergoing off pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery are selected for the study. Who are allergic to planned-medications, chronic opioid or opioid receptor agonist users, those with preoperative neuropathies, psychiatric diseases will be excluded. Electrocardiography and pulse oximetry monitorization is performed in the recovery room where a peripheric intravenous line is opened afterwards. High frequency (12-24 MHz) linear probe is used for measurements. Images will be recorded by USG from the 3., 4. and 5. intercostal spaces for the LIMA and RIMA and 3cm proximal to the wrist for the right and left radial arteries. After images are saved, the researcher will perform ESP block with USG. ESP block will be performed to right and left sides equally with 40ml %0.25 bupivacaine in total. Artery images will be recorded again by the same researcher after 45 minutes.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Effect of erector spinae plane (ESP) block on the change in diameters of mammarian arteries and radial arteries</measure>

    <description>Linear probe is used for measurements. Images will be recorded by ultrasound from the third, fourth and fifth intercostal spaces for the LIMA and RIMA and 3cm proximal to the wrist for the right and left radial arteries. After images are saved, the researcher will perform ESP block with USG. Linear/convex probe is used to place the needle parasagittally 3 cm lateral to T5 spinous processes. ESP block will be performed to right and left sides equally with 40ml %0.25 bupivacaine in total, to the fascial plane between the transverse process and erector spinae muscle. Artery images will be recorded again by the same researcher after 45 minutes.For the recordings, one researcher will record the images as explained in the protocol and two researchers will measure the records separately. The results measured in millimeters by two researchers will be compared statistically and if there is no significant difference, the average value of the records will be used for statistical analysis.</description>

    <description>One researcher will record the artery images as explained in the protocol and two researchers will measure the radius and area of those vessels separately. Researchers who are measuring the radius and area of vessels won't know whether those images belong to pre or post- ESP block. The results two researchers measure will be compared statistically and if there are no statistically significant differences, the mean value of their separate recordings will be taken into account for the statistical analysis.</description>
