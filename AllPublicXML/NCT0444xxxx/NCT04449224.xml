  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of a multicenter prospective observational study is to compare effectiveness
      and safety of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and small molecular inhibitors
      in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis patients who have had an
      inadequate response or intolerace to methotrexate.

      This study is a multicenter prospective observational study to show non-inferiority of
      clinical efficacy for small molecular inhibitors after 48 week of treatment to biologic
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in patients having moderately to severely
      active RA and who have been intolerant to conventional synthetic disease modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) including methotrexate.

      Primary end point is a percentage of participants of achieving low disease activity according
      to Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-Erythrocyte Sedientation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at weeks 24.
      A total of 506 RA patients will be included, and allocated in ratio of 1:1 to bDMARD group
      and small molecule inhibitor group. Group allocation is determined by shared-decision making,
      so that the number of participants could be re-assessed according to recruitment status of
      participatns.

    <measure>Changes in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported assessment of physical function that includes 20 items in eight categories representing a comprehensive set of functional activities, including dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. Patients are asked about their ability to complete these tasks in the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst), with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability.</description>

    <measure>Changes in EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of two parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Patients are asked about their ability to complete specific tasks today using the following dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems (1), slight problems (2), moderate problems (3), severe problems (4) and extreme problems (5). EQ-5D-5L health states can be summarised using the 5-digit code, after that, it is represented by a single summary number (index scores). Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of two parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the patient rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>

    <description>The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria classify patients as good, moderate, or nonresponders, using the individual amount of change in DAS28 and the level of DAS reached (low, moderate, or high); good responders were patients with an improvement of &gt;1.2 and a present score of ≤3.2; moderate responders were patients with an improvement of &gt;0.6 to ≤1.2 and a present score of ≤5.1, or an improvement of &gt;1.2 and a present score of &gt;3.2; non-responders were any patients with an improvement of ≤0.6, or patients with an improvement of &gt;0.6 to 1.2 and a present score of &gt;5.1</description>

    <description>We would like to discover serum biomarkers predicting 24-week treatment response in each targeted therapy for RA patients. Serum samples will be collected before target therapies (at 0 week) and grouped according to the treatment response after 24 weeks. The putative biomarkers predicting treatment response will be screened using proteomics method and validated via ELISA.</description>

    <measure>Compliance with targeted therapy defined by Patient-reported adherence and Modified Morisky scale (if possible)</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 48</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-item questionnaire measures two domains of adherence; knowledge and motivation. Patients are categorized as having 'high' or 'low' knowledge and motivation based on their yes or no response to each of the six questions of the Modified Morisky Scale. Each 'no' response to each question results in +1 (except question 5, in which a 'yes' response would result in +1) and 'yes' responses to each question result in +0 (except question 5, where a 'no' response would result in +0). Scores for the 6-item of Modified Morisky Scale can range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating better adherence.</description>
