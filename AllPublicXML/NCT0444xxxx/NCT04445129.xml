  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether portable devices can provide measurements
      at home similar to those taken in the clinic, in particular in participant with NT1, and to
      investigate night-to-night changes in sleep patterns using these devices at home. This study
      may enable future at-home studies and ultimately lead to a decreased burden on the people who
      need these measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-drug study including participants with NT1 and healthy participants using
      devices designed for at-home assessments. The study will assess whether a portable EEG device
      provides an EEG signal comparable to gold-standard inpatient nPSG. The frequency and
      characteristics of wake and sleep patterns and transitions over multiple nights will also be
      characterized. Participants with NT1 who will complete the study TAK-994-1501 (NCT04096560)
      will be eligible to enter the current study following the appropriate washout period (60
      days).

      The study will enroll approximately 36 participants (18 participants with NT1 and 18 healthy
      participants). Participants will be enrolled in the 2 groups:

        -  NT1 Participants

        -  Healthy Participants

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 8 days. The follow-up visit will occur on Day 10
      and during this debrief, participants will answer a questionnaire on user experience (device
      comfort) for the wearable devices.

    <measure>Sleep State Scoring From nPSG and Portable EEG Device</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 Nights</time_frame>
    <description>The concordance between EEG signals obtained from the portable EEG device with gold-standard nPSG over 2 inpatient night stays will be assessed using data obtained during the inpatient setting from nPSG and a portable EEG device. Scoring of sleep stages occur in 30-seconds epoch based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring rules. The output from the nPSG and the portable EEG device will be hand scored for each participant, with the rater assigning 1 of 6 sleep/wake stages to each 30 second epoch 3 stages of non-REM (NREM) sleep (N1, N2, N3), rapid eye movement (REM), wakefulness (W), and uncategorized. The nPSG is a standardized procedure used to assess various sleep parameters, including sleep latency and sleep architecture. nPSG will be used to as the gold-standard comparator to the portable EEG device.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stage Shift Index (SSI) as Measured by Standard nPSG and EEG Device on Night 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 2</time_frame>
    <description>SSI will be measured by standard nPSG and portable EEG device on Night 2 in the clinic as determined by a certified sleep specialist. SSI will be calculated as the number of transitions between any wake or sleep stage divided by hours of total sleep time. The summary of the frequency of different stages of sleep transitions can be represented by SSI, which can be used to differentiate healthy participant from those with sleep pathology. The correlation between the SSI as measured by the portable EEG device and by the nPSG will be analyzed for participants with NT1 and healthy controls. The nPSG is a standardized procedure used to assess various sleep parameters, including sleep latency and sleep architecture. nPSG will be used as the gold-standard comparator to the portable EEG device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SSI as Measured by Standard nPSG and EEG Device During the Period at Home</measure>
    <time_frame>Nights 3-7</time_frame>
    <description>SSI will be measured by portable EEG device on nights 3-7 at home as determined by a certified sleep specialist. SSI will be calculated as the number of transitions between any wake or sleep stage divided by hours of total sleep time. The summary of the frequency of different stages of sleep transitions can be represented by SSI, which can be used to differentiate healthy participant from those with sleep pathology. The SSI will be analyzed using the intrasubject correlation (intraclass correlation across different nights) in participants with NT1 and healthy participants. The nPSG is a standardized procedure used to assess various sleep parameters, including sleep latency and sleep architecture.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Microsleeps and State Transitions During the Maintenance of Wakefulness Tests (MWTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Micro sleeps are defined as the appearance of any stage of sleep arising out of wakefulness lasting from 3 seconds to less than (&lt;) 15 seconds. Micro sleeps will be assessed on the signals obtained from the portable EEG device. State transition refers to the switch between wake and sleep. MWT is a validated, objective measure used to measure excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) in clinical studies. MWT evaluates a person's ability to remain awake under soporific conditions for a defined period. Wakefulness will be measured indirectly by time to fall asleep using MWT. Four 40-minute (1 session) MWT assessments will be administered. Sleep onset is defined as the first epoch of greater than 15 seconds of cumulative sleep in a 30-second epoch. Trials are ended after 40 minutes if no sleep occurs/after unequivocal sleep, defined as 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 sleep or 1 epoch of any other stage of sleep. If no sleep has been observed, then the latency is defined as 40 minutes.</description>

             portions of the study.

          3. Cannot maintain stable sleep environment at home, for example, due to young children

          6. Has medical condition, such as past or current epilepsy, seizure, head injury/trauma,
             medically significant unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, or
             gastrointestinal disease, that interferes with a normal sleep pattern or would
             preclude enrollment in the view of the investigator.

          7. Has a lifetime history of major psychiatric disorder, such as bipolar disorder or
             schizophrenia.

          8. As of the screening visit and throughout the study, the participant should not be a

          9. Has a medical disorder (other than narcolepsy), associated with excessive daytime
             sleepiness. This includes clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea or restless
             legs syndrome that has a significant impact on daytime sleepiness, confirmed by past
             PSG data (example, apnea hypopnea index &gt;10, periodic limb movement disorder index in
             sleep &gt;15) or a periodic limb movement disorder arousal index of &gt;10, or as evaluated
             on interview at the screening visit. Because nPSG data is obtained on Night 1,
             participants may be removed from study if symptoms are observed. Participants removed
             under this criterion will be replaced.
