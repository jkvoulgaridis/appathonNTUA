  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who underwent cardiac surgery may experience anesthesia, intracardiac operation,
      cardiopulmonary bypass and mechanical ventilation, which will result in a lot of injuries.
      Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) is a regimen of breathing exercises that aim to strengthen
      the respiratory muscles and make it easier for a person to breathe. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative IMT on e clinical outcomes in patients with cardiac
      surgery.
