  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) are commonly prescribed in an uncritical manner to patients with
      liver cirrhosis without a clear evidence-based indication. Observational studies suggests
      that PPI use in cirrhotic patients may be a risk factor for the development of infections,
      especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A possible explanation are PPI-associated
      microbiotic shifts leading to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth with subsequently
      increased bacterial translocation. Furthermore, PPI therapy in cirrhotic patients may lead to
      an increased risk for pneumonia and Clostridium difficile-infections.

      However, the evidence is ambiguous, as other published studies found no evidence for an
      association of PPI use with an increased risk for SBP or pneumonia.

      Moreover, an association between episodes of hepatic encephalopathy and PPI use has been
      reported.

      Infections and hepatic encephalopathy may often lead to a hospitalization of cirrhotic
      patients and PPI use at discharge has also been associated to early re-hospitalization.

      While some studies found an association of PPI and increased mortality in cirrhotic patients,
      other studies could not observe this association.

      Thus, some of the current evidence suggests an unfavourable risk profile of PPIs in patients
      with liver cirrhosis. However, this patient population is considered to be at a high risk of
      gastrointestinal haemorrhage from peptic ulcers. Importantly, patients with liver cirrhosis
      have an increased mortality after peptic ulcer bleeding as compared to patients without
      cirrhosis. Therefore, generous PPI use may also have a yet unproven preventive effect against
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

      The STOPPIT trial is the first prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial
      investigating the effect of discontinuation of long-term PPI therapy on hospitalized patients
      with complicated liver cirrhosis with a pre-existing long-term PPI therapy. Importantly,
      patients with an evidence-based indication for PPI therapy are excluded from the trial. All
      study participants (n=476) stop their previous PPI treatment and are then randomized (1:1) to
      receive either placebo (intervention group) or esomeprazole 20mg/day (control group) for 360
      days.

      The primary hypothesis anticipates a delay of re-hospitalisation and/or death (composite
      endpoint) in patients who discontinue PPI treatment as compared to patients who continue PPI
      therapy. Secondary objectives include the assessment of mortality, re-hospitalisation rates,
      infection rates, rate of acute hepatic decompensation and ACLF, as well as rates of upper and
      lower gastrointestinal bleeding events in both groups. Impact of prolonged or discontinued
      PPI therapy on the intestinal microbiota and pharmacoeconomics will be studied as a secondary
      assessment.
