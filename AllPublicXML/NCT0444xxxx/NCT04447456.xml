  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with early-stage squamous cell carcinomas of the vocal cord can be treated in an
      equivalent way in terms of carcinology by surgery or radiotherapy. The study will be to
      analyse the vocal outcome at 5 years of these two types of management in order to define
      whether one is superior to the other on this criterion of voice quality after treatment.

    <measure>Voice Handicap Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VHI is a self-administered questionnaire that provides a score ranging from 0 to 120 points validated in France and internationally based on the declarative answers to 30 items of the questionnaire. A high score corresponds to a voice felt to be of poor quality. This is a subjective assessment made by the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain, Instability SCORE (GRBASI Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This score is obtained from an internationally and nationally validated hetero-assessment. It consists in the attribution by a listening jury made up of two people of a mark ranging from 0 to 3 for each of the 6 items: Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain, Instability.
A high score is associated with a voice perceived as bad by the audience.</description>
