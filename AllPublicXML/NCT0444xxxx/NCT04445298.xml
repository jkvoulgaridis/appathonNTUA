  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective birth cohort study assessing the role of maternal and environmental
      factors on the development of allergic diseases in children. Pregnant mothers will be
      enrolled and we will examine her skin barrier with skin tape strips (STS) and transepidermal
      water loss (TEWL), along with blood work. We will then follow her offspring and perform
      similar testing, along with detailed questionnaires inquiring about exposures such as use of
      detergents and soaps, sunlight exposure, and pollution exposure. When the infant is around 12
      months old, we will contact the family via telephone to see if the child developed any
      allergic conditions within their first year of life, such as eczema, food allergy, or
      wheezing. A final questionnaire will be performed.

    <measure>Skin barrier assessment with transepidermal water loss (TEWL) will be done in every infant.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL will be performed in all infants to compare skin barrier assessments between infants born in the fall and winter with those born in the spring and summer. We hypothesize greater skin barrier dysfunction in those born in the fall and winter.</description>

    <measure>Skin barrier assessment with skin swabs for staphylococcus aureus colonization will be done in every infant.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Skin swabs for staphylococcus aureus colonization will be performed in all infants to compare skin barrier assessments between infants born in the fall and winter with those born in the spring and summer. We hypothesize greater staphylococcus aureus colonization in those born in the fall and winter.</description>

    <measure>Skin barrier assessment with TEWL will be performed in every pregnant female and compared to her infant offspring, as well as between other pregnant females giving birth in other seasons.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the mother's skin barrier with the infant skin barrier to see if there is an association with the mother's skin barrier during pregnancy. We will perform TEWL to assess the degree of water loss before, during, and after skin tape stripping.</description>

    <measure>Skin barrier assessment with STS will be performed in every pregnant female and compared to her infant offspring, as well as between other pregnant females giving birth in other seasons.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the mother's skin barrier with the infant skin barrier to see if there is an association with the mother's skin barrier during pregnancy. We will perform STS to determine the skin breakdown products.</description>

    <measure>Skin barrier assessment with filaggrin gene mutation status will be determined in everyone enrolled, and we will look for the filaggrin gene mutation in both the mother and infant.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The filaggrin gene is important for skin health, and we will assess for common filaggrin gene mutations in everyone enrolled in this study via a blood draw in the mother's and cord blood in the infants.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vitamin D levels will be obtained and compared between individuals enrolled in this study.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Vitamin D levels will be obtained by blood draw in the pregnant mother's and cord blood in the infants. We will compare the values according to season of birth, as we hypothesize that the infants born in the fall and winter, along with their mothers, will have a lower vitamin D level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaires regarding exposures will be compared with the skin barrier measurements to understand exposures that lead to increased skin barrier dysfunction.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires will be administered to capture exposures during pregnancy, such as detergents, soaps, medications, and sunlight exposure. The answers will be compared with the results of the skin barrier assessment in both pregnant women and their infants to understand which exposures lead to skin barrier dysfunction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaires and a follow up telephone call will allow us to see if infants born in the fall and winter have a higher incidence of allergy development.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires and follow up telephone calls when the infant is 12 months old will determine which infants develop allergic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and wheezing. We will compare the infants born in the fall and winter with those born in the spring and summer to see whether the infants born in the fall and winter have increased risk of developing allergy.</description>
