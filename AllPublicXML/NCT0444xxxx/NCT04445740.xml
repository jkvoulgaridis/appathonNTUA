  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the
      intervention. This will ensure that all aspects of the research protocol and procedures work
      as desired and are acceptable to families in preparation for the fully powered cluster
      randomized controlled trial. The proposed study will assess our ability to: 1)recruit,
      consent, and retain participants, 2) deliver the intervention, 3) implement study and
      assessment procedures 4) assess reliability of the proposed measures in this sample, 5)
      determine whether modifications to the intervention, procedures, and measures are needed
      prior to conducting a fully powered study, and 6) willingness of participants to participate
      in the intervention.

  <detailed_description>

      We will employ a 2 group randomized control design (treatment and no-treatment control) with
      randomization occurring after baseline (time 0) and 3 additional evaluation periods (end of
      intervention (time 1), and 9 months (time 2) and 12 months post intervention (time 3)).
      Because the the i♥rhythm project is intended to prevent children from beginning a trajectory
      toward overweight/obesity in elementary school, we will explore the impact of the
      intervention on change in standardized BMI (BMIz) during the following summer (time 2 and 3),
      identifying whether a maintenance intervention is needed. Following the intervention and
      final data assessment (time 1 and 3), qualitative interviews will explore the acceptability
      of the intervention, treatment barriers and facilitators, difficulties with study procedures,
      maintenance of improvements, and self-efficacy to maintain improvements. A third treatment
      condition controlling for the effect of attention was beyond the scope of the current
      feasibility study. We will employ a 2 group randomized control design (treatment and
      no-treatment control) with randomization occurring after baseline (time 0) and 3 additional

    <measure>Feasibility Criteria: ability to recruit the needed sample size</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of the intervention will be established by our ability to recruit the needed sample size; favorable acceptability ratings by 80% of the sample, participation in greater than 80% of daily diaries, views of intervention materials by 80% of participants, and retention of at least 80% of participants. Decisions regarding changes to the intervention will be made based on attainment of feasibility criteria and post assessment interviews.

    <measure>Treatment Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Acceptability Report Form-Revised(TARF-R) 185 is a 20-item global measure of treatment acceptability for behavioral interventions. The TARF-R has demonstrated good internal consistency (αs&gt;.69) and evidence of construct validity. A favorable rating is considered 4 of greater.</description>

    <measure>Anthropometrics</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most common indicator of body size and has been consistently correlated with metabolic problems in children. Participants' height and weight will be measured using established protocols. BMI (kg/m2) will be computed and BMI %ile and BMIz will be calculated from age and gender normative data. BMI %ile will determine weight status group. Change in BMI and BMIz are the best proxy measures for change in fat mass and standardized fat mass and will assess exploratory hypotheses. Change in BMI will serve as the primary outcome for the fully powered randomized controlled trial. For the current application, feasibility criteria will serve as the primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of endogenous circadian rhythms</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Circadian phase can be examined by measuring the circadian timing of melatonin onset under dim light conditions (dim light melatonin onset; DLMO). Compared to markers of endogenous circadian rhythms, melatonin is relatively robust. Salivary DLMO measures have demonstrated high intraclass correlations (.93) with plasma and sensitivity and specificity comparable to plasma assays. Following established procedures with children, salivary DLMO will be collected on a weekday evening in the laboratory under dim light conditions (&lt;40 lux), via a cheek swab every hour beginning 5 hours prior to and ending 1 hour following typical bedtime. Saliva samples will be centrifuged, frozen, and assayed using radioimmunoassay test kits. DLMO phase will be determined using linear interpolation across the time points before and after melatonin concentration increased to and remained above 4pg/mL.</description>

    <measure>Actigraphy for the measurement of sleep, sleep/wake patterns, physical activity, and light exposure.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphs (GT3X-BT, Pensacola, FL) worn on the wrist of the dominant hand 24 hours a day for 7 days will measure sleep duration and timing of sleep onset and waking. Wrist placement reliably measures sleep duration in adolescents. Sleep diaries will be completed. Monitor-wear logs will identify times the accelerometer is removed and the activity engaged in while the monitor is off. Non-parametric algorithms quantify inter-daily similarity and variability and the relative amplitude or consolidation of activity/sleep during the day and night-time. The photocell contained in the Actigraph GT3X-BT will be used to measure ambient light exposure. Accelerometers have been extensively used to assess children's physical activity (PA). Five days of monitoring had 0.8 reliability of accurately capturing the habitual PA of children. Activity counts captured in 5 second epochs will be categorized into sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous PA using established cut points.</description>

    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Since BMI can misrepresent adiposity among muscular and slender children, use of additional body fat indicators has been recommended. We will assess percent body fat using Bod Pod.</description>

    <measure>Dietary Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24)174 will be used to assess children's dietary intake (e.g., total daily caloric intake, timing of intake, timing of the last eating episode of the day). As recommended, parents will complete the adult version of the ASA-24, providing proxy report of their child's dietary intake. We will use 3 days of diet assessment as 3 days optimize the prediction of doubly labeled water estimated energy expenditure.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Structure</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Comprehensive General Parenting Questionnaire (CGPQ) is a parent report of parenting practices among parents of 5-13 year olds. We will assess subscales related to parenting structure (inconsistent discipline, consistency, organization, and scaffolding). There is support for the construct validity of the CGPQ. Parenting structure subscales have demonstrated acceptable to good internal reliability (ranging from .67-.74).</description>

    <measure>Bedtime Routines</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 12 months and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Bedtimes Routines Questionnaire (BRQ), is a 31-item parent report measure of children's bedtime routines, comprised of three scales measuring consistency of bedtime routines (weekday &amp; weekend), reactivity to changes in bedtime routines, and frequency of adaptive and maladaptive activities. The BRQ scales had good internal consistency ranging from α = 0.69 to 0.90.</description>
