      Different diseases worldwide have repercussions at the level of multiple systems; but without
      a doubt a higher prevalence in the cardiopulmonary system. When a patient is hospitalized, he
      enters a continuous and often prolonged rest stay. Wherein, this physical inactivity plus its
      base pathology negatively impact its lung capacity. And low lung capacity has been shown to
      increase the risk of mortality, hospital stay, and complications. That said, the use of the
      device known as the &quot;incentive inspirometer&quot; is important, which to some extent there is no
      standardization of its use or applicability in a structured and planned manner. For this
      reason, the Japer method emerges as an idea; which, pretending through an exercise
      prescription through the incentive inspirometer according to 50% to 80% of the maximum
      inspiring capacity of the patient, improves their inspiring capacity. Having said this, the
      general objective was to analyze the effects of the JaPer method to improve lung capacity
      versus the traditional use of an inspirometer in hospitalized patients.

    <textblock>
      In 1974 the Respiratory Rehabilitation (RR) Committee of the American College of Chest
      Physicians defined RR as an art. It took almost 20 more years for another group of experts to
      describe it as a service. Moving forward in our reasoning, it is important to remember that
      all physical activity produces an increase in metabolic energy expenditure, as a result of
      body movement carried out in a specific period of time. The current literature through
      various organizations has been oriented to promote activities that arouse interest in
      generating movement and thus obtain benefits in improving health and quality of life. The
      respiratory physiotherapy techniques are basically divided into 2 types: facilitating
      techniques for expectoration and respiratory exercises. The former are indicated in
      hypersecretory processes, in alterations in the properties of mucus, ciliary dysfunction and
      alterations in the cough mechanism, to keep the airway free of secretions. The second is
      focused on improving a respiratory pattern, a respiratory reeducation, strengthening of
      respiratory muscles, preventing and / or reducing dyspnea and fatigue through the use of the
      inspirometer, respiratory exercises and specific techniques. In addition, it helps to
      decrease the hospital stay. Which, when prolonged, generates negative effects on the health
      system, such as: increased costs, poor accessibility to hospitalization services, saturation
      of emergencies and risks of adverse events. Plus all the negative effects it can generate in
      a hospitalized patient.

The present one was distributed with a basic probability sampling using a table of random numbers, the order of which was randomized through the Microsoft Excel 16.0 program, with the experimental group being 337 participants (Respiratory exercises plus new method of intervention with respiratory incentive - JaPer Method -) and the control group with 371 (Respiratory exercises plus conventional use of the respiratory incentive).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It is the maximum amount of oxygen that the body can absorb, transport and consume in a given time, is the blood that our body can transport and metabolize. To determine the Vo2 values, the 6-minute walking test is used and to determine the result of the test, formulas are used according to the meters traveled, age, sex, height and weight of the participant. The larger the meters traveled, the greater the vo2.</description>

The test is stopped when the participant. indicates that it can not be more or there are electrocardiographic alterations that indicate that it is the participant's maximum.</description>

    <description>The participant must perform a series of exercises that will be the same for the two groups in this investigation. In addition to the exercises, this group will use the incentive inspirometer device with a new method created by the main author called the Method JaPer.
For the method JaPer, the participant sits and holds the device. Then put the mouthpiece of the inspirometer in the mouth. Be sure to make a good seal on the mouthpiece with your lips. And exhale normally until you run out of air. And after that, inhale slowly as much as possible. This maximum value will be taken as an indicative parameter of its maximum inspiratory capacity and 50 and 80% for 1 set of 10 repetitions at 50% of their maximum value, 2 sets of 10 repetitions at 60% of its maximum capacity and ends with 1 series at 80% of its maximum capacity. It is highlighted that in each series before finishing and without stopping to rest, the participant must do 5 repetitions at 100% maximum capacity</description>

Then put the mouthpiece of the inspirometer in the mouth. Be sure to make a good seal on the mouthpiece with your lips. And exhale (exhale) normally until you run out of air. And after that, inhale (inspire) slowly as much as possible. Repeat 10 times and use these indications for 3 sets. In addition, participants must perform the same breathing exercises that are identical for experimental group.</description>
