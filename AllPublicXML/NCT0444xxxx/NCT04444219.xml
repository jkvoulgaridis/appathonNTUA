  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, characterized by an increase in body weight that results in excessive fat
      accumulation, is a global health problem. Recently, it has also been shown that obesity is
      associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation in adipose tissue. This condition is
      mediated by activation of the innate immune system in adipose tissue that promotes
      inflammation and oxidative stress and triggers a systemic acute-phase response.

      Previous research points towards the potential of phytochemicals in food as part of
      nutritional strategies for the prevention of obesity and associated inflammation, as well as,
      increase in insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients.

      The last decade, mushrooms have attracted the research interest as functional foods rich in
      beta-glucan with desirable health benefits in several metabolic disorders without the side
      effects of pharmacological treatment. Edible mushrooms are highly nutritious and exhibit
      beneficial effects on several inflammatory diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes,,
      high blood pressure.

      However, the postprandial effect of mushrooms in human biological samples is still
      undetermined. To this end, the current study aims to investigate if there is any effect at
      postprandial glucose, insulin responses and appetite hormones. Fifteen apparently men and
      women with Metabolic Syndrome, aged 18-65 years old, will be enrolled based on certain
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      After enrollment, the volunteers will undergo a medical and dietary assessment and their
      health status will be evaluated through a complete blood count. On the day of the experiment
      and after overnight fasting, the volunteers will consume one of two breakfast meal, including
      114g bread, 40g cheese and 15g dry mushrooms (meal 1) or 114g bread, 40g cheese and 200g
      tomatoes (meal 2). Blood samples will be obtained on timepoints 0h, 30min, 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 2,5h
      and 3h after breakfast intake. Two weeks later, the same volunteers will consume the other
      breakfast meal.

      After collection, the glucose and insulin values will be identified in plasma samples.
      Additionally, some appetite hormones will be measureD in serum samples.
