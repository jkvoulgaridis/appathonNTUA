    <textblock>
      Placental abruption is a significant cause of both maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity
      and mortality. Most abruptions accept to be related to a chronic placental disease process.
      Therefore, it is very important to understand these processes. To analyze maternal and
      neonatal effects of placental abruption(PA) through a novel classification in the presence of
      hypertension. Initial hemoglobin parameters were also compared to predict pregnancy outcomes
      in addition to hypertension.

      Objective: We aimed to classify placental abruption according to hypertension status.

      Methods: This retrospective cohort designed study was conducted on 115 pregnant women with
      placental abruption. The main parameters scanned and recorded from the hospital database and
      patient medical files. Two groups were classified regarding of presence or absence of
      hypertension (53 hypertensive, 62 normotensive). Maternal demographical and clinical
      characteristics (abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding) were recorded. APGAR scores below 5 at 1
      and 5 min., fetal or neonatal death, admission and length of stay in Neonatal Intensive Care
      Unit(NICU) were also investigated and compared between the groups.
