  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little research on the health service utilization and the health situation of undocumented
      pregnant migrants has been performed previously, and it is essential to obtain more
      information on the services given, and to examine whether residency status is a risk factor
      in maternal and perinatal health among migrants.This project will give new knowledge on
      undocumented women seeking care at the voluntary clinics and the emergency clinics (DEGPs) in
      Oslo and Bergen, their health care needs, and the medical follow-up they are provided. The
      project will present new knowledge by showing trends in undocumented pregnant migrants care
      seeking compared to general trends among other migrants and Norwegian residents. It will also
      give new knowledge on pregnancy outcomes and perinatal health in undocumented migrants
      compared to foreign and Norwegian born women. This approach has not previously been used to
      study undocumented migrants in Norway, and there are very few similar studies in other
      European countries. Cause and effect relations are rarely claimed in findings from
      observational epidemiologic studies, however the information from three different sources
      (voluntary clinics, emergency clinics and Medical Birth Registry) will give an overall
      picture of the use of primary health care in undocumented pregnant migrants, as well as a
      comparative assessment of maternal outcomes in this population. The proposed research will
      also give important knowledge on how to conduct quantitative research in a population that is
      difficult to reach, and that is not commonly included in research.

      Research questions and objectives

        1. Work package 1 (WP1): What characterizes pregnant undocumented migrants attending the
           voluntary clinics in Oslo and Bergen from 2009 to 2020?

             1. Give a descriptive summary of the population of pregnant undocumented migrants
                seeking care (e.g. age, number of children, time stayed in Norway, work status,
                family network) and the medical problems they are presenting.

             2. Investigate the care received based on indicators such as number of antenatal
                visits and the extent of collaboration with or referral to other health facilities.

             3. Investigate the risk of pregnancy related complications (e.g. pre-eclampsia and
                gestational diabetes) and adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g. use of Caesarean Section
                and pre-term birth) in women seeking care at the clinics.

        2. Work package 2 (WP2): Are there any consultation trends in pregnant undocumented
           migrants seeking emergency care at the emergency units (DEGPs) in Oslo and Bergen from
           2007 to 2020?

             1. Give a descriptive summary of the population of undocumented migrants seeking
                emergency care at the DEGPs, in particular pregnant undocumented migrants seeking
                care.

             2. Investigate trends in emergency consultations at the DEGPs for pregnant
                undocumented migrants after the start of the voluntary clinics (2009/2014),
                comparing with the trends in consultations for the general population of pregnant
                women seeking care.

             3. Investigate trends in emergency consultations at the DEGPs for pregnant
                undocumented migrants after the start of the voluntary clinics (2009/2014),
                comparing to the trends in consultations for other undocumented migrants.

        3. Work package 3 (WP3): What is the occurrence of pregnancy-related complications and
           adverse perinatal outcomes (as reported in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway) in
           patients without national identity number from 1999 to 2020?

             1. Investigate the prevalence of pregnancy related complications (e.g. pre-eclampsia,
                gestational diabetes, nutrient deficiency) in undocumented migrant women compared
                to foreign and Norwegian born women.

             2. Investigate the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g. use of Caesarean
                section, pre-term birth, small for gestational age, low Apgar score) in
                undocumented migrant women compared with foreign and Norwegian born women.
