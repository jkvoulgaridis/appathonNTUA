  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Malaria Heart Disease Study is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of a random sample
      of approximately 1200 individuals from the state of Acre in Brazil. The overall hypothesis is
      that patients who have (i) previously suffered from a malaria infection or (ii) patients with
      ongoing symptomatic malaria will benefit from having an echocardiogram and blood tests
      performed as a screening tool to diagnose early cardiac impairment and prevent future
      cardiovascular disease.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between exposure to malaria and
      the risk of developing subclinical and manifest cardiovascular disease. The study is
      conducted in the high endemic malaria zone pertaining to the city of Cruzeiro do Sul, located
      in the state of Acre, Brazil. The city is considered a part of the Amazon basin.

      By invitation of a random sample of patients with a history of malaria, controls with no
      history of malaria, and symptomatic patients with ongoing malaria infection, the aim is to
      elucidate potential pathways linking malaria to cardiovascular disease.

      Aim 1: Determine whether prior exposure to malaria is associated with myocardial dysfunction.
      We hypothesize that adults with a history of treated malaria (cases) will have worse left
      ventricular (LV) diastolic function and systolic strain compared to age- and sex-matched
      controls without a history of malaria infection. We will recruit 500 cases and 500 controls
      from Cruzeiro-do-Sul, Brazil. State-of-the-art ultrasonographic examinations will be used to
      asses novel imaging metrics of cardiac function.

      Aim 2: Define the extent to which proinflammatory factors (such as Ang-2, CRP, VEGF) are
      associated with cardiac dysfunction in subjects with a history of malaria. We hypothesize
      that proinflammatory biomarkers will be higher in cases compared to controls, and that higher
      concentrations of inflammatory markers will associate with worse LV diastolic function and
      strain. We will measure inflammatory biomarkers, determine the association with cardiac
      dysfunction, and test whether history of malaria modifies this association.

      Aim 3: Determine if echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic function and
      cardiac biomarkers are significantly elevated in patients with symptomatic malaria (N=200).

      Upon conclusion of this study, we will better understand the relationship of malaria with
      subclinical cardiac dysfunction. This will allow us to develop the scientific foundation and
      necessary infrastructure to expand this project to a longitudinal study to prospectively
      assess associations with relevant clinical outcomes.
