    <textblock>
      This Randomized Clinical Trial will be conducted to compare the efficacy of ethanolic extract
      of Aloe vera versus chlorhexidine cavity disinfectant in reducing total bacterial count of
      Streptococcus mutans (SM) and Lactobacilli (LB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries remains to be a major oral health problem afflicting people, young and old,
      especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Though dentistry has magically
      developed with newer materials and newer techniques, dental caries remains a disease of great
      prevalence.

      The prevention and control of caries necessitates the elimination of cariogenic bacteria that
      produce acids responsible for the decrease of pH and starting the process of
      demineralization.

      While the goal of restorative treatments for dental caries is to remove the infected dentin
      and fill the area with a suitable restorative material, failure to remove the infected teeth
      surface totally and achieve complete sterilization of the cavity can lead to microleakage,
      increased pulp sensitivity, pulpal infection and secondary caries that necessitate
      replacement of restoration.

      Therefore, after removal of the carious dentin it is important to eliminate any remaining
      bacteria that may be present on the cavity walls, in the smear layer, at the enamel-dentin
      junction, or in the dentinal tubules. But unfortunately, no definitive and reliable criteria
      are available to ensure the complete removal of carious tooth structure. Many investigations
      have shown the presence of bacteria in the dentin even after removal of dye-stainable dentin.

      Due to indiscriminate use of antimicrobials more and more pathogens are becoming resistant
      and posing a serious threat in rendering successful treatment of the diseases. With the rise
      in bacterial resistance to various synthetic antimicrobial agents, there is a considerable
      interest and a growing trend in the field.
