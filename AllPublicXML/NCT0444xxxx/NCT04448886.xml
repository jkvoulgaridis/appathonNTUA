          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation. Childbearing
             potential is defined as participants who have not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12
             continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause) and
             have not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception. Contraception is required starting with the first dose of study
             medication through 150 days (5 months) after the last dose of study medication.
             Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
             bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, and copper intrauterine devices.
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Hormonal
             contraceptives are contraindicated for HR+ breast cancer.

          -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of study treatment with pembrolizumab and
             7 months after the last dose of study treatment (i.e., 90 days (duration of sperm

             five half-lives.

          -  The participant must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and
             willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent administration of any other anti-cancer therapy, including investigational
             agents, within 4 weeks of study treatment initiation and during the course of this
             study (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, capecitabine, bisphosphonates, and RANK
             ligand inhibitors are allowed).

          -  Prior therapy with any anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 agent or IMMU-132. Prior therapy
             with irinotecan or topoisomerase I-containing antibody drug conjugates at any time for
             early stage or metastatic disease.

          -  Prior hypersensitivity to the excipients of pembrolizumab or IMMU-132 therapy.

          -  Known history of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) *28 allele homozygosity,
             which is associated with increased risk for neutropenia and diarrhea related to
             irinotecan.85

          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control
             symptoms.

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation. Patients must have
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery.

          -  Uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease,
             uncontrolled seizures, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit
             compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy (&gt;
             10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive
             medication (including disease modifying agents) and has required such therapy in the
             last 2 years. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic therapy.

          -  Participant has documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that currently
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

          -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.

          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers that have been diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years are eligible:
             cervical/prostate carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, non-melanoma cancer
             of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 3 years and felt to
             be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study principal investigator
             to determine eligibility.

          -  Participant has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B
             (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C
             virus (defined as detected HCV RNA [qualitative]) infection. HIV-positive participants
             are ineligible due to the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of combination
             antiretroviral therapy with study drugs and the increased risk of fatal infections.
             Note: No testing for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by
             local health authority.

          -  The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to study treatment
             initiation. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:
             measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid
             vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is allowed.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are
             excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in
             the nursing infant, participants who are breast-feeding are not eligible for
             enrollment.
