      To determine whether nutritional optimization in head and neck cancer patients undergoing
      major surgery will decrease post-operative wound complications. The Investigators hypothesize
      that nutritional supplementation with Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery (AR) will decrease the

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nutritional optimization in head and neck
      cancer patients undergoing major surgery will decrease post-operative wound complications. It
      is likely that many head and neck cancer patients suffer from sarcopenia, and this
      contributes to many wound complications, including wound infection, dehiscence, fistula
      formation, and free flap tissue loss. The Investigators hypothesize that nutritional
      supplementation with Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery (AR) will decrease the rate of wound
      complications after surgery

    <description>Patients will be encouraged to continue their regular diet until their surgery day. In addition, beginning 5 days before surgery, subjects will be instructed to drink three, 6 ounce cartons of Nestle IMPACT AR each day until their surgery. Post operatively patients who are able to eat orally, will be given three, 6 ounce cartons of Nestle IMPACT AR to drink each day for 5 days. Patients who are not able to tolerate an oral diet will be given Nestle IMPACT via a continuous tube feeding for 5 days through a temporary nasogastric feeding tube placed per standard post-operative care. Dosing of the tube feeding will be based on weight at a rate of approximately 70-75 cc/hour.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18 years. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups will be
             included.

             candidates.

          -  Patients must be indicated for major head and neck surgery, defined as surgeries with
             an anticipated post-surgical hospital stay of 4 or more days. Examples of major
             surgeries include, but are not limited to, total laryngectomy, large oral cavity,
             oropharyngeal, salivary gland, or soft tissue resections requiring free flap or major
             regional flap (e.g. pectoralis major flap), and large skull base procedures requiring
             extensive skull base reconstruction.

          -  Patients must have cross-sectional body imaging (PET-CT or equivalent) performed
             within 4 weeks of study enrollment and available for review.

          -  Patient must be willing to receive Nestle IMPACT Advance Recovery for five days prior
             to planned surgery as well as for 5 days after surgery.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  All adult men and women with cancer of the head and neck undergoing surgery by the
             study PI's at UI Health will be considered for participation in this study without
             regard to race, gender or socioeconomic status.

             enrollment, or who are scheduled to receive an investigational drug during the course
             of the study.

          -  Patients currently taking IMPACT or other immuno-nutrition products
             (arginine-containing supplements) will be excluded. Other forms of nutritional
             supplementation, such as caloric supplementation, tube feeding, or other dietary
             supplements are allowed on study.

          -  Patients currently taking anabolic steroids will be excluded. Patients taking
             corticosteroids are allowed on study.

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
