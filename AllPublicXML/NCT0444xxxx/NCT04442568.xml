  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with BMI &gt;35 and chronic diseases or BMI &gt;40 will be scheduled to receive
      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG). Two groups are planned according to receive Enhance
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol or not. All participants will receive standard LSG.
      Participants of ERAS will receive anesthesia and post-surgical nutrition protocol which are
      determined for ERAS. All patients will be checked for status of pain with VAS score, nausea
      and vomiting with PONV score at postoperative 2nd hour, 12th hour. In ERAS group liquid oral
      intake will be started between postoperative 2nd and 4th hours. In no ERAS group liquid oral
      intake will be started in the morning of postoperative first day. The patients who provides
      discharge criterias will be discahrged. these criterias are; To provide adequate pain relief
      with paracetamol and nonsteroidal painkillers, No wound problem, No complications after
      surgery, Pulse rate &lt;90 beats / min, temperature ≤ 37 · 5 ° C, respiratory rate, &lt;20 breaths
      / minute, To be able to mobilize easily, To be able to drink 1 liter of water after surgery.

      Emergency admissions of the participants within a month after surgery will be recorded.
