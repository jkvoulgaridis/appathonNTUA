  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common digestive system disease in clinic. Although it has not
      reached the level of life-threatening, it seriously affects the quality of life of patients.
      The pathogenesis of FD mainly involves gastric motility disorder and visceral
      hypersensitivity. At present, there are gastric motility promoting drugs and gastric acid
      inhibiting drugs, but they can not achieve satisfactory therapeutic effect. Traditional
      Chinese medicine has a good clinical effect on FD, but the specific mechanism is not clear.
      With the gradual deepening of intestinal flora research, it provides a useful tool for
      elucidating the mechanism of action of traditional Chinese medicine compound. The role of
      intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of FD, especially in the pathogenesis of symptoms, has
      not been studied, and the mechanism of Spleen-strengthening and motility-promoting effects of
      Xiangsha Liujun has not been studied from the perspective of intestinal flora. In this study,
      16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to observe the difference of
      intestinal flora between FD patients and normal people, and then to observe the effect of
      Xiangsha Liujun on intestinal flora of FD patients. The aim of this study was to explore the
      role of intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of FD and to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism
      of Xiangsha Liujunzi by regulating intestinal flora of FD patients, so as to provide support
      for follow-up clinical and experimental studies.
