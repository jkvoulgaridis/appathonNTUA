      The study is a non-interventional prospective observational study in patients with trigeminal
      neuralgia that undergoes micovascular decompression. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and
      complications 2 years after microvascular decompression

      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate effect and complications 2 years after MVD
      using independent assessors of outcome and complications.

      Data of outcome and complications is collected prospectively based on based on standardized
      follow-up schemes and questionnaires. Patients were assessed by independent assessors before
      surgery and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Current pain level was evaluated according
      to VAS and BNI pain scale. Complications were evaluated by the assessors by a questionnaire
      and physical examination. All patients undergo a pre-surgical protocolized 3.0 Tesla MRI of
      the brain and brainstem.

        We consecutively evaluated patients with the diagnosis of TN seen at the Danish Headache
        Center (DHC), a tertiary medical referral centre for headache and facial pain. Patients who
        were treated with MVD at the Department of Neurosurgery were included in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Most give Signed informed Consent.

          -  Must fullfil the ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria for classical TN.Patients with purely
             paroxysmal TN and patients with TN with concomitant persistent facial pain will be
             included.

          -  If the ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria is fulfilled and if complete clinical history,
             neurological and physical examination and a 3.0 Tesla MRI do not raise any suspicion
             of another causative disease such as painful posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy or
             symptomatic TN, subjects with sensory abnormalities detected at clinical neurological
             examination are also included.

          -  Has had a 3.0 Tesla MRI according to the trigeminal neuralgia protocol, prior to the
             surgical intervention.

          -  Semi-structured interview and neurological examination by the independent assessors
             prior to neurosurgical intervention.

          -  Has tried at least one, preferably two, sodium channel blocker (either carbamazepine
             or oxcarbazepine) before referral to neurosurgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if one of the following exclusion criteria is met:

          -  Psychiatric or mental illness or condition that might interfere with the ability of
             the patients to fill in the Informed Consent and questionnaires.

          -  Previous microvascular decompression as a treatment for trigeminal neuralgia
