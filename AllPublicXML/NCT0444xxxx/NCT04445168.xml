  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of Americans have diabetes or prediabetes, for which regular physical activity can
      reduce risks of unfavorable outcomes of these conditions. This study will test the effects of
      an evidence-based intervention in the primary care setting on increasing physical activity
      among these individuals. If effective, it can be broadly implemented in primary care.
