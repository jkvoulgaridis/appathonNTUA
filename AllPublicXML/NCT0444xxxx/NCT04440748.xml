  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Additional trunk therapy is proven to be effective for improving trunk function and sitting
      balance. However, conventional trunk therapy is limited by the needed supervision of a
      therapist and when using unstable surfaces, only a small patient group can profit from this
      training. Rehabilitation technologies are considered an effective add-on to conventional
      therapy in order to improve semi-independent training at a high-intensity for a broad type of
      patients. For the trunk, only few devices exist, mainly used for research purposes and not
      adapted to clinical needs.

      Therefore, a prototype to train the trunk of the patient was developed (T-Chair), in order to
      train trunk control and sitting balance. After the first usability study with the first
      T-Chair prototype, it was found that the device was usable and safe but it needed further
      improvements. Over the past year these improvements have been made. Therefore the goal of
      this feasibility study is to investigate the usability of the new T-Chair 2.0 prototype, as
      well as the possible effect the device could have on trunk control and lower extremity
      function.

      To do this, 30 persons in the subacute phase post stroke will be included in the study and
      randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental
      group will perform in addition to their normal general rehabilitation programme, additional
      therapy with the T-Chair 2.0, three times per week for four weeks. Participants in the
      control group will perform their normal general rehabilitation programme. Before training at
      T0, trunk function, trunk muscle strength, lower extremity function, lower extremity muscle
      strength, sitting balance, general mobility, cognition and level of neglect will be
      evaluated. Directly after each therapy session feasibility in terms of demand, safety,
      handling, acceptance, comfort, exertion of exercises and general feedback will be evaluated.
      After four weeks at T1, all measurements will be repeated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, 14.608 people suffered a stroke in Switzerland alone, causing impairment in
      cognitive, psychological and motor functions. One of the most well-known symptoms is a
      hemiplegia, causing the patient to lose muscle force and sensibility on one body side. Mostly
      unknown, is that the trunk is affected bilaterally, causing the patient to have problems with
      sitting or standing balance and being unable to execute simple tasks in daily life. As trunk
      function is a strong prognostic factor for independence in daily life, it is a key component
      in rehabilitation after stroke.

      Additional trunk therapy is proven to be effective for improving trunk function and sitting
      balance. However, conventional trunk therapy is limited by the needed supervision of a
      therapist and when using unstable surfaces, only a small patient group can profit from this
      training. Rehabilitation technologies are considered an effective add-on to conventional
      therapy in order to improve semi-independent training at a high-intensity for a broad type of
      patients. For the trunk, only few devices exist, mainly used for research purposes and not
      adapted to clinical needs.

      Therefore, a prototype to train the trunk of the patient was developed (T-Chair), in order to
      train trunk control and sitting balance. The feasibility of the first prototype was tested in
      a previous study. Outcomes have been used to improve the prototype in order to produce the
      final prototype: the T-Chair 2.0. In order to know if this final device suits the needs of
      patients and therapist and has an effect on trunk and lower extremity function after stroke a
      feasibility study combined with a pilot randomised controlled trial will be performed.

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will perform additional therapy with the T-Chair 2.0. Participants can train in two modes. Participants will either train in the active modus, whereby the participant has to move the seat in a certain direction, or in the passive modus, whereby the participant has to stay in a stable position while the seat is moving underneath the participant. The seat is able to move in mediolateral, anteroposterior, and diagonal and combined directions such as circles or eight-figures. The modus, the type of movement, the range of motion and speed of movement are chosen by the therapist according to the patients' abilities.Training will be coupled with a computer based exercise. During the session preparation time, and time for the questionnaires is needed, thus we expect the actual training time to be on average 30 minutes per training.</description>

    <description>The general rehabilitation program that is offered to all patients of Clinic Valens fits the current standards for treatment post-stroke. This program is tailored to the patients needs and consists of a 90 minute so called &quot;focus training&quot; per day, which includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, resistance training and gait training. According to the patient needs, extra therapy will be given such as robotic therapy, speech therapy and aquatic therapy. The general rehabilitation program in both groups is comparable in content, time and intensity.</description>
