  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of INCMGA00012
      and pelareorep and to see how well they work in treating patients with triple negative breast
      cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).

      INCMGA00012 is a monoclonal antibody that works by attaching to the programmed cell death
      protein 1 (PD-1) and blocking this pathway, allowing the immune system to recognize and
      attack the cancer cells. Pelareorep is a type of virus called reovirus which occurs naturally
      and may break down cancer cells. Giving INCMGA00012 and pelareorep may slow the growth and
      spread of the cancer to another part of the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of the combination of retifanlimab (INCMGA00012) and pelareorep
      for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the second and third line
      setting.

      II. To assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of INCMGA00012 in combination with the
      oncolytic virus pelareorep for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the
      second and third line setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and duration of response
      (DOR) in patients receiving INCMGA00012 in combination with the oncolytic virus pelareorep
      for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the second and third line
      setting.

      II. To assess quality of life measures.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether pre-treatment PD-L1 expression is associated with treatment outcomes.

      II. To determine if changes in T cell repertoire as measured by T-cell receptor (TCR)
      sequencing is predictive of treatment outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pelareorep intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 2, 15, and 16.
      Patients also receive retifanlimab IV over 60 minutes on day 3. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 6
      months for up to 2 years.

                  control includes (a) intrauterine device plus 1 barrier method; (b) on stable
                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,
                  implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective
                  barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams
                  or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner
