    <textblock>
      This is a randomised control trial of adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in Hong
      Kong to compare the effectiveness of financial and social incentives against a control group
      receiving standard care. The investigators follow participants for 9-months (6-month
      intervention period and a 3-month post-intervention follow-up period) to assess glycemic
      control and other health indicators. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups (in ratio 3:1): arm A (financial and social incentives in addition to standard care),
      and arm B (control arm receiving standard care). Financial incentives will be framed around
      loss aversion and the endowment effect. Social incentives will include peer competition, and
      social support. Financial and social incentives are to encourage increased physical activity
      and participants will use a pedometer to track activity. Participants are followed for an
      additional 3-months after the cessation of incentives to assess the sustainability of
      lifestyle changes.

    <description>Participants will be credited with HK$1000 in their virtual accounts at the beginning of the trial. After baseline step counts are gathered in the second week, participants will lose HK$40 for each subsequent week that they do not meet their personal weekly step target. For social incentives, participants receive feedback of their physical activity performance, personal rankings within their assigned groups, and positive messages for encouragement. Nominated supporters will be informed of participants' performance for social support.</description>
