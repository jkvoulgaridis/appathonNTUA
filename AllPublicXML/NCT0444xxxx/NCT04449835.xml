    <textblock>
      The Intracept Global Registry is a prospective, noninterventional, observational global post
      market independent data collection of the ongoing effectiveness, safety, and satisfaction
      outcomes for patients treated with the Intracept Procedure. This registry will be conducted
      according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, including participant verbal informed
      consent and Independent Review Board (IRB) / Ethics Committee (EC) approval and oversight.

      Registry design, conduct, analysis, and reporting are overseen by the Principal Investigator
      (PI) and the cross-specialty TIGR Physician Steering Committee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the registry will have seven study visits over a period of five years (one
      prior to procedure and 6 post their procedure). Study visits will be conducted via telephone
      by a third-party CRO and independent clinical research coordinators. Participants will be
      verbally consented and then evaluated via telephonic study visits at baseline (prior to
      procedure) and at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post their Intracept Procedure.

      Primary and secondary objectives are based on patient reported outcomes for functional
      improvement, pain reduction, and physical and mental health pre and post procedure. The
      registry will also look at utilization of injections and pain interventions/surgery for
      treatment of low back pain post Intracept.

    <description>Validated questionnaire of low back pain related disability. Comprised of 10 questions evaluating the impact of low back pain on activities of daily living. The ODI is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 100 (complete disability), with categories of 0-20 (minimal disability), 21-40 (moderate disability), 41-60 (severe disability), 61-80 (crippling back pain), and 81-100 (bed-bound or exaggerating). Comparison of mean ODI baseline to 3 months.</description>
