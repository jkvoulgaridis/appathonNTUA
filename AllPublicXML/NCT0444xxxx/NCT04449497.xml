  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lien Centre for Palliative Care has been commissioned by Lien Foundation to produce the 2020
      rankings of the Quality of End of Life Care across countries. This index will focus on
      patients with life limiting illnesses and their families and aims to produce an index and
      rankings that take into account the preferences of patients, their caregivers and providers
      in terms of what is truly important at end of life. The aim of this research is to
      investigate best practices in palliative care policy and implementation as they relate to
      end-of-life care for individuals with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. This task
      will be completed through a systematic review of peer reviewed and grey literature,
      supplemented with qualitative interviews to identify the list of the candidate indicators to
      be used in the index. A final instrument when completed by country experts will allow for
      ranking countries in their ability to deliver high quality end of life care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care has gained considerable attention at the global, regional and national levels
      and there has been follow-up on actions outlined in the 2014 World Health Assembly (WHA)
      Resolution on palliative care. The WHA Resolution called countries to action to integrate
      palliative care into their national health strategies and as part of universal health
      coverage (UHC) efforts. Further, important contributions have been made to the literature on
      palliative care overall and at the end of life, such as by the Lancet Commission on Global
      Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief as well as on quality healthcare.

      Through this research, the Quality of Death and Dying Index will be published and it seeks to
      facilitate monitoring of country-level progress based on domains/sub-domains and indicators
      used to define quality of death and dying in the discourse on end-of-life care, and within
      the context of the contrasting realities occurring worldwide. Examining the various
      trajectories that countries have followed and the experiences of end-of-life care design and
      delivery by countries from different income groups and based on the viewpoint of diverse
      stakeholders will provide critical information for metrics development, namely the 2020
      Quality of Death and Dying Index
