      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and relative
      bioavailability of a single dose of JNJ-70033093 spray dried dispersion (SDD) tablets
      compared with JNJ-70033093 SDD granule capsules in healthy participants under fasting
      conditions in Part 1 and 2 and to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of a
      single dose of JNJ-70033093 SDD tablets in Part 1.
