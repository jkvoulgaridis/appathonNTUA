  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern immunosuppression is characterized by a combination of different immunosuppressants.
      As a result, the dose of the individual substances, and thus also their side effects can be
      reduced. Immunosuppression on the basis of low-dose calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) with
      comparatively low CNI target levels could therefore prevail. Despite all efforts to optimize
      the treatment regimen after liver transplantation from deceased donors, the amount of
      medication remains high throughout the postoperative course with CNIs being the main
      component of immunosuppressive treatment. The main substance used is Tacrolimus in
      combination with steroids and possibly Mycophenolic acid. Tacrolimus is considered a narrow
      therapeutic index drug requiring individual dose titration, to achieve a satisfactory balance
      between maximizing efficacy and minimizing dose-related toxicity. Furthermore, transplanted
      recipients have to remain to a very demanding medication regimen for a long time. The burden
      of pills required is associated with decreased adherence, and lack of adherence can lead to
      rejection and possibly graft loss. The aim of present study is to assess the tough levels and
      need of doses adaptation in de novo liver transplantation with Tacrolimus in the clinical
      routine, without any intervention in the treatment regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug requiring individual dose titration,
      to achieve a satisfactory balance between maximizing efficacy and minimizing dose-related
      toxicity. The pharmacokinetic profile of Tacrolimus is characterized by a high degree of
      inter- and intraindividual variability. Although it is rapidly absorbed, the bioavailability
      of Tacrolimus in the twice-daily capsule formulation is low and variable, ranging from 17 to
      23%. This could be due to poor water solubility, extensive first pass metabolism,
      p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux and the ingestion of food. Tacrolimus twice-daily capsules are
      also associated with a characteristic high peak following dosing, which may be associated
      with increased toxicity.

      Furthermore, transplanted recipients have to remain to a very demanding medication regimen
      for a long time. The burden of pills required is associated with decreased adherence, and
      lack of adherence can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss.

      The development of once-daily Tacrolimus forms without any change of the form of dissolving
      has already been shown to increase patients' adherence, while little difference has been
      demonstrated in the Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic profile. The pharmacokinetic profile of
      Tacrolimus is characterized by flatter kinetics (i.e., less fluctuation and swing) compared
      to twice-daily Tacrolimus providing for a balanced concentration-time consistency over 24
      hours which can also lead to reduced incidence and/or intensity of drug toxicity-related
      adverse events. Since the development of LCP-Tacrolimus once-daily tablets, with the use of
      MeltDose® technology, clinical data have shown lower peak and reduced peak-to-tough
      fluctuations.

    <description>Similar to the clinical routine, as soon as a patient is able to swallow and has a sufficient gastrointestinal activity, Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression using Prograf®, Advagraf® or Envarsus® will be started. Furthermore, calcineurin inhibitors-based immunosuppression will be used (initial dose based on the patients' body weight) with the goal of tough levels of 3-7 ng/mL in the first seven days after liver transplantion, depending on immune status and indication for transplantation. Further tough levels will be determined based on factors such as patients' history and indication for liver transplant.</description>
