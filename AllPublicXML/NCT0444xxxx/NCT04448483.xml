  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of a new treatment for upper
      limb motor rehabilitation after severe stroke using non-invasive neurotechnologies. The
      investigational system is used alone or coupled with brain stimulation provided by
      transcranic direct current stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at providing two interventions:

      In the first intervention, a brain computer interface able to non-invasively detect motor
      intention from the non-invasive measure of brain activity by using electroencephalography,
      activates a robotic glove that will assist-as-needed hand movements and paretic upper limb
      functional electric stimulation. The latter will activate upper limb muscles to perform motor
      rehabilitation exercises for the upper limb. The motor rehabilitation exercises include upper
      limb and hand mobilization and functional tasks, such as hand open/closing, wrist
      flexion/extension, and reach and grasp a cup, keep and release.

      In the second intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation in the form of transcranial direct
      current stimulation will be provided in addition to the previous intervention.

      Each participant will perform a minimum of 11 rehabilitative sessions for the first
      intervention and a minimum of 11 rehabilitative sessions for the second intervention, for a
      total minimum of 22 rehabilitative sessions. If the participant recovers with the
      intervention, the relative rehabilitative session continues to be proposed until patients
      will reaches a &quot;plateau&quot;. The intervention will switch from 1 to 2 if the participant does
      not improve anymore with the 1st intervention. If the patient does not improve anymore with
      the 2nd intervention the interventional part of the trial will be finished. The
      intervention(s) will terminate also if the participant continues to progress after 6 months
      of inclusion. As the study is especially designed for personalization of intervention for
      every patient, it is not possible to determine a priori the number of sessions for each
      participant, because they depend on the response of each participant to the intervention. The
      duration of each rehabilitative visit is about two and half hours.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain stimulation effectiveness in BCI-aided motor therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months average</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the effectiveness of brain stimulation is measured by FMA scores of all patients at initial, inter-intervention and final evaluation. This measurement is made between the end and the beginning of each intervention for each patient.
Comparison is made by using one-way ANOVA if data normally distributed, or Kruskal Wallis test if otherwise. Secondary analysis measures are calculated for each patient once they complete the study. It will consist in the evaluation of effectiveness of BCI-aided motor therapy without and with brain stimulation. Group comparison is done with inferential statistics for full and partial populations. Similar comparisons and judgement criteria are applied for clinical scales and questionnaires.</description>
