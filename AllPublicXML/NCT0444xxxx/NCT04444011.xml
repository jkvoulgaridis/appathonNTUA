      A single-center, randomized, open-label, crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic
      drug-drug interaction and safety of the quadruple therapy with Anaprazole 20mg/Amoxicilin
      1000mg/Clarithromycin 500mg/Bismuth Potassium Citrate 0.6g in healthy Chinese male subjects.

      The study composed of 2 cohorts, using a 4*4 or 2*2 crossover design in cohort 1 and 2,
      respectively. 4 rotating treatment sequences in cohort 1, each treatment sequence comprised 4
      treatment periods, separated by a washout period of 9 days; 2 rotating treatment sequences in
      cohort 2, each treatment sequence comprised 2 treatment periods, separated by a washout
      period of 9 days
