  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the drug Mesna®
      (Uromitexan) in healthy participants with overweight or obesity with respect to change in
      plasma concentrations of total cysteine, following single ascending doses of oral Mesna.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both animal experiments and human studies, cysteine in the blood is strongly associated
      with obesity. In rodents, changes in cysteine induced by dietary means are accompanied by
      changes in fat mass.

      In this phase I, single ascending dose study the investigators will determine the effects of
      Mesna in healthy volunteers with overweight and obesity with focus on its effects on plasma
      total cysteine concentrations. The aim of this dose-finding clinical trial is to determine
      the lowest single oral Mesna dose that will lower plasma total cysteine concentrations by 30%
      using pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling. The investigators will further
      evaluate the effect of Mesna on plasma cysteine fractions and related metabolites, urinary
      cysteine excretion, safety and adverse drug reactions, and plasma biomarkers.
