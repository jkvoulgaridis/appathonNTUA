      The purpose of this study is to assess the percent change in body weight when switching to
      darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) (Immediate Switch Arm) compared to continuing the current integrase (INI) + tenofovir
      alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) antiretroviral (ARV) regimen (Delayed Switch Arm) in
      virologically-suppressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected participants who have
      experienced rapid and significant body weight gain.
