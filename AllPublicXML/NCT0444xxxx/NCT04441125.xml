      Aim: This study has been planned as an observational study. The aim of this study is to
      determine the effect of labor induction with oxytocin on early postpartum hemorrhage,
      perineal integrity, pain and breastfeeding.

      Materials and Methods:

      The sample consists of 70 healthy mother and infant pairs. The mothers in the experimental
      group will receive oxytocin induction before and after delivery. On the other hand, the
      mothers in the control group will not receive any oxytocin induction before delivery, and
      will receive oxytocin induction in the end of delivery.

      Data were collected by using the Personal Information Form, the Visual Analogue Scale, the
      LATCH Breastfeeding Diagnostic Scale, the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale, the follow-up
      bag for postpartum hemorrhage, and episiotomy healing assessment known as the REEDA Scale.

      Oxytocin is applied to the women in the experimental group before the delivery.

      There is a procedure on the usage of oxytocin at the delivery room. In accordance with the
      relevant procedure, it is administered as an intravenous infusion by adding 5 units of
      oxytocin in 500 cc of physiological saline solution.

      The initial dosage is adjusted in order to allow for the flow of 4 drops per minute. Maximum
      40 drops in total can be applied by increasing for 4 drops every 20 minutes. The dosage can
      be increased by considering the intensity and duration of contractions. The initial dosage of
      the oxytocin procedure applied to the women is the same for all women. As the total duration
      of delivery is different, there are differences between the dosages of oxytocin received.

      In accordance with the postpartum procedure at the delivery room, it is administered as an
      intravenous infusion to all women (primiparous, multiparous) by adding 20 units of oxytocin
      in 500 cc of physiological saline solution immediately after the delivery.

      The women in the control group do not receive any oxytocin induction before the delivery, and
      these women give birth spontaneously. After the delivery, the postpartum procedure applied
      for the control group is preferred.

      Episiotomy is applied routinely to the primiparous pregnant women at the gynecological
      examination table in order to enlarge the opening of the vagina during the delivery.
      Episiotomy is a surgical incision applied to the bulbo-cavernous muscle in the perineal
      region while the baby's head appears in order to protect the perineal tonus, prevent
      undesired repairs, and to provide an easy, quick and safe delivery by enlarging the vaginal
      opening. Medio-lateral episiotomy is applied routinely to all women.

      Immediately after the delivery, the baby's umbilical cord is clamped and cut. The postpartum
      hemorrhage bag is placed under the mother's perineal region immediately after the umbilical
      cord is cut, and it is waited for separation of the placenta. The duration for separation of
      the placenta is 30 minutes in maximum. After separation of the placenta, episiotomy repair is
      made. The loss of blood in the postpartum hemorrhage bag is recorded after the episiotomy
      repair. Before the woman is taken to her bed, necessary pads are provided, postpartum
      hemorrhage is followed-up, and the pads are weighed in the 24th postpartum hour.

      The perineal region is evaluated by the REEDA scale in the postpartum 12th hour and the 24th
      hour.

      Pain is evaluated by the VAS in the postpartum 6th hour and the 24th hour.

      The LATCH, the Breastfeeding Assessment, and the BSES are applied in the postpartum 24th hour
      and the first week.

    <time_frame>6th hour</time_frame>
    <description>'0' is the normal value for total score. In the scale, an increase in score shows that pain increases, and a decrease in score shows that pain decreases. '0' indicates that the person has no pain, and '10' indicates that the person has a severe pain.

The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale consists of 14 items.
The lowest score which can be achieved from the scale is 14, and the highest score is 70.
Achieving a high score indicates that the mothers have a high breastfeeding self-efficacy.

    <description>The postpartum hemorrhage bag has been calibrated in order to help for the follow-up of vaginal hemorrhage and fluid, and has been designed as filtration-specific. The bag is transparent colored, and the amount within the bag is recorded as milliliter.The postpartum hemorrhage bag is placed under the mother's perineal region after the delivery in order to measure the postpartum hemorrhage, and the amount of hemorrhage is recorded when the mother leaves the gynecological table. Then, the hemorrhage follow-up is made through a pad when the mother is taken to the bed. All pads are sterile and same in size. In the 24th postpartum hour, the pads used by the researcher are weighed and recorded.</description>
