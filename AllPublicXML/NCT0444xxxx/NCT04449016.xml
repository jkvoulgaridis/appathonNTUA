  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if ethnicity alters training responsiveness to a
      low dose of high intensity interval training in inactive women.

    <textblock>
      Prior to the session, women completed a 4-minute warmup at 10 % PPO. Each subject completed 9
      sessions of HIIT over a 3-week period which consisted of eight to ten 1-minute bouts of
      cycling at 85% PPO with 75-second recovery between bouts at 10 % PPO. This protocol is
      well-tolerated in inactive individuals. Continuously during each session, heart rate was
      monitored using telemetry. On days 1, 3, 6, and 9 of training, the physical activity
      enjoyment scale (PACES) was completed. VO2max and cardiac output max were assessed prior to
      training, as well as post.

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant performed VO2max testing on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer using a ramp protocol. During exercise, subjects expired through a plastic mouthpiece and low resistance valve into tubing connected to a mixing chamber. Measures of ventilation and expired fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide were obtained throughout exercise by a metabolic cart. Gas exchange data including VO2, VCO2, and ventilation were time-averaged every 15 seconds. The test was terminated when the subject's pedal cadence was below 50 rev/min.</description>
