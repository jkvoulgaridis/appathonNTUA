  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin (CisP) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat head and neck and lung cancer in
      adults and over 15 different pediatric cancers. Despite its known toxicity, CisP is still
      widely used as a first line chemotherapy as it is so effective. Nephrotoxicity is one of the
      most common adverse effects of CisP, occurring in 20-50% of patients. It manifests as acute
      kidney injury (AKI) typically within the first few days of exposure and is associated with
      short and long-term morbidity. Furthermore, AKI diagnosis is only possible once kidney damage
      has progressed to functional impairment, when mitigation strategies are ineffective. Tests
      that could predict AKI risk pre-emptively or diagnose early-stage AKI before functional loss
      would be very impactful, affording opportunities for prevention or early intervention to
      mitigate CisP nephrotoxicity, reduce morbidity and improve health outcomes.

      The field of metabolomics seeks to identify patterns of small molecules (metabolites)
      involved in cell or tissue metabolism related to disease states, or patient factors like
      lifestyle and genetics. Plasma and urine are ideal for sampling the metabolome, which can
      identify at-risk patients and reveal disease-related changes earlier than existing diagnostic
      methods do.

      In CisP-treated children and adults from across Canada, we will identify urine and plasma
      metabolite profiles a) prior to CisP dosing that predict CisP AKI risk, and b) shortly after
      dosing to identify early-stage nephrotoxicity, before clinical signs of AKI are detectable.
      Our identified biomarkers will allow individualization of CisP treatment based on the level
      of nephrotoxicity risk and the design of trials to mitigate the progression and complications
      of CisP nephrotoxicity.

        Child Cohort. We already performed these study procedures on 159 children in the &quot;ABLE&quot;
        study, a 12-centre cohort study.Eligibility criteria and data/samples collected on these
        patients during their initial CisP treatment are almost identical to the present study. The
        cohort diagnoses include neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, germ cell tumour,
        hepatoblastoma, and other cancers. Data and specimens from the pediatric study subjects in
        the ABLE study who were recruited during their first CisP infusion (about half) will be
        included in the current study. The remaining children (to reach a target of 300) will be
        recruited over 3 years from the following centres: McGill, UBC, SickKids, U. Manitoba and
        UWO. Adult Cohort. 300 adults (18 years of age or older) initiating CisP (≥75 mg/m2)
        treatment for head/neck or lung cancers will be recruited to participate in this study from
        PMH (Toronto), UBC and UWO over 2 years. Over 500 new patients/year are available across
        all sites.
