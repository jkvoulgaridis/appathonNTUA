    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in combination with lenvatinib
      in participants with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma.The primary hypothesis of
      this study are that patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma could benefit
      from durvalumab plus lenvatinib with respect to: 1)Progression Free Survival (PFS) ; 2)
      Objective Response Rate (ORR); and Overall survival (OS). The investigators design a clinical
      study to explore whether the combination above as a treatment in patients with advanced and
      recurrent endometrial carcinoma could prolong PFS and to analyze potential immune biomarker
      of therapeutic response.

      The combination of Lenvatinib and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking has great
      potential in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer. This trial is
      designed as a prospective, open label study for 20 patients with advanced (recurrent,
      refractory or metastatic) endometrial cancer, including carcinosarcoma of the uterus. The aim
      is to investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally
      and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial endometrial carcinoma.

          -  Patient must have endometrial cancer in one of the following categories:

               -  Newly diagnosed Stage III disease (measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 following
                  surgery or diagnostic biopsy),
