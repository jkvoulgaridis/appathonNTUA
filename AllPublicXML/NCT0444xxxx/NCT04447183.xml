      This study was conducted in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had undergone
      near-total thyroidectomy. After surgery patients were randomized to one of two methods of
      performing thyroid remnant ablation (use of radioiodine to remove any remaining thyroid
      tissue). One group of patients who took thyroid hormone medicine and were euthyroid [i.e.
      their thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal], and received injections of
      Thyrogen (0.9 mg daily on two consecutive days) followed by oral radioiodine. The second
      group of patients did not take thyroid hormone medicine so that they were hypothyroid (i.e.
      their TSH levels were high), and were given oral radioiodine. All patients received the same
      amount of radioactive iodine (30mCi±1.5mCi or 1.11GBq of 131I). Approximately 9 months later,
      whole body scans were performed on all patients to learn whether the thyroid remnants had
      been successfully ablated.
