  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate early preliminary efficacy of the eMotion
      intervention in rural US adults who have experienced a myocardial infarction and
      participating in phase II cardiac rehabilitation.

      This study will evaluate early efficacy and evaluate the cognitive processes as intervention
      response variables. Investigators will also examine the relationships between emotion
      regulation and other cognitive processes and symptoms (threat and stress, cognition and
      motivation), and symptoms [depression, anxiety, pain, sleep, and fatigue]) among rural
      dwelling adults enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation after a first myocardial infarction.

    <description>The eMotion intervention is based on feasibility testing of the successful in-person program with critical refinement to improve accessibility. eMotion has undergone subsequent content validity testing with intervention development, self-management, cardiovascular health, and health information technology delivery experts. eMotion teaches a carefully selected repertoire of emotion regulation strategies well suited for aging rural adults following a first cardiac event in tandem with usual cardiac rehabilitation. The intervention helps patients recognize their emotions, balance emotional and physical wellbeing, and implement emotion regulation strategies effectively.</description>

    <description>Content is delivered within the context of emotion provoking situations common in those recovering from a first MI and in maintaining MVPA. The new on-demand access to asynchronous content sessions provides didactic presentation of video and written material based on weekly needs assessments. Weekly scheduled synchronous video chat sessions, led by a nurse interventionist, will provide further individualization and application of content materials.</description>
