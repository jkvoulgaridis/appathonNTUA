  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised control trial to look at the impact of a digital tool, which uses
      relaxation and mindfullness based cognitive therapy, for twelve days on those who have
      prolonged mental distress from being admitted with Covid-19 during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2
      epidemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies that have looked at the psychological impact of being admitted with
      COVID-19 during the pandemic. It is important that the long-term wellbeing of patients who
      have been admitted is addressed. A newly published meta-analysis (Rogers et al 2020) has
      looked at both the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric consequences from the SARS and MERS
      outbreaks, showing increased risks of anxiety, depression and PTSD in both acutely and longer
      term. Excluding usual psychiatric services and some specialist ITU step down services, no
      interventions across the country have been set up to address the long-term psychological
      impacts of COVID-19.

      This is a randomised control study looking at a digital psychological tool versus current
      treatment practises. It is not a blinded study. The null hypothesis is that patients admitted
      with COVID-19 who are given a digital psychological tool do not experience any benefit to
      their mental well-being.

      Patients who were discharged during the peak of the pandemic, April 2020, will be contacted 2
      months post discharged and a screening survey will assess their level of psychological
      distress. Those suffering symptoms of anxiety or PTSD will be invited to participate in the
      trial which involves 12 days of an intervention with short and long term follow up using
      validated anxiety, depression and PTSD scales.

    <time_frame>Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>Generalised anxiety disorder score (GAD-7) scale. Score 0-21, with a higher score associated with greater anxiety symptoms. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. GAD-7 score at baseline will be controlled for.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression as measured by the patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 days and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a screening tool for the identification of depressive disorders, which has been validated for use in primary care. Each of the nine items in the questionnaire is based on the DSM diagnostic criteria for clinical depression. The PHQ-9 is scored out of 27 according to severity, where score of 5-9 indicates mild depression, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, and 20 or above severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trauma as measured by Trauma screening questionnaire (TSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Trauma screening questionnaire (TSQ) is a 10 point scale used to identify symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with a score between 0 and 10, with a score of 6 or higher scored as positive.</description>
