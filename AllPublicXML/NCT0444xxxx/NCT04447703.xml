      This trial performs user testing of a mobile-friendly patient history collection and genetic
      education tool to improve healthcare providers' understanding of prostate cancer genetic
      testing. This trial also compares traditional genetic counseling versus a web-based genetic
      education (WBGE) tool to provide information about genetic testing to men with prostate
      cancer. The WBGE tool has educational modules on genetic counseling and testing, as well as a
      patient history collection tool to help providers learn which patients may carry genetic
      mutations and may be considered for genetic counseling and genetic testing. The purpose of
      this research is to use technology to deliver information on genetic testing for prostate
      cancer to patients to help them decide whether or not to receive genetic testing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform user-testing of an education and patient history collection mobile tool among
      medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and urologists across study practice settings,
      including Veterans Affairs to address genetic referrals needs (n=10 providers).
      (Provider-focused)

      II. Develop multimedia web-based pretest genetic education (WBGE) tool and conduct a
      randomized trial of traditional genetic counseling (GC) (Arm 1) versus (vs.) WBGE (Arm 2) for
      informed and timely uptake of genetic testing for men with lethal/predicted lethal prostate
      cancer (PCA). (Patient-focused)

      OUTLINE:

      ARM I (TRADITIONAL GENETIC COUNSELING): Patients receive genetic counseling with a certified
      genetic counselor in-person, by telehealth, or over the phone (according to patient
      preference). Patients may then undergo genetic testing.

      ARM II (WEB-BASED GENETIC EDUCATION): Patients receive a link to the web-based genetic
      education tool online including all elements of genetic counseling in written modules and in
      a series of professional videos. Patients may then undergo genetic testing. Patients may
      cross-over to Arm I to see a genetic counselor.

      After the completion of study, patients are followed up yearly for up to 5 years.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the target population can use the tool in the way it was intended (i.e. to perform patient history collection to determine consideration for germline testing). To evaluate, we will collect initial information from participants regarding their experience with the guidelines for genetic testing and how they collect data on family history. Will evaluate the participants' mental model for germline testing and how they identify suitable candidates before and after interaction with the tool.</description>

    <measure>Decisional Conflict (Aim II)</measure>

    <description>Will capture men's satisfaction with each arm using the Satisfaction with Genetic Counseling Scale at the end of the pre-test genetic counseling or after viewing the web tool. This 6-item scale includes questions such as &quot;My genetic counselor seemed to understand the stresses I was facing,&quot; and &quot;The genetic counseling session was valuable to me&quot; rated on a 5-point Likert Scale (Cronbach's alpha 0.7-0.88). The questions will be adapted for web-based pretest genetic education such as &quot;This web tool addressed all of the concerns I had&quot; or &quot;The web tool was valuable to me&quot;.</description>
