  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research trial is studying a combination of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT), immunotherapy
      (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy for lymph node-positive, triple negative (TN) or hormone
      receptor positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Radiation Therapy (RT)

        -  Immunotherapy: Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)

        -  Chemotherapies:

             -  Paclitaxel

             -  Doxorubicin (also called Adriamycin)

             -  Cyclophosphamide

             -  Carboplatin (optional, and in TN only)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out what is the best dose of preoperative RT when
      combined with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The study will assess if combining the RT with
      the immunotherapy agent, pembrolizumab, will increase the ability of the immune system to
      destroy cancer cells.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment,
      including evaluations and follow-up visits.

      The study aims to assess the effectiveness of pembrolizumab (study drug) with or without RT
      directed to the breast tumor. Participants will then undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      pembrolizumab, followed by standard of-care treatment that can consist of one or more of the
      following:

        -  Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and axillary surgery

        -  Adjuvant radiation to the entire breast or chest wall, plus or minus the lymph nodes
           after surgery

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy

        -  Hormone therapy

      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups. Neither the participant not the research
      doctor will choose the group that the participant is assigned to. However, the participant
      will be notified of the group prior to the start of study treatment. Participants will
      receive study treatment for up to 7 months. Participants will be followed for 2 years after
      the end of the study treatment.

      It is expected that a total of 120 people will be participating in total.

      This research study is a randomized, phase II study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab for your specific disease, but it has been approved for
      other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the chemotherapies being
      used in this study (Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin,

             pneumonitis.

          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with

             detected). Note: Testing for hepatitis B or hepatitis C is not required, unless
             mandated by local health authorities or institutional guidelines.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the first dose
             of study treatment (see Appendix A). If the urine test cannot be confirmed as
             negative, a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be
             excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.

          -  Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies:Use of immunosuppressants and/or systemic
             corticosteroids is exclusionary, except the following in the absence of active

               -  As premedication for chemotherapy

               -  For the prevention of nausea in the three days following chemotherapy

               -  Participants are permitted the use of corticosteroids with minimal systemic
                  absorption (e.g. topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal and inhaled)

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or
                  equivalent permitted

               -  Adrenal replacement steroid doses including doses &gt;10 mg daily prednisone is
                  permitted

               -  A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g. CT
                  scan premedication against contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of
                  non-autoimmune conditions (e.g. delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by
                  a contact allergen is permitted (used in the management of cancer or
                  non-cancer-related illnesses). However, use of corticosteroids is allowed for the
                  treatment of immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs), or adrenal insufficiency.

               -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases
                  within 4 weeks prior to first dose of pembrolizumab.
