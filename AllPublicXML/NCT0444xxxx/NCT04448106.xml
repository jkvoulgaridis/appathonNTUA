    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 open-label, 6 arms (1 study group and 1 control group for each joint
      category), randomized control group clinical study with 300 subjects diagnosed with
      osteoarthritis of knees (n=100), hips (n=100) and shoulders (n=100). The study subjects will
      be evaluated for disease-associated severity according to symptoms, such as pain, mobility,
      daily active life, and functions using arthritis society established specific measurement
      tools related to the joints (KOOS and KSS for OA-knees: HOOS and HHS for OA-hips and ASES and
      CSS for OA-shoulders).
