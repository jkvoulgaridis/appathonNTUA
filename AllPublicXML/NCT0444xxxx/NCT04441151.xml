      Objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of lung rehabilitation on
      patients treated with high flow humidification apparatus in ICU. Methods: 70 patients in ICU
      who were treated with high flow humidification apparatus from June 2019 to June 2020 were
      randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was treated with pulmonary
      rehabilitation and the control group was treated with routine medical treatment only. All
      patients were evaluated and measured by bedside diaphragm ultrasound. The vital signs of all
      patients were monitored every day. MRCsum assessment of peripheral muscle strength, 30s
      sitting test, modified Barthel index, Borg dyspnea score, arterial blood gas analysis and
      bedside diaphragm ultrasound monitoring were performed at admission and discharge. Finally,
      statistics were made on the use of non-invasive ventilator, endotracheal intubation, new
      complications (pressure sore, aspiration, thrombus, etc.) and the time of patients getting
      out of bed for the first time.The end point of the experiment was 28 days.
