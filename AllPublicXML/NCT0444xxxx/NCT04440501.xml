      1. Specific Aim (1) is to assess both the immediate and longer term impact of VIRTUE on the
           patient's GFD knowledge compared to standard of care (SOC) dietary education.

        2. Specific Aim (2) is to determine the impact of VIRTUE on patient QoL, symptomatology,
           and Celiac biomarkers (tissue transglutaminase antibodies, deamidated gliadin peptide
           IgA, deamidated gliadin peptide IgG, and total serum IgA).

    <textblock>
      The global burden of Celiac Disease (CD) is estimated to be 1% in Western countries and
      0.7-1.4% of the global population.The only treatment for CD is a strict, lifelong Gluten Free
      Diet (GFD). However, dietary adherence is the main barrier against disease control. Whereas
      experiential learning, learning through experience, has been associated with greater impact
      in achieving desired nutritional outcomes in pediatric populations. Replicating the
      environments in which patients would make food choices in clinic is not feasible.

      Previous research, in addition to our preliminary results indicate that Virtual reality (VR)
      may act as an effective precursor to the real world by providing a safe and immersive
      learning environment. As such, the investigators seek to investigate how VR use to Teach,
      Improve Outcomes, and Engage (VIRTUE) will affect patient GFD knowledge, QoL, symptoms, and
      CD biomarkers. The central hypothesis will tested through the following specific aims:

        1. Specific Aim (1) is to assess the immediate and long-term impact of VIRTUE on children's
           GFD knowledge compared to SOC education. We hypothesize that VIRTUE with SOC education,
           will improve children's GFD knowledge by 10-20%, opposed to SOC alone

        2. Specific Aim (2) is to determine the impact of VIRTUE on patient QoL. We hypothesize
           that VIRTUE with SOC education, will improve children's QoL scores, opposed to SOC
           alone.

        3. Specific Aim (3) is to determine the impact of VIRTUE on decline of CD biomarkers
           (tissue transglutaminase antibodies and deamidated gliadin peptide IgG). We hypothesize
           that VIRTUE with SOC education, will reduce levels of CD biomarkers faster, compared to
           SOC alone.

This group will receive VIRTUE, and watch a VR educational video, and play Chaos CafeÃÅ, which will be administered by a research team member. This group will be prescribed to take home the VIRTUE headset and play modules for 15 minutes per week until the 6-8 month follow up.
The VIRTUE technology will track frequency of game playing to control for adherence to the prescription.</description>
