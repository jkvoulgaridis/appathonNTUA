  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment represents the standard approach for resectable
      locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The incidence of pulmonary infection and
      other perioperative complications were higher in patients who received esophagectomy and
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy than those without neoadjuvant treatment and surgery patients.
      However, reliable clinical data can quantify the damage degree of immunologic function caused
      by chemotherapy and radiotherapy is still unknown. This project regards the level of
      lymphocyte and immunocyte in peripheral blood as a quantitative index to reflect the dynamic
      change of the immunologic function of patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment. Meanwhile, the investigators will
      also investigate the relationship between the level of lymphocyte and immunocyte in
      peripheral blood and the response rate of neoadjuvant therapy.

      Peripheral blood will be collected from patients who will undergo esophagectomy and/or
      neoadjuvant therapy. The setting time is before chemoradiotherapy, finishing
      chemoradiotherapy, pre-operation, postoperative day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7. These blood
      samples will be used for detection and analysis in lymphocyte and immunocyte by flow
      cytometry.
