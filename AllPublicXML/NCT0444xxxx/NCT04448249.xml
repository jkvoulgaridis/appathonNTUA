  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most frequent chronic pathology in France and in the world. It is one of
      the main modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In France, 50% of treated hypertensives are
      uncontrolled and only 30% of treated patients are fully adherent to their antihypertensive
      treatment. Poor adherence to drug treatments is considered as one of the main causes of
      non-control of hypertension. Since 2018, a new profession has entered the French healthcare
      system: Advanced Practice Nurses (APN). They have many broad skills, at the interface of
      nursing and medical exercises. The purpose of this interventional study is to assess the
      impact of APN on blood pressure (BP) control in the context of usual care of hypertension
      thanks to a better adhesion of patients and a better therapeutic alliance. The hypothesis
      formulated is that an individual APN intervention, included in a usual hypertension
      management, improves BP control.

    <description>APN intervention is divided into five main steps:
clinical and paraclinical examinations,
appraisal of patient's knowledge,
health education on hypertension and treatments,
setting a written medication plan with the patient to invest him in his management with adjusting or renewing treatments identically if necessary,
decision-making balance between the benefits and risks of non-adherence to medication. A time is scheduled at the end of the intervention to let the patient ask questions or express his difficulties if he needs to.</description>
