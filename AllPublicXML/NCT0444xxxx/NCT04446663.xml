  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel controlled, phase IIa exploratory study that evaluates the
      efficacy and safety of Toripalimab (PD-1 Antibody) combined with induction chemotherapy
      （Albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin ）and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and explores the biomarkers that can predict the efficacy and
      toxicity of the treatment.

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The change of QoL from randomization to 12 months after chemoradiation. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30）version 3.0 will be used. This questionnaire comprises 30 questions, 24 of which are aggregated into nine multi-question scales, that is, five functioning scales (e.g., physical), three symptom scales (e.g., fatigue) and one global health status scale. The remaining six single-question (e.g., dyspnoea) scales assess symptoms. These 15 scales will be scored according to the official Scoring Manual: 1. Estimate the average of the questions that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score. 2. Use a linear transformation to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning, a high score for the global health status represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of problems.</description>
