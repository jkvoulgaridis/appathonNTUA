  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Mature T-cell malignancies (TCM) are rare and heterogeneous group of leukemias and
           lymphomas accounting for 5 to 10% of all lymphomas in the US

        -  Patients with systemic TCM are most commonly treated with a CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)-like regimens, that produce long-term
           progression-free survival in about 30% of these cases

        -  Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) TCM have very poor prognosis with median overall
           survival of less than 1 year. Treatment options for R/R TCM are very few and of limited
           efficacy, thus novel treatment strategies are urgently needed.

        -  Mutations in epigenetic regulators are common in aggressive TCMs and standard treatment
           with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as romidepsin show modest clinical
           activity with single agent the overall response (ORR) around 25%

        -  Combination of romidepsin and 5-azacitidine (hypomethylating agents) was synergistic in
           preclinical models, and has demonstrated high clinical activity with an ORR of 79%

        -  Many TCMs rely on The Ikaros-dependent NF-kB/IRF4 signaling pathway to maintain
           proliferation, which is why lenalidomide, which induces degradation of Ikaros and
           downregulates IRF4, has single agent activity in R/R TCM with ORR of 26% to 42%,
           depending on the subtype.

        -  Lenalidomide synergizes with romidepsin and enhances tumor cell death in TCM cell lines,
           predicting that the addition of lenalidomide to the established romidepsin/ CC-486 (5-
           azacitidine) combination will further improve efficacy.

      Objectives:

      To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      four-drug combination of CC-486 (5-azacitidine), romidepsin, lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      in patients with TCM

      Eligibility:

        -  Refractory/relapsed TCM defined as follows:

             -  Patients with systemic disease

             -  Have received at least one line of prior therapy

             -  Must have received brentuximab vedotin if the disease is anaplastic large cell
                lymphoma or CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 (or less than or equal to 3 if
           decrease is due to the disease)

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory mature TCM

        -  Adequate organ and marrow function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, uncontrolled Phase 1 study

        -  '3 + 3' design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated lenalidomide with
           fixed dose of romidepsin and CC-486 (5-azacitidine)

        -  An expansion cohort of 9 patients will be evaluated at the MTD

        -  Maximum 6 cycles (21-day cycle) of combination therapy

        -  To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, the
           accrual ceiling will be set at 30 patients

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have relapsed after or progressed during at least one line of prior
             systemic therapy (which may include allogeneic stem cell transplantation) for mature T

             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis),
             celiac disease (i.e., sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or any other
             gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption,

             to New York Heart Association Classification Class II), congenital long QT syndrome,
             or other serious cardiac arrhythmia including 2nd degree atrio-ventricular (AV) block
             type II, 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardia (ventricular rate less than 50
             beats/min).

          -  Hypertrophic cardiomegaly or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior treatment or other
             causes.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e., blood pressure (BP) of greater than or equal to
             160/95; patients who have a history of hypertension controlled by medication must be
             on a stable dose (for at least one month) and meet all other inclusion criteria.

          -  Triplicate average baseline QTcF interval greater than or equal to 480 ms

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including psychiatric conditions such
             as recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or
             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
             lenalidomide is a Class X agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.
