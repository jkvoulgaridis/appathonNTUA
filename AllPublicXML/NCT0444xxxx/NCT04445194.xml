    <textblock>
      In this trial, a total of 50 subjects were recruited; the test vaccines were divided into 3
      groups, low-dose vaccine groups, high-dose vaccine groups, and placebo groups. The
      first-stage randomized participants in the low-dose group (20 cases) and the placebo group (5
      cases) were evaluated for 7 days. After the 7-day safety data was evaluated and agreed by the
      DSMB, the second-stage study was conducted. Into the high-dose group (20 cases) and placebo
      group (5 cases) subjects; follow-up to 30 days, after the safety assessment by the
      investigator and consent, then inoculate the second dose. Observation was performed for 1.0
      hour after the second dose. The researchers conducted a safety evaluation and agreed to
      follow-up after discharge.

      In this trial, all adverse events (AE), all AEs from 0-7 days, and all AEs from 8-30 days
      will be collected 30 minutes after each dose, and all AEs will be collected from the first
      dose to 30 days after the entire vaccination, and the first dose will be inoculated to the
      full course All serious adverse events (SAE) 6 months after vaccination.
