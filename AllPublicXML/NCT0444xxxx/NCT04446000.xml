      This phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single ascending doses of
      CSL730 administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection or SC infusion in healthy adult subjects.

    <ipd_description>CSL will consider requests to share Individual Patient Data (IPD) from systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers. For information on the process and requirements for submitting a voluntary data sharing request for IPD, please contact CSL at clinicaltrials@cslbehring.com.
Applicable country specific privacy and other laws and regulations will be considered and may prevent sharing of IPD.
If the request is approved and the researcher has executed an appropriate data sharing agreement, IPD that has been appropriately anonymized will be available.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>IPD requests may be submitted to CSL no earlier than 12 months after publication of the results of this study via an article made available on a public website.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Requests may only be made by systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers whose proposed use of the IPD is non-commercial in nature and has been approved by an internal review committee.
An IPD request will not be considered by CSL unless the proposed research question seeks to answer a significant and unknown medical science or patient care question as determined by CSL's internal review committee.
The requesting party must execute an appropriate data sharing agreement before IPD will be made available.</ipd_access_criteria>
