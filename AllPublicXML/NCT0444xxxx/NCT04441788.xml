    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase 2a study of
      ION-827359 in up to 180 participants. The participants will be randomized to receive oral
      inhalation of either ION-827359 or placebo for up to 13 weeks. At the end of 13 weeks,
      participants will enter a 10-week post-treatment evaluation period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the Primary Time Point in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Compared to Placebo</measure>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the EXACT Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) Daily Symptom Diary to the Primary Time Point</measure>
    <time_frame>One week prior to first dose through one week after the last dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The EXACT (E-RS) scale is a participant-reported outcome (PRO) designed to measure the symptoms of participants with COPD. The E-RS utilizes 11 respiratory symptom items from the existing and validated 14-item EXACT, which measures symptoms of exacerbation. The E-RS total score quantifies respiratory symptom severity, and 3 domains assess breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms. The E-RS will be collected on the daily e-diary, which will include all 14 items from the EXACT questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) to the Week 14 Time Point</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is an eight-item questionnaire that will be completed by the participant and is designed to quantify the impact of COPD symptoms on the health status of participants. The CAT provides a score of 0-40 to indicate the impact of the disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to the Week 14 Time Point</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a participant completed, a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in participants with obstructive airway disease. Scores of the SGRQ-C range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>
