      Continuous feeding is the most popular enteral feeding mode in the ICU because of its lower
      nursing burden and theoretically better intestinal toleration. However, continuous feeding is
      nonphysiological. We proposed a feeding mode called sequential feeding, as it utilizes a
      combination of continuous feeding in the beginning, time-restricted feeding in the second
      stage, and oral feeding at last.

      The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health due to its many useful functions.
      Not only dietary structure but also eating mode (eating time for example) influenced the gut
      microbiota in a healthy population. Therefore, we think this new feeding mode, sequential
      feeding, also has different influences on gut microbiota and metabolomics in critically ill
      patients compared to continuous feeding.

      Nutrition is an important part of therapy for critically ill patients. Continuous feeding is
      the most popular enteral feeding mode in the ICU because of its lower nursing burden and
      theoretically better intestinal toleration. However, continuous feeding is nonphysiological.
      In our opinion, feeding mode should be changed according to gastrointestinal function and
      disease progression; one singe feeding mode is not always suitable for critically ill
      patients. We proposed a feeding mode called sequential feeding, as it utilizes a combination
      of continuous feeding in the beginning, time-restricted feeding in the second stage, and oral
      feeding at last.

      The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health due to its many useful functions,
      such as metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and maintenance of the intestinal barrier and immune
      system. Not only dietary structure but also eating mode (eating time for example) influenced
      the gut microbiota in a healthy population. Therefore, we think this new feeding mode,
      sequential feeding, also has different influences on gut microbiota and metabolomics in
      critically ill patients compared to continuous feeding.

    <description>At the beginning, all the patients received continuous feeding. After achieving ≥80% of the nutrition target calories (25-30 kcal/kg/d) through continuous feeding, the patients were randomly assigned into the sequential feeding (SF) group or the continuous feeding (CF) group with a random number table. Patients in the CF group received continuous feeding with constant velocity by enteral feeding pump over one day.</description>

After achieving ≥80% of the nutrition target calories (25-30 kcal/kg/d) through continuous feeding, the patients were randomly assigned into the sequential feeding (SF) group or the continuous feeding (CF) group with a random number table. In the SF group, continuous feeding was changed into time-restricted feeding. The total daily dosage of enteral nutrition was equally distributed during three time periods at 7-9:00, 11-13:00 and 17-19:00. Other times of the day were fasting times. Enteral nutritional suspension in each time period was administered at a uniform rate within two hours by an enteral feeding pump.</description>
