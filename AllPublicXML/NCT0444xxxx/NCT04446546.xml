  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular access creation in patients with renal failure requiring long-term hemodialysis can
      be a challenge when there is no more autologous material or in case of infection, in a
      population undergoing long term dialysis with a longer life-expectancy. Many types of grafts
      have been used, with its advantages and drawbacks, such as prosthetic grafts (PTFE). Over the
      past decade, surgeons have used cold stored venous allografts as a biological conduit for
      hemodialysis, with the idea of avoiding most of major complications including a lower
      incidence of infection and steal syndrome, with patencies at least equivalent to PTFE. There
      is only a few data in the litterature, but many surgical teams use it when there is no
      autologous material or in case of infection.

      The aim of the study is to give the primary patency of vascular access with this technique,
      and to assess its long term outcomes.
