  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The original implant treatment protocol recommended that the implant should be placed in a
      fully healed site and covered with mucosa after placement to ensure osseointegration. The
      reason was to protect the implant site from bacterial contamination and to avoid loading of
      the implant. After that, a second stage surgical procedure had to be performed to expose the
      implant to connect the abutment. However, it was shown that a one stage or non-submerged (NS)
      approach can lead to successful and predictable outcomes.

      Customized healing abutments can be used in the non-submerged protocol, protecting and
      containing the bone substitute during healing, preserving the alveolar contour, preventing
      food impaction, and eliminating the need for a second stage surgery and. By means of this
      technique, critical and subcritical contours can be projected speeding up the peri-implant
      soft tissue conditioning phase in order to achieve final natural-like restorations.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare the clinical and radiographic hard and soft
      tissue changes using chairside customized healing abutment versus submerged healing following
      immediate implant placement in mandibular molars through measuring the horizontal ridge
      changes by CBCT , the crestal bone loss by a standardized digital x-ray and the soft tissue
      changes by the pink esthetic score (PES).

      Immediate implant placement in extraction sockets was used to (i) reduce the number of
      surgical procedures (ii) preserve the dimensions of the alveolar ridge and (iii) reduce the
      interval between the removal of the tooth and the insertion of the implant supported
      restoration.

      Flapless extraction is a technique aimed towards leaving the periosteum undisturbed by
      extracting the tooth with minimal trauma using periotomes without flap reflection. They also
      found less crestal bone loss around immediate implants placed in flapless extraction sockets
      in compared to implants placed by elevating a flap, due to greater blood supply and less
      postoperative swelling and pain.

      Submerged healing and absence of loading was proposed during the early stage of
      osseointegration. Such a two-stage approach, based on a period of submerged healing aimed at
      optimizing the process of new bone formation and remodeling that follows implant placement is
      considered the gold standard procedure. It requires a second surgery to connect the abutment.
      This second surgical procedure is generally a minor one; thus, it is not particularly
      uncomfortable for the patient and offers the possibility to perform soft tissue management
      procedures around healed implants which may result in a better long-term prognosis. On the
      other hand, the desire to provide faster and less invasive treatment to patients, as well as
      to avoid postponing implant load and prosthesis delivery, has led to one-stage surgery
      (non-submerged healing). In this approach the implant and the healing abutment are placed in
      a single procedure so it remains exposed in the oral cavity during the osseointegration
      period.

      The provisional restoration or a custom abutment can act as a &quot;prosthetic socket-sealing&quot; to
      protect, contain and maintain the blood clot and bone-graft material during the healing phase
      of treatment.

      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic hard
      and soft tissue changes using chairside customized healing abutment versus submerged healing
      following immediate implant placement in mandibular molars.

    <description>Patients will receive an immediate implant with customized healing abutment
Atraumatic extraction without flap elevation using periotomes and elevators then sectioning of the roots will be performed to preserve the interseptal bone.
The drilling will be performed starting from the pilot drill in the interseptal bone to the twisting drills according to the manufacturer's instructions to the selected implant size. The implant is to be placed immediately then the insertion torque will be measured using a torque wrench. In order to place the customized healing abutment, the insertion torque should be more than 25 ncm.
The gap distance will be filled by xenograft, a plastic abutment will be screwed in place then a flowable composie resin will be applied around into small amounts and cured to take the soft tissue contour then finishing and polishing of the customized healing abutment will be done.</description>
