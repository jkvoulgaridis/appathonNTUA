    <textblock>
      This study aims a determine the effect that the addition of REGENETEN Bioinductive Implant
      has on Supraspinatus Tendon Repair. 120 patients will be included in this prospective,
      randomized, parallel group study.

    <textblock>
      The rotator cuff tear is one of the most frequent pathologies in the shoulder joint. When
      there are many symptoms these breaks are repaired surgically. The success rate of healing of
      these injuries is between 30% and 80%. In two recent studies conducted at two of the centers
      participating in this trial, the success rate of repair was 75% (unpublished data) and 70%
      respectively.

      The use of high porosity resorbable bovine collagen meshes as bioinductive scaffolds for cuff
      repair seems to be a valid alternative when trying to improve the success rate in the healing
      of rotator cuff injuries.

      REGENETEN Bioinductive Implant (a high porosity reconstituted type I collagen mesh of bovine
      origin) is applied to the repaired tendon. In a pilot study of 9 subjects with full thickness
      supraspinatus ruptures who underwent tendon repair and subsequently had the implant
      associated with the rupture, a significant clinical improvement was observed after one year
      and was observed on magnetic resonance imaging ( RM) 100% healing of breaks. In a study of 33
      subjects with partial thickness tears treated with the implant alone, improvement in MRI
      characteristics of the tendon was observed in 31 cases. There is a study that performs a
      histological analysis of samples obtained in 7 subjects in whom the implant was used. No
      evidence of foreign body reaction or inflammatory reaction was observed. In none of the three
      studies where said implant was used in humans were any complications or adverse effects
      related to the use of said implant observed.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect that the addition of REGENETEN bovine
      collagen mesh has on tendon repair on MRI performed one year after surgery.

      The study does not in itself pose a greater risk than the usual practice for the patient,
      since in these subjects where the implant could be used as a supplement to the repair, having
      already obtained the CE marking.

    <measure>Integrity of the tendon repaired in an MRI study one year after the intervention using the Sugaya classification (Sugaya H (2005)).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a classification system described by Sugaya et al. which uses magnetic resonance imaging in order to evaluate tendon integrity after rotator cuff repair. Postoperative cuff integrity is classified into 5 categories: type I, sufficient thickness with homogenously low intensity; type II, sufficient thickness with partial high intensity; type III, insufficient thickness without discontinuity; type IV, presence of minor discontinuity; type V, presence of major discontinuity</description>

    <description>The Constant-Murley Shoulder Score is a scoring method used by clinicians to assess function of the shoulder. The score is on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being no shoulder function and 100 being excellent function.</description>

    <measure>Functional changes, measured with ASES questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) questionnaire was developed to provide a standardized method for evaluating shoulder function and has been validated in patients with any array of shoulder pathologies. The range is from 0 to 100, with 0 being worst, and 100 being best.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life measured with EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The Euro Quality of Life Five Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire consists of two parts: a descriptive system and a Visual Analogue Scale.
The descriptive system describes the health state and consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Patients who reported problems were then categorized into two categories, a &quot;has no problem&quot; category (health state code of 1) and &quot;has problem&quot; category (health state code of 2-5) for each level of each dimension.
The second part of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is the EQ-VAS, which is a thermometer-like scale (ranging from 0 to 100) that reflects the patient's health in general. EQ-VAS represents the patient perspective, where 0 indicates the worst imaginable health state and 100 reflects the best imaginable health state.</description>
