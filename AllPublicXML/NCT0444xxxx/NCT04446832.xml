  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatic disease, and especially cirrhosis, are associated to a global dysfunction of
      the immune system. Liver transplantation represents the only replacement therapy for
      end-stage liver disease and a curative means of localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but
      required immunosuppressive treatment to limit the risk of rejection. Candidates for liver
      transplantation are at an increased risk for severe infections, some of which can be
      prevented by vaccination. With regard to vaccine preventable diseases, these patients share
      the same pitfalls than all immunocompromised individuals: i) a theoretical or proven
      increased incidence and severity of certain infections warranting specific vaccine
      recommendations; ii) a decrease in immunogenicity of vaccine; iii) a risk of developing
      vaccine disease after administration of live attenuated vaccines. It is therefore recommended
      for all patients awaiting liver transplantation: i) updating the vaccinations recommended in
      general population (DTPw, MMR); ii) vaccination against viral hepatitis A and B to limit the
      risk of severe hepatitis; iii) vaccination against pneumococcal infection, influenza and
      chickenpox more common and more serious in this population. However, these recommendations
      are based on theoretical assessments and experts opinions; i) immunogenicity of vaccination
      in cirrhotic patients and persistence of post-transplant protection had been poorly assessed
      as well as their determinants; ii) there are only a few data regarding the tolerance of
      vaccinations in this population; iii) vaccination coverage of patients with end-stage liver
      disease is poorly known in France and; iv) the perception and acceptability of vaccinations
      have not been evaluated in this population.

      Investigators hypothesis is that: the vaccination schedule currently recommended for liver
      transplantation does not provide adequate protection against vaccine targets 6 months after
      liver transplantation.
