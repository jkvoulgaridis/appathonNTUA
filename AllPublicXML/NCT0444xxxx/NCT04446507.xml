    <textblock>
      A total of 32 participants will be enrolled:

      Group 1 (Severe renal impairment not on HD, eGFR &lt;30) - 16 subjects Subjects will be enrolled
      and dosed consecutively (i.e. first 8 subjects of group 1 will receive 2 mg dose, followed by
      another 8 subjects who will receive 4 mg dose).

      Group 2 (Normal renal function eGFR ≥90) - 16 subjects Subjects in this group will be matched
      according to age (± 10 years), sex, and weight (± 10 kg) with participants in Group 1 (Severe
      renal impairment not on HD) on a one to one basis based on demographic characteristic. In
      this group, 8 participants will be administered single dose of 2 mg Saroglitazar Magnesium
      and 8 participants will be administered single dose of 4 mg Saroglitazar Magnesium.

             ICF.

          3. Participants will be classified at screening by renal function as determined by the
             modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula for estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (eGFR) in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Classification
             will be repeated at Day -1, if the renal function classification for the participant
             is not the same at the two time points, enrollment of the participant will be based on
             eGFR at screening.

          4. Group 2 (Normal renal function) subjects, should be in good health as determined by no
             clinically significant deviations from normal for medical history, physical

             examinations at screening or Day-1.

          5. Group 1 (Severe renal impairment not on HD, eGFR &lt;30) subjects, may have medical
             findings consistent with their degree of renal impairment, as determined by medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory examinations
             at screening and Day -1. Participants are eligible if abnormal findings are considered
             not clinically significant by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant, unstable medical condition or other instability that would prevent

             designee.

          2. History of malignancy of any type in the last 3 years of screening, with the exception
             of the following: in situ cervical or breast cancer or surgically excised non-melanoma

          3. History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection within the six months prior to
             screening that would potentially alter absorption and/or excretion of orally
             administered drugs (uncomplicated appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair
             will be allowed).

          5. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of asymptomatic gallstones) or other hepatic abnormalities that in
             the opinion of the investigator would preclude the subject from participation in the
             study.

          6. Any major surgery within 3 months of screening.

          7. Donation of blood or blood products within 3 months prior to screening.
