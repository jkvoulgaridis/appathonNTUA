  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of using a mobile ABMT application as a treatment
      modality in the Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis population. Participants will be asked to
      undergo one hour-long baseline evaluation, followed by at-home ABMT application sessions.
      Subjects will complete online REDCap or MyCap surveys weekly and at the end of the study.

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals will be categorized as &quot;compliant&quot; if they interact with the mobile ABMT a minimum of 3 times per week for a minimum of three of the four weeks across the study period of 30 days. We will consider reaching 50% of compliant participants to indicate that the intervention is feasible for continued study. Descriptive analyses will be completed to identify any trends in predicting those participants who are most likely to be compliant (ie. age, gender, baseline function).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preliminary efficacy composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators convert performance at baseline and study end across study measures SCARED P/C,CDI-II, MASC-2, BDI-II, BAI, and PANAS to scaled age normative scores. Differences in scaled scores, indicating change following intervention, will be calculated for each compliant participant (defined as above) and averaged for group metrics. Descriptive analyses will be completed to identify any trends in predicting those participants who are most likely to have improvement in anxiety and mood at study end (ie., age, gender, baseline function) as well as corresponding degree of use of the mobile ABMT with magnitude of benefit.</description>

    <description>After consent/assent, participants will complete 1 hour-long, in-person or remote, baseline study visit at the Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. During this visit, participants will complete baseline study surveys and a brief computerized attention bias assessment and be trained on the use of the ABMT mobile application. Participants will then complete at-home game play 4 days a week, for 30 days, using an iOS mobile device, approximately 10-15 minutes each day. Subjects will complete weekly online study surveys via REDCap or MyCap (Mobile REDCap Application). At the conclusion of participation, participants will complete online end of study surveys via REDCap or MyCap.
Parents of participants will complete surveys at the baseline visit, followed by online surveys at Week 2 and at the end of study. For participants who are 18 years old or older, parental participation will not be required.</description>
