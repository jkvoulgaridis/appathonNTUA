  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if patients with lower extremity wounds in rural
      communities who undergo specialty referral through telemedicine have expedited care compared
      to patients who are treated through standard in person referral.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clustered trial where patients identified as having lower extremity ulcers with
      peripheral artery disease and diabetes are given the option to be seen by specialty care
      providers through telemedicine vs. normal standard in person referral. The study is being
      conducted in rural areas where there are no in person vascular surgery providers. The aim of
      the study is to determine if patient activation affects likelihood to use telemedicine and if
      use of telemedicine can expedite speciality care.
