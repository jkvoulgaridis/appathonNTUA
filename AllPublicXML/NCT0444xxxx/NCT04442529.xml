  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Qatar Mothers and Babies is a 4-year collaboration between Northwestern University Feinberg
      School of Medicine and Sidra Medicine in Doha, Qatar that will generate and evaluate a
      cultural and contextual adaptation of the Mothers and Babies intervention for pregnant
      Arabic-speaking women in Qatar. The study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of
      the adapted intervention as well as its effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes
      among pregnant women receiving prenatal care at Sidra Medicine in Doha. Additionally, given
      the high prevalence of diabetes among this study population, we are also interested in seeing
      if the Mothers and Babies interventions helps improve the management of this disease. Funded
      by the Qatar National Research Fund's National Priorities Research Program (NPRP), this
      project has the potential to guide future cultural adaptations of Mothers and Babies as well
      as other evidence-based interventions, as well as the delivery of Mothers and Babies to Arab
      and Arab-American women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression and anxiety are the two most common perinatal mental health disorders
      (mental health disorders occurring during pregnancy and the year after birth), with
      prevalence rates higher among women living in Qatar than in most western countries. The
      negative outcomes associated with postpartum depression and anxiety are profound, and include
      poor birth outcomes, poor parenting practices, and compromised infant and young child
      development. Although interventions exist to prevent postpartum depression and anxiety, to
      date there have been no studies that have attempted to prevent postpartum depression or
      anxiety among Arabic speaking women in the Middle East, including Qatar. This project brings
      together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians from Sidra Medicine (Qatar)
      and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine (USA) to conduct a first-of-its-kind
      study that examines the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes associated with an
      evidence-based postpartum depression interventionâ€”Mothers and Babies (MB). MB has been widely
      used in the USA and has been linguistically translated into Arabic and successfully delivered
      to Arab-American women. In Phase One of this project, we will culturally and contextually
      adapt Mothers and Babies to ensure its suitability for use with women residing in Qatar. In
      Phase Two, we will conduct a small pilot study that examines the acceptability,
      appropriateness, and feasibility of the adapted Mothers and Babies intervention.
      Specifically, we will deliver the adapted intervention to 10 women receiving prenatal care at
      Sidra Medicine. In Phase Three, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (n = 160) to
      determine the effectiveness of the adapted Mothers and Babies intervention on depressive
      symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and perceived stress among women receiving prenatal care at Sidra
      Medicine. As part of the randomized controlled trial, we will recruit a sub-group of 40 women
      with diabetes, given the high prevalence of diabetes among women in Qatar and the negative
      outcomes associated with diabetes on mother and child. We will explore whether the
      cognitive-behavioral techniques in Mothers and Babies are effective not only in promoting
      better mental health outcomes among this subgroup, but also better diabetes self-management.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Screening tool</time_frame>
    <description>For our primary outcome of depressive symptoms we will administer the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Scores are determined by participant self-report on screening questions. The total can range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Screening tool</time_frame>
    <description>For our primary outcome of anxiety symptoms we will administer the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7). Scores are determined by participant self-report on screening questions. The GAD-7 total score can range from 0-21 with higher scores indicating more anxiety symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>For our primary outcome of perceived stress, we will administer the Perceived Stress Scale 10-item version (PSS-10). Scores are determined by participant self-report at baseline and six-month follow-up. Scores range from 0-40 with higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Activation will be measured using the Behavioral Activation Depression Scale (BADS). The BADS assesses behaviors hypothesized to underlie depression and specifically targeted for change by behavioral activation strategies. It examines changes in the following areas: activation, avoidance/ rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. The BADS consists of 25 items, each rated on a seven point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). The range of the scale is 0-64. For the total scale, higher scores represent increased activation. The BADS has demonstrated strong internal consistency, construct validity, and predictive validity (Kanter et al, 2007; Kanter et al., 2009).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Mood regulation will be measured using the 30-item Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMRS) (Catanzaro &amp; Means, 1990). For each question, respondents use a 5-point scale to indicate what they believe they can do when they are disappointed or experiencing a negative mood. For our analyses, these items were averaged to create a mean NMRS score (range 1-5). Higher scores indicate a greater ability to regulate one's mood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be measured using the 19-item Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) (Sherbourne &amp; Stewart, 1991). This brief self-administered survey includes an overall functional social support index, as well as four functional support subscales: affectionate, emotional/informational, tangible, and positive social interaction. The range is 1-5 with greater scores indicating more perceived social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decentering Thoughts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome of Decentering will be measured using the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ) (Fresco et al., 2007). The EQ is a 20 item self-report scale designed to measure decentering and rumination, which has demonstrated strong internal consistency in a number of studies examining effects of interventions that incorporate cognitive restructuring techniques. Response choices are on a 1-5 scale. For the purposes of our analyses, we will create a mean EQ score (range 1-5), with higher scores indicating more decentering/rumination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes self-management</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome of Diabetes self-care will be assessed using the Summary of Diabetes Self-Management questionnaire. The tool contains 16 items, it is a reliable and valid instrument and enables an efficient assessment of self-care behaviors associated with glycemic control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Religious Coping- major life stressors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome of major life stressors ad religious coping will be assessed using the RCope. The tool contains 12 items of religious coping with major life stressors. It has helped contributing to the growth of knowledge about the religion roles that serve in the process of dealing with crisis, trauma, and transition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MB Skill Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Six-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is administered at the 6-month follow-up survey with higher scores indicating greater use of core MB skills in one's daily life. The instrument that will be utilized has been developed by the investigators.</description>
