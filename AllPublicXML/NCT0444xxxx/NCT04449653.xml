      OASIS: A mobile study to measure and predict lupus (SLE) disease activity using digital
      signals The OASIS study is exploring how patient reported data and digital biomarkers, like
      activity level and heart rate variability, can be used to predict changes in lupus disease
      activity. You may receive a Withings Steel HR smartwatch as part of this study. The purpose
      of this study is to look for factors that affect lupus disease activity and potentially
      predict lupus flares through non-clinical tests

    <description>Individuals who are diagnosed with System Lupus Erythematosus and consent to the study will be placed in this cohort. Upon enrollment they will be given the opportunity to invite a non-SLE-diagnosed friend to enroll in the study as a healthy control. These individuals will answer weekly questions and receive a smartwatch to measure their physical activity.</description>

        Lupus is more common by 3.5-fold among minority groups, e.g., African Americans, than it is
        among European- Americans.Additionally more than 90% of diagnosed cases of lupus are women.
        We anticipate significant enrollment of female gender and minority populations reflecting
        this racial and disparity in disease occurrence rates. Participants will be enrolled from
        across the United States, with no specific geographic locations being targeted or
        preferred.
