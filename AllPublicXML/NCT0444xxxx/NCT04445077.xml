  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The competence of care home staff in dementia care is highly influential to the quality of
      care that adversely affects both people living with dementia and staff and in Mainland China
      where knowledge on dementia among care home staff was generally poor and this area is
      under-researched. This study aims at developing a competency-based culturally-sensitive
      education program on dementia care for care home staff through literature review, qualitative
      study. And then a quasi-experiment design without random assignment will be conducted to
      evaluate the effects of this program on care home staff's sense of competence, knowledge,
      attitudes, and care approach related to dementia care and staff satisfaction with the
      intervention. Focus group interviews will be conducted to understand participants' experience
      about the education program after the intervention. This study is expected to provide an
      effective way to improve care homes staff's competence in dementia care thereby improve the
      quality of care.
