  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the acute effect of three isocaloric meals varying in level of
      food processing, including a whole foods, gluten-free, and highly processed meal on energy
      metabolism and blood glucose in 8-12 young adult, normal weight females. A secondary aim of
      this proposed study is to compare palatability, satiety, and perceived energy ratings among
      highly processed, unrefined, and gluten-free unrefined isocaloric meals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A shift towards a diet containing large quantities of highly processed foods is believed to
      be a major contributor to the trends in obesity. The degree of processing of foods often
      affects the nutritional content of the constituents. A reduction in macromolecular complexity
      allows for an increased rate of digestion, meaning that the body does not have to work as
      hard to metabolize high processed food products. Thus, the purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effect on energy metabolism and blood glucose after the consumption of an
      unrefined, whole foods meal versus two highly processed food meals, including a common
      Western style meal and gluten-free meal in 8-12 young adult, normal weight females. A
      secondary aim of this proposed study is to compare palatability, satiety, and perceived
      energy ratings among highly processed, unrefined, and gluten-free unrefined isocaloric meals.
      It is hypothesized that an unrefined meal will induce a greater postprandial thermogenic
      response and a smaller blood glucose response than a highly processed or gluten-free meal.
      Additionally, it is hypothesized that a highly processed foods meal will be considered more
      palatable than an unrefined or gluten-free meal.
