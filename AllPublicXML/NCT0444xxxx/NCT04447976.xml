  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate overall performance of disposable TIP duodenoscopes and get insight from
      end-users regarding its performance during various steps of ERCP procedure as well as ease
      and feasibility of pre-procedure duodenoscope set up and post procedure manual cleaning as
      well as reprocessing.

      Research design: This is a prospective observational multi-center study. Procedure used:
      During ERCP

      Risks and potential benefits: There are no risks associated with this study as it is a
      retrospective chart review. Potential benefits include the knowledge gained from this study
      which may be of help to patients in the future.

      Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result: The quality of health care
      which will be crucial to identify patterns of competence and identify areas of continued
      improvement. More specifically in the quality metrics sector we will be able to see what is
      already in place and steps we will undertake that will be beneficial for physicians.

      This is a prospective study to evaluate performance of disposable TIP duodenoscopes. Scope is
      designed to facilitate effective reprocessing of duodenoscope and thus prevent future
      outbreaks related to contaminated duodenoscope despite standard reprocessing.

      This is a multi-center study being performed at the University of Texas Health Science
      Center, Wake Forest Baptist Health and Institute of Gastroenterology in Ecuador. The study
      will enroll a total of 100 patients who undergo ERCP. The study is purely observational as it
      will collect clinical success and information of the TIP duodenoscope.

        Participants will be outpatients and inpatients undergoing ERCP at the Memorial Hermann
        Hospital Texas Medical Center. All patients will be seen by any one of the investigators
        either in the outpatient clinic or during inpatient consultation on hospitalized patients.

        The physicians and Nurse technicians will be evaluating the performance of the TIP
        duodenoscope on these patients undergoing ERCP.
