    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score at Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The 17-item HAM-D scale is used to assess the severity of depression. It is comprised of individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia, work and activities, retardation, agitation, anxiety, somatic symptoms, genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Individual items are scored on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe. The total score is the sum of individual items, ranging from 0 to 52; where a higher score indicates more depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point Likert scale to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. A participant is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7= among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

    <measure>HAM-D Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 3, 28, and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The 17-item HAM-D scale is used to assess the severity of depression. It is comprised of individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia, work and activities, retardation, agitation, anxiety, somatic symptoms, genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Individual items are scored on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe. The total score is the sum of individual items, ranging from 0 to 52; where a higher score indicates more depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HAM-D Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 15 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The time to response is defined as time from first administration of study drug to the time when ≥50% reduction in HAM-D score from baseline is achieved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HAM-D Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 15 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D remission is defined as HAM-D total score ≤7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I response is defined as having a CGI-I score of &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved.&quot; The CGI-I employs a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition posttreatment. Response choices include 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item HAM-A is comprised of a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). The HAM-A total score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. The scoring for HAM-A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First HAM-D Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 3, 8, 12, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The time to response is defined as time from first administration of study drug to the time when ≥50% reduction in HAM-D score from baseline is achieved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PRO Measures of Health-Related Quality of Life, as Assessed by the 36-item Short Form version 2 (SF-36v2) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1, 8, 15, 28 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's health will be assessed using Patient-reported outcome (PRO) health related quality of life (HRQOL) SF-36 V2. The SF-36v2 is a 36-item measure including eight health dimensions which are four physical health status domains and four mental health status domains. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range = 0 &quot;worst&quot;-100 &quot;best&quot;). Higher SF-36v2 scores will indicate a better state of health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PRO Measures of Depressive Symptoms, as Assessed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1, 8, 15, 28 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a participant-rated depressive symptom severity scale where scoring is based on responses to specific questions. The score will be calculated as the sum of the 9 individual item scores. The PHQ-9 total score ranges from 1 to 27 with a higher score indicating more depression.</description>
