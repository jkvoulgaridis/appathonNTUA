  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post mastectomy pain management is of crucial importance for patients' rehabilitation and
      quality of life. PECS block is used for acute and chronic post mastectomy pain management.
      Surgical infiltration is also used in this field. Patients in our study are divided in two
      groups receiving PECS block or surgical infiltrationbefore incision. Multimodal analgesia is
      indispensable according to recent guidelines for enhanced postoperative recovery. Pain scores
      will be assessed during the first 24h postoperatively and at 3 months after surgery.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomly assigned to 2 groups, PECS block or surgical infiltration group.
      Patients assigned to PECS group will receive 30cc of ropivacaine 0,375% where 10cc will be
      injected between pectoralis major and pectoralis minor and 20cc between pectoralis minor and
      serratus anterior muscle under ultrasound guidance. Patients assigned to surgical
      infiltration group will receive 30cc of ropivacaine 0,375% injected by the surgeon. Local
      aneshetic is administered in both groups after the induction of general anesthesia and before
      incision. Pain will be assessed at 1, 12, 24h after surgery and at three months after surgery
      communicating by telephone. Post operative analgesia includes paracetamol 1gr, parecoxib 40
      mg (as required) and tramadol as rescue analgesia (1 mg/kg iv up to 3 times daily). Chronic
      pain will be assessed after 3 months as for prevalence and neuropathic characteristics.
