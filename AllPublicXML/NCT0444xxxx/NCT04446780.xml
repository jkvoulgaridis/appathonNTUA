    <textblock>
      Literature is contradictory about the impact of mediolateral episiotomy during operative
      vaginal delivery in obstetric anal sphincter injuries prevention explaining the absence of
      international guidelines. The investigators consider that a randomized trials does not
      appears feasible for both ethical and practical reason and so we suggest a large national
      observational study.

      The investigators will include all nulliparous women that underwent an operative vaginal
      delivery within the 72h following the delivery at more than 34 weeks of amenorrhea. The
      investigators will collect data about the history of pregnancy, the course of labor, the mode
      of delivery, maternal immediate and one-year morbidity, neonatal immediate morbidity. The
      investigators expect a one-year study in 121 recruiting center with 15000 included women.

      The primary objective is to assess the protective effect of mediolateral episiotomy against
      obstetric anal sphincter injury during instrumental delivery in nulliparous women according
      to the type of instrument used. The secondary endpoints are to investigate the effect of
      mediolateral episiotomy on one-year maternal morbidity, immediate maternal morbidity. The
      investigators also aim to develop a clinical score to assess the absolute risk of obstetric
      anal sphincter injury during instrumental delivery. Finally, the investigators will
      investigate the impact of fetal presentation ultrasound assessment immediately before
      instrumental delivery on the mode of delivery.

        We will include in 121 centers in France during women year women who gave birth to their
        first child with requirement of an operative delivery. We will compare those who underwent
        a mediolateral episiotomy to those wo have not for the occurrence of obstetric anal
        sphincter injury according to the type of instrument used
