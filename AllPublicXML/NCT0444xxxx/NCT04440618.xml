  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to determinate the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome
      after treatment by combined chemoradiotherapie in a locally advanced stages treated
      population of oropharyngeal cancer. Indeed, the level of knowledge about the consequences of
      oropharyngeal cancer tratment on sleep quality remains poor but the few studies published on
      the subject suggest an increased risk of development of OSAHS for these patients.

    <description>Value of the AHI as a function of the post-therapeutic delay which corresponds to the delay compared to the end of the curative treatment carried out for squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. It is obtained after the inclusion visit and the realization of the polygraphy with the IAH score. OSAHS is mild (if IAH ≥ 5 / h and &lt;15 / h), moderate (if IAH ≥ 15 / h and ≤ 30 / h) or severe (if IAH&gt; 30 / h)</description>
