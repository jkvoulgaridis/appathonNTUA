  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blind, randomized control trial, with one additional unblinded
      arm. This study has been designed to identify a means of improving quality of life for
      patients requiring in-office cystoscopy. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) has
      been shown to improve quality of life and symptom control in multiple urological conditions
      based on shared neuroanatomical structures between the genitourinary system and the tibial
      nerve The goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of PTNS in
      minimizing patient discomfort during cystoscopy to develop a larger randomized control trial
      in the near future.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the ability of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation to improve patient discomfort during routine office-based cystoscopy based on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) by comparing median and interquartile ranges between groups. A score of 0 will indicate no pain whereas a score of 10 indicates the worst pain imaginable.</description>
