  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy (carboplatin and
      paclitaxel) versus usual treatment (chemotherapy alone) for the treatment of anal cancer that
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving nivolumab together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may help doctors find out if the
      treatment is better or the same as the usual approach.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate that anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel
      results in improved progression free survival (PFS) versus systemic chemotherapy alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel
      results in improved overall survival (OS) versus systemic chemotherapy alone.

      II. To demonstrate that anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel
      results in improved objective response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1 versus systemic chemotherapy alone.

      III. To evaluate toxicity profiles of the two regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) on day 1, and paclitaxel IV on days 1,
      8 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive carboplatin on day 1, paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8 and 15, and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, and then on day 1 only of
      subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles for carboplatin and
      paclitaxel, and up to 2 years for nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, then every 3 months
      for 2 years.

             or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea
             following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24
             consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive
             months).

             investigational drugs for the treatment of inoperable recurrent or metastatic anal
             cancer (previous use of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in this setting is not an
             exclusion criterion if: 1) non-irradiated target tumor lesions are present at
             randomization for the purpose of tumor response assessment or 2) in the absence of
             non-irradiated target tumor lesions, progression of the irradiated tumor lesions

             ulcerative colitis, and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),
             Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or anti-phospholipid syndrome. Patients with any of these

             even if &lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for
             prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions
             (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted
