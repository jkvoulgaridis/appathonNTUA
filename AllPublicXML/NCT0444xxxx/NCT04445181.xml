  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the body does not make enough of a hormone called
      insulin or does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels.

      People with T2D are at a higher risk of having a condition called chronic kidney disease
      (CKD). In people with CKD, the kidneys become damaged and do not work as they should. People
      with CKD can have trouble breathing and often have swelling in their arms and legs, and high
      blood pressure.

      People who have CKD and T2D are more likely to have other medical problems, such as heart
      disease.

      There are many treatments available to patients who have CKD and T2D. But, researchers need
      more information about how doctors in Canada are deciding which treatment to give these
      patients.

      In this study, the researchers will review health information from men and women with T2D who
      visited a doctor in 2019 and had check-ups for at least 6 months. The health information will
      be taken from a Canadian registry (or database) owned by LMC Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology. The
      registry contains information from people that went to an LMC clinic. In this study, the
      researchers will learn how many of these people had T2D and CKD. They will learn the
      treatments these people received, and if they had other related medical problems. The
      researchers will also use surveys to ask the doctors about why they chose certain treatments.

        used to determine the prevalence of CKD in patients with T2D. Patients identified with T2D
        and CKD will form the cohort for all subsequent analysis.

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
