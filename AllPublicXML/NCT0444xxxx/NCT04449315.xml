      Subject Selection: Every outpatient oncology patient experiencing nausea and/or anxiety
      during an infusion visit will be offered hospital-approved aromatherapy of Peppermint oil or
      Lavender oil. If patient says yes, then they will be selected for the study and infusion
      nurse will notify the study co-investigators or principal investigator. Informed consent will
      then be obtained by co-investigators or principal investigator of the study. The consents as
      well as the data collection tool sheets will be numbered without identifying patient's
      personal information. Peppermint oil aromatherapy and/or lavender oil aromatherapy will then
      be administered to consented patients.

      Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment: Every outpatient oncology patient

      be selected for the study and infusion nurse will notify the study co-investigators or
      principal investigator. Informed consent will then be obtained by co-investigators or
      principal investigator of the study. The consents as well as the data collection tool sheets
