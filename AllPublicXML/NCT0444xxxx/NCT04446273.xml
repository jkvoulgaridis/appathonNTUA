    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind randomized comparative efficacy study involving 40 participants with
      chronic stroke. Participants will be randomized into proximal priority robotic group or
      distal priority robotic group and receive 18 intervention sessions (90 min/d, 3 d/wk for 6
      weeks). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity subscale, Medical Research Council Scale,
      Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment, and Wolf Motor Function Test will be administered at
      baseline, after treatment, and at the 3-month follow-up. Two-way repeated-measures analysis
      of variance and the Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector Method will be used to examine
      the comparative efficacy and predictors of outcome, respectively, after intervention.

      Background. The sequence of establishing proximal stability or function before facilitation
      of the distal body part has long been recognized in stroke rehabilitation practice but lacks
      scientific evidence. This study plans to examine the effects of proximal priority robotic
      priming and impairment-oriented training (PRI) and distal priority robotic priming and
      impairment-oriented training (DRI).

      Methods. This is a single-blind randomized comparative efficacy study involving 40
      participants with chronic stroke. Participants will be randomized into PRI or DRI groups and
      receive 18 intervention sessions (90 min/d, 3 d/wk for 6 weeks). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment
      Upper Extremity subscale, Medical Research Council Scale, Revised Nottingham Sensory
      Assessment, and Wolf Motor Function Test will be administered at baseline, after treatment,
