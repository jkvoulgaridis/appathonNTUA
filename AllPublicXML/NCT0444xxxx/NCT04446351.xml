  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-time-in-human (FTIH) study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of escalating
      doses of GSK6097608 given as monotherapy and in combination with dostarlimab in participants
      with advanced solid tumors. This study will be used to define the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). The study comprises 3 phases; screening phase (28 days prior to first dose),
      treatment phase (until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of
      consent) and follow-up phase (90 days). Approximately 100 adult participants with locally
      advanced, recurrent, or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible participants will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of GSK6097608 every 3 weeks as monotherapy (Arm A) in escalating doses. Once a dose of GSK6097608 has been identified, enrollment in the combination arm (Arm B) will begin. Escalating doses of GSK6097608 will be evaluated with a fixed dosing regimen of dostarlimab given as an IV infusion at the end of GSK6097608 IV infusion. In each arm, a PK/PD cohort will be enrolled at the RP2D.</intervention_model_description>
