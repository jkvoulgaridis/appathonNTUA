      MOCSS study is a multicenter prospective clinical cohort study. The purpose of the MOCSS
      study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the preoperative cerebral
      small vessel disease and the incidence of covert stroke after non-cardiac surgery. Cerebral
      small vessel disease (CSVD) and covert stroke will be diagnosed using multimodal MRI. This
      study will also investigate whether preoperative CSVD and postoperative covert stroke are
      related to postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium.

      With the growing number of the older population, surgery for elderly patients is on the rise.
      Elderly patients often have more cardiovascular disease and brain vulnerability and tend to
      experience more perioperative complications. Perioperative covert stroke is one of those that
      can been neglected for a long time and is associated with long-term cognitive impairment.
      While CSVD is an insidious disease mainly affecting small blood vessels in the brain with
      variable symptoms including dementia, cognitive decline, gait impairment, mood disturbance
      and stroke. According to the etiopathology of CSVD, there's a possibility that CSVD is a
      potential risk factor for covert stroke and it may serve as a predictive marker for cognitive
      decline after surgery.

      In this multicenter prospective clinical cohort study, the investigators aim to investigate
      the correlation between the MRI manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease and
      perioperative covert stroke.

      Patients aged between 65 to 85 who are scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgeries will be
      enrolled.The primary outcome is the incidence of perioperative covert stroke diagnosed by
      MRI. Secondary outcomes include incidence of delirium (using ICU-CAM) within 3 days after
      surgery and cognitive function tests (using Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment), physical function test (using ADL, Activities of Daily Living) and
      dependence test (using modified Rankin Scale) at 3 months, 6 months and 12months after
      surgery.

      5 ml peripheral venous blood samples will be taken before the surgery. The blood samples will
      be preserved in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes and patient's information and serial
      number will be recorded on the tube. Samples are centrifuged for 10min at 2000x g and the
      supernatants will be transformed into Eppendorf tubes and stored at -80 °C. DNA will be
      extracted according to the protocol. The DNA samples will be stored at -80°C until further
      use. Before taking blood from patients, the purpose of using blood samples will be fully
      explained to them and informed consent will be obtained.
