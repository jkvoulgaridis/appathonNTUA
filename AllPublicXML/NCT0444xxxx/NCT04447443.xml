    <textblock>
      This study evaluates longitudinal data associating changes in gut microbiota composition and
      diversity, defecation, performance status and adverse reactions in response to prebiotic
      fiber supplementation in patients with gastrointestinal cancer chemotherapy-related diarrhea.
      120 adult participants , age 18 to 65 years, will be randomized into one of the two arms. Arm
      A (intervention group) will receive prebiotic fiber and loperamide hydrochloride capsule(a
      drug for standard treatment). Arm B will receive maltodextrin placebo and loperamide
      hydrochloride capsule.
