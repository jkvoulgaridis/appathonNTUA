        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, male or female between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 19-28 kg/m2 and within a body weight of ≥ 60 kg and ≤
             120 kg.

          -  Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential (defined as postmenopausal for
             at least 2 years or surgically sterile at least 6 months prior to dosing) or must be
             using adequate contraception.

          -  Subject is judged by the investigator to be in generally good health at screening
             based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, laboratory profile,
             and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Non-smoker (no tobacco use within past 3 months).

          -  Subject is willing to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, endocrinological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric,
             hematological (including myelosuppression and bleeding disorders) or
             immunological/autoimmune disorder(s), and/or any condition that could constitute a
             potential safety risk factor or could alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or elimination of the study drugs.

          -  Positive test result on Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or is Hepatitis C virus
             antibody (HCV-Ab) positive or positive HIV-1 and/or -2 serology.

          -  Subject has a history of chronic alcohol abuse within the last 2 years, or has a
             positive alcohol test or is known to have excessive alcohol intake.

          -  History of substance abuse, known drug addiction, or positive test for drugs of abuse.

          -  Subject has participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or a
             medical device) within the last 3 months or is currently participating in another
             trial of an investigational drug (or a medical device).

          -  Female subject who is pregnant or lactating or planning a pregnancy.

          -  A history of major mental illness that in the opinion of the Investigator may affect
             the ability of the subject to participate in the study (psychosis is to be
             disqualified).

          -  Subject has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability to
             provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that might confound the
             interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk.
