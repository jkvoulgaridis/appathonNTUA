  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to increase proportions of bystander defibrillation during out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest (hereof referred to as cardiac arrest) in residential areas with a high
      density of cardiac arrests. The intervention consists of Automated External Defibrillators
      (AEDs) and residents' involvement in resuscitation through training and enrollment as citizen
      responders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival decreases by 10% for every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest until
      defibrillation. Despite an increasing number of available AEDs, survival and defibrillation
      rates in residential areas remain poor. Efforts to increase bystander defibrillation has the
      potential to improve survival. Through the strategic deployment of AEDs, training, and
      recruitment of residents as citizen responders, we aim to improve proportions of bystander
      defibrillation and 30-day survival in densely populated residential areas with a high density
      of cardiac arrests.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the study, treatment allocation is not masked to rescuers or patients. The steering committee will, during the study, receive information on total numbers of arrests and overall success of providing defibrillation. The steering committee will not receive information on whether defibrillation took place in areas allocated to intervention or no intervention. Only the safety committee will have access to all information.</masking_description>

    <description>For all 1-1-2 calls with suspected cardiac arrest to the emergency dispatch center will activate a two-tiered response consisting of dispatch of an ambulance with an emergency medical technician, a physician-staffed mobile emergency care unit, and citizen first responders through the Heart Runner app.
The medical dispatcher offers telephone assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to bystanders. Furthermore, if more than two bystanders are present and an AED is accessible within 1½ minute travel distance (depending on the type of terrain), then one bystander is guided to localize and retrieve the AED.</description>

    <description>As a supplement to the standard care as described in the control arm, the following will be supplied:
Strategical deployment of AEDs with 24:7 availability and 1½ minute walking distance to every residence within the area. The AEDs will be registered with the AED network and thus linked to the emergency dispatch center.
The emergency dispatch center will retrieve data from used AEDs.
For each interventional area, approximately 120 residents will receive a course in CPR and AED use and subsequently be recruited as citizen responders so that they can be activated through the HeartRunner app in case of a nearby cardiac arrest.</description>
