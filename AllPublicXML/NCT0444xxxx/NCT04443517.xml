  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to recruit 600 participants to see if alpha power during anesthesia
      is influenced by analgesic medication and associated with a reduction of delirium following
      surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium may manifest in the immediate post-anesthesia care period. Such
      episodes appear to be predictive of further episodes of inpatient delirium and associated
      adverse outcomes. Intraoperative monitoring of frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) has been
      associated with postoperative delirium and poor outcomes. However, the efficacy of titrating
      anesthesia medication to proprietary index targets for preventing delirium remains
      contentious. The investigators aim to assess the efficacy of two pharmacologic strategies
      which could prevent post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium (1) maximization of
      intraoperative alpha power during maintenance and (2) switching anesthesia regimes during the
      emergence phases of anesthesia.

    <measure>Change in Frontal Alpha Power</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EEG data collected during the study duration will be processed using a customized script. Frontal alpha power (i.e., the cumulative power in the EEG alpha range) will be extracted from the EEGs and analyzed to compare the groups for the differences in the frontal alpha power.</description>

    <measure>Change in pain in PACU: numerical rating score (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical rating score (NRS) requires the patient to rate their pain from 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable (high score indicates worse outcome).</description>

    <description>During the first randomization, participants randomized to intraoperative oscillatory EEG alpha optimization will receive individualized titration of anesthetic gas and opioid. During the second randomization, participants randomized to conversion to a propofol infusion for emergence from anesthesia will received an infusion of propofol 400mg/h and simultaneous reduction of desflurane concentration during the final 10-20 minutes of surgery.</description>

    <description>During the first randomization, participants randomized to intraoperative oscillatory EEG alpha optimization will receive real-time monitoring of alpha recordings and individualized titration of desflurane and opioid.
