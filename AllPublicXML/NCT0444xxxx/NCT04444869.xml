    <textblock>
      This trial will explore giving standard dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy to sites of
      disease including all lymph nodes involved with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, but
      administer lower doses of radiation therapy to the lymph nodes that are not known to be
      involved with cancer. By doing so, it is hypothesized that there will be equally good long
      term loco-regional and distant disease control but will reduced long term treatment side
      effects and improved quality of life in persons living well beyond their cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial of definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy in human papilloma virus
      positive oropharyngeal cancers, in a population whose cancer is thought to be highly
      radio-sensitive. This is a population whose outcomes are already known to be very good with
      high rates of local and distant control of the disease. With the long term disease control
      and survival of patients with this disease, long term treatment toxicity and resulting
      reduction in quality of life poses new problems. This has lead to several studies to examine
      the role of radiation dose de-escalation through various strategies in attempt to reduce long
      term toxicity from treatment and yet achieve equivalent long term disease control.

      This trial specifically hypothesizes that a lower dose of radiation therapy to the clinically
      and radiographically uninvolved lymph nodes will no detrimental effect on loco-regional
      control or overall survival and will improve the long-term side effect profile, particularly
      with regards to xerostomia and dysphagia. The goal of this study is therefore to determine
      whether a lower dose to the clinically and radiographically uninvolved lymph nodes can be
      done safely and with better long-term toxicity profile and better overall quality of life
      without compromising the expected outcomes of progression free survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients generally must have the psychological ability and general health that permits
             completion of the study requirements and required follow up.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active should be willing and
             able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception throughout the treatment phase
             of the trial and until at least 60 days following the last study treatment.

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of squamous cell
             carcinoma (including the histological variants papillary squamous cell carcinoma and
             basaloid squamous cell carcinoma) of the oropharynx (tonsil, base of tongue, soft
             palate, or oropharyngeal walls); cytologic diagnosis from a cervical lymph node is
             sufficient in the presence of clinical evidence of a primary tumor in the oropharynx.
             Clinical evidence should be documented, may consist of palpation, imaging, or
             endoscopic evaluation, and should be sufficient to estimate the size of the primary
             (for T stage).

          -  Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measurable disease at the
             primary site or at nodal stations. Tonsillectomy or local excision of the primary
             without removal of nodal disease is permitted, as is excision removing gross nodal
             disease but with intact primary site. Limited neck dissections retrieving â‰¤ 4 nodes
             are permitted and considered as non-therapeutic nodal excisions.

          -  Immunohistochemical staining for p16 must be performed on tissue and documented in the
             pathology report(s) with reported result positive for p16.

          -  Clinical stage T1-T3, N0-N2c (AJCC, 7th ed.), which is equal to T1-T3, N0-2 (AJCC, 8th
             ed.) including no distant metastases based on the following diagnostic workup:

               -  General history and physical examination within 30 days prior to registration;

               -  Fiberoptic exam with laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror and/or fiberoptic and/or direct
                  procedure) within 60 days prior to registration;

               -  One of the following combinations of imaging is required within 45 days prior to
                  registration:

                    1. A CT scan of the neck (with contrast) and a chest CT scan (with or without
                       contrast);

                    2. or an MRI of the neck (with contrast) and a chest CT scan (with or without
                       contrast);

                    3. or a CT scan of neck (with contrast) and a PET/CT of neck and chest (with or
                       without contrast);

                    4. or an MRI of the neck (with contrast) and a PET/CT of neck and chest (with
                       or without contrast).

        Note: A CT scan of neck and/or a PET/CT performed for the purposes of radiation planning
        may serve as both staging and planning tools.

          -  Patients will be asked about their personal smoking history prior to enrollment. Only
             active smokers with greater than 10 pack years will be excluded from the trial. The
             total number of pack years will be collected at baseline. Current smokers who wish to
             discontinue will be offered smoking cessation information, and if they are able to
             discontinue smoking prior to initiation of radiation therapy, they can remain eligible
             for the trial.

        Number of pack-years = [Frequency of smoking (number of cigarettes per day) Ã— duration of
        cigarette smoking (years)] / 20 Note: Twenty cigarettes is considered equivalent to one
        pack. The effect of non-cigarette tobacco products on the survival of patients with
        p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers is undefined.
