  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether the use of weighted blankets can change the
      experience of chronic pain and to examine if social, psychological, or health factors
      influence the perception of the blanket. Multiple blanket weights will be tested.

    <measure>Change in pain ratings from before to after brief blanket use</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 15 minutes</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain ratings from before to after nightly blanket use</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (3 nights) and over 7 nights of use</time_frame>
    <description>Pain ratings will be compared before and after 1 week of nightly use of weighted blanket on the following scale: Pain VAS: &quot;No pain&quot; to &quot;Worst pain ever&quot; (higher = worse).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety ratings from before to after brief blanket use</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 15 minutes; also at baseline (3 nights) and over 7 nights of use</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety ratings will be compared before and after use of weighted blanket on the following scale: Anxiety VAS: &quot;Extremely anxious&quot; to &quot;Neutral&quot; to &quot;Extremely calm&quot; (higher = better).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ratings of sleep quality from before to after brief blanket use</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (3 nights) and over 7 nights of use</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sleep quality from before to after use of weighted blanket will be compared on the following scale: perceived sleep quality VAS: &quot;Extremely poor&quot; to &quot;Neutral&quot; to &quot;Extremely good&quot; (higher = better).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality measured by fitness watch from before to during week of blanket use</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (3 nights) and over 7 nights of use</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sleep quality from before to during use of weighted blanket will be compared by measurement of deep vs light sleep from a fitness watch.</description>
