  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By comparing the preoperative data and postoperative data of 9 patients of microspherophakia,
      we concluded that the 6-point transscleral suture fixation of a 3-looped haptics posterior
      chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) through scleral pockets was a feasible method of PC-IOL
      implantation in the surgical treatment of microspherophakia.

        A retrospective study was conducted on 9 patients (18 eyes) diagnosed with
        microspherophakia in Eye Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University
        School of Medicine from July 2016 to April 2020.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Microspherophakia was diagnosed and lens diameter＜9mm;

          -  The lens subluxation was beyond the range of one quadrant and glasses cannot correct
             the vision;

          -  Lens dislocated into the anterior chamber;

          -  Lens dislocation caused elevated intraocular pressure (IOP);

          -  The lens contacted the corneal endothelium;

          -  Cataract;

          -  Corneal endothelial cell density＞1000/mm2;

          -  The fundus was normal without retinal detachment, severe macular disease and optic
             nerve atrophy；

          -  There was possible improvement in postoperative visual acuity measured by retinometer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The lens is centered and the position of the lens is stable;

          -  Glasses can correct the vision obviously;

          -  The reason for the elevated IOP was independent with the lens;

          -  A high possibility of corneal decompensation after surgery;

          -  Fundus function was poor and it is not expected to improve the vision after surgery;

          -  Combined with other ocular diseases which were not suitable for IOL implantation;

          -  Combined with a systemic disease that the patient cannot tolerate the surgery.
