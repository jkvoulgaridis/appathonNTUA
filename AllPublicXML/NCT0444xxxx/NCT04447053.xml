  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease in which the immune system (the bodily system
      that fights infection) attacks the body's own cells and tissues, causing inflammation and
      organ damage if not promptly and appropriately managed. Autoantibodies (specific proteins
      produced by the immune system which participate in attacking self tissues and organs) are the
      hallmarks of SLE which are produced by a specific type of white blood cells called B cells.
      Belimumab (Benlysta®) is a monoclonal antibody against the B cells by blocking the action of
      BLyS, a protein that prolongs the longevity and enhances the functions of B cells and is
      found to be elevated in patients with SLE, was approved by the FDA to treat patients with
      SLE. This study aims to study the effects of Belimumab on T cells, another specific type of
      white blood cells which also play a crucial role in SLE, in patients with SLE. In this trial,
      80 adult patients with SLE will be recruited, 40 of them will be assigned to receive
      intravenous (IV) Belimumab with standard of care therapy (SOC), and 40 to receive SOC only.
      After 48 weeks of exposure to Belimumab + SOC and SOC alone, the phenotype and functions of T
      cells will be studied and compared.
