      Objective: To assess whether basal hormonal level can predict the elevation of P4 on the day
      of oocyte retrieval, as well as to examine the impact of P4 elevation on the day of oocyte
      retrieval on the outcome of assisted reproduction.

      Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Department of In Vitro Fertilization, Gynecology
      and Obstetrics Institute, Clinical Center of Serbia Patient(s): One hundred sixty four
      patients enrolled in the ART procedure Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancies, miscarriages,
      biochemical pregnancies and deliveries

      A prospective clinical trial was conducted at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics
      Clinical Center of Serbia from January 1st to December 31st 2015. The study included 164
      patients enrolled in the ART procedure at the Clinic.

      Basal hormonal status - serum levels of estradiol (E2 - pg/ml), progesterone (P4 - ng/ml),
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH - mIU/ml), luteinizing hormone (LH - mIU/ml) and
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH - ng/l) were measured on the 2ndor 3rd cycle day before
      stimulation commencement. During COS levels of estradiol were determined, while levels of
      progesterone were determined on the day of oocyte retrieval i.e. aspiration. Blood samples
      were taken by Vacutainer tubes (BD Vacutainer Systems) and centrifuged according to the
      manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of the serum samples. AMH value (Gen II ELISA
      ref. No. A79765; Beckman Coulter) in serum was measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay), 1 ng / ml). FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone were analyzed by chemiluminescent
      immunoassay (Access 2 immunoassay system, Beckman Coulter).

      The main outcome measures were the procedure success as well as the pregnancy outcome.
      Pregnancy was confirmed by a positive finding of serum β-hCG (&gt;25 MIU/ml) 14 days after
      embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancies were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound findings of a
      gestational sac with a vital embryo at the 6th gestational week.

        The study evaluated 164 patients undergoing ART procedure - oocyte retrieval and embryo
        transfer in our Clinic. Patients in average had 34.66 ± 3.39 years, mean BMI was 22.23 ±
        2.65, and their infertility mostly lasted for 4.86 ± 2.61 years (range 1 to 17 years).

        The mean P4 values on OR day were 1.26 ± 0.46 ng/ml in group P4 &lt;2ng/ml, while in the group
        of patients with P4 values ≥2ng/ml, the average P4 was 3.74 ± 1.62 ng/ml.
