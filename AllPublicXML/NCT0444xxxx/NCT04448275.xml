    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of Neurodynamics Nerve flossing on femoral neuropathy in patients
      with haemophilia

      Background: heamophilia is one of the serious chronic disorders in children and adolescents
      which results in less physical activities and restlessness hours than their peer.

      HYPOTHESES:

      This study will hypnotize that:

      Neurodynamics Nerve flossing will have a significant effect on femoral neuropathy in patients
      with haemophilia

      RESEARCH QUESTION:

      will the Neurodynamics Nerve flossing has an effect on femoral neuropathy in patients with
      haemophilia?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilic patients with Femoral Neuropathy will be randomly divided in two equal groups
      control group which will receive conventional selected exercise program and study group will
      receive the same exercise training program in addition to Neurodynamics Nerve flossing three
      times per week for three successive months.

      The Evaluation will done pre and post interventions included:

      femoral nerve motor conduction velocity, muscle test For Iliopsoas and Quadriceps muscles and
      Pain visual analogue scale.

    <description>Femoral Nerve Tension Test is a neural tension test used to stress the femoral nerve
A positive test was be reproduction of the patient's symptoms as burning discomfort in the groin or anterior thigh occurred if there was femoral nerve involvement.</description>

    <description>The group Manual muscle test was used for testing the strength of iliopsoas and quadriceps muscles, according to the Oxford Scale as the Muscle strength is often rated on a scale of 0/5 as follow:
(0/5) no contraction of muscle, (1/5) muscle flicker contraction, but no movement (2/5) movement possible, but not against gravity (test the joint in its horizontal plane), (3/5) movement possible against gravity, but not against resistance by the therapist, (4/5) movement possible against some resistance by the examiner and (5/5) normal strength</description>
