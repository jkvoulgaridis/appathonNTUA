  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fremanezumab in reducing
      pain in patients with interstitial cystitis-bladder pain syndrome (IC-BPS).

      A secondary efficacy objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of fremanezumab on
      other efficacy measures, including pain, voiding frequency, urinary symptoms, and quality of
      life.

      And another secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      fremanezumab administered subcutaneously in adult patients with IC-BPS.

      The planned active study period is 8 weeks; the entire planned study duration for each
      patient is 17 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  has a diagnosis of IC-BPS according to the American Urological Association endorsed
             criteria for a duration of ≥6 months to ≤15 years

          -  has IC-BPS with moderate to severe bladder pain and urinary frequency

          -  has urinary frequency of ≥8 voids/day

          -  has had a cystoscopy within 6months before screening with report indicating absence of
             Hunner lesion(s). A patient who has not had a cystoscopy within 6months may undergo
             cystoscopy, at the physician's discretion, and be rescreened for study entry.

          -  has persistent symptoms despite an adequate trial of 3 months of dietary counseling
             and modification

          -  has a body mass index within 18.5 to 39 kg/m2 and a body weight ≥99 lbs.

          -  has non-pharmacologic interventions (such as physical therapy, pelvic floor massage,
             acupuncture, naturopathy, new initiation of mindfulness exercises, or cognitive
             behavioral therapy) that are unchanged for a minimum of 30 days before the screening
             visit

          -  if of childbearing potential, must meet any of the following criteria:

               -  Patients must use 1 form of highly effective contraception with their partners
                  during the entire study period and for 5 months after the last dose of the IMP

               -  Sexual abstinence is only considered a highly effective method if defined as
                  refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability
                  of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
                  clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
                  abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods),
                  declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not
                  acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-human
                  chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy test at the screening visit (confirmed
                  by urine dipstick β-HCG pregnancy test at baseline)

        NOTE- Additional criteria apply; please contact the investigator for more information

             the screening visit, urethral diverticulum, incomplete bladder emptying, overactive
             bladder (ie, urinary urgency associated with urinary incontinence or fear of
             incontinence), radiation cystitis, tuberculosis cystitis, vaginitis, neurogenic
             bladder, or any other condition/disease which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could compromise subject safety or confound the collection or interpretation of study
             results

          -  is receiving any of the following treatments:

               -  intravesical therapy of any kind, corticosteroid therapy, cyclosporine, or
                  anti-tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors within 2 months before the screening
                  visit (visit 1)

               -  cyclophosphamide or ketamine at any time

               -  mAbs targeting the CGRP pathway (including erenumab, eptinezumab, galcanezumab,
                  or fremanezumab) at any time; if the subject has participated in a clinical study
                  with any of these mAbs, it has to be confirmed that the subject received placebo
                  in order to be eligible for this study

          -  has a known history of previous urinary diversion procedure with or without bladder
             removal or bladder augmentation

          -  has a known history of a cystoscopy with bladder biopsy, hydrodistention, or
             fulguration or triamcinolone injection ≤3 months before the screening visit

          -  was diagnosed with and/or treated for chronic migraine, defined as headaches occurring
             on ≥15 days/28-day period at any time over the past 3 months

          -  is receiving prophylactic treatment for migraine disorders

          -  has a lifetime known history of any psychotic and/or bipolar disorder
