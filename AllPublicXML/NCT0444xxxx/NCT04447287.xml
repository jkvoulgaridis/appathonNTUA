  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses
      of buprenorphine/naloxone alone and buprenorphine/naloxone in combination with a single dose
      of ASP8062.

      This study will also assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between ASP8062 and
      buprenorphine/naloxone.

      Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to first investigational product (IP)
      administration. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and
      will be residential for a single period of 27 days/26 nights.

      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit after completion of down-titration on
      the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical
      reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit; which is the end-of-study visit (ESV). Prior
      to discharge, participants will be provided with local buprenorphine and methadone providers
      for their reference.

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an Investigational Product (IP) and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, the event: results in death, is life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, results in congenital anomaly or birth defect, requires hospitalization or prolongation to hospitalization, or other medically important event.</description>
