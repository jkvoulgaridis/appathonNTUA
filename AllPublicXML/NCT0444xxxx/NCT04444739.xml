  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the correlation between muscle atrophy (MA), sagittal alignment,
      and stenosis degree in patients with lumbar spinal Stenosis (LSS). From existing radiological
      images, specific radiographic parameters will be extracted. General Information (Age, sex,
      levels of stenosis, duration of symptoms) will be extracted from patient files.

    <measure>Severity of muscle atrophy (MA) from supine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine</measure>
    <time_frame>single time-point at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle atrophy stage will be observed using Goutallier classification
Stage 0: No fatty infiltration
Stage 1: Few fatty streaks within the muscle
Stage 2: Less than 50% fat within the muscle
Stage 3: 50% of fat within the muscle
Stage 4: more than 50% fat with in the muscle. The MA stage will be observed in MRI of 5 lumbar disc levels (L1-S1). The MA stage of patients will be calculated as average stage of five lumbar segments.</description>

    <measure>Pelvic incidence (PI): Pelvic alignment from standard upright standing sagittal plane X-ray of lumbar spine with clear visibility of pelvis sacrum and femoral heads</measure>
    <time_frame>single time-point at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic incidence (PI): The angle between the line perpendicular to the sacral endplate at its midpoint and a line connecting this point to the axis of the femoral head.</description>

    <measure>Severity of stenosis from supine MRI of lumbar spine</measure>
    <time_frame>single time-point at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Stenosis grade will be observed using Schizas classification (Schizas et al., 2010)
Grade 1: Dural sac party occupied by the rootlets; Cerebrospinal fluid clearly visible; No stenosis
Grade 2: Rootlets occupy whole dural sac; Some cerebrospinal fluid visible; Moderate stenosis.
Grade 3: Rootlets not visible; No cerebrospinal fluid visible; Epidural fat posteriorly; Severe stenosis.
Grade 4: Rootlets not visible; No cerebrospinal fluid; No epidural fat; Extreme Stenosis. The most severe level will be regarded as the stenosis grade of the patients.</description>
