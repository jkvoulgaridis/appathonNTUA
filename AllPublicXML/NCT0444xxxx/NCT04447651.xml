  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who
      have a specific genetic mutation in patients' tumor (the SF3B1 mutation), are more likely to
      respond to immunotherapy agents that are now commercially available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic study, meaning that while Johns Hopkins is providing a treatment
      recommendation based on participants' genetic information, participants and participants'
      oncologist will decide ultimately what to do, and participants' oncologist will monitor
      participants' day to day care while on therapy. Participation involves allowing the
      investigators access to participants' sequencing report and medical records, providing a
      blood sample (about 8 tablespoons) at baseline and possibly again after three months, and
      answering questionnaires. If participants join the study, a panel of experts (Johns Hopkins
      Molecular Tumor Board) will review participants' genetic information participants entered and
      make a determination regarding treatment recommendation. Blood will be collected at baseline
      irrespective of what treatment is recommended. If immunotherapy is recommended, the
      investigators may collect blood again at 3 months. Participants and participants' oncologist
      will ultimately decide if participants proceed with the recommend treatment or not; the
      recommendation made from Johns Hopkins is not binding in any way. Participants' oncologist
      will continue with usual care according to standard practices while participants are on
      therapy. The investigators will get health information and conduct questionnaires with
      participants and participants' oncologist to assess how participants are doing on therapy.
      The main risks are the discomforts of the blood draw (which are expected to be minor and not
      last), boredom from completing questionnaires and the risk that information may become known
      to people outside of the study. Participants may or may not benefit directly from being in
      the study and there is no payment for participation.

      Blood samples will be collected to:

        -  Evaluate whether mutations detected in tumor tissue using various Clinical Laboratory
           Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified next-generation sequencing assays correlate with
           those found in plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA).

        -  To evaluate changes in ptDNA from baseline to 3 months in patients with spliceosome
           mutations receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)

        -  To evaluate changes in circulating immune cells (PBMCs) from baseline to 3 months in
           patients with spliceosome mutations receiving ICI

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Performance status eligible for immune checkpoint blockade as determined by local
             physician

          -  Able to demonstrate histologically proven locally advanced or metastatic breast
             cancer. Any receptor status is eligible (i.e. hormone receptor or human epidermal
             growth factor receptor 2-neu (HER2) positive or negative disease)

          -  genomic testing demonstrating a spliceosome mutation (SF3B1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Local physician determines has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that
             would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Local physician determines the patient has a history or current evidence of any
             condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the
             trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial,
             or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate
