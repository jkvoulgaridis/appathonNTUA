  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urine and blood samples are being collected from patients with and without diseases of the
      pancreas. These samples will be tested with the aim of developing an accurate way of
      diagnosing diseases of the pancreas using the results.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this research study is to establish the accuracy of a urinary biomarker panel
      (LYVE1, REG1B, TFF1), and affiliated PancRISK score alone or in combination with plasma
      CA19-9 for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

      Samples will be collected from symptomatic individuals with suspected pancreatic cancer, and
      asymptomatic subjects at risk of developing PDAC.

      The results of urine biomarker and CA19-9 analysis carried out on these samples will be
      compared to the imaging and, where available, histopathology data, which will inform the
      development of a predictive model to detect PDAC earlier.

        Samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals at risk of PDAC will be provided to
        the UroPanc team by collaborating centres via dedicated tissue banks/registries already in
        place at UCL (ADEPTS) and the University of Liverpool (EUROPAC).

        Symptomatic individuals at risk which are being referred to specialist care by their
        general practitioners (GPs) will be recruited to participate in UroPanc when attending
        clinics (gastroenterology clinics, endoscopy units and Multidisciplinary Diagnostic Centres
        (MDCs)) at a participating study site.
