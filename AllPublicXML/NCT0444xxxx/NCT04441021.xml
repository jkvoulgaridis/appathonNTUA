  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children are often reported to have antibiotics allergies, with approximately 10% of the US
      population labeled as allergic to an antibiotic. Recent studies have demonstrated that a
      large majority of children with a penicillin allergy label do not have a true IgE-mediated
      allergy. Appropriately delabeling antibiotic allergies has been shown to improve patient care
      outcomes and lower health care costs. However, efforts to implement these assessments in
      practice are lacking, particularly in the hospital setting. Therefore, there is a need for
      hospital-based risk assessment and delabeling strategies for hospitalized children. The
      investigator's objective is to determine the feasibility of implementing a hospital-based
      approach to penicillin allergy risk stratification and evaluation of patients at low-risk for
      true allergy.
