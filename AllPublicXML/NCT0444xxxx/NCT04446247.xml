  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performance testing of pulse oximeters. The protocol involves brief stable arterial oxygen
      desaturation in healthy volunteers and sampling arterial blood when a stable level of hypoxia
      has been attained. The blood sample is analyzed for oxygen saturation with a gold standard
      bench CO-oximeter. This protocol is aligned with the latest ISO and FDA guidance documents
      for pulse oximeter testing.
