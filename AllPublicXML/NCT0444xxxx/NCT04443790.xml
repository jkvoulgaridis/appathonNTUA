    <textblock>
      The study was designed to explore an alternative approach to reduce weight in human beings
      using a polyherbal formulation. A polyherbal formulation named as Obesecure was developed
      after screening of local medicinal flora. The formulation was further improved after pilot
      studies and Phase-I Clinical Trials.

      Obesity is a common disease of developing countries including Pakistan. Obesity is a risk
      factor for many diseases which can be life-threatening or making the person unable to perform
      daily routine work. Obesity is considered a risk factor for different diseases like
      cardiovascular diseases, hormonal imbalance, infections, malignancies and chest problems. The
      leptin hormone has appetite suppressing and energy dissipation activity in the body. A
      screening study on animals was carried out to find out the leptin enhancing medicinal plants
      from locally available plants in Pakistan. This study was aimed to see the combined effects
      of the Leptogenic drug Obesecure on weight management.

      Patients of age20 to 50 years with BMI more than 25, not taking any anti-obesity drugs
      one-month prior to start of study were enrolled. The Participants were randomly allocated to
      receive either Obesecure or placebo twice a day for three months in Shifa-ul-mulk Hospital,
      PRIEM Health Care Clinic (Pakistan) and Ria Eastern Medicine Clinic (Pakistan).

      An acute toxicity study showed no adverse effect of taking Obesecure prior to clinical
      trials.
