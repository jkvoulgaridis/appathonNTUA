  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to measure the changes of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6
      months after the following high-risk oncological abdominal surgery: gastrectomy,
      esophagectomy, pancreatectomy and hepatectomy. The investigators will measure the HRQoL using
      the validated EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire before and at 6 months after the surgery. The
      investigators will identify phenotypes of HRQoL changes (improvement, stability and
      deterioration) at 6 months after surgery.

      The second aim is to assess the regret of the patient at 6 months regarding his/her decision
      to undergo surgery. The investigators will also assess the regret of the next of kin at 6
      months regarding the decision to undergo surgery.

      This descriptive, prospective, observational, single-centre cohort study aims to: identify
      phenotypes of HRQoL changes after abdominal surgical oncology (improvement, stability and
      deterioration); assess the regret of patients regarding their decision to undergo surgical
      oncology at 6 months; assess the regret of the next of kin regarding the decision of the
      patient to undergo surgical oncology at 6 months. The investigators will include patients
      scheduled for the following elective abdominal cancer surgery: gastrectomy; esophagectomy;
      pancreas resection and hepatectomy. The investigators will assess HRQoL using the validated
      EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score before and 6 months after surgery. The cut-offs for the three
      phenotypes of HRQoL changes will be defined using the minimal clinically important difference
      (MCID) of 10 points. The investigators will assess regret using the Decision Regret Scale
      (DRS) at 6 months after surgery.

      The expected results are: The investigators can identify phenotypes of HRQoL changes after
      surgical oncology using the EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score; the investigators will describe the
      distribution of these phenotypes and will find an association with the pre-existing frailty.
      The investigators can describe the extent of the regret of the patient and of the next of kin
      at 6 months using the DRS. The investigators will observe an association between the DRS
      score at 6 months and the HRQoL Summary Score change. The investigators will not observe a
      relationship between the DRS score of patients and next-of-kins.
