    <textblock>
      The DECIDE Parent-Provider Intervention is designed to support parents caring for adolescents
      who are receiving treatment for Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct disorders.
      Participating in DECIDE study may help you effectively ask questions and participate in
      decisions about your adolescent's care.

    <textblock>
      Interventions to optimize parent-provider interactions are urgently needed to ensure
      adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct disorders (DIC)
      receive the behavioral health care they need. For these adolescents, behavioral health care
      is complex, long-term, and requires parental participation. Research shows providers have
      biases and limited skills and confidence to communicate with these parents to encourage them
      to voice their concerns and care preferences. Low income and minority parents are at greatest
      risk of not being involved in their adolescents' behavioral health care, having poor
      interactions with providers, and are more likely to perceive poor quality of their
      adolescents' behavioral health care, and low treatment engagement. If unaddressed, poor
      parent-provider interactions interfere with adolescents' retention in behavioral health care.
      No evidence-based interventions have targeted both parents and providers to optimize their
      interactions and improve behavioral health care for adolescents with DIC. To address these
      problems, the investigators propose modifying the evidence-based DECIDE intervention to
      target parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. DECIDE stands for Decide the problem;
      Explore the questions; Closed or open-ended questions; Identify the who, why, or how of the
      problem; Direct questions to your health care professional; Enjoy a shared solution. DECIDE
      was developed for ethnically/racially diverse adult patients with serious mental illness and
      the latest evidence-based iterations include intervention components targeted to and shown to
      increase patient activation, provider communication, and patient-provider interactions.
      DECIDE has two primary components: 1) three patient training sessions designed to help
      patients effectively ask questions and participate in decisions about their care: and 2) a
      12-hour workshop and up to 4 individual coaching sessions for providers to improve
      perspective-taking, reduce attributional errors, and increase receptivity to parent
      participation and collaboration. The purposes of this two-phase study are: Phase I, Aim 1.
      Modify the DECIDE intervention for parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. Phase II,
      Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of modified DECIDE. Aim 3. Estimate
      preliminary effects of modified DECIDE to improve parent, provider, and adolescent outcomes.
      Innovative features of this study are the proposed focus on both parents and providers; and
      inclusion of parent activation and provider communication, which are new in field of child
      and adolescent behavioral health care, and focus on low income and minority parents. The
      investigators expect to find that compared to usual care: Hypothesis 3.1. Modified DECIDE
      parents will show greater improvements in: 1) activation; 2) parent-provider interactions; 3)
      perceived management of adolescents' behavioral health care, 4) perceived quality of
      adolescents' behavioral health care, and 5) engagement in adolescents' behavioral health
      care. Hypothesis 3.2. Modified DECIDE providers will show greater improvements in: 1)
      communication skills; and 2) parent-provider interactions. Hypothesis 3.3. Adolescents of
      modified DECIDE parents and providers will show higher rates of retention in behavioral
      health care. Sample will include 16 providers and their parents ( ~ 5 parents per provider, n
      = 80) recruited from the Child and Adolescents Program of a large safety net health system
      setting that serves predominately low income and minority persons. Feasibility will be
      assessed using tracking logs and field notes, and acceptability through parent and provider
      satisfaction scores and in depth, semi structured interviews. Outcomes will be assessed at
      baseline and within 4 weeks post- intervention using standardized questionnaires or surveys
      from parents, providers, and independent observers reports. Effects sizes will be estimated
      using linear mixed models. If study findings are positive, we will be poised to test the
      modified DECIDE intervention in a fully powered R01 level randomized, controlled, multi-site
      clinical trial.

    <description>It will include three 60 minutes sessions. Session 1 (Decisions and Agency) is designed to increase awareness of their role in clinical interactions and encourage participation and decision making in care. Session 2 (the Who, How, and Why of Decisions) teach skills for understanding treatment decisions in terms of roles, processes, and reasons involved. Session 3 (Self-efficacy and Consolidation) encourages parents to ask questions about their adolescents' behavioral health and health care and treatment options. The provider component is designed to improve provider communication in three key areas: 1) perspective taking to understand circumstances and perceptions; 2) attributional errors or attributing negative parent behaviors to character traits; and 3) receptivity to parent participation and collaboration.</description>

        Phase 1, Aim 1. Inclusion Criteria. Parents of adolescents with DIC, who are receiving
        services at Midtown Child and Adolescent Program or CAP. We will invite parents 1) from our
        previous study advisory board (n=3), and two who participated in preliminary study 2 that
        agreed to be contacted for future studies. Inclusion Criteria. CAP staffs who do not meet
        the inclusion criteria in phase 2 (i.e. manager and clinical coordinators or supervisors,
        clinic nurse, advanced practice registered nurses, or psychiatrists). We will invite two
        other direct care providers who work in the healthcare system but not at recruitment site.
        No providers or parents will be excluded on basis of race/ethnicity, gender, or sexual
        orientation.

        Phase II, Aims 2 and 3. Providers will be regular paid staff members who are (1)
        masters-prepared clinical social workers or mental health counselors and (2) provide
        behavioral health services to adolescents and their parents at CAP. We focus on this
        category of providers because they have primary clinical contact with parents; thus,
        activation/communication is particularly important for the dyad. Parents will have an
        adolescent with DIC receiving services from a participating CAP provider. Enrollment will
        be limited to parents who: (a) are aged 21 or older; (b) speak English, (c) are the
        biological parent of the adolescent or a parent surrogate serving in a primary caregiver
        role (for at least past 6 months)and (d) report an activation score of 1 or 2. There are
        four levels of activation: Starting to Take a Role (Level 1), Building Knowledge and
        Confidence (Level 2), Taking Action (Level 3), and Maintaining Behaviors (Level 4). Parents
        will be excluded if they: (a) are a foster parent; (2) show significant cognitive
        impairment or acute emotional distress on screening; or (3) have an incarcerated
        adolescent. No providers or parents will be excluded on basis of race/ethnicity, gender, or
        sexual orientation.

        Specifically for semi-structured interview post intervention. Include: All intervention
        providers (n = 8) and two of each of their parents (n = 16). To explore different levels of
        acceptability by parents, for each provider, one parent will be chosen who has a high score
        (&gt; 3) on the CSQ and one parent who has a low score (&lt; 3). Both parents and providers will
        be asked about their experience with the intervention, what was helpful or not, and how
        they would change the intervention.
