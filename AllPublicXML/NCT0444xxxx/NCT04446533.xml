      The enrolled subjects will be examined and treated by specialized medical personnel.

      Patients will undergo a professional oral hygiene session (causal therapy) and will be
      instructed to perform proper oral hygiene manoeuvres at home.

      Next, subjects will be divided into three groups: after the causal therapy, the treatment of
      the pockets will be performed by probing, between 3 and 7 mm, with the test product, active
      comparator or placebo, with the aid of a dedicated sterile syringe. The application will be
      repeated after approx. 5 minutes.

      One bottle of the product (test, comparative or placebo) will then be given to the patient
      who will be instructed to use it 3 times a day, after meals and after normal oral hygiene
      procedures, for at least one week.

      The subjects will then be re-evaluated after 3 days and after a week. During these check-ups,
      new samples will be collected at the level of the initial sampling sites and will be
      reassessed on the basis of the selected clinical indices (in particular plaque, bleeding and
      probing depth).

      Patients with allergic reactions or hypersensitivity due to the use of the products will be
      advised to discontinue the use of the products and seek medical advice.

    <intervention_model_description>Following a professional oral hygiene session, subjects will be divided into three groups: BMG0703, active comparator a nd placebo.
First application of products will be applied clinically, and subsequently, one bottle of the product (test, comparative or placebo) will be given to the patient to use it 3 times a day, after meals and after normal oral hygiene procedures, for at least one week.
The subjects will then be re-evaluated after 3 days and after a week. During these check-ups, new samples will be collected at the level of the initial sampling sites and will be reassessed on the basis of the selected clinical indices (in particular plaque, bleeding and probing depth).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The products will be packaged in such a way that they are not recognizable either by the operator or by the patient. Each package will be assigned a number that in turn will refer to the type of the product. The association between the number and type of the product will be collected by another operator on the basis of the association carried out by a dedicated software. The operator who will deliver the product will be informed about the type only at the end of the treatment.
The data will be collected in pseudonymised form and inserted into a dedicated database in order to carry out the statistical analysis provided.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bleeding index</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 7, 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo the measurement of bleeding index according to Silness J &amp; Loe. Four surfaces per tooth (vestibular, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal) will be considered.
Data will be collected based on four possible clinical conditions:
Code 0: absence of bleeding during probing depth measurement; Code 1: absence of bleeding during probing depth measurement, presence of redness and oedema; Code 2: presence of bleeding during probing depth measurement with redness and oedema; Code 3: spontaneous bleeding
Higher score means worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 7, 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo the measurement of plaque index according to Silness J &amp; Loe. Four surfaces per tooth (vestibular, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal) will be considered.
Data will be collected based on four possible clinical conditions:
Code 0: absence of plaque; Code 1: presence of plaque not visible to the naked eye but evidenced by the periodontal probe passage; Code 2: presence of plaque at the level of the gingival margin; Code 3: abundant presence of plaque at the level of the gingival margin and/or the rest of the dental surface.
Higher score means worse outcome
The sum of the values of the four surfaces examined, divided by the very number of surfaces, will give the plaque and bleeding index value for each individual tooth. The sum of the indices of each examined tooth divided by the total number of teeth examined will indicate the overall plaque and bleeding index of the subject at that time.</description>

    <measure>Change in Microbiological analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>0,3,7,30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The DNA-Sorb-B (Sacace) nucleic acid extraction kit will be used for the extraction and purification of bacterial DNA from clinical samples. Bacterial genome extraction is performed on 500 microlitres of oral sample fluid obtained from each patient.
The molecular analysis, using Real Time PCR, involves the use of the KIT Periodontitis (PeriodontScreen Real-TM, Sacace), and in particular the following bacterial species will be researched: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas endodontalis.
Periodontopathogenic bacteria are divided into high (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticle, Tannerella forsythia) and medium risk (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella Intermediate, Porphyromonas endodontalis). The results of the molecular analysis will be related to the clinical indices obtained from each patient.</description>
