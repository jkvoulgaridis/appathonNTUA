  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of two parts. Part A: will test single doses of ZF874 in a
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled and dose-escalating design. Up to 4 groups of 8
      healthy volunteers will receive an oral dose of ZF874 or matching placebo (6 active: 2
      placebo for each group). The dosing of the first 2 subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) will
      take place before dosing of the remainder of the group. The dose will be escalated only if
      the safety and tolerability of the previous highest dose are acceptable, and the plasma
      concentrations of ZF874 are predicted to remain below the toxicokinetic exposure limit, as
      determined by the Safety Review Group.

      Part B: Multiple Doses in subjects carrying one Z mutated alpha-1-antitrypsin (Z-A1AT) allele
      (PiMZ subjects): 1 group of 8 subjects will receive daily doses of either ZF874 or placebo on
      28 consecutive days (6 active: 2 placebo). Dose level will depend on review of data from Part
      A and pharmacokinetic modelling as appropriate, but it is anticipated to be the highest dose
      judged to be safe from Part A.

    <textblock>
      Part A: Enrolment of up to 32 healthy men and women is planned, in up to 4 groups. Each group
      will consist of 8 subjects. Subjects will receive a single oral dose of either ZF874 or
      placebo, in the fasted state. There will be up to 4 dose levels of ZF874. In each group, two
      subjects (one placebo, one ZF874) are to be dosed in a double-blind manner at least 23 hours
      prior to the remainder of the group. In the absence of any safety concerns in the sentinel
      subjects, the remaining subjects will be dosed, at intervals of at least 10 minutes. Subjects
      will be screened in the 28 days before their dose of trial medication. Subjects will be
      resident on ward from 1 day before their dose (Day -1) until 48 hours after dosing (Day 3).
      They will return for a follow-up visit 5-7 days after their dose (Day 6-8).

      Part B will not start until at least 3 dose levels have been completed in Part A. The dose
      level to be tested in Part B will be selected based on review by the Safety Review Group of
      the available safety and pharmacokinetic results from Part A. One group of 8 PiMZ subjects
      will receive ZF874 or placebo once daily by mouth for 28 days. Six subjects will receive
      active treatment and 2 will receive placebo. Dosing will be staggered: 2 sentinel subjects
      will be dosed first, and the remaining subjects will be dosed at least 71 h later. To
      maintain the blind nature of the study, the 2 sentinel subjects will be randomised to ensure
      that 1 subject receives active treatment and the other receives placebo. The leading subjects
      will be dosed a minimum of 5 min apart. Provided there are no safety concerns, the remaining
      subjects will be dosed, at intervals of at least 10 minutes. Subjects will be pre-screened to
      confirm PiMZ genotype within 84 days before their dose of trial medication. Once their
      genotype is confirmed, they will be screened in the 28 days before their dose of study
      medication. Subjects will be resident on the ward from 1 day before their first dose (Day -1)
      until 1 hour after they receive their second dose (Day 2). They will then attend 6 outpatient
      visits on Days 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25. Subjects will return to the ward and be resident from
      Day 27 until 24 hours after the final dose (Day 29). They will return for further outpatient
      visits on Days 36, 43 and 50, and for a follow-up visit 28-30 days after their final dose
      (Day 56-58).

    <description>ZF874 is a novel, first-in-class small molecule. ZF874 is a chemical chaperone that specifically rescues the folding of the Z variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT). It is being developed for the treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) caused by the Z-mutation.</description>
