  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective and prospective study to determine if the use of ambient lighting during
      screening colonoscopy is well tolerated and if ambient lighting will help physicians maintain
      adenoma detection rates while decreasing symptoms of eye strain as the day progresses.

      This study is a a single-center study at an independent community-based teaching hospital
      comparing adenoma detection rate in screening colonoscopies performed in low lighting with
      those performed with ambient lighting (75-150 lux). All cases included in the study involved
      adult patients undergoing screening colonoscopy with a participating gastroenterologist.
      Diagnostic colonoscopies, history of colon resection, colorectal cancer, and cases performed
      in children, pregnant women, and prisoners were excluded from analysis. Cases involving
      gastroenterology fellows were also excluded. Retrospective data was collected over a six
      month period from January 2017 to June 2017, followed by a prospective arm the during the
      same calendar months the subsequent year (January 2018 to June 2018).
