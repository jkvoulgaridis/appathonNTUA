  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PPV-06 immunotherapy targets interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key molecule of the immune system whose
      overproduction is implicated in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
      arthritis and osteoarthritis. The benefit of vaccination with PPV-06 is to induce, in
      response to immunizations, the production of antibodies directed against IL-6. The antibodies
      produced will neutralize the biological activity of IL-6 involved in the body's inflammatory
      process.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety/tolerability of vaccination with PPV-06.
