  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The positioning of the ICU patient is a daily concern of the medical and paramedical teams.
      Developments in emergency medicine and sedation and analgesia techniques have made it
      possible to reduce patient mortality. However, considered too unstable, patients were no
      longer mobilized outside the bed until the complete resolution of the symptoms that led to
      hospitalization or surgery.

      Despite encouraging results for early mobilization, bed and rest remained the most widespread
      positioning technique worldwide with the emergence of intensive care units, mechanical
      ventilation and sedation/analgesia/curarization. The result is peripheral muscular amyotrophy
      and respiratory muscular amyotrophy, with increased length of stay and exacerbated
      morbidity/mortality several years after discharge from ICU.

      Numerous studies have shown the value of early mobilization of the ICU patient to preserve
      functional and muscular capital.

      However, few studies have evaluated the value of mobilizing the ICU patient from the bed in
      order to improve oxygenation. The lack of mobility outside the bed causes condensation of the
      pulmonary parenchyma at the bases and in the dorsal region when the patient is lying down or
      in a prolonged semi-seated position.

      In awake spontaneously ventilated patients, whether intubated on ventilatory support
      (Pressure Support), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO),
      the reference position is a semi-seated patient with the head of the resuscitation bed tilted
      at 30°. The problem with this position in the bed is that patients tend to slide toward the
      foot of the bed. This migration is due to gravity or the design of the ICU bed. The end
      result of this migration is that the inclination indicated by the bed head inclinometer does
      not correspond to the actual angulation between the patient's lower limbs and trunk. The
      patient finds himself &quot;compressed&quot; in the lower abdomen, which can lead to compression of the
      diaphragm and thus hypoventilation in the postero-caudal regions of the lungs.

      Our hypothesis is that the chair position (outside the ICU bed) allows, without modification
      of the ventilatory parameters, to improve the alveolar ventilation and thus the oxygenation
      of the arterial blood, compared to the &quot;natural&quot; semi-seated position in the ICU bed, in
      patients with spontaneous ventilation (PS/NIV/HFNO).

  <detailed_description>

      This is a monocentric, comparative, randomized, open-label trial comparing two methods of
      &quot;seated&quot; positioning of the ICU patient, chair versus natural position in bed, on arterial
      blood oxygenation

        1. Sitting in a Chair position For patients randomized in the chair group, we will perform
           the transfer to the chair immediately after the morning arterial blood gas. The chair
           position will be maintained for 3 hours, if the patient shows no clinical signs of
           discomfort or intolerance.

        2. Semi-recumbent position in bed The patient will benefit from conventional positioning
           techniques in the ICU bed. With the help of the medical monitoring software present in
           the wards, we will note the different nursing care given to the patient during the 3
           hours following the morning arterial gasometry.
