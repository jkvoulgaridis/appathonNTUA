  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic
      study to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) or recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of
      both ALA and RT. Once the MTDs are identified, the cohort providing the highest dose
      intensity at or below the MTD (if supported by emerging PK and biomarker data) will be
      selected for an expansion phase for the purpose of refining the safety assessment and
      assessing preliminary efficacy. The initial dose escalation phase will enroll at least 20
      patients across a variety of tumor types, after which concurrent disease site-specific
      expansion cohorts will accrue, each consisting of 20 patients. Anatomic site-specific cohorts
      will include patients with symptomatic metastatic disease to specific anatomic regions, where
      varying toxicity may be expected (Head and Neck, Thorax and Abdomen/Pelvis).

               1. Patients who refuse MRI imaging are not eligible

               2. Patients who cannot undergo PET/MRI imaging will be deemed screen failures.
                  Rescreening X1 (once) is permissible if the investigator feels that appropriate
                  premedications may allow successful imaging.

          3. All previous therapies for cancer, including radiotherapy, major surgery, and/or
             investigational therapies, must be discontinued for ≥ 14 days (≥ 28 days for mitomycin

             therapy must have resolved to baseline severity or Grade ≤ 1 Common Terminology

             eligibility list

             effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after
             completion of treatment. The decision of effective contraception will be based on the
             judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded. Patients with asymptomatic
             and treated CNS metastases may participate in this trial. The patient must have
             completed any prior treatment for CNS metastases ≥ 28 days prior to study entry,

             have any clinical evidence of impaired gastrointestinal function or any
             gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of ALA, in the
             opinion of the treating investigator. Patients who cannot swallow but rely on
             enterally-administered supplementation may enroll if they otherwise meet this
             criterion.

             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             the study.

             10. Patients with implanted battery-controlled devices (including, but not limited to,
             pacemakers and implanted cardiovascular defibrillator (AICDs)) that may suffer
