  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Teneligliptin as quadruple oral
      combination therapy for type 2 diabetes after failure of an oral triple anti-diabetic
      regimen. Patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (7.1% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 9%) prescribed with
      triple combination of oral antidiabetic drugs more than 12 weeks with sufficient doses
      (metformin &gt;= 1000mg/d, Glimepiride &gt;=4 mg/day, Gliclazide &gt;= 60 mg/day, SGLT-2 inhibitor
      with approved dose by Korea FDA) will be included. Using randomization, patients would take
      either teneligliptin (20mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of trial, all patients
      would receive teneligliptin for another 12 weeks. As outcomes, changes in HbA1c and fasting
      plasma glucose at 12th and 24th weeks compared with at baseline, and proportions of patients
      who achieved a glycemic goal (HbA1c &lt;=7%) at 12th and 24th weeks will be evaluated.
