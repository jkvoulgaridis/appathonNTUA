      SCOPE-PLUS is an optional substudy of the observational SCOPE Study (Screening for Chronic
      Kidney Disease among Older People across Europe, NCT02691546). The objective of the
      SCOPE-PLUS study is to derive new equations based on innovative and novel biomarkers of CKD
      function and compare its accuracy to measure GFR in the population older than 75 years.

      SCOPE-PLUS is an optional substudy of the SCOPE cohort study (Screening for Chronic Kidney
      Disease among Older People across Europe, NCT02691546). SCOPE has retrieved data on a wide
      panel of biomarkers of CKD in a large study cohort enrolling about 2,450 older people in
      Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Poland and Israel. The innovative biomarkers
      have been already validated by the literature, and include e.g. Cystatin C (CysC), Î²-Trace
      protein (BTP), and Beta2-microglobulin. Others promising novel biomarkers of CKD, based on
      metabolomic and proteomic determinations or other techniques have been evaluated. The
      objective of the SCOPE-plus study is to to verify the accuracy of newly developed equations
      based on innovative and novel biomarkers of CKD function by calculating the percentage of
      estimates within 30% (P30) of the measured GFR (mGFR). The mGFR will be obtained by the
      assessment of nonradioactive iohexol clearance. Patients previously enrolled in the SCOPE
      study, are invited to participate in this additional protocol. Iohexol is an iodinated
      contrast medium with characteristics similar to those of inulin, being freely filtered by the
      glomerulus, neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the renal tubules and recovered almost 100% in
      the urine. These characteristics made it an ideal agent for the determination of the renal
      function.

    <measure>To measure GFR in subjects aged 75 or older by iohexol clearance to verify the accuracy of equations of innovative and novel biomarkers of CKD newly evaluated in the SCOPE study</measure>
    <time_frame>300 minutes from intravenous injection of iohexol</time_frame>
    <description>Iohexol solution 5 mL (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare), containing 3235 mg of iohexol will be administered intravenously into an antecubital, forearm, or hand vein and flushed with 10 mL of normal saline. Blood samples for serum creatinine and other biomarkers will be obtained before iohexol is applied. Blood samples will be obtained after 5 minutes from the contralateral arm to confirm that the Iohexol has been administered correctly intravenously. Subsequent blood sample will be collected (always from the contralateral arm) at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 300 minutes after injection. The exact timing of the samples collection will be recorded. All clearance measurements will be started between 8:00 and 10:30 a.m.</description>
