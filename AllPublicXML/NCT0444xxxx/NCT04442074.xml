  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid diaphragms are a non-atheromatous arterial cause of cerebral infarction, especially
      in young people (≤65 years old). This anomaly is more common in the African or
      African-American population, although it is more and more often discovered in young
      Caucasians. This cause of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), known until the 1970s, was later
      forgotten until a recent revival of interest, probably in connection with the improvement of
      imagery but also by the discovery that these lesions have a high rate of recurrence in the
      absence of interventional care. In a Brazilian study, the carotid diaphragm was reported in
      10% of patients under the age of 60.

      The carotid diaphragm is a non-atheromatous overgrowth of the intima of the arterial wall. It
      appears in imagery in the form of an endoluminal web wider than it is tall. Its preferred
      seat is the carotid bulb. It is a source, by an embologenic mechanism, of cerebral infarction
      starting from local thrombus developed within large cerebral arteries. In histology, the
      lesions are different from atherosclerosis and characterized by a thickening of the intima
      with proliferation of loose and strewed spindle cells mainly involving the intima.

      An atheromatous plaque or dissection with detachment of the intima are the two main
      differential diagnoses of the carotid web. However, the appearance of a diaphragm implanted
      on a regular wall and the absence of any other localization of atheroma distinguish the
      lesion of the carotid web from that of a focal atheromatous plate. In addition, the very
      proximal localization of the carotid web, from the emergence of the internal carotid artery,
      does not suggest a dissection, the localization of which is usually downstream of the bulb.

      The baseline exam to detect a carotid diaphragm is a carotid angiography scan, but the
      abnormalities are often inconspicuous, making diagnosis difficult. We can be led in case of
      doubt to perform a conventional arteriography, which remains the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The latter,
      dynamic examination compared to the CT scan, shows above all a stasis of blood flow in the
      recess created by the diaphragm, stasis at the origin of the formation of thrombi. It has
      been suspected that the maximum risk of infarction is upon waking, at the time of
      verticalization, with mobilization of the thrombus.

      Therapeutically, the discovery of a symptomatic carotid diaphragm (ischemic swallowing
      accident) justifies radical treatment. The risk of recurrence of a patient on antithrombotic
      (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) being too high, it is proposed either surgery, or carotid
      angioplasty with stent placement. No comparative study of the 2 techniques has been carried
      out.

      Besides radiological examinations, ultrasound is another technique for studying the cervical
      arteries. It is reputed to be of little contribution in the search for a carotid diaphragm,
      but few publications exist to date even though the cervical Doppler is often the first
      arterial examination carried out after an ischemic stroke. Two series reported Doppler
      ultrasound data in the carotid diaphragm. A recent retrospective study evaluated, in
      multimodal imaging [Doppler, CT scan of the Supra-Aortic Trunks (ASD) and conventional
      arteriography], 30 patients (60 carotids) with diaphragm or atherosclerosis. The correlation
      between conventional arteriography and CT angiography was perfect, but the correlation
      between Doppler and CT angiography for diaphragm diagnosis was moderate. In another series
      studying 15 diaphragms diagnosed by CT angiography, the retrospective analysis of doppler
      reports revealed that 40% were considered normal and 60% mentioned nonspecific hyperechoic
      lesions, but this work remained in the form of a presentation. at a congress. With the
      improvement of the technique and the resolution of the Doppler ultrasound as well as the
      knowledge of the particular ultrasound characteristics, it seems to us that this examination
      could regain a place in the diagnosis of the pathology. The carotid diaphragm is also largely
      unknown to vascular doctors practicing cervical Doppler ultrasound.

      This descriptive study of the diagnostic contribution of the echo-doppler for a carotid
      diaphragm has for perspective the establishment of a prospective study of the contribution of
      a combined expertise angiologist-neurologist in the echo-Doppler for patients &lt;60 years
      hospitalized for an ischemic stroke.
