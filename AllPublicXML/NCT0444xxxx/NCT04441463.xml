  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the neonatal serum level of severals proteins can be used as an indicator of
      subsequent risk. For example, we plan to explore the neonatal kinetics of tryptase and other
      immune proteins as potential markers for the risk of postnatal complications, particularly in
      premature babies. However, today no study has shown whether the tryptase level in the newborn
      is a reflection of fetal synthesis alone, or that of the mother by possible transplacental
      passage. There is also no database that has defined normal values for tryptase in cord blood.

      Our main objective is to determine the correlation between the level of maternal tryptase and
      that of the newborn in cord blood immediately after birth in order to estimate the
      transplacental passage of this molecule.

      -  The protocole will be explain to the family in delivery room, an information note will
           be given, and we will let the time to think about it.

        -  In a second time investigator will make the mother sign a consent, that participant
           could retract any time then.

        -  A blood sample will be taken from the mother within 2 hours of delivery, using a
           standard blood test.

        -  A sample will be taken from the infant by blood drawn from the umbilical cord
           (non-invasive and painless sample).

        -  A final blood sample from your newborn will be collected at the time of the Guthrie test
           (systematic screening for congenital diseases) already scheduled for the new born on the
           third day of life.

        -  This blood sample will be sent to the immunology laboratory of the Clermont-Ferrand
           University Hospital where specific biological assays will be carried out.

        -  Blood samples will be stored for future use in studies.

        -  A collection of data concerning the child, childbirth and the results of biological
           analyzes will be carried out. All data will be coded.

        -  A phone call will be made at 3 months of life, to review the state of the child's health
           during his first months of life.
