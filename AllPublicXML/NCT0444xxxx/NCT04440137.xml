      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of oral health promotion in the prevention of ECC
      (early childhood caries) in bottle-fed children. Half of the patient will receive oral health
      promotion which emphasizing more on the benefit of stopping the bottle feeding habit, a
      free-flow cup and oral hygiene kit which include a toothbrush, toothpaste (1000ppm fluoride).
      The other half of the patient will receive standard of care oral hygiene promotion and oral
      hygiene kit which include a toothbrush, toothpaste (1000ppm fluoride)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Malaysia, even though there are decreasing trend in caries prevalence from a survey
      conduct in 1995 to 2015 (87.1% 1995, 76.2% 2005 and 71.3% 2015) [NOHPS 2015], yet the
      difference is just 15.8% in a period of 20 years. One of the factors which contribute to the
      development of ECC in children in prolonged bottle-feeding. Many literatures had mentioned
      association of bottle feeding and ECC however there are no controlled studies done on the
      effect of bottle feeding and ECC. Despite antenatal oral health promotion program done by
      Ministry of Health Malaysia and incorporation of oral hygiene education and oral hygiene
      instruction during dental visit, the prevalence of ECC remains high. This study will provide
      evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral health promotion in preventing early childhood
      caries by early termination of bottle feeding in toddlers.
