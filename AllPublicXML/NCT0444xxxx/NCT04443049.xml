  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the available first line palliative therapy for advanced HCC is Sorafenib and
      Lenvatinib of which Lenvatinib is tolerated better. Unfortunately, patients tend to progress
      after few months of therapy. Therefore it is imperative, to do trials by combinative therapy
      to the available therapy for added survival benefits and quality of life with advanced HCC.
      In this regard, Mebendazole appears to be a good choice for drug repurposing as it has shown
      very promising results either alone or in combination with other therapies in tumors of GI
      origin and CNS tumors. With regard to HCC Mebendazole has been found to be effective in vitro
      system of HCC and preclinical models. However no clinical trials have been initiated till
      now. The key hallmark features of HCC include activation of MAPK and angiogenesis which in
      turn are targeted by RTK inhibitors such as Sorafenib and Lenvatinib. In this regard
      Mebendazole has broad range of action by not only inhibiting angiogenesis and pro-survival
      pathways of MAPK, but by also inhibiting the secretion of MMPs and Tubulin polymerization
      which can all be beneficial in tumor regression and prevention of chemo-resistance in HCC.
      Mounting of a strong immune response plays an important role in identification of tumor
      antigen and thereby clearing of tumors. While Mebendazole can modulate the tumor, the data is
      scant with respect to the role of the drug. Hence repurposing Mebendazole as a combinatorial
      therapy appears a promising approach and forms the basis of the present work. We hypothesize
      that combinatorial therapy of addition of mebendazole to lenvatinib will prove more
      beneficial than lenvatinib alone in increasing the overall survival of patients with advanced
      HCC. To prove the mechanistic effects of mebendazole on HCC, we will also conduct a animal
      study in preclinical mice model of HCC with the help of our animal house facility. The animal
      study will help us to understand the additional benefits from mebendazole and lenvatinib with
      objective evidence of liver biopsy which is not feasible in humans.

      (A) STUDY HYPOTHESIS

        -  Mebendazole augments response of lenvatinib by synergistic response.

        -  Addition of anti angiogenic drugs (lenvatinib and mebendazole) to hypoxic environment
           generated post locoregional therapy like TACE leads to more effective control of
           advanced HCC resulting in improvement in overall survival.

      (B) AIM: To compare the efficacy of combination of mebendazole with lenvatinib in cirrhotics
      with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

      (C) OBJECTIVE:

      Primary objective:

      To compare the efficacy of combination of mebendazole with lenvatinib in improving the
      overall survival at 15 months in cirrhotics with advanced HCC.

      Secondary objective:

        1. To compare the progression free survival with combination therapy of mebendazole and
           lenvatinib in advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

        2. To compare the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and clinical
           benefit rate (CBR) with combinative therapy of mebendazole and lenvatinib in advanced
           HCC.

        3. To study therapy related adverse effects of mebendazole in cirrhotics.

        4. To develop pre-clinical HCC animal model to prove the added efficacy of combination
           therapy.

      (D)STUDY DESIGN Type of study - Single center, prospective, open label, randomized control
      study Study population - cirrhosis of liver of any etiology with advanced HCC undergoing at
      ILBS Study duration - 22 months from the date of approval of IEC Sample size - Considering
      mebendazole adds 2 months more to lenvatinib which offers 13 months overall survival, power
      of the study as 80 %, attrition rate as 30 %, alpha error of 5%, sample size will be 85
      patients in each arm ( totally 170 patients).

      (F) Methodology: Cirrhotics with advanced HCC proven by imaging and or biopsy or cytology,
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. They may undergo 1 or 2
      sessions of locoregional therapy (TACE/ SBRT/RFA) if feasible. All patients will undergo
      complete physical examination, CBC, LFT, KFT, INR, AFP, PIVKAII, CEMRI/ CECT upper abdomen
      (Triple phase ), UGI endoscopy at baseline before randomization.

      Randomization:

      Those patients who are not feasible for locoregional therapy will be randomized at baseline.
      Those patients undergoing locoregional therapy will be randomized after 1 month of last
      locoregional therapy (patient may undergo maximum of two sessions of locoregional therapy
      before randomization). The response will be determined by m RECIST criteria before
      randomization. Those patients requiring further sessions of locoregional therapy beyond two
      sessions will not be randomized into study.

      Patient will be then randomized to one of the two groups Arm I :Lenvatinib +Placebo(
      Lenvatinib will be given once a day(OD) orally at dose of 8 mg if body weight is &lt; 60 kg and
      12 mg if body weight is &gt; 60 kg ) with placebo (Tab Mecovit) orally twice a day (BD) daily
      Arm II : Lenvatinib and mebendazole ( Lenvatinib will be given orally once a day (OD) at dose
      of 8 mg if body weight is &lt; 60 kg and 12 mg if body weight is &gt; 60 kg) and mebendazole will
      be given at dose of 100 mg orally twice a day (BD) daily

      Follow-up Patients will be followed up with clinical events, CBC, LFT, KFT, INR, AFP,
      PIVKAII, CEMRI/ CECT upper abdomen (Triple phase ) at the end of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months,
      9 months, 12 months and 15 months.
