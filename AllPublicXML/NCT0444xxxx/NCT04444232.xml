  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial examines cancer communication within Hispanic social networks. Hispanics have the
      lowest colorectal cancer screening rate of any major ethnic group and health interventions
      are crucially needed among Hispanics. Patient decision aids are health communication
      interventions designed to provide patients with targeted health information and have shown to
      improve colorectal cancer screening rates among Hispanics. The goal of this study is to
      investigate, in a sample of Hispanics, how a colorectal cancer decision aid aimed at
      increasing individuals' colorectal cancer screening behavior has effects on their alters'
      intention to get screened for colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants view an educational video on cancer and cancer screening options over 12
      minutes. Participants also complete a phone survey over 10-15 minutes before attending the
      video session and 2 months after the video session.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' communication with their families, friends, and co-workers about colorectal cancer (CRC) screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using a single dichotomized question with two response options ('yes' or 'no'). CRC communication constitutes in-person conversation, email, phone, or post on social media (e.g., blog, Twitter, Facebook). Will also assess the characteristics of the alters by asking the patients two questions on social-tie dimensions: 1) contact frequency (never, rarely, sometimes, often, or very often) and 2) personal relationship (acquaintance , close friend , co-worker, relatives, or spouse).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alters' intent to become screened for CRC in the next six months</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intent will be assessed using a single categorical item with three response options (definitely planning to be screened, considering being screened, not considering being screened).</description>
