  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music that is familiar and preferred by patients has been shown to heighten neuroplasticity
      and can mitigate these disabilities. Therefore, this study seeks to explore the effect of
      providing patient preferred music to patients in the very early post stroke period (within 24
      hours of a left cerebral artery stroke [LMCA]event) as a complementary modality to usual
      stroke care.

      Aim I. The primary aim of MASTER is to identify whether a potential relationship exists
      between an intervention of participant preferred music, when initiated within the first 24
      hours following a left middle cerebral artery stroke, and a reduction in the following
      disabilities: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit and post stroke depression.
      This aim will serve to address the first research hypothesis and address the relationship
      between These disabilities are well known sequalae among patients diagnosed with the most
      common form of stroke, a LMCA stroke. Participant preferred music within the first 24 hours
      following a LMCA stroke and a reduction in: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit
      and post stroke depression, as these disabilities are well known sequalae among LMCA stroke
      patients.

      Aim II. The second aim of MASTER is to identify if a relationship exists between an
      intervention of audible books, when initiated within the first 24 hours following a LMCA
      stroke, and a reduction in the following disabilities: Expressive aphasia, right hand
      functional deficit and post stroke depression.

      Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that although listening to books stimulates cognitive
      function, the effect of melody and participant engagement in music is far superior to
      listening to words alone as the inherent rhythmicity of patient-favored music has been shown
      to strengthen synchronous neuronal connectivity, by modulating dopamine and inducing fine
      grained neuroanatomical changes in a recovering brain.

    <measure>expressive aphasia measured by use of the WAB-R</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in expressive aphasia will be measured by use of the WAB-R. Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB- R).This instrument is intended to provide a standardized measure of aphasia type and severity. Implementation of the instrument takes 15 approximately minutes to complete. THE WAB-R identifies and classifies 8 aphasia types: Global, Broca's, Isolation, Transcortical Motor, Wernicke's, transcortical Sensory, Conduction and Anomic. The WAB-R assesses linguistic skills more frequently affected by aphasia. Participants will be assessed at enrollment, discharge from hospital and again at 1,3,6 months post stroke.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>motor activity right hand as measured using the Motor Activity log</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in right hand motor activity and function will be assessed using the Motor Activity Log. The Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a semi-structured interview for hemiparetic stroke patients to assess the use of their paretic arm and hand Target tasks include object manipulation (e.g. pen, fork, comb, and cup) as well as the use of the arm during gross motor activities (e.g. transferring to a car, steadying oneself during standing, pulling a chair into a table while sitting). Participants will be assessed at enrollment, discharge from hospital and again at 1,3,6 months post stroke.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms as measured using the PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A change in depressive symptoms will be assessed using the PHQ-9. The PHQ-9 will be used for screening for depression, as it has been identified as the preferred (gold standard) screening tool for depression among post stroke patients in hospitals. The PHQ-9 takes less than 5 minutes to administer, and has been shown to have superior sensitivity and specificity.</description>
