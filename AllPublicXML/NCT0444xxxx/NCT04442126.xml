  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2, dose-escalation study with
      expansion cohorts to evaluate NM21-1480 for safety and immunogenicity, to determine the
      maximal tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose, define the pharmacokinetics, to explore
      the pharmacodynamics, and to obtain preliminary evidence of the clinical activity in adult
      patients with selected advanced solid tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part A

          -  Patients with any previously treated solid tumor-type other than hepatocellular
             carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma that is advanced, or recurrent and
             progressing since last anti-tumor therapy, and for which no alternative, standard
             therapy exists.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy must have been completed at
             least 4 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug, and patient
             has recovered

        Part B:

          -  Patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Squamous Cell Cancer Head and Neck
             (SCCHN) and basket cohort consisting of melanoma, gastric or gastro-esophageal
             junction adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma with locally
             advanced or metastatic, non-resectable disease, which has progressed despite treatment
             with anti-programmed cell death protein (anti-PD-1) or anti-programmed death-ligand 1
             (anti-PD-L1) monotherapy or anti-PD1/chemotherapy or anti-PD-L1/chemotherapy

          -  Prior therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the administration of
             the first dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient previously had known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or
             idiosyncrasy to the excipients

          -  Treatment with any PD-1, or Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein (CTLA)-4
             directed antibody or with any other immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to initiation
             of the study drug.

          -  Part A: Use of other biological investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any
             indication), including use of investigational drugs targeting CD137/4-1BB within at
             least 5 half-lives (or within 8 weeks, whatever is longer) prior to the administration
             of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Part B: Use of other biological drugs (marketed or investigational) for treatment of
             the current cancer other than anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 directed
             antibodies.

          -  Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease.
