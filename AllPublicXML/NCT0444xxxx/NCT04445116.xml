  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of using an Endeavor™ application as a treatment
      modality for cognitive impairments in the pediatric MS population. Participants will be asked
      to undergo a hour-long baseline evaluation, followed by at-home Endeavor™ application
      sessions. Subjects will complete the User Experience Feedback Form weekly on REDCap and at
      the end of the study. They will undergo another hour-long follow-up evaluation at the end of
      the study.

      Duration of subject participation in this study is anticipated to take 3-4 months. After
      consent/assent, participants will complete an one hour-long baseline study visit in-person at
      the MSCCC, or through a video visit. During this visit, participants will complete a
      neuropsychological evaluation and baseline study surveys and get trained on the use of the
      Endeavor™ video game. Participants will then be instructed to target a completion of at-home
      game play 5 days a week, for a total period of 8 weeks, using their own iOS mobile device, or
      a study-provided device if needed, approximately 25-30 minutes each day. Subjects will be
      instructed to complete the User Experience Feedback Form weekly via REDCap to assess
      feasibility and acceptability of Endeavor™. At the conclusion of participation, participants
      will complete an hour long neuropsychological evaluation and end of study User Experience
      Feedback Form via REDCap (in-person at the MSCCC, or through a telehealth video visit).

    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue form will be completed by the adult MS patients (7 questions). The PROMIS Fatigue instrument evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms that likely decrease the subjects' ability to carry out daily activities and might have an influence on cognitive function and processing speed.</description>

    <description>The MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQoL) 54 Instrument is a health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items and will be completed by the adult MS patients enrolled in this study. The instrument consists of 54 self-report items and yields two summaries, a health composite summary and a mental health composite summary.</description>

    <measure>Change in behaviors in pediatric participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), End of study (Day 60)</time_frame>
    <description>To determine and control for depressive and other behavioral symptoms on cognitive functioning, the Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children Third Edition (BASC-III) will be administered to pediatric MS subjects in this study. The assessments describe specific behaviors that are rated on a four-point scale of frequency, ranging from Never to Almost Always and include statements such as &quot;My parents listen to what I say&quot; and &quot;I like to take risks.&quot; This 189-item assessment will help in determining behavioral patterns. These rating scales are performed on a computer.</description>

    <description>Endeavor™ is a digital, non-drug investigational treatment that is delivered through an action video game and is designed to target cognitive deficits in adolescence and young adults with pediatric onset MS. Endeavor™ is an investigational product, meaning that it is currently being tested and is not yet cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</description>
