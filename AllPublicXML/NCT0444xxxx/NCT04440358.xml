    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Exablate Model
      4000 Type 2 system when used as a tool to open the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in subjects with
      recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) undergoing carboplatin monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to establish the
      safety and feasibility of blood-brain-barrier disruption (BBBD) combined with intravenous
      carboplatin for the treatment of rGBM using the Exablate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 system.
      Adult glioblastoma subjects that are planned for carboplatin chemotherapy will be considered
      for study enrollment. Eligible subjects will undergo up to 6 cycles of Exablate BBBD
      procedures in conjunction with carboplatin chemotherapy.

    <description>Carboplatin will be administered via IV infusion about every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles. The dosage will be calculated based on subject's creatinine level. On the day of planned carboplatin therapy, subjects will undergo Exablate procedure to open the blood-brain-barrier in the targeted cancerous brain areas prior to carboplatin administration.</description>
