  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase angle, derived from bioimpedance analysis (BIA), reflects tissue quality and quantity
      in which cell mass, membrane integrity and hydration state are represented. Phase angle, as a
      measure of body composition, changes with the physical condition of patients and is
      associated with survival in several disease states and during ICU admission. Aim of the study
      is to explore the predictive value of the phase angle for long term ICU outcome.

      is to explore the predictive value of the phase angle for long term ICU survival.

      A single-centre prospective observational cohort will be performed with consecutive patients,
      elective and non elective, admitted to the ICU between 1st June 2018 and 1st June 2019.
      Demographic data, APACHE III, comorbidity and phase angle are collected and the ICU- ,
      hospital- and 6 months survival will be registered.
