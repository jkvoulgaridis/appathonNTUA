      This is a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel, phase II clinical
      efficacy study evaluating NORS for the treatment of COVID-19 in individuals with Suspected
      mild COVID-19 Infection.

    <textblock>
      Up to 300 subjects will be enrolled into one of two cohorts of this study in a ratio of 1:1
      (Treatment: Placebo Control). Subjects will be screened and randomized into one of two
      parallel cohorts.

        -  Treatment (N = up to 150): Subjects will be enrolled and receive daily NORS treatment
           for 14 days for the full duration with a follow-up visit on Day 28 post randomization.

        -  Placebo (N = up to 150): Subjects will be enrolled and receive a placebo for 14 days for
           the full duration with a follow-up visit on Day 28 post randomization.
