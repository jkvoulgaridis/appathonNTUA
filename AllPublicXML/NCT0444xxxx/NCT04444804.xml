  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researcher in this study want to compare the effectiveness of Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) versus
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and phenprocoumon for the treatment and secondary
      prevention of venous thromboembolism by evaluating routine clinical practice data from
      research database in Germany. VTE is defined by a blood clot in the leg or lower extremity
      (deep vein thrombosis) or a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism). Treatment of VTE
      traditionally consists of acute anticoagulation treatment with heparin (mainly LMWH),
      followed by maintenance oral anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists (in Germany mainly
      phenprocoumon). Rivaroxaban, a direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC), is an alternative
      VTE treatment and has been approved for both the acute and maintenance phase of VTE
      treatment. The study will enroll adult male or female patients who are newly diagnosed with
      VTE and are already on the treatment with Rivaroxaban or LMWH and phenprocoumon. Researchers
      are especially interested whether patients experience under treatment any VTE events or fatal
      bleedings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one new diagnosis of VTE during the inclusion period:

          -  Ambulatory diagnosis, coded as verified,

          -  Primary hospital discharge diagnosis.

          -  Secondary hospital discharge diagnosis The quarter of the first VTE diagnosis in the
             inclusion period will be defined as the index quarter. For hospital diagnoses, the
             date of admission will be used to define the index quarter.

          -  The 12 months prior to the index date will define the baseline period for all included
             patients. Patients treated with anticoagulation regimens other than defined above
             (e.g. other DOACs) will not be included in the study. All patients will have to
             fulfill the additional inclusion criteria:
