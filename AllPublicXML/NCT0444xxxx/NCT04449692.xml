      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of low-dose dasiglucagon (Zealand Pharma,
      Denmark) to oral carbohydrate consumption for prevention of s.c. insulin-induced hypoglycemia
      in CSII- and MDI-treated people with type 1 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Near-normalization of blood glucose levels through intensive insulin therapy has shown to
      reduce the risk of diabetes late complications, but the approach is associated with two major
      side effects: hypoglycemia and weight gain. Although management of hypoglycemia through oral
      carbohydrate consumption is generally effective, the approach can lead to excessive
      carbohydrate intake and cause rebound hyperglycemia. It has previously been demonstrated that
      subcutaneous (s.c.) low-dose glucagon can be utilized to effectively treat mild hypoglycemia
      in people with type 1 diabetes. However, the instability in aqueous solution of currently
      available glucagon and the need for reconstitution with sterile water immediately prior to
      administration has limited its clinical role outside emergency settings. Due to the stability
      and ready-to-use formulation, dasiglucagon does not hold the limitations known for the
      currently available glucagon preparations.

      The aim of this randomized, partially single-blinded, three-arm cross-over study is to
      compare the efficacy of low-dose dasiglucagon (80 and 120 μg) to oral carbohydrate (15 g)
      consumption for prevention of s.c. insulin-induced hypoglycemia in CSII- and MDI-treated
      people with type 1 diabetes. On each study visit (separated by ≥ 3 days), an initial insulin
      bolus will be administered (at t = 0) aiming for a plasma glucose (PG) level of 3.0 mmol/l.
      When reaching 4.5 mmol/l, the intervention (s.c. dasiglucagon or oral carbohydrates) will be
      administered (t-intervention = 0), whereafter PG will me monitored for an additional 180 min.
