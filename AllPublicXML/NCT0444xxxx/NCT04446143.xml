  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to evaluate if mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) will improve satisfaction and reduce anxiety during a urodynamic study
      (UDS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic studies (UDS) are used to measure the functionality of the bladder and urethra to
      be able to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). UDS consists of catheterization,
      uroflow and cystometrogram. Intravesical, vaginal or rectal transducer placements, and
      placement of perineal electrodes are part of the study protocol. During the study the bladder
      will be filled slowly with sterile fluid and the patient will be asked about sensation of
      filling. At the end of the study the patient will be asked to void.

      Although beneficial for diagnosis of underlying LUTS, UDS maybe associated with heightened
      patient anxiety and feeling of discomfort. In a recently published pilot study, it was shown
      that a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) protocol may help improve a patient's
      emotional health and perception of UDS. To validate the findings from this previous study,
      the current study aims to implement a MBSR protocol in a randomized prospective study.
      Patients scheduled for UDS will be randomized into two groups. One group will listen to
      mindfulness meditation prior to the UDS and the other group won't.

      All patients will complete validated questionnaires to assess their satisfaction, anxiety and
      pain level as well as lower urinary tract symptoms before and after intervention.
