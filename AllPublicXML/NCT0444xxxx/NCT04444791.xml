      Purpose: To investigate the growth and development status for children of 1 ~ 3 years old in
      China, and to explore and analyze the influencing factors of infant growth. Mother's health
      status would also be investigated simultaneously.

      Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter prospective cohort study. Participants were all
      from the Chinese Pregnant Women Cohort Study (CPWCS), which is a multicenter prospective
      cohort study we conducted before. In simple terms, pregnant women during the first trimester
      (5~13 weeks' gestational age) were included from 25 July 2017 to 26 November 2018. Related
      information were collected by electronic self-administered questionnaire, including general
      information, environmental exposure assessment, physical activity assessment, dietary and
      nutritional assessment, depression assessment, sleep quality assessment and economic burden
      assessment. Subsequently, objective medical information, obstetric and neonatal outcomes were
      collected through hospital information system (HIS).

      To further assess the mothers' and infants' health status, a new multicenter prospective
      cohort study, including more than 1000 participants of the CPWCS from 5 hospitals of 5
      different provinces in China, will be conducted. Through the electronic self-administered
      questionnaire surveys and laboratory testing methods, information about infants' feeding,
      sleeping, defecating, oral health, early development and common allergic diseases will be
      collected. And we will also assess mothers' current health habits and status, such as
      sleeping, diet, anxiety, physical activity, and oral health. SAS statistical software will be
      used for data analysis.

      Ethics and Dissemination Permission for the study was obtained from Chinese Academy of
      Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Ethics approval was obtained from the
      Ethics Review Committee of Department of Scientific Research, School of Basic Medicine,
      Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China. The results will be published in peer-reviewed
      journals or disseminated through conference presentations.

        In the Chinese Pregnant Women Cohort Study (CPWCS), more than 9000 pregnant women were
        recruited from 25 July 2017 to 26 November 2018 during their routine antenatal check at the
        first trimester. Five hospitals of 5 different provinces in China with certain working
        foundation, good cooperation and high follow-up rate of pregnant women in the CPWCS were
        selected as study sites for the new cohort of the Chinese Pregnant Women Cohort
        Study-Offspring Follow-up (CPWCS-OF). From these 5 hospitals, mothers with the baseline
        information, first trimester questionnaire, delivery outcomes, and neonatal outcomes data
        completed, and had live birth and singleton were included. According to the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria, 1978 mothers with their infants were selected as the research objects.
