  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single, ascending-dose design with five dose-cohorts of 8 subjects. Forty healthy adults
      aged 18 to 45, inclusive, will be recruited and admitted at one US site. Each subject will be
      randomized to receive either SAR440894 or matching placebo via 60-minute intravenous
      infusion. In each cohort of 8 subjects, the randomization ratio will be 6 active to 2
      placebo, and 2 sentinel subjects (one from each active and placebo group) will be dosed
      first. Dosing of the next dose-cohort will be dependent on acceptable meeting predefined
      safety criteria in the preceding cohort. Each subject's participation will take place over
      approximately 150 days, not including the screening visit. There are no hypotheses for this
      phase I study. The primary objective will be to determine the safety of single ascending
      intravenous (IV) infusions of SAR440894 when administered in healthy adults.

      intravenous (IV) infusions of SAR440894 when administered in healthy adults. The secondary
      objectives are: 1) to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending doses of
      60-minute IV infusions SAR440894 in healthy adults and 2) to asses the immunogenicity of
      single ascending doses of 60-minute IV infusions SAR440894 in healthy adults.
