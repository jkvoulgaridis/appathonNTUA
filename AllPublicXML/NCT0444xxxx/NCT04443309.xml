      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Lenvatinib
      combined with Camrelizumab as first-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma.The target sample size is 53.In the first phase 6 panticipants was evaluated
      (N=3+3), If there was no obvious dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then entered the extended
      phase (N=47).Treatment continually until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or
      patients withdrawal of consent.
