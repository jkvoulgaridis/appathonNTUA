    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled study designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib given in combination with atezolizumab
      versus a second novel hormonal therapy (NHT) in men with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have previously been treated with one, and only one, NHT for
      their prostate cancer disease.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib (XL184) in
      combination with atezolizumab versus a second NHT (abiraterone or enzalutamide) in subjects
      with mCRPC who have previously been treated with one, and only one, NHT (e.g. abiraterone,
      apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) to treat metastatic castration-sensitive prostate
      cancer (mCSPC), non-metastatic CRPC (M0 CRPC), or mCRPC, and who have measurable extrapelvic
      disease. The multiple primary efficacy endpoints comparing the experimental arm and control
      arm are Duration of Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by Blinded Independent
      Radiology Committee (BIRC) and Duration of Overall Survival (OS). The secondary efficacy
      endpoint is Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 per BIRC.
