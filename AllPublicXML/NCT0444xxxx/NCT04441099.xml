    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study will evaluate the recommended dose for further clinical
      development, safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of NBE-002, a novel anti-ROR1 antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.
