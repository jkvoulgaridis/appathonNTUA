    <textblock>
      A Phase II trial to study the effectiveness and security of cisplatin concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy plus TIL versus cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy only in treating
      patients with FIGO stage IIIA to IVA cervical carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was the standard treatment for locoregionally advanced
      cervical cancer, while the incidence of treatment failure is still high. Adjuvant
      chemotherapy or inducing chemotherapy addition to CCRT did not significantly improve patient
      survival compared to CCRT alone. Hence, there is a need for novel therapies to improve
      survival for these patients.

      Accumulating evidence shows that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) selected for tumor
      recognition and greatly expanded in vitro are effective for treating cervical cancer
      patients.

      This is a phase II trial to study the effectiveness and security of cisplatin concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy plus TIL versus cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy only in treating
      patients with FIGO stage IIIA to IVA cervical carcinoma.
