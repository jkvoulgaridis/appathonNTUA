  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aims of this project are to: 1) create a developmentally appropriate interactive
      educational website for adolescents called DigiKnowIt News: Teen, and 2) examine the
      feasibility of DigiKnowIt News: Teen in a small randomized control trial with adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth (N=30) will be recruited to participate in the feasibility study. Parent permission and
      youth assent will be sought. Participants will be randomized into one of two study arms:
      intervention and wait-list control. All participants will complete a web-based pre-test
      questionnaire. Youth in the intervention group will then receive access to DigiKnowIt News:
      Teen for one week. Approximately one week after completing the pre-test questionnaire, all
      participants will complete a web-based post-test questionnaire (the post-test for youth in
      the intervention group will also include Consumer Satisfaction Questions). Youth in the
      wait-list control group will then receive access to DigiKnowIt News: Teen for one week. After
      one week, they will complete a Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire.

    <measure>Change from baseline knowledge at 1 week</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Youth will respond to 25 questions that assess their factual knowledge about clinical research (e.g., Who is part of a clinical trial?). Questions are in multiple choice format and some questions have multiple correct answers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline attitudes and beliefs at 1 week</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Youth will be asked to respond to questions that assess their positive attitudes about clinical trials (e.g., How do you feel about kids participating in clinical trials?; 1=Not good at all; 2=Not very good; 3=Not sure; 4=Good; 5=Very good) and questions that assess their beliefs about positive aspects of pediatric clinical research (e.g., I believe that clinical trials can help kids; 1=Strongly Disagree; 2=Disagree; 3=Unsure; 4=Agree; 5=Strongly Agree).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline self-efficacy at 1 week</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Youth will be asked to respond to questions related to their self-efficacy for making decisions related to participation in clinical trials (e.g., How sure are you that you can do the following things: Ask my parents questions for more information about clinical trials?; 1 = I cannot do it at all; 5 = I know I can do it. Youth will be asked to respond to additional items to measure youths' confidence for participating clinical trials (e.g., I know what rights I have in a clinical trial. I know whom to ask if I need more information about a clinical trial.; 1=Strongly Disagree; 2=Disagree; 3=Unsure; 4=Agree; 5=Strongly Agree).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from procedural fears at 1 week</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Youth will be asked to respond to questions related to their perceptions of fear or anxiety about different types of medical procedures, including getting a needle in the arm, injection in the leg, getting a scan, and taking new medicine, on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all afraid or anxious, 2 = Somewhat afraid or anxious, 3 = Moderately afraid or anxious, 4 = Very afraid or anxious, 5 = Extremely afraid or anxious).</description>
