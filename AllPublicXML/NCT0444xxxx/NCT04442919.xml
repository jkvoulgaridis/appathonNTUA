  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor and its active metabolite in patients who received ticagrelor
      followed with methoxyflurane versus ticagrelor followed with morphine or ticagrelor alone due
      to unstable angina pectoris

    <textblock>
      Results of the IMPRESSION trial published in 2015 proved that morphine use in patients with
      acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is associated with undesirable impact on pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ticagrelor. Despite that, morphine is still a standard analgesic
      treatment in ACS patients and it should not be routinely withdrawn. Based on contemporary
      knowledge, morphine, acting via mi-opioid receptors, was found to inhibit gastrointestinal
      motility or induce adverse effects such as nausea or vomiting.

      We decided to design a clinical study aiming to evaluate the impact of methoxyflurane on PD
      of ticagrelor in patients diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris (UA). Methoxyflurane is an
      inhaled anesthetic, registered in Poland in emergency medicine for pain alleviation in trauma
      patients. The drug was widely used in 1960s to induce general anesthesia, however its
      clinical utility was reduced with the development of novel anesthetic agents. Taking into
      account its different mechanism of action, it can be presumed that, contrary to morphine, no
      respiratory depression should be observed as well as no attenuation or delay of
      antiaggregatory effect of ticagrelor should occur, as no interaction with mi-receptor in
      gastrointestinal tract is related to activity of methoxyflurane.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into the study arms as follows: 1) 180 mg
      ticagrelor (2 integral tablets of 90 mg ticagrelor) followed by 3 mg inhaled methoxyflurane,
      2) 180 mg ticagrelor followed by 5 mg intravenous morphine, 3) 180 mg ticagrelor alone
