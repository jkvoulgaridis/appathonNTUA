  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing opioid epidemic has altered both how physicians prescribe narcotics and patients'
      perceptions of those prescriptions. Along with increased scrutiny regarding the quantity of
      opioids that be may prescribed after acute injury, for chronic conditions and following
      surgery the healthcare industry as a whole continues to search for alternative medications
      that provide adequate pain relief and have a reduced tendency for abuse/dependence/addition.
      To that end this study has the following aims:

        1. To evaluate the amount of opioids consumed following minimally invasive, female pelvic
           surgery when patients' postoperative pain is managed via:

             1. Acetaminophen plus Ibuprofen plus breakthrough pain opioids (Standard protocol)

             2. Acetaminophen plus Intranasal Ketorolac Tromethamine plus opioids for breakthrough
                pain (Sprix protocol)

        2. Patient satisfaction with the aforementioned methods

        3. Evaluate and compare pain scores via validated questionnaire

      Hypothesis:

      Primary:

      1. Patients prescribed intranasal Ketorolac (Sprix protocol) will consume significantly less
      Morphine Milliequivalents (mEqs) of narcotics compared to the standard protocol following
      minimally invasive female pelvic surgery.

      Secondary:

        1. Patients in the Sprix protocol will have lower Visual Analog Scale (VAS) measures of
           pain which will be measured on a 0-10 scale where 0 denotes no pain and 10 denotes
           maximum experience of pain

        2. Patients in the Sprix protocol will have lower numeric pain score and on POD#4

        3. Patients in the Sprix protocol will have higher Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40 )scores
           on POD#1

        4. Patients in the Sprix protocol will have higher QoR-40 scores on POD#4

        5. Patients will not have any significant difference in overall surgical satisfaction on
           POD#1 and POD#4 using a numerical satisfaction score

        6. Patients in the Sprix protocol will be more likely to consume no narcotics at all once
           discharged to home
