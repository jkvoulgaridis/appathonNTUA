  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a monitored group exercise program can
      increase strength, muscle mass and ability to move in women after treatment for early stage
      breast cancer.

      This trial will assess the safety and feasibility of a monitored group exercise regimen
      utilizing high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements in a
      group of women treated for early stage breast cancer with the goal of improving functional
      mobility, body composition, and strength after breast conservation therapy.

             week, scheduled during the day.

          9. Women must complete a Functional Mobility Screen (FMS) and determined safe to engage
             in the workout regimen by the study personnel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any treatment with chemotherapy for recent breast cancer treatment
