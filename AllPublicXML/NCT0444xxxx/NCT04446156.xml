  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy era, fatty liver has become an important cause of
      liver function damage in people living with HIV (PLWH). There are a large number of PLWH in
      China who are infected with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. HIV, hepatitis B virus,
      hepatitis C virus, drugs, alcohol, etc. affect each other, which makes the cause, diagnosis,
      and treatment of liver function damage in PLWH complicated in China.

      The investigators plan to conduct a large-scale questionnaire survey among PLWH in Zhejiang
      Province to assess liver function, detect liver Injuries early, and analyze HIV, hepatitis B
      virus, hepatitis C virus, anti-HIV drugs, alcohol and other factors associate with liver
      injuries in PLWH, to provide basis for the treatment and prevention of liver disease in PLWH
      in eastern China.
