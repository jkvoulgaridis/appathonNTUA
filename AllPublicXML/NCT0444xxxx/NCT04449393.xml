  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of enamel matrix derivative in addition to
      scaling and root planing in comparison to scaling and root planing only in periodontitis
      patients that have already undergone initial periodontal therapy and are in periodontal
      maintenance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) have already been widely applied as a regenerative
      bio-modulator in periodontal surgery and have been demonstrated to enhance periodontal
      regeneration. Recently, also its flapless, non-surgical application has been shown to have
      beneficial effects when applied during initial therapy of periodontitis.

      The present study is designed as a single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. We
      plan to include a total of 50 periodontitis patients that have already undergone initial
      periodontal therapy, but still show remaining sites with increased periodontal probing depth
      (PPD). Patients will be randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to either scaling and root planing
      (SRP) in combination with EMD application into the affected pockets (test group, n=25) or to
      SRP only (control group, n=25). Before treatment, as well as after 3, 6 and 12 months, we
      plan to assess site-specific periodontal parameters as well as whole-mouth oral hygiene
      indices. Furthermore, we intend to evaluate gingival crevicular fluid, as well as parameters
      representing periodontal disease activity.

    <description>Emdogain® FL is an enamel matrix derivative intended for subgingival and topical application in conjunction with scaling and root planing procedures to provide regeneration of tooth support lost due to periodontal disease. Emdogain® FL has been shown to be effective in residual pockets with probing depths from 5mm to 9mm with no furcation involvement in patients with adequate plaque control. Emdogain® FL has also been shown to enhance the early healing of periodontal soft tissue wounds resulting from the instrumentation of periodontal pockets.</description>
