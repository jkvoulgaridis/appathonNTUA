  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at the effect of Endovenous Mechano-Chemical Ablation (MOCA) in
      addition to multilayer elastic compression bandaging vs multilayer elastic compression
      bandaging only in patients with incompetent great saphenous vein (GSV) and venous ulcers
      (VU's).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most severe form of chronic venous disease is venous ulceration with an overall
      prevalence of about 1% in the adult population. Venous ulcers significantly impair quality of
      life, and their treatment places a heavy financial burden upon healthcare systems.

      To get the ulcer to heal, the current best treatment is to wear a compression bandage with
      multiple layers, with which about 60% of these ulcers will heal within 6 months.

      There is evidence that treatment of the varicose veins by sahenous veins stripping will
      prevent the ulcer recurrence.

      Recent studies have suggested that novel proceduress of superficial truncal reflux
      elimination, such as foam sclerotherapy or treating the saphenous veins with termal (laser or
      radiofrequency) ablation to seal it effectively, may help the ulcers to heal more quickly and
      increase recurrence-free rate. These techniques can be carried out in the outpatient setting
      and are much better tolerated by patients in comparison to surgery.

      At the same time, no studies which compared compression plus endovenous mechanochemical
      ablation (MOCA) vs. compression alone in chronic venous ulcers have been conducted to date.

      The aim of this study is to see whether treatment of varicose veins using MOCA helps with
      healing.
