  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement (THR) is associated with extensive tissue injury and considerable blood
      loss that can be complicated by hyperfibrinolysis with an increased need for blood
      transfusion. THR in patients with cancer involving the hip joint, can reduce pain and improve
      or maintain the function and quality of life. However, these patients have an increased
      likelihood of haemostatic abnormalities, such as thrombosis or extensive blood loss.
      Rotational thromboelastometry is a point-of-care viscoelastic assay that can provide a
      measure of coagulation disorders in the above settings, and this is still under review. The
      objective of this prospective cohort study is to quantitate the changes in clot formation
      dynamics following THR with a subgroup analysis of patients with cancer.
