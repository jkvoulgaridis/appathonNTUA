  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Intestinal microbiota composition is fundamental to human health and undergoes
      critical changes within the first two years of life. Factors probably influencing the
      microbiota are the maternal microbiota and the general environment in Switzerland. However,
      the development of the intestinal microbiota is incompletely understood. Gaining knowledge of
      the trajectory of microbiota maturation is likely key to the understanding of the
      pathogenesis of many pathologies in childhood.

      Aims: The investigators aim for a deep understanding of the maturation of the healthy infant
      intestinal microbiota regarding composition, diversity and metabolic activities. The
      investigators aim for identifying parameters affecting microbiota maturation and effects of
      the microbiota on infant outcome.

      Methods: The investigators will recruit 120 pregnant mothers who will be followed as
      mother-baby pairs until 10 years of age. Infants will be followed clinically to determine
      adequate growth and development as well as pathology including abdominal pain.
      Epidemiological parameter and infant nutrition will be assessed. The investigators will
      collect biological samples such as stool, maternal milk, vaginal swaps, placenta swabs and
      skin swaps.

      Species composition and diversity will be assessed by 16S sequencing. Metagenomic shotgun
      sequencing and bacterial messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) analysis will inform about
      metabolic potential and metabolic activity of the microbiota. Mass spectrometry will assess
      the small molecule content of stool and maternal milk samples. Network analysis will be used
      to assess the complex relationships between bacteria metabolic activities and small molecular
      content.

      Expected results: The investigators expect an increase in complexity and metabolic potential
      and activity with age. Microbiota parameters will differ according to nutrition and might
      predict infant outcomes such as growth and abdominal pain. Systematic analysis of sequential
      maternal and infant bacteria samples from stool, skin and maternal milk will help
      characterizing bacterial transfer from mother to infant Conclusion: The investigators propose
      an observational study of healthy Bern mother baby pairs with clinical characterisation and
      biological sampling. Advanced analysis tools will be used to characterise the microbiota and
      address mechanistic questions.

      Methods for sample analysis:

      For the primary objective and outcome/ endpoint of the study, bacterial content of infant
      stool will be analyzed by:

        -  Mass spectrometry to assess intestinal content (metabolome). Techniques have been
           established in the laboratory of Prof. U. Sauer who already collaborated with the
           investigators' group in previous studies.

        -  16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing for bacterial species composition as
           well as microbial diversity.

        -  Bacterial full genome metagenomics shotgun sequencing to identify bacterial genes
           present (metabolic potential of the microbiota).

        -  Bacterial mRNA sequencing to assess transcription and a functional role of the
           microbiota (metabolic activity of microbiota).

        -  Analysis of the intestinal virome and eukaryotic intestinal populations by appropriate
           sequencing or culturing techniques.

        -  Analysis of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies in human milk and stool and the
           interaction of antibodies with intestinal bacteria.

      For the secondary endpoints identical analyses will be performed in skin swabs, maternal
      milk, maternal vaginal swabs, maternal placenta probes and maternal stool. Parameters for
      infant growth, neurodevelopment, immune maturation and potential occurrence of pathology will
      be assessed at every visit. Maternal and infant nutrition, hygiene, socioeconomic status and
      clinical history will be assessed by questionnaires at every visit.

      Further follow-up experiments with the acquired samples are possible. Specifically,
      individual bacteria strains can be isolated and cultured in vitro and also tested alone or in
      combination in experimental animals.

      Bacterial sequencing by the methods described above will also inevitably identify maternal or
      infant DNA sequences, since metagenomic shotgun sequencing cannot differentiate between
      bacterial and human DNA. These human DNA sequences will not be analyzed within the scope of
      this project. However, these sequences might be the subject of future studies. Study
      participants will therefore be asked for permission to analyze human DNA from mother and/ or
      child at the page for &quot;further analyses&quot; within the consent form. An option to &quot;opt out&quot; for
      human DNA analysis will be provided and refusal will not lead to exclusion from the study.

      Any findings of clear relevance to the health of the participant (i.e. mother or child) will
      be reported to the participant in collaboration with their treating pediatrician.
      Participants will need to inform the study team if they do not wish to be informed.
