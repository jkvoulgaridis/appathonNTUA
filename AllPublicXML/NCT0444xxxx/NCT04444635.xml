  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this work is to study the efficacy of ultrasound guided serratus anterior plane
      block in pediatric patients undergoing thoracic surgeries.

      It is a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective randomized controlled study. It is designed to estimate and compare the
      analgesic effect of single shot serratus anterior plane block in pediatric patients
      undergoing thoracic surgeries with fentanyl infusion versus fentanyl infusion alone as the
      control group. Our primary outcome will be the total dose of intra-operative fentanyl
      boluses.

      Randomization will be achieved by using an online random number generator. Blindness will be
      achieved by patient codes which will be placed into sequentially numbered sealed opaque
      envelopes by a research assistant who is not involved in the study. A physician not involved
      in patient management will be responsible for opening the envelope and give the instructions
      contained within each envelope to the anaesthesiologist who is expert in doing the serratus
      anterior plane block in patients included within the block group. This expert
      anaesthesiologist will not be involved in collecting data but another anaesthesia doctor will
      be responsible for patient management and collecting the intraoperative and postoperative
      data.

    <description>After induction of anesthesia, the patients will be put on the lateral position with the diseased side up. A linear ultrasound transducer will be placed in a sagittal plane over the mid-clavicular region of the thoracic cage.
Then counting down ribs till the fifth rib will be identified in the mid-axillary line. The following muscles will be identified overlying the fifth rib: the latissimus dorsi (superficial and posterior),teres major (superior) and serratus muscles (deep and inferior). Under complete sterile conditions, the needle (25 G needle) will be introduced in-plane with respect to the ultrasound probe targeting the plane superficial to the serratus anterior muscle. Then, 2 mg/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected with continuous ultrasound guidance. In addition to continuous fentanyl infusion</description>
