  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection of Botox into the bladder is a common treatment for overactive bladder.
      Postoperative bladder infection is one of the more frequently reported complications of this
      procedure. Prophylactic antibiotics given at the time of bladder Botox for the reduction of
      postoperative bladder infection have not been well studied. The main goal of our study is to
      determine if prophylactic antibiotics at the time of bladder Botox injection for the
      treatment of overactive bladder in women reduces postoperative bladder infection. The
      investigators are proposing a study which will randomize participants into two groups - one
      receiving Ciprofloxacin and the other receiving placebo pills for three days following the
      procedure. The primary outcome evaluated will be the difference in postoperative bladder
      infection between the two groups. The investigators will also investigate differences in
      reported side effects between the two groups possibly related to antibiotic use. Follow-up
      will be over six weeks following the procedure.

      This study will be a single-centred, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
      Recruitment will be undertaken at two Urogynecology/Urology sites associated with the
      University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. Participants will be randomized to treatment or
      placebo arm with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients and surgeons will be blinded.

      On the day of the procedure, a urine culture will be collected preoperatively to identify
      pre-existing bacteriuria. Technique and dose of Botox injection will be at the discretion of
      the operating physician. Trigone-sparing technique with injection of 100 to 200 units of
      Botox distributed across 10 to 20 sites is generally used at our centre.

      Follow-up will occur over a six-week postoperative period. A questionnaire will be used at
      each follow-up encounter to screen patients for urinary tract infection symptoms, voiding
      dysfunction, and other adverse events potentially related to the prophylactic antibiotics.
      Urine cultures will be collected to confirm infection for patients developing postoperative
      symptoms.
