  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is the major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, about
      15 million babies are born too soon every year, causing 1.1 million deaths, as well as short-
      and long-term disability in countless survivors. Few prognostic tests are available to
      predict PTB. A short transvaginal ultrasound cervical length (TVU CL) has been shown to be a
      good predictor of PTB.

      Other strategies have been adopted for prevention of PTB. The evidence supports the use of
      vaginal progesterone in singleton pregnancies with short cervix.

      However, the predictive value of the research has recently been questioned, as the threat
      rate from preterms in the low-risk population has not decreased over time. Numerous clinical
      studies have been conducted to improve and identify effective prevention strategies in the
      threat of preterm birth. Among the parameters studied, in addition to the measurement of the
      uterine cervix and its complaints during the three trimesters of pregnancy, an evaluation of
      the cervical consistency index (CCI) was also proposed, i.e. an ultrasound evaluation of
      cervical softness.

      Numerous clinical studies have been conducted to improve and identify effective prevention
      strategies in the threat of preterm birth. Among the parameters studied, in addition to the
      measurement of the uterine cervix and its changes during the three trimesters of pregnancy,
      the evaluation of the cervical consistency index (CCI), or an ultrasound evaluation of
      cervical softness, was also proposed.

      Reduced CCI values correspond to greater compressibility and cervical softness. Studies
      conducted to study cervical remodeling on animal models suggest an early increase in cervical
      softness that begins immediately after conception followed by shortening and dilation in the
      terminal stages of pregnancy so that minimal changes in cervicometry correspond to a
      significant increase in cervical softness . Therefore the study of the early stages of
      cervical remodeling, such as cervical softness through the ICC, could allow to identify in a
      timely manner women with an increased risk of preterm birth.

      The purpose of this study is to define and standardize the transvaginal technique to
      determine the CCI, its reference range and establish its potential predictive use in the
      threat of preterm birth before 32, 34 and 37 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to verify the hypothesis that the introduction of a universal
      screening program with TVU CL and CCI measurement, in the three trimesters of pregnancy, may
      be associated with a predictive ability to deliver preterm higher than current protocols.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, non-pharmacological, non-profit interventional study on women with single pregnancy without a history of previous preterm spontaneous birth. Cervical lenght (CL) and Consistence Cervical Index (CCI) will be assessed by transvaginal ultrasound. CL and CCI measurements will be performed in the first trimester, between 11 and 13 weeks + 6 days, in the second trimester, between 19 and 22 weeks and in the third trimester between 29 and 32 weeks during routine ultrasound examinations for monitoring of pregnancy, in accordance with current national guidelines.</intervention_model_description>
