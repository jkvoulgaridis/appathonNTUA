  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited mobility of the uterine cervix and alignment with the vaginal canal is often required
      during insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD). Currently, the available
      instruments are traumatic tenacula, which could cause pain and bleeding and therefore
      represent an obstacle for certain patients to pursue their medical follow-up.

      AspivixTM is a new device, which enables atraumatic traction of the cervix while respecting
      its specific semi-circular anatomic shape through a system powered by a vacuum chamber.

      The aim of our comparative study is to assess the patient's pain and bleeding using the
      AspivixTM device in comparison with a commonly used single-tooth tenaculum (Pozzi forceps).
      Additionally, the comparative study aims to assess and compare the safety of the AspivixTM
      device with the single-tooth tenaculum (Pozzi forceps).

      Note: Study is made of 2 phases (pilot phase followed by a comparative phase). Details
      regarding pilot study is registered separately.
