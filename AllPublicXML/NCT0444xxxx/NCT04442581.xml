  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib and pembrolizumab work for the first-line
      treatment of patients with liver cancer who are not eligible for local therapy (i.e. advanced
      stage). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some cell surface
      receptors and signaling pathways inside the tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer.
      Giving cabozantinib and pembrolizumab together may work better in treating patients with
      advanced liver cancer compared to cabozantinib or pembrolizumab alone.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up
      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Disease assessment
      by imaging will be performed every 9 weeks.

                  least 7 days before initiating study treatment

               -  Known active tuberculosis

               -  Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Patients with proteinuria &gt; 1+ on urine dipstick testing will undergo 24-hour urine
             collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein
             &gt;= 1 g/24 hours will be ineligible

          -  Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 480 ms per
             electrocardiogram (EKG) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment

               -  Note: If a single EKG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two
                  additional EKGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30
                  min after the initial EKG, and the average of these three consecutive results for
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility

          -  Inability to swallow tablets or any other condition that might interfere with oral
             absorption of medications

          -  Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to study drugs and/or any of their
             excipients

          -  Ongoing secondary malignancy that is progressing and/or has required active treatment
             within the past year. Adjuvant treatment for resected breast cancer is allowed

               -  Subjects with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma or the
                  skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that
                  have undergone potentially therapy are allowed

          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Note: HIV testing
             is not mandated for screening

          -  Co-infection with HBV (HBsAg [+] and /or detectable HBV DNA) and HCV (anti-HCV Ab [+]
             and detectable HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]) at study entry

          -  Co-infection with HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) at study entry

          -  Live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Known psychiatric illness, substance abuse disorder, or other condition that would
             interfere with the ability to comply with the requirements of the study

          -  Has history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator
