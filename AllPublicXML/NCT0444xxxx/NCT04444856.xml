    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will compare the clinical outcomes in women with an event of
      severe postpartum haemorrhage treated with NovoSeven® to clinical outcomes in women with an
      event of severe postpartum haemorrhage not treated with NovoSeven®. The study will be a
      single centre retrospective cohort study of women with an event of severe postpartum
      haemorrhage, defined as 1.5 L of blood loss within 24 hours of delivery, in the period of
      2005-2016.
