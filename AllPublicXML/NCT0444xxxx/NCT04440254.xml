  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and conduction
      disorders during a three-year follow-up using implantable Holter ECG monitoring in 40
      patients with Fabry disease. The secondary objectives are to analyze the correlations of
      these anomalies with changes in cardiac MRI and echocardiographic parameters as biological
      parameters and overall severity of the disease assessed by MSSI.

      The main objective of this non-blinded, monocentric non-randomized study is to assess the
      occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders (sinus dysfunction, branch block
      [BB], atrioventricular block [BAV], sustained [TVS] or non-supported [TVNS] ventricular
      tachycardias, atrial fibrillation [AF] during a three-year follow-up in 40 patients with
      Fabry disease (half with left ventricular hypertrophy) using an implantable Holter ECG device
      (Medtronic Reveal-LINQ™). The secondary objectives are to analyze the correlations (at 1, 2
      and 3 years) of these anomalies with the modifications of :

        -  cardiac MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] data at inclusion [M0] and at 36 months [M36]
           (left ventricular hypertrophy [HVG], amplitude of the T1 signal, extent of fibrosis);
           MRIs will be performed before implantation and after removal of the Holter to avoid the
           reading artifacts linked to the device.

        -  echocardiographic measurements of the left ventricle (overall longitudinal strain
           systolic [SGL] and ejection fraction [FE])

        -  biological parameters (BNP or NT-proBNP, ultra-sensitive troponin and Lyso-Gb3)

        -  the overall severity of the disease assessed by MSSI (Mainz Severity Score Index), DFG
           and proteinuria
