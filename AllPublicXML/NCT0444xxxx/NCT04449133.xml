  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common and serious of the sleep disorders.
      Long-term, OSA is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, with a number of adverse
      cardiovascular, neurocognitive, metabolic, and daytime functioning consequences. No drugs are
      currently approved for OSA treatment.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over, inpatient phase 2
      clinical trial to examine the efficacy and the safety of a fixed dose level of AD128 in
      patients with OSA.
