      Elderly (age 70 years or older) or &gt;18 years old AND poor risk (ECOG 2) newly diagnosed stage
      IIIA-C (AJCC 8th edition) inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are eligible
      to participate in this phase II open label study of concurrent, split course chemoradiation
      followed by Durvalumab (MEDI4736).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the study is to identify another cohort of stage III NSCLC for whom
      adjuvant Durvalumab can be safely given, expanding its utilization and benefits. With a
      unique, extremely well-tolerated 4-phase split course CRT regimen preceding the
      administration of Durvalumab, we expect to be able to offer adjuvant Durvalumab to a
      significant proportion of patients on study.

      Patients who have completed four cycles of chemoradiation (Radiation is 60 Gy in 30 fractions
      administered over 12 weeks with 1-1.5 week breaks between cycles; Chemotherapy is once every
      3 weeks for up to 4 cycles) will go on to receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy as 1500mg
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13
      doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48 until confirmed disease progression
      unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation
      criterion is met.

      Primary objectives are:

        1. To determine the percentage of poor risk and/or elderly unresectable stage III NSCLC
           patients who complete split course chemoradiation

        2. To determine the safety and tolerability of durvalumab (MEDI4736) after completion of
           chemoradiation in this group of patients.

      Secondary Objectives are:

        1. To determine the 1-year overall survival rate

        2. To determine the 1-year progression-free survival rate

        3. To determine the 1-year loco-regional progression-free survival rate

        4. To determine rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities with this regimen in the selected patient
           population

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social

             hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients
             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core
             antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for

                  Patients with endocrine AE of ≤Grade 2 are permitted to enroll if they are stably
                  maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.

               4. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than
