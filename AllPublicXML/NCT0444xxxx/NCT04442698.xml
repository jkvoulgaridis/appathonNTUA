  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is now or soon will be a worldwide epidemic. Diabetes has impact on both healthcare
      costs in addition to the costs in human lives, suffering and disability. Treatment that
      lowers Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) improved outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that both general
      surgery and bariatric procedures may improve or reverse diabetes. In several studies the
      Billroth II reconstruction following gastrectomy was the most effective surgical technique in
      improving or reversing Diabetes. The purpose of this study is to analyze the outcomes of the
      Mini-Gastric Bypass-Original Technique (MGB-OT) version of the One Anastomosis Bypass (OAGB)
      to investigate the association of a &quot;Tailored&quot; Bilio-pancreatic Limb Length (BPLL) with the
      HbA1c changes.

      There is general agreement that Diabetes is now or soon will be a worldwide epidemic. Studies
      also make clear the devastating impact of diabetes on both healthcare costs in addition to
      the costs in human lives, suffering and disability. It is also clear that treatment that
      lowers Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will result in improved outcomes proportional to the decrease,
      saving both lives and costs. Unfortunately medical and lifestyle therapy routinely result in
      less than ideal resolution of elevated HbA1c levels. Studies have demonstrated that both
      general surgery and bariatric procedures may improve or reverse diabetes. In several studies
      the Billroth II reconstruction following gastrectomy is the most effective surgical technique
      in improving or reversing Diabetes. The purpose of this study is to analyze the outcomes of
      the Mini-Gastric Bypass-Original Technique (MGB-OT) version of the One Anastomosis Bypass
      (OAGB) to investigate the association of a &quot;Tailored&quot; Bilio-pancreatic Limb Length (BPLL)
      with the HbA1c changes.
