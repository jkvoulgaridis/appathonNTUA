      BRIEF SUMMARY :

      In the most severe cases of brain injuries, intensive care may allow patients with altered
      consciousness to survive despite a significant risk of heavy sequelae. Persistent impairments
      of consciousness are currently categorized according to behavior in three main neurological
      categories: comatose state, vegetative state (recently named unresponsive wakefulness
      syndrome) and minimally conscious state. Refining the diagnosis of internal state is a major
      goal to determine the abilities for an optimal recovery of cognitive deficit. Circadian
      rhythms are implicated in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles but also in cognitive
      functions. Their role is actually revaluated in the mechanisms of consciousness impairment.
      First, it is well known that cognitive performances partially depend on such rhythms as they
      are more elevated during the day and correlated to the hormonal secretion. In a prognostic
      point of view, fewer rhythmic perturbations during the initial resuscitation period (with
      reorganized sleep rhythms and the presence of paradoxical sleep) could be associated to a
      higher functional outcome.

      However, this internal state of alertness could be highly variable during the day as it might
      be influenced by specific rhythms such as the circadian rhythm. Only a continuous assessment
      could help defining them properly.

      Thus, investigators hypothesize that the circadian restauration, assessed in a dynamic
      perspective, is associated with the improvement of content and level of awareness. The main
      challenge of our study is to capture the long-term changes in the evolution of circadian and
      ultradian rhythms and to keep a part of the natural history of the clinical recovery of these
      patients.

      To achieve this goal, the investigators plan to analyze during more than 2 days both
      neurophysiological rhythms (EEG) and behavioral rhythms of alertness (&quot;Eyes&quot; scale from of
      the Glasgow coma scale) in a dataset collected retrospectively from the population of
      patients continuously monitored by EEG for medical purposes (to identify seizures and prevent
      status epilepticus) in an intensive care unit of teaching hospital as far as acquisitions
      last more than 48h and present no prolonged epileptic discharges or artifacts leading to
      uninterpretable EGG.

    <time_frame>We analyze data obtained in a period between 2014 to 2017. The analysis is made since January 2020.</time_frame>
    <description>The final outcome to assess the respective predictive value of behavioural assessment in ICU and EEG assessment of circadian and ultradian rhythms will be obtained by the medical record when the patient leave the hospital using a unique functional scale, namely the GOSE (Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended).
We use the Glasgow coma recovery scale for assessment of behavior to check the variation of wakefulness. The scale was performed by the nursing staff every 2 to 8 hours depending on the severity of the medical condition.
The continuous analysis of neurophysiologic data was based on EEG with a bipolar montage composed of the less noisy electrodes per recording period.
The patient outcome at the ICU and hospital discharges were collected from the medical files.</description>

    <description>Patients with strok in coma, with or without wake up, and with disorder of consciousness. No limit in age (maybe give the younger age).
We obtain this data from medical record. Every assessment was made of clinical purposes.
We use the Glasgow coma recovery scale for assessment of behavior to check the variation of wakefulness. The scale was performed by the nursing staff every 2 to 8 hours depending on the severity of the medical condition.
The continuous analysis of neurophysiologic data was based on EEG with a bipolar montage composed of the less noisy electrodes per recording period.
The EEG features will include: spectral analysis (relative and absolute power in 4 canonical bands: Delta/Theta/Alpha/Beta) and complexity analysis (DFA, determinism, SVD entropy and permutation entropy).
