    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab on the annualized
      rate of exacerbations in participants with Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on lung function in participants with ABPA

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on ABPA-related exacerbations

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on hospitalization/emergency department (ED)/urgent
           care visits in participants with ABPA

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on asthma control in participants with ABPA

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
           participants with ABPA

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on radiological changes in the lungs in
           participants with ABPA

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and
           Aspergillus-specific IgE concentrations

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) levels

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of dupilumab in participants with ABPA

             at least 12 weeks, with a stable dose and regimen with no change in the dose or

             physician-diagnosed bronchiectasis due to a condition other than ABPA or with a
             history of a positive lower respiratory culture for P aeruginosa or other
             multi-drug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli; cystic fibrosis; sarcoidosis;
             interstitial lung disease not due to ABPA; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
             [COPD] not due to ABPA; hypereosinophilic syndrome; etc) or a diagnosed pulmonary or
             systemic disease associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts
