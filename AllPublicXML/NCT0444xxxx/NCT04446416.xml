    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, two stages, open-label, pilot study to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of FUS add-on bevacizumab (BEV) in rGBM patients. The BEV is the best
      physician's choice of standard of care for rGBM after prior radiotherapy and temozolomide
      chemotherapy in the LinKou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Eligible patients will be enrolled
      through the process of informed consent.

      This trial will be divided into two stages. The study design and procedures will be as
      follows:

      Stage 1:

      Eligible patients will first be administered with BEV 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion.
      After 30-60 minutes, patients will receive microbubbles (MB) (SonoVue®) 0.1 mL/kg and optimal
      ultrasound exposure doses (based on the acoustic emission feedback FUS power control
      algorithm) generated from the NaviFUS System single exposure unit for up to two minutes every
      2 weeks to transiently open the BBB.

      After 4 weeks of treatment with BEV and single unit FUS-MB treatment, if the patient
      experienced BBB opening using FUS treatment and BEV IV infusion without any serious adverse
      effects (such as brain significant bleeding), then the patient may proceed to stage 2.

      Stage 2:

      Patients who complete stage 1 will enter stage 2 to receive the BEV with MB-mediated multiple
      units of FUS treatment for up to five minutes (but the maximum exposure time per single unit
      is two minutes) every 2 weeks for up to 30 weeks or until evidence of progressive disease,
      unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up for 28 days.
