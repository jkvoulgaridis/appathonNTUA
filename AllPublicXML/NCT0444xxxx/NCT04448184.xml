  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that a strategy using prophylactic oral and intravenous Tranexamic Acid
      (TXA) with therapeutic platelet transfusions (if required) is safe and more effective than
      prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients undergoing an autologous hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (ASCT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, over 1,500 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (ASCT) are
      performed annually for hematologic malignancies. It is currently standard practice to provide
      a prophylactic transfusion of platelets to prevent bleeding when the daily measured platelet
      count is less than 10 x 109/L. A patient may require up to six adult platelet doses during
      the post-transplant period. However, the true benefit of prophylactic platelet transfusions
      in the ASCT setting is unclear and has been called into question by several recent studies.

      Prophylactic platelet transfusions may not only be unnecessary, they may be detrimental to
      the patient. Among blood products, platelet transfusions are associated with the highest risk
      of both infectious and non-infectious complications: this would include bacterial infections
      and allergic /febrile reactions. Moreover, the potential overuse of platelet products places
      a significant burden on a scarce health care resource that is provided through volunteer
      donations.

      An alternative strategy to prevent bleeding and reduce the need for platelet transfusions
      involves administering Tranexamic Acid, an antifibrinolytic agent to stabilize blood clots
      and reduce bleeding. Tranexamic Acid is safe and effective in many clinical scenarios, and
      may be a reasonable alternative for prophylactic platelet transfusions. In the setting of
      ASCT, Tranexamic Acid may reduce bleeding and further enhance a strategy of therapeutic
      platelet transfusions where platelets are administered only in the event of active bleeding
      symptoms.

      The effect of prophylactic platelet transfusions and Tranexamic Acid on clinical, quality of
      life and economic outcomes in patients receiving ASCT is unknown. The primary aim of this
      research program is to perform a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a strategy
      of prophylactic Tranexamic Acid (with therapeutic platelet transfusions) is safe and
      effective compared to prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients undergoing ASCT.

      A pilot trial demonstrated feasibility by successfully recruiting 100 patients and these
      patients will be rolled over into the phase III study. The treatment assignment and bleeding
      outcomes for these patients remain blinded.

    <measure>Transplant related outcome: Bearman Scoring System for Organ Toxicity following HSCT</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>This is a validated scoring system to assess toxicity during HSCT. In this system, grade I toxicity is reversible without treatment and grade 2 is not life threatening, but requires treatment. Grade 3 requires life-support intervention and grade 4 is fatal. Regimen-related toxicity in each organ system was scored as the highest grade achieved in that organ system through day 28, except that deaths occurring after day 28 as a result of regimen-related toxicity occurring before day 28 are also scored as grade 4. Adverse events that could be attributed to infection (culture-documented), bleeding or other medications are not scored as regimen-related toxicity. The maximum toxicity is the highest grade recorded in any individual organ system and the cumulative toxicity score is the sum of the highest grades recorded for all eight organ systems.</description>

    <description>The FACT consists of 5 subscales that measure physical well-being, functional well-being, social/family well-being and emotional well-being.

    <description>The FACT-BMT scale is valid and sensitive to clinical change in transplant recipients. It is the most consistently used scale amongst the Canadian Bone Marrow Transplant Group (CBMTG). It is the preferred scale in several Canadian multicentre trials in stem cell transplantation. FACT- Thrombocytopenia 18 is valid measure to elicit quality of life due to thrombocytopenia, and will complement the FACT-BMT scale.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments; it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. It is cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete.</description>
