  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The microbiome of 80 orthopedic-device related infection (ODRI) patients treated with
      antibiotics and 10 healthy controls will be investigated. Samples (blood, stool, saliva,
      skin-swab) are collected 4x within 6 months. Composition and diversity of the microbiome will
      be assessed by 16sRNA sequencing, skins swabs are screened for rifampicin-resistant
      staphylococci onto Mannitol-salt-agar plates supplemented with rifampicin, inflammation
      markers and antibodies in blood and saliva are monitored to track changes in the immune
      response. For further analysis patients are assigned to one of two groups: 1) antibiotic
      therapy including rifampicin and 2) non-rifampicin antibiotic therapy.

        The project population will include patients suffering from an ODRI (orthopedic
        device-related infection). This includes any patient with a bone infection with a current
        or previous involvement of an implant. The majority of patients are expected to be
        prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and fracture-related infection (FRI) patients, although
        also patients with spinal implantation with an infection, or patients who have had an
        implant removed yet develop an osteomyelitis will also be included.

        These patients all have a deep bone implant infection and will receive antibiotic therapy,
        including at least two weeks IV therapy and at least 4 weeks of oral rifampicin. The
        investigators expect the distribution of patients getting rifampicin or non-rifampicin to
        be approximately 50/50 overall and anticipate PJI patients will be older, receive more
        concomitant medications and have underlying co-morbidities than patients with an FRI.

             ulcerosa.
