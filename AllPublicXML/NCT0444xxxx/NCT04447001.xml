  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how best to disseminate and implement Tai Chi Fundamentals® (TCF) in
      community settings for older adults with balance problems. TCF is a program designed for
      older adults with pain and physical limitations to enhance balance, coordination, strength
      and endurance. Investigator will evaluate program implementation including Aging and
      Disability Resource Center (ADRC) uptake, reach, feasibility, teaching fidelity, and exercise
      adherence and also collect outcomes including leg strength, balance, walking ability and
      executive function before and after the 6-week session. The final product of this study will
      be recommendations to address key barriers and facilitators for implementation of TCF by
      community organizations serving older adults.

      The primary aim for this study is to evaluate the program implementation. This is not an
      efficacy study. Within the limits of a Dissemination and Implementation grant budget,
      Investigators do take advantage of a natural experiment even if it is not the primary aim of
      this study. By doing so investigators plan to establish the feasibility of this multi-site
      data collection plan for future studies. Based on the study settings, study team will get a
      chance to explore the effect of TCF in real world settings since two sessions can be held in
      a fall season and a spring season. In addition to the pre-post tests of TCF sessions to
      explore TCF effectiveness, pre-test scores for session 2 are compared to post-test scores of
      session 1 participants since both are collected at nearly the same time. The larger sample
      will be for the within group pre-post comparison analyses. This will be a valuable
      opportunity to test data collection procedures for future trials.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to immediately begin short 6-week modified tai chi course along with a personal home practice plan to receive greater Tai chi dose(session 1) or complete a 8-week wait (wait-list control). Wait-list group will be receiving Tai-chi prime intervention after 8 weeks wait time (session-2).
In addition to the pre-post tests of TCF sessions to explore TCF effectiveness, pre-test scores for session 2 are compared to post-test scores of session 1 participants since both are collected at nearly the same time.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>baseline for session 1, 7 weeks (post test for session 1) and 7 weeks (pretest for session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test(TMT) is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. In TMT, the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The time taken to complete the test being used as the primary performance metric.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline for session 1, 7 weeks (post test for session 1) and 7 weeks (pretest for session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC scale is a self- report measure of balance confidence in performing various activities without losing balance or experiencing a sense of unsteadiness.
ABC is an 11-point scale and ratings should consist of whole numbers (0-100) for each item. Participants will indicate their level of confidence in doing an activity without losing balance or becoming unsteady by choosing one of the percentage points on the scale from 0%-100%. Total the ratings (possible range = 0 to 1600) and divide by 16 to get each participant's ABC score.
Scores lower than 50 indicate a low level of functioning, scores above 50 but below 80 indicate a medium level, and those over 80 indicate a high level of functioning.</description>

    <description>Static balance is the ability to maintain the body in some fixed posture.</description>

    <description>TUG test is a test of mobility and gait. Participant will timed for the following TUG test
Participants will be asked to sit back in a standard chair and identify a line 3 meters, or 10 feet away.
At 'Go' participant will stand up from the chair.
Walk to the line on the floor at your normal pace.
Turn.
Walk back to the chair at your normal pace.
Sit down again.
Time taken from start to finish will be measured in seconds.
An older adult who takes ≥12 seconds to complete the TUG is at risk for falling.</description>

    <measure>Change in the time taken to hold tandem stands in the 4-stage balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline for session 1, 7 weeks (post test for session 1) and 7 weeks (pretest for session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>4 stage balance test consists of four standing positions that get progressively harder to maintain.
instructor will describe and demonstrate each position to the participant.Then the instructor will stand next to the participant, hold their arm,and help them assume the correct position. When the participant will be steady, let go, and time how long they can maintain the position. Instructor will be ready to assist the participant if they lose their balance.
If the participant can hold a position for 10 seconds without moving their feet or needing support, instructor can ask to go on to the next position. If not, test will be stopped.
Participants should not use an assistive device (cane or walker) and they should keep their eyes open.
Participants (older adults) who cannot hold the tandem stand for at least 10 seconds will be at increased risk of falling.</description>

    <measure>Change in the 'number of times the participant comes to a full standing position in 30 seconds'</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline for session 1, 7 weeks (post test for session 1) and 7 weeks (pretest for session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 Second Chair Stand Test can help to indicate if a patient is at risk of falling. Purpose of this test is to test the strength and endurance.
Instructions to the participant:
Sit in the middle of the chair.
Place each hand on the opposite shoulder crossed at the wrists.
Place your feet flat on the floor.
Keep your back straight and keep your arms against your chest.
On &quot;Go&quot;, rise to a full standing position and then sit back down again.
Repeat this for 30 seconds.
On &quot;Go&quot; timer starts.
Number of times the participant comes to a full standing position in 30 seconds will be recorded.
If the participant is over halfway to a standing position when 30 seconds have elapsed, it will be counted as stand.</description>
