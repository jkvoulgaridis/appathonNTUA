    <description>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)
The change in the quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, consists of 30 questions that provide a global QoL scale, five functional scales (physical, role-playing, emotional, cognitive, social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and six individual factors (dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The scores of each scale are calculated in a score ranging from 0 to 100. A high score on a functional scale represents a good level of function.</description>
