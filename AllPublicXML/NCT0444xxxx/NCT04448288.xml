      Stretching is reported to have detrimental effects on strength and thus avoided prior to
      strength training session. Do stretching indeed decreases muscle strength? To examine the
      time course (immediate, 10- and 20-min post stretching) for the effects of 2, 4, and 8 min
      long duration of static-stretching (SS) on isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)
      force of hamstring muscles.

      OBJECTIVE: To examine the time course (immediate, 10- and 20-min post stretching) for the
      effects of 2, 4, and 8 min long duration of static-stretching (SS) on isometric maximum
      voluntary contraction (MVC) force of hamstring muscles.

      METHODS: Pretest-posttest experimental design. Total of 14 subjects with mean age 25 years
      participated in three experimental trials on three different days. On day-I for
      static-stretching for 2 minutes (SS2), day-II for 4 minutes (SS4), and day-III for 8 minutes
      (SS8). Testing was conducted before (pre), immediately after (post), and at 10 and 20 min
      post stretching. MVCF was measured using strain gauze as the main outcome measure.

On day-I for static-stretching for 2 minutes (SS2), day-II for 4 minutes (SS4), and day-III for 8 minutes (SS8). Testing was conducted before (pre), immediately after (post), and at 10 and 20 min post stretching. MVCF was measured using strain gauze as main outcome measure. The SS trials involved varied repetitions of 30-s static-stretches and 20-s relax period. MVC force was assessed.</description>
