  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enhance perinatal opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in a
      rural setting by developing an evaluated curriculum of perinatal OUD provider education.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team will establish and evaluate a perinatal model of care for OUD serving two
      counties, Carbon and Emery, which have high rates of OUD and overdose. This model of care
      will entail University of Utah medical clinicians providing education and webinars to
      healthcare providers in Carbon/Emery counties who care for pregnant women with OUD and their
      babies. This model of care will also help other social and behavioral health care providers
      in the area to understand how to treat and better coordinate care. No clinical services are
      being provided by University of Utah investigators or staff.

    <measure>Self-report of linkage and adherence to treatment as assessed by the Treatment Service Review- 6 (TSR-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>This data will be collected from each participant during a baseline assessment, a pre-delivery assessment occurring between 34 and 40 weeks of gestation, and a final assessment conducted within 30-days following delivery.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete the Treatment Services Review-6 (TSR-6) in order to measure changes in service across time. The TSR-6 is a clinically validated 56-item measure with excellent reliability for assessing drug and alcohol treatment engagement, medication use (including drug, alcohol, psychiatric, and physical health medications), psychiatric care, family services, financial/employment/housing, and legal services. This measure captures linkage/retention in care, that is to say: initiation and daily engagement in services. Specifically, the research team will capture frequency of meetings/sessions/days in OUD and other substance counseling and psychiatric care and social services. The research team will also use the TSR-6 medication use section to capture adherence to buprenorphine or methadone. Data collected will be used to measure change across time in linkage and retention in health and behavioral health services.</description>
