  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stoke Therapeutics is evaluating the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of
      STK-001 in patients with Dravet syndrome. Change in seizure frequency and quality of life
      will be measured as secondary endpoints in this open-label study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STK-001 is an investigational new medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. STK-001 is
      an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is intended to increase the level of productive SCN1A
      messenger RNA (mRNA) and consequently increase the expression of the sodium channel Nav1.1
      protein. This RNA-based approach is not gene therapy, but rather RNA modulation, as it does
      not manipulate nor insert genetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      STK-001 is designed to upregulate Nav1.1 protein expression from the nonmutant (wild-type)
      copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological Nav1.1 levels. Nav1.1 levels are reduced in
      people with Dravet syndrome. Stoke has generated preclinical data demonstrating
      proof-of-mechanism for STK-001.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Must have DS with onset prior to 12 months of age with recurrent focal motor or
        hemiconvulsive or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which are often prolonged and
        triggered by hyperthermia.

          -  No history of causal MRI lesion

          -  No other known etiology

          -  Normal development at seizure onset.

          -  Documented pathogenic, likely pathogenic variant, or variant of uncertain significance
             in the SCN1A gene associated with DS.

          -  Had at least 2 treatments for epilepsy that either had lack of adequate seizure
             control (requiring an additional AED) or had to be discontinued due to an AE(s).

          -  Currently be taking at least one AED at a dose which has been stable for at least 4
             weeks prior to Screening.

          -  All epilepsy medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet or
             vagal nerve stimulator) must have been stable (including product type, dose, and
             setting) for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known pathogenic mutation in another gene that causes epilepsy

          -  Currently being treated with an antiepileptic drug acting primarily as a sodium
             channel blocker including: phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine,
             lacosamide, or rufinamide.

          -  Clinically significant unstable medical conditions other than epilepsy.

          -  Has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness in the 4
             weeks prior to Screening or prior to dosing on Day 1, other than epilepsy.

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study, may
             influence the results of the study, or may affect the patient's ability to participate
             in the study.
