  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the hypothesis that the clinical complete response (CCR) rate
      of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy will increase after an adaptive-design paradigm, as well as the rate of
      2-year organ preservation, recurrence, quality of life, DFS and OS.

      1. Primary objective:

           Evaluate the CCR rate of low rectal cancer using adaptive and optimized chemotherapy and
           radiotherapy strategies (all population and dMMR/MSI-H subgroup)

        2. Secondary objectives:

           2.1 Evaluate the 2-year anal preservation rate, recurrence rate, quality of life, DFS
           and OS 2.2 Explore the subgroup of patients suitable for observation.

        3. Outline:

      Patients after long-course chemoradiation are grouped based on their MSI-H/dMMR status. For
      patients with MSI-H/dMMR, consolidation immunotherapy of Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) will be
      assigned. For patients with MSS/pMMR, consolidation chemotherapy will be given according to
      their tumor response. After completion of consolidation therapy, those who reach clinical
      complete response will receive organ preservation (watch and wait) strategy in place of
      radical surgery. During treatment, once local regrowth occurs or poor tumor response, total
      mesorectal excision (TME) surgery will be performed.

    <description>Arm 1 includes patients with MSS/pMMR. In this arm, patients receive consolidation chemotherapy after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). The chemotherapy regimens either XELIRI or FOLFIRINOX, and the cycles of chemotherapy depend on patient tumor responses. For patients who reach cCR will enter the &quot;W&amp;W&quot; cohort and omit radical surgery, while those without cCR will receive radical surgery.</description>
