      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. The study will characterize the effect
      of a high-fat meal on the PK of TAK-788 administered in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 14 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment sequence

        -  TAK-788 160 mg Fasted (Reference) in Period 1 + TAK-788 160 mg Fed (Test) in Period 2

        -  TAK-788 160 mg Fed (Test) in Period 1 + TAK-788 160 mg Fasted (Reference) in Period 2

      All participants will be asked to take capsules of assigned TAK-788 on Day 1 of each period.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 61 days. Participants will be contacted by telephone for 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment</ipd_description>
