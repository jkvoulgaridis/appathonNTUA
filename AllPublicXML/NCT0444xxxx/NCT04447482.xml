      Evaluate results for participants with lung lesions randomized to either 4D Electromagnetic
      Navigation Bronchoscopy (4D-ENB) versus Conventional Bronchoscopy with Fluoroscopy for
      diagnostic biopsy and detection of lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy results for two
      bronchoscopic biopsy techniques for sampling lung lesions: either image-guided
      electromagnetic navigation or conventional bronchoscopy with fluoroscopy. The diagnostic
      yield and adverse events of participants prospectively randomized to either arm will be
      evaluated. This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study.
