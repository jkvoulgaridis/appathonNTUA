      Pectus excavatum (PE) or funnel breast is the most common congenital deformity of the chest
      wall, which occurs in about 1 in 400 births with a boy to girl ratio of 4: 1 to 3: 1. The
      etiology of PE is largely undefined, but there are numerous indications that genetic factors
      play a role in the development of PE. Up to 40% of patients report affected family members
      with similar congenital deformities. In many families, PE follows a pattern that would be
      compatible with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. The data on the
      frequent occurrence of PE in family members fluctuate greatly and only a few genes associated
      with a PE have been identified so far.

      Previous studies suggest that sulfation of proteoglycans plays a crucial role in the normal
      development of cartilage and bone and could therefore be crucial in the genesis of the
      disease. The main catalytic machinery responsible for the biosynthesis and breakage of
      sulfate esters in the proteoglycans consists of various enzymes and transporters. Mutations
      in Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SK1) and Sphingosine Kinase 2 (SK2) genes that encode the
      transmembrane transporters of sulfate or enzymes that are involved in 3'-phosphoadenosine
      5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) synthesis have been identified as the cause of several inherited
      diseases that all have skeletal system deformities.

      Connections between chest wall deformities with syndromes (e.g. Marfan, Noonan), anomalies
      (e.g. Poland, Moebius) or associations (e.g. Cantrell Pentalogy, PHACE) are well known. In
      contrast, there have so far been hardly any genetic studies of the isolated congenital chest
      wall deformities. Epidemiological data are insufficient and only a few groups deal with the
      inheritance and the incidence of this disease when it occurs in isolation.
