  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the suggested study is to assess the added value of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT over
      18F-FDG PET/CT in evaluating the extent of disease in pancreatic and gastric cancer,
      malignancies that are known to show variable FDG-avidity, at times, no uptake at all.

      Although some studies reported a relatively high sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT for pancreatic
      cancer, FDG uptake in these tumors is usually only slightly higher than the mean SUV of the
      pancreas itself [10]. Also, false-negative PET results can be observed in hyperglycemic
      patients or in subcentimeter lesions, whereas false-positive PET results can occur in some
      inflammatory states.

    <description>The study population will include 25 patients with one of the following indications:
Exocrine Pancreatic cancer.
Gastric carcinoma, either with low-FDG uptake or known to be mucin-producing or signet-ring carcinoma.
The study population will include only patients treated in Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel, and referred by their attending physicians, of whom are part of the hospital staff.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo two scans: first a routine FDG PET scan and a FAPI PET scan, within 10 days.
Scans will be interpreted by board certified Nuclear medicine physicians and board certified radiologists.
Immunohistochemical analysis with specific staining for FAP will be performed in removed malignant tissues, either at surgery or from biopsy, to assess a possible correlation between the intensity of uptake and the level of FAP expression.</description>
