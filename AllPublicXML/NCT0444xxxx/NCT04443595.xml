  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LPN procedure is performed under general anesthesia. The transperitoneal access to
      peripancreatic space is via the gastro-colic ligament and greater omentum, effusion and pus
      is removed by laparoscopic forceps and suction. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is
      performed during the LPN procedure on patients with indication.

      The NPN procedure is followed by the standard retroperitoneal approach. After the catheter is
      exchanged over a guide wire and serially dilated up from 6F to 24F followed by Seldinger
      technique, the access track to the necrotic cavity is established. A nephroscope is inserted
      into the cavity through the track for debridement. Using forceps and suction, the
      peripancreatic solid necrotic tissue and pus is grasped and removed. A large-bore irrigating
      drain is left in the cavity, with continuous irrigation by warm normal saline solution at a
      rate of 100-125 ml/h after surgery.
