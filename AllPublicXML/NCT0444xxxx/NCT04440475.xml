    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the transversus abdominis plane block (Tap
      block) is different than the oral postoperative pain medications in controlling pain after
      robotic sacrocolpopexy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sacrocolpopexy is a procedure to correct prolapse of the vaginal apex (top of the vagina) in
      women who have had a previous hysterectomy. The operation is designed to restore the vagina
      to its normal position and function. Pain management is an important aspect of perioperative
      anesthetic care. Acute postoperative pain control impacting surgical outcomes remains a
      controversial topic

      The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block was first presented by Rafi in 2001 as a
      landmark-guided technique via the triangle of Petit to achieve a field block. It involves the
      injection of a local anesthetic between the internal oblique muscle and transversus abdominis
      muscle. The thoracolumbar nerves originating from the T6 to L1 spinal roots run into this
      plane and supply sensory nerves to the anterolateral abdominal wall, the local anesthetic in
      this plane can block the neural afferents and provide analgesia to the anterolateral
      abdominal wall. The Tap block is a widely used procedure to help in postoperative pain
      management, it is easily performed, cost-effective, with minimal procedure-related morbidity.
      The use of Tap block is in concordance with several of the goals of Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery Pathways (ERAS). In a systematic review comparing Tap bloc to no tap block for
      post-hysterectomy pain found that visual analog score (VAS) was lower in patients receiving
      tap block in both open and laparoscopic hysterectomy procedures. The study found no
      significant difference in the amount of morphine used by patients who underwent laparoscopic
      hysterectomy and received a tap block. Currently the standard of care at Promedica hospitals
      is to give patients oral medications to control postop pain after sacrocolpopexy. Patients
      are offered to receive a tap block or no, and it is up to the patient to receive the tap
      block or no.

      No Studies on Tap block after Sacrocolpopexy have been published yet. Our hypothesis is that
      Tap block will reduce the need for pain meds during the first 24 to 48 hours after
      sacrocolpopexy.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will perform a pilot randomized control trial, where one group will be receiving TAP blocks whereas the other group will be receiving regular postoperative pain medications (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, tramadol orally upon discharge). Randomization will be completed using a computer-generated randomization sequence using 1:1 ratio with blocking in groups of 4. The randomization sequence will kept in our research office and investigators enrolling subjects will not have access. Sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes will be prepared following the randomization sequence, randomized participants will receive an envelope in sequential order.
The patient and the person performing the statistical analyses will be blinded.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Tap block description:
The skin is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion for a lateral to posterior/lateral approach to the Transverse Abdominis Plane (TAP). The Anesthesiologists use ultrasound guidance for all TAP blocks and pre mix 60cc of 0.2% ropivicaine with 10mg of preservative free dexamethasone. After the plane is identified in approximately the mid axillary line, a 17g Tuohy needle is used under ultrasound guidance to enter the potential space from an anterior approach. The needle is visualized in-plane with the ultrasound probe, traversing the exterior and interior oblique muscles and penetrating through the posterior fascia of internal oblique into the transverse abdominal plane. Once the Tuohy is in place, the needle is aspirated and the plane is hydro-dissected using 0.2% Ropivicaine with 10mg of dexamethasone. The anesthesiologist will use 30ml of 0.2% Ropivicaine on each side.</description>
