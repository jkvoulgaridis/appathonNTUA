               1. For Part 1 (Dose Escalation): The participant must have histological or
                  cytological evidence of cancer (a solid tumor) that is advanced and/or

                  available.

               2. For Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The participant must have histological or
                  cytological evidence of cancer that is advanced and/or metastatic.

             disease.

          3. For Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The participant has measurable disease.

             immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for myelosuppressive
             agents or 14 days for radiotherapy and non-myelosuppressive agents, prior to receiving
             GLR2007, and has recovered from the acute effects of therapy (treatment related
             toxicity resolved to ≤Grade 1) except for residual alopecia.

          7. The participant is willing and able to make themselves available for the duration of
             the study and is willing and able to follow study procedures.

          9. The participant has an estimated life expectancy of ≥3 months.

         10. The participant agrees to minimize ultraviolet exposure and sunlight for the duration
             of their study participation.

         11. A diagnostic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain must be
             performed within 28 days prior to registration. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography
             (CT) is acceptable if MRI is not possible.

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC.

          2. Participants must have received at least 1 line of standard therapy for metastatic
             disease, including platinum-based chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor
             given together or as separate lines of therapy, unless participants are ineligible for
             or cannot tolerate such therapy.

          3. Participants with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS (ROS1), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral
             oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK)
             aberrations must have received therapy directed at their molecular aberration in order
             to enroll on this study.

             stereotactic radiosurgery is allowed). A neurosurgical consult is at the discretion of
             the investigator.

          3. Participants with brain metastases of NSCLC origin must have received at least 1 line
             of standard therapy for metastatic disease, including platinum-based chemotherapy and
             an immune checkpoint inhibitor given together or as separate lines of therapy, unless
             participants are ineligible for or cannot tolerate such therapy.

          4. Participants with ALK, EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and NTRK aberrations must have received
             therapy directed at their molecular aberration in order to enroll on this study.

             field.

             surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel recurrent, unexplained or
             cardiac-related syncopal episodes within the last 6 months or ventricular arrhythmia
             (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation).

             positive. The participant has an active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral
             infection (for example, hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies).

        Cohort-specific exclusion criteria:

        Part 2 (Cohort A, NSCLC): The participant has NSCLC with worsening symptoms within 14 days
        prior to receiving GLR2007.

        metastasis with worsening symptoms within 14 days prior to receiving GLR2007.
