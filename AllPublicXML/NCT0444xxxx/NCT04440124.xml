      Field tests to objectively measure functional capacity are becoming of greater importance
      when looking to assess an individual's fitness for surgery. One such field test is the
      incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). An externally paced, maximal excursion test, the ISWT
      is a simple and easily reproducible test that is widely used within cardiac and pulmonary
      populations and shown to correlate well with Vo2 mas on a cardiopulmonary exercise test.
      Previous studies looking at the benefit of the ISWT in predicting post-operative outcomes
      within the oesophagastric population have demonstrated that walking less than 350 meters has
      been associated with significantly higher rates of mortality at 30 days and 3 years. No
      correlation between ISWT and postoperative respiratory complications in this surgical
      population has been previously reported.

      This study aims to assess whether walking &lt;350 meters on an ISWT predicts the development of
      hospital acquired pneumonias following an elective oesophagectomy

    <description>All patients were reviewed by a physiotherapist during their pre-assessment clinic one week prior to surgery to complete an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). The ISWT was completed according to a standardised protocol and involved patients walking around 2 cones set up 9 metres apart. Patients were asked to cover the distance between the cones in time to auditory cues. Oxygen levels and heart rate were recorded during the assessment with the use of a portable pulse oximeter. The test was stopped when patients could no longer keep pace with the auditory cues or were too breathless to continue. The total distance mobilised was recorded.</description>
