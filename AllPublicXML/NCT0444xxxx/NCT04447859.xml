  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Semaglutide is a Glucagon Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist recently approved in Israel
      to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Semaglutide is
      currently administered as a weekly subcutaneous injection.Treatment with semaglutide is
      associated with the occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) commonly observed
      during GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. The most common adverse reactions, reported in ≥5%
      of patients treated with semaglutide are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and
      constipation.

      In this trial we plan to explore the effect of a slower titration regimen of semaglutide vs.
      the current label-recommended dose escalation regimen on the occurrence of GI-AEs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have personally signed and dated the informed consent form indicating that he/she has
             been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits and other study procedures.

          -  Meet one of the following categories:

               1. The subject is a male.

               2. The subject is a female who is not of reproductive potential, defined as a female
                  who either: (1) is postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses
                  in women ≥45 years of age); (2) has had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral
                  oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion at
                  least 6 weeks prior to screening; OR (3) has a congenital or acquired condition
                  that prevents childbearing.

               3. The subject is a female who is of reproductive potential and agrees to avoid
                  becoming pregnant: while receiving study drug and for 60 days after the last dose
                  of study drug by complying with one of the following: (1) practice abstinence†
                  from heterosexual activity OR (2) use (or have her partner use) acceptable
                  contraception during heterosexual activity. Acceptable methods of contraception
                  are‡:

        Single method (one of the following is acceptable):

          -  non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  vasectomy of a female subject's male partner

        Combination method (requires use of two of the following):

          -  diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide)

          -  cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)

          -  contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)

          -  male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a known contraindication to use of GLP-1 agonists.

          -  Has been treated with a GLP-1 agonist in the last 30 days.

          -  Has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus

          -  Has a medical history of untreated active proliferative retinopathy.

          -  Has other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or blinded
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.
