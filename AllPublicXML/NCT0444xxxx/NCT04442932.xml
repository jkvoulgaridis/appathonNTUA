  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study designed to determine the clinical
      sensitivity and specificity of the Abionic IVD CAPSULE Allergic Asthma panel performed on
      Abionic's abioSCOPE device using K3-EDTA anticoagulated plasma samples from atopic and
      non-atopic pediatric and adult patients. Patients' sensitization determined with the
      abioSCOPE will be compared to the clinical assessment of allergy.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be evaluated by estimating the Sensitivity and Specificity of the abioSCOPE to detect sensitization to each of the five allergens or group of allergens. The estimates will be accompanied by 95% Clopper-Pearson Confidence Intervals. The acceptance criteria will be compared to the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval. The ability of the abioSCOPE to detect sensitization to each allergen will be considered acceptable if both the sensitivity and specificity of the allergen meet both performance goals.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Atopic and non-atopic individuals are needed for this study. For enrollment in the atopic
        arm, patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria listed below to be eligible for
        participation:

          1. Provide signed and dated written informed consent by patient or legally designated
             representative prior to any mandatory study-specific procedures, sample collection, or
             analysis. Assent will be obtained from pediatric patients who are ≥ 6 years of age and
             less than 18 years of age.

          2. Male or female, ≥ 6 years of age.

          3. Consulting for signs and/or symptoms of IgE-mediated allergies to perennial allergens.

        For enrollment in the non-atopic arm, patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria list
        below to be eligible for participation:

          1. Provide signed and dated written informed consent by patient or legally designated
             representative prior to any mandatory study-specific procedures, sample collection, or
             analysis. Assent will be obtained from pediatric patients who are ≥ 6 years of age and

          2. Male or female, ≥ 6 years of age.

          3. Apparently healthy individuals who exhibit no signs/symptoms of IgE-mediated allergies
             including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, eczema, urticaria or food allergy symptoms
             upon exposure to animal danders, dust mites, cockroaches, pollens or food allergens
             (non-atopic).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients must not meet any exclusion criteria below to be eligible for participation:

          1. Patient participating in another study that may influence test results.

          2. Subjects taking any of the following medications: antihistamines in the week preceding
             the consultation, systemic steroids (inhaled or nasal steroids are allowed),
             anti-cytokines or cytokines, systemic interferon (injection local interferon α for the
             treatment of HPV is allowed), anti-IgE therapy (approved or investigational) or
             treated with systemic chemotherapy.

          3. On-going allergen immunotherapy or prior allergen immunotherapy within the prior 3
             years.

          4. Patient with a history of cancer, autoimmune, or immune deficiency disease.

          5. Patient suffering from a hematological pathology (coagulation disorder, severe anemia)
             that could interfere with the blood test.

          6. Known severe allergic reaction to any of the IVD CAPSULE Allergic Asthma panel
             allergen components
