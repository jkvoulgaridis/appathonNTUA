  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte derangement occurring in hospitalized patients.
      It is usually classified as hypovolemic, euvolemic or hypervolemic. The most common aetiology
      of euvolemic hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Hypervolemic
      hyponatremia is common in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) (10-27%) and liver
      cirrhosis (up to approximately 50%). In SIAD, the regulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP)
      secretion is impaired which leads to free water retention. In CHF and liver cirrhosis, the
      effective arterial blood volume is decreased leading to non-osmotic baroreceptor mediated AVP
      release and consecutive free water retention.

      Current treatments of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, including the most used
      treatment fluid restriction, are of limited efficacy. Sodium-Glucose-Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2)
      inhibitors reduce glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, resulting in glucosuria and
      consecutive osmotic diuresis. A placebo-controlled randomized trial of our group has shown
      that a short-term, i.e. a 4-days administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin
      (Jardiance)® in addition to fluid restriction was effective in increasing the serum sodium
      concentration in 87 patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. The effect of empagliflozin
      (Jardiance)® without additional fluid restriction is however not yet known. Large randomized
      controlled trials have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced hospitalization for heart failure
      in patients with, and more recently without type 2 diabetes. No studies have investigated the
      effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in hypervolemic hyponatremia.

      To evaluate the effect of empagliflozin (Jardiance)® in eu- and hypervolemic hyponatremia, a
      randomized placebo-controlled study is needed.
