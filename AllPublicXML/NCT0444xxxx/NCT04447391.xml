  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to explore the effects of a 12-week combined exercise on ghrelin O acyl
      transferase, acylated ghrelin and desacylated ghrelin levels in obese girls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about on ghrelin O acyl transferase (GOAT), acylated ghrelin (AG) and
      desacylated ghrelin (DAG) levels during long-term exercise in adolescent population. Our
      previous study showed that combined exercise program in overweight children increases DAG
      with unchanged AG. This study aimed to explore the effects of a 12-week combined exercise on
      GOAT, AG, and DAG in obese girls.
