  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two movement illusion techniques can currently be used in clinical practice for motor
      rehabilitation after stroke hemiplegia: visual illusion (mirror therapy) and proprioceptive
      illusion (tendon vibration). Mirror therapy, in its computerized version (IVS3, Dessintey,
      Saint-Etienne, France), is based on the substitution of the deficient visual feedback by a
      visual feedback of a correctly realized movement. The proprioceptive illusion is based on the
      external application of a vibrator on muscle tendons at a frequency between 50 and 120 Hz.
      These two techniques are currently used independently. They are, in theory, complementary and
      additive. No study has described the combinatorial properties of the illusions generated by
      these 2 techniques in hemiplegic subjects and healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the administration of mirror therapy together with vibration
      will increase the perception of movement in a subjective scale.
