    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled trial, investigators aim to study the effects and
      safety of bicarbonated Ringer's solution in patients with septic shock compared with lactated
      ringer's solution, and provide evidence for current fluid resuscitation strategies for septic
      shock.

      Although the latest guidelines recommend crystalloids as the first choice for the patients'
      fluid resuscitation, it still remains controversial that which crystalloid solution is the
      best choice. It is reported that balanced crystalloid can result in better outcomes than
      saline for critically ill patients. However, there are few studies conducted between
      different crystalloid solutions.

      Lactated ringer's solution is the longest-used crystalloid solution. Compared with lactated
      ringer's solution whose anion is lactate, the anion of bicarbonate ringer's solution is
      bicarbonate. And lactate needs to be metabolized into bicarbonate through the mitochondria of
      the liver before it can play an alkalization role. Therefore, in theory, bicarbonate ringer's
      solution does not need to rely on liver metabolism, the onset time to maintain acid-base
      balance is shorter, and it may be more suitable for patients with severe acidosis. In
      patients with septic shock, the incidence of moderate to severe metabolic is increased.
      Bicarbonate ringer's solution can directly supplement the concentration of bicarbonate, while
      lactated ringer's solution needs to take time and be metabolized in the liver. Thus, we
      hypothesize that bicarbonate ringer's solution is more effective for patients with shock and
      metabolic acidosis than lactated ringer's solution.
