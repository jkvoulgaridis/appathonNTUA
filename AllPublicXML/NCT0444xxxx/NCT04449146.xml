    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to analyse the positioning of the scapula in standing position
      and compared to the supine position (CT scan) in 3 dimensions (3 rotations of the scapula)
      using a non-radiant, portable system, combining an ultrasound probe with marker and a camera
      integrated into a Tablet for the three-dimensional location of the marker (probe).

      This is a mono-center trial. Patients in the process of pre-operative care of a reverse
      shoulder arthroplasty (CT Scan already available as part of the care course in supine
      position) will be offered the study. A localizer ultrasound will be performed during surgical
      consultation or the day before the surgery in standing position (duration: 1/2 day). This
      consultation takes place during the course of the surgical consultation or when the patient
      is admitted the day before his surgical procedure.

    <description>The localizer ultrasound of the shoulder is performed on an unclothed patient (at the shoulders) and comes to locate bony landmarks using the ultrasound probe as a Transcutaneous localizer. The Protocol plans to acquire different landmarks on the scapula: lower angle, coracoid, scapula spine and bilateral acromioclavicular joint (definition of the coronal plan). These acquisitions are carried out by the probe connected to a Tablet (Microsoft surface Pro 3) which allows to locate the probe and by extension of the probe the location of the points selected by ultrasound.</description>
