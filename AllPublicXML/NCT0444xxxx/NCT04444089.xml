  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimization of perioperative fluid management is important for preventing adverse events,
      such as hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, volume overload, and pulmonary edema, in both adult
      and pediatric patients. If the intravascular (IV) fluid volume is not optimized, pediatric
      patients are at risk of dehydration or volume overload. Perioperative IV fluid therapy is
      important during and after induction of general anesthesia (GA).The aim of this study is to
      investigate the difference between conventional and restrictive fluid replacement regimens
      using lung ultrasound in pediatric patients undergoing penile hypospadias repair, as a
      surgery with minor fluid loss.

The deficit volume is calculated as the maintenance volume multiplied by fasting hours and given as follows: 50% of the volume in the first hour, 25% of the volume in the second hour, and 25% of the volume in the third hour, in addition to the aforementioned maintenance volume</description>

    <description>Lung ultrasound with a curvilinear probe (DDED) is performed in all patients in a supine position on the lateral wall of the chest at approximately the level of the lower ribs using an ultrasound probe at a frequency of 4-12 MHz (AcusonX300, Siemens Korea, Seoul, South Korea). The mean number of B-lines detected on the ultrasound image and the percentage of patients who showed B-lines on their images were recorded. The mean of three measurements is used. Inter-observer variability is estimated to be 0.766 (95% confidence interval 0.675-0.847).</description>
