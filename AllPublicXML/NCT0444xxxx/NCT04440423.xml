      This Pivotal study will investigate the bioavailability in fasting women of 1 Tablet
      formulations containing Clotiazepam 5 mg.

      The Pivotal study will be performed at a single site with 30 subjects. Participants will take
      1 Tablet of the test product and reference product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test
      after reference or reference after test). There will be a washout of at least 7 days between
      each study period.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of

      Clotiazepam of 1 tablet formulation with Clotiazepam 5 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence
      of both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:

        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Tecnandina S.A., Ecuador.

        -  Reference Product: Rize [Trademark], product of Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Japan.

      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters Ã¡rea under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours
      (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl
      estradiol will be determined.

      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 12 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic
      (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 18 blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours after the
      administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to provide additional
      blood samples at 24 h and 34 h postdose.

      The washout period between the two study periods will be at least 7 days. The samples from
      each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of highperformance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Levonorgestrel
      and Ethinyl estradiol in plasma.

      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by
      collecting adverse events.
