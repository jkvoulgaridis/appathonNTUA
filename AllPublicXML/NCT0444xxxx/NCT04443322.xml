    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in combination with lenvatinib
      in participants with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplant and
      metastatic unresectable HCC.The primary hypothesis of this study are that patients with
      locally advanced HCC could benefit from durvalumab plus lenvatinib before liver transplant;
      patients with metastatic unresectable HCC could also benefit from durvalumab plus lenvatinib
      with respect to: 1)Progression Free Survival (PFS) ; or recurrence-free survival (RFS) if
      patients with locally advanced HCC underwent liver transplant; 2) Objective Response Rate
      (ORR); and 3) Overall survival (OS). The investigators design a clinical study to explore
      whether the combination above as a treatment in patients with advanced and recurrent
      endometrial carcinoma could prolong PFS and to analyze potential immune biomarker of
      therapeutic response.

    <textblock>
      The combination of Lenvatinib and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking has great
      potential in the treatment of locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver
      transplant and metastatic unresectable HCC. This trial is designed as a prospective, open
      label study for 20 patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver
      transplant and metastatic unresectable HCC. The aim is to investigate the efficacy of the
      combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion
      every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.
