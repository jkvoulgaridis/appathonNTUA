  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) treats patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic
      pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Intra-procedural markers of success to guide the intervention
      are lacking. We propose to measure right ventricular (RV) pressure volume loops invasively
      and measure biomarkers at intervals during the course of a course of BPA. These data will be
      analysed to define load independent indices of RV functional improvement, cross correlated
      with biomarker data and be used to calibrate non-invasive assessment of ventriculo-arterial
      coupling by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to better detect responders of BPA and
      pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA).

    <textblock>
      Patients who have Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) can treated
      surgically or by undergoing minimally invasive balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA). However
      not all patients have resolution of their pulmonary hypertension following these procedures,
      and some patients who don't have pulmonary hypertension derive substantial benefit
      nonetheless from surgical clearance of their thromboembolic disease.

      Thus better understanding of the interaction between the blood vessels, the right heart
      workload, and symptoms and outcomes is required to predict treatment response.
      Ventriculo-arterial coupling is one such measure, quantifying the efficiency of transfer of
      energy from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries. Traditionally this has required
      invasive procedures involving intracavity conduction catheterisation of the right ventricle
      to simultaneously measure flow and pressure whilst altering preload. Not only is this
      invasive, but it is not routinely performed in clinical practice due to its complexity and
      requirement for specialised expertise and equipment. As CMR can simultaneously assess right
      ventricular and pulmonary function it may be able to assess function and ventriculo-arterial
      coupling non-invasively and allow for a more detailed and accessible mode of disease
      quantification and stratification.

      We will measure how the right heart function changes during BPA in patients with inoperable
      CTEPH, measured using a conductance catheter placed within the pumping chamber on the right
      side of the heart (right ventricle). This will generate pressure volume loops to detect
      intra-procedural changes of ventriculo-arterial coupling that can be used to quantify
      treatment success. We will also monitor the levels of a newly discovered vessel inflammatory
      marker in the blood (Angiopoietin 2), and NT-Pro BNP that may also be useful in identifying
      responders to treatment and help define the optimal treatment protocol for BPA.

      This cohort will have CMR as standard of care. Data from CMR and invasive measurements of
      ventriculo-arterial coupling will determine the best CMR measures of coupling efficiency.
      These measures will then be applied within a large well-characterised cohort with long term
      follow-up to determine its association with symptoms, and outcomes following surgical
      intervention.
