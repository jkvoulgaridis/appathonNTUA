  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several minimal invasive techniques have been proposed since the last decade aiming to
      enhance and provide adequate environment for periodontal regeneration. Harrel and Rees
      proposed minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in 1995 and minimal invasive surgical technique
      (MIST) that was introduced in 2007 and then further enforced with modified minimally invasive
      surgical technique (M-MIST) in 2009 . A new minimal invasive technique called Non-Incised
      Papilla Surgical Approach (NIPSA) was introduced in 2017. It is aims to maintain the marginal
      tissues integrity by placing horizontal or oblique incision apical to the defect approaching
      the defect through apical access.

      Intraosseous vertical defects are one of the consequences that could result from
      periodontitis, which are classified according to their architecture by the number of residual
      walls, defect width as well as topographic extension in relation to the tooth.

      Conventional surgery done for regenerative purpose regarding vertical defects has been known
      to be affected by clot stability, it was reported in the literature that reduced clinical
      outcomes occurred when early wound failure and exposure of the treated area occurred. This
      led to the innovation of different minimally invasive flap techniques that aimed at reducing
      the surgical trauma, allowing blood clot stability, protecting the regenerating site,
      reducing patient discomfort postoperatively as well as minimizing surgical chair time Among
      these techniques are papilla preservation flaps and minimally invasive surgical approaches
      with papilla elevation or without papilla elevation . However, these techniques had in their
      design incisions related to the interdental papilla which would jeopardize and complicate the
      vascular integrity of the interdental tissues Non incised Papilla surgical approach is a new
      surgical technique introduced by Moreno Rodriguez in 2017 to maintain the marginal tissues
      and the papilla intact by placing a horizontal or oblique incision apical to the defect and
      approaching it through an apical access leaving the marginal tissues to act as a &quot;dome &quot;
      protecting the blood clot

    <description>Horizontal or oblique incision is done on the buccal mucosa as far as possible from the marginal keratinized tissue and the inter dental papilla The horizontal/oblique incision is extended mesio-distally enough to allow proper visualization of the defect A full thickness flap is elevated apico- coronally to expose the coronal limit of the defect Scaling and root planning are done using mini-curettes and power driven ultrasonic tips with care trying to maintain fibers attached to the cementum Granulation tissue is removed with mini-curettes detached from the bony walls and removed from the base of the papilla carefully with microblades and microscissors .
1ry soft tissue closure will be performed by horizontal mattress suture 2mm from the edges of the incision as a first line of closure and then simple interrupted suture as a second line of closure using (5-0, 6-0) polypropylene suture.</description>
