  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of mouthwash with white tea in the
      prevention of paclitaxel induced oral mucositis in women with breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is a common side effect from paclitaxel treatment. It can be very painful and
      compromise nutrition and oral hygiene, and it may increase the risk of infection. Although
      oral mucositis is a common side effect to chemotherapy, no available treatment is yet
      available that can effectively prevent or treat oral mucositis.

      Based on the knowledge that white tea has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-microbial
      effect, the current study aims to assess the effect of mouth wash with white tea on
      paclitaxel induced oral mucositis in women with breast cancer.

      This study is a phase II randomized controlled trial in which eligible patients will be
      allocated to a control group (CG) and a study group (SG). The CG will use salt water with
      soda for mouthwash eight to ten times a day and the SG will use white tea for mouthwash five
      to six times a day.
