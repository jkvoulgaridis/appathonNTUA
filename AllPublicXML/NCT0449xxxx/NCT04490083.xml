  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extra corporeal shock wave therapy (ESWL) is recommended for pain management in patients with
      stone formation in pancreatic duct. ESWL can cause complete stone fragmentation and removal
      in 70% patients, associated with 85 to 90% pain relief.

      Investigators aim to study, predictors pain relief in patients who undergo ESWL, to find out
      which patients will improve and which patients won't improve in terms of pain.

      The study will be a single center observational study.

      General information of the patient in form of duration of symptoms and duration of
      diagnosis,exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Imaging findings such as main pancreatic duct
      stone,size,parenchymal calcification , ductal stricture and its location, using any
      medications such as antioxidants and pain killers .

      The pain score will be estimated by Izbicki's pain score in last 6 months. Patients will
      receive standard of care during study period, and they won't receive any experimental
      therapy.

      After 6months of ESWL further general information of the patient any addictions, a formal
      imaging and determining main pancreatic duct stone ,size ,calcifications and strictures and
      also usage of any medications for decreasing pain.

      Pain will be calculated by Izbick's pain score in last 6 months . Comparing pain score and
      information investigators will evaluate predictive factors of pain relief after ESWL by
      logistic regression.

    <description>ESWL will be performed with a third generation electromagnetic lithotripter (Delta Compact, Dornier Med Tech, Germany) This has both fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging facility. Radio opaque calculi will be targeted directly while a naso pancreatic tube (NPT) was placed for all radiolucent calculi and contrast was passed through this to localize the calculi. Between 5000 and 6000 shocks were delivered per session with frequency of 90 shocks per minute. The aim will be to fragment the calculi to &lt;3 mm or demonstrate a decrease in heterogeneity or density of the calculi in the main pancreatic duct. Shocks will be delivered on consecutive days till fragmentation is achieved. If there is no fragmentation after four sessions of ESWL the procedure will be labeled as unsuccessful and patient will be advised surgery. Procedures will be performed under epidural anesthesia.</description>
