    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (serum bactericidal assay using
      human complement [hSBA] titer ≥ 1:8) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y following the
      administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to a single
      dose of Nimenrix® (Group 2)

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe:

        -  the antibody response of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by hSBA,
           before and 1 month following meningococcal vaccination administered alone (Groups 1 and
           2) or concomitantly with 9-valent human papilloma virus (9vHPV) and tetanus, diphtheria,
           and acellular pertussis - inactivated polio vaccine [adsorbed, reduced antigen(s)
           content] (Tdap-IPV) vaccines (Group 3)

        -  the antibody response against antigens of 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV vaccines, before and 1
           month following vaccination

        -  the safety profile in each group after each and any vaccination
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of study participation for each participant will be approximately 30 to 60 days,
      including 2 or 3 visits (1 or 2 vaccination visit) and 1 or 2 telephone calls, depending on
      study Group.

      * This is the first dose of 9vHPV, of the 2-dose or 3-dose series according to the local
      recommendations and age of the participant. These additional vaccinations for the completion
      of 9vHPV schedule will take place outside of the objectives and scope of this study and thus
      will not be described in this protocol.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>This is a parallel group prevention study with 2 groups that are observer blind (only the person administering the vaccine is unblinded), and 1 group that is open-label</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The study will be performed in a partially observer-blind fashion:
In Groups 1 and 2
Investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment, participants, parents/legally acceptable representatives, the Sponsor, and laboratory personnel performing the serology testing will be kept blinded to the vaccine received
Only the study staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety evaluation will know which vaccine is administered In Group 3
Everyone involved in the study (ie, Investigator, study staff, the Sponsor, participants, parents/legally acceptable representatives) will know which vaccine is administered. This open-label design for Group 3 is due to the different vaccination schedule for this group than for Groups 1 and 2</masking_description>
