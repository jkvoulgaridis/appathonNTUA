  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether longitudinal neuroimaging acquired
      across multiple research and clinical centers is a feasible biomarker to use as an outcome
      measure for clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that manifests with extensive clinical
      heterogeneity, including variable degrees of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron
      (LMN) impairment. While ALS is classically defined as a neuromuscular disorder, approximately
      15% of individuals also develop cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction of the frontotemporal
      variety, ranging in severity from ALS with cognitive or behavior impairment to a frank form
      of dementia consistent with FTD2

        -  Recent consensus criteria capture this heterogeneity by defining these conditions
           together as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD)3

        -  There are emerging and in-progress interventional clinical trials underway that aim to
           arrest ALS and/or FTD disease progression; however, there are limited objective and
           quantitative biomarkers to directly track disease progression during life. Multi-modal
           neuroimaging provides an ideal candidate biomarker for clinical trials because ALS-FTSD
           affects a distributed neuroanatomic network and we can reliably measure
           neurodegeneration of grey matter (GM) and arterial spin labeling based perfusion MRI
           (pMRI) measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, there are many unaddressed
           technical challenges associated with measuring disease progression using neuroimaging
           techniques in a multi-center setting. The overall aim of this protocol is to leverage a
           team science approach to develop disease-specific candidate neuroimaging outcome
           measures for ALS-FTSD clinical trials.

    <description>Neuroinflammatory pathways have been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the vast majority of this evidence is from animal or ex vivo human studies. In vivo measurement of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become possible with [11C]-PBR28 PET imaging. Briefly, TSPO expression is increased when microglial are activated. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that [11C]-PBR28 uptake is elevated in ALS compared to controls, is correlated with upper motor neuron severity, and that microglial activation is associated with more severe upper motor neuron disease and faster disease progression. We are only aware of a single 6-month study of 10 patients evaluating longitudinal change of [11C]-PBR28 in ALS. We hypothesize that we will observe increased [11C]-PBR28 uptake over a 6-month period in motor cortex and prefrontal cortex in ALS. This portion of the study will be performed at UPenn only.</description>

    <description>A dose of ≤ 20 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be 5-20 mCi) of [11C]-PBR28 will be administered by IV injection to the patient under the direct supervision of a Nuclear Medicine Authorized User. A lesser activity may be injected if, in the opinion of a nuclear medicine authorized user complete imaging data could be generated.
Subjects will undergo an approximately 90 minute dynamic PET/CT scan over the brain starting at approximately the same time as the [11C]-PBR-28 injection. Scans will be acquired using a Philips PET/CT time-of-flight Ingenuity scanner (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH, USA). At the end of the dynamic imaging the participant will be allowed to get off the scanner.</description>
