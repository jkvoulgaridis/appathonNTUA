  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Fenzian™ treatment on symptoms
      (such as shortness of breath), lung function (how well the lungs work), and
      albuterol/salbutamol (rescue medication) use in people with asthma. This will be done by
      comparing the effects of Fenzian™ treatment to the effects of a sham treatment, which looks
      the same as the Fenzian™ device but doesn't do anything.

      The Fenzian™ device is an electrical instrument that the investigators hope will help reduce
      airway inflammation associated with asthma symptoms by stimulating the nerves with very low
      electrical currents. The study device will be applied directly to the skin on the back,
      working along the ribs toward the spine, alternating between left and right sides, and on
      your face.

    <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (QOL Technologies 2004) Elizabeth Juniper, (Eur Respir J 1999; 14:902-7). Range 0-6, 0 is no symptoms, 6 is maximal symptoms. 0.5 is considered a minimally important difference, 0.75 or less is associated with a 85% chance that the subject's asthma is well controlled, 1.50 or greater is associated with a 88% chance that the subject's asthma is not well controlled. The ACQ consists of 6 patient/subject reported questions on symptoms and a question completed by the staff for categorization of the patient/subjects forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) from spirometry.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score (to Evaluate Quality of Life)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to completion of treatment at 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mini AQLQ is a questionnaire specifically designed to assess health status in patients with asthma. The mini-AQLQ consists of 15 questions covering symptoms and activities. Each question is scaled from 1 (poorly controlled asthma) to 7(maximally controlled asthma) where 7 reflects a higher quality of life. Total score is the sum of 15 items and may range from 15-105. An increase in the AQLQ score indicates a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The SNOT-22 is a disease-specific quality of life score for rhinosinusitis. SNOT22 is a validated scale which measures sinonasal symptoms for sinusitis patients. The 22 questions are rated on a scale of 0-5 for a maximum total score of 110. Higher scores represent more symptomatic patients.</description>

    <measure>Daytime Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days prior to final assessment visit at week 15</time_frame>
    <description>Daytime symptoms due to asthma were assessed via the electronic diary (AM2+ Asthma Monitor) each evening for 7 days prior to the study visit at Week 15. Daily scores were derived from five questions relating to 1) frequency of asthma symptoms, 2) impact of asthma symptoms, 3) activity, 4) impact of asthma on activity, and 5) breathlessness. Each question was scored from 0 (best) to 6 (worst), with the average of 5 questions providing a daily score ranging from 0 (best) to 6 (worst). Each participant's symptom score was calculated as the average of 7 daily scores. Thus, the range of possible scores is from 0 (best) to 6 (worst).</description>

        <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (QOL Technologies 2004) Elizabeth Juniper, (Eur Respir J 1999; 14:902-7). Range 0-6, 0 is no symptoms, 6 is maximal symptoms. 0.5 is considered a minimally important difference, 0.75 or less is associated with a 85% chance that the subject's asthma is well controlled, 1.50 or greater is associated with a 88% chance that the subject's asthma is not well controlled. The ACQ consists of 6 patient/subject reported questions on symptoms and a question completed by the staff for categorization of the patient/subjects forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) from spirometry.</description>

        <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (QOL Technologies 2004) Elizabeth Juniper, (Eur Respir J 1999; 14:902-7). Range 0-6, 0 is no symptoms, 6 is maximal symptoms. 0.5 is considered a minimally important difference, 0.75 or less is associated with a 85% chance that the subject's asthma is well controlled, 1.50 or greater is associated with a 88% chance that the subject's asthma is not well controlled. The ACQ consists of 6 patient/subject reported questions on symptoms.</description>

Each question is scaled from 1 (poorly controlled asthma) to 7(maximally controlled asthma) where 7 reflects a higher quality of life. Total score is the sum of 15 items and may range from 15-105. An increase in the AQLQ score indicates a better quality of life.</description>

The 22 questions are rated on a scale of 0-5 for a maximum total score of 110. Higher scores represent more symptomatic patients.</description>

        <title>Daytime Symptom Score</title>
        <description>Daytime symptoms due to asthma were assessed via the electronic diary (AM2+ Asthma Monitor) each evening for 7 days prior to the study visit at Week 15. Daily scores were derived from five questions relating to 1) frequency of asthma symptoms, 2) impact of asthma symptoms, 3) activity, 4) impact of asthma on activity, and 5) breathlessness. Each question was scored from 0 (best) to 6 (worst), with the average of 5 questions providing a daily score ranging from 0 (best) to 6 (worst). Each participant's symptom score was calculated as the average of 7 daily scores. Thus, the range of possible scores is from 0 (best) to 6 (worst).</description>

The scores in the TDI evaluate ratings for 3 different categories (functional impairment, magnitude of task in exertional capacity, and magnitude of effort). TDI category scores range from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement)</description>
