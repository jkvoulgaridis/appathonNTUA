      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of oral lenvatinib in
      participants with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or radioiodine (131 I)-refractory/resistant
      differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), unresectable differentiated thyroid cancers, stratified
      by Histology.

      This study contained 3 Phases: the Pretreatment Phase, the Treatment Phase, and the Extension
      Phase. The Pretreatment Phase lasted no longer than 28 days. Informed consent was obtained
      and protocol eligibility and disease characteristics were established prior to treatment. The
      Treatment Phase consisted of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. The Treatment Period
      of the Treatment Phase began at the time that the first participant began study drug
      administration and ended at the time when all participants enrolled completed 8 cycles of
      treatment or discontinued study treatment prior to the eighth cycle (ie, time of data cutoff
      for the primary study analysis [Primary Completion Date]). All participants then entered the
      Extension Phase. The Extension Phase consisted of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period.
      The Extension Phase began immediately after the Treatment Phase ended and included all
      participants that were either still receiving treatment or in follow-up. The time of data
      cutoff for the primary study analysis occurred when all subjects in the study completed 8
      cycles of treatment or discontinued study treatment prior to the eighth cycle.

    <description>ORR was the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 for target lesions using magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) scans, as determined by independent imaging review (IIR). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter. ORR=CR+PR, was presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) by the method of Clopper and Pearson.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK): Steady State Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose and at 0.5 and 2 hours postdose), Cycle 1 Day 8 (predose), Cycle 2 Day 1 (predose and at 0.5 and 2 hours postdose), and Cycle 3 Day 1 (predose and at 2 hours postdose) (Cycle length= 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 9 samples per participant were obtained at specific time points. Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were analyzed using standard analysis methods. Due to the sparse PK sampling in this study, the data were pooled with data from other Phase 1 studies conducted in participants with solid tumors for PK model development and covariate analysis. Individual exposure (steady state AUC) to lenvatinib in MTC and DTC subjects in this study was derived based on the individual predicted steady state AUC from the final PK model. Only data for participants taking 24 mg lenvatinib daily were reported (participants taking 20 mg lenvatinib daily were not included in this data set).</description>

        <description>ORR was the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 for target lesions using magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) scans, as determined by independent imaging review (IIR). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter. ORR=CR+PR, was presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) by the method of Clopper and Pearson.</description>

        <title>Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK): Steady State Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC)</title>
        <description>Up to 9 samples per participant were obtained at specific time points. Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were analyzed using standard analysis methods. Due to the sparse PK sampling in this study, the data were pooled with data from other Phase 1 studies conducted in participants with solid tumors for PK model development and covariate analysis. Individual exposure (steady state AUC) to lenvatinib in MTC and DTC subjects in this study was derived based on the individual predicted steady state AUC from the final PK model. Only data for participants taking 24 mg lenvatinib daily were reported (participants taking 20 mg lenvatinib daily were not included in this data set).</description>

        <description>Blood samples to measure free T4 were collected at Screening (Baseline), Cycle 1 Day 15 (MTC cohort), Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 20, and Final Visit. Changes in free T4 concentration values from baseline to specific time points were calculated. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit values were included.</description>

        <population>All participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit/time point values were included. Data not reported for DTC cohort at Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 20 Day 1 because no participant was evaluable at these time points.</population>

        <description>Blood samples to measure free TSH were collected at Screening (Baseline), Cycle 1 Day 15 (MTC cohort), Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 20, and Final Visit. Changes in free TSH concentration values from baseline to specific time points were calculated. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit values were included. For any free TSH result that was reported as &lt;0.008 mIU/L, 0.004 mIU/L was used for calculating summary statistics.</description>

For each change from baseline assessment time point, only participants with both baseline and relevant visit/time point values were included.

        <description>Blood samples to obtain serum were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 19, Final Visit, and were analyzed for thyroglobulin concentration. Percent changes in thyroglobulin concentration values from baseline to specific time points were calculated. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit values were included.</description>

            <description>Participants with radioiodine (131 I)-refractory/resistant differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) received 24 mg lenvatinib (two 10 mg tablets and one 4 mg tablet) orally, once daily or 10 mg lenvatinib orally twice daily in 28-day treatment cycles. Out of 58 participants in the DTC cohort, 56 participants received 24 mg lenvatinib once daily and 2 participants received 10 mg lenvatinib twice daily (total 20 mg daily), given continuously in 28-day treatment cycles.</description>

        <description>Blood samples to obtain serum were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1(Baseline), Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 2 Days 1,8 &amp;15, Cycles 3 to 9,11,13 Day 1, Final Visit, and analyzed for CytoC concentration. Changes in CytoC concentration values from baseline to specific time points were calculated. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit values were included. For results reported as below quantifiable level (BQL), zero was used for calculating summary statistics. If more than 50% of the results at a visit were BQL, then only 'n', 'minimum' and 'maximum' were calculated for summary statistics.</description>

        <description>Blood samples to obtain serum were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1(Baseline), Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 2 Days 1,8 &amp;15, Cycles 3 to 9,11,13 Day 1, Final Visit, and analyzed for M-30 concentration. Changes in M-30 concentration values from baseline to specific time points were calculated. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit values were included. For results reported as BQL, zero was used for calculating summary statistics. If more than 50% of the results at a visit were BQL, then only 'n', 'minimum' and 'maximum' were calculated for summary statistics.</description>

        <description>Blood samples to obtain serum were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 2 Days 1, 8, and 15, Cycles 3 to 9, 11, 13 (Day 1), Final Visit, and analyzed for Casp 3/7 concentration. Changes in Casp 3/7 concentration values from baseline to specific time points were calculated. Only participants with both baseline and relevant visit values were included. The concentrations of Casp 3/7 were BQL for most participants at most time points. For results reported as BQL, zero was used for calculating summary statistics. If more than 50% of the results at a visit were BQL, then only 'n', 'minimum' and 'maximum' were calculated for summary statistics.</description>
