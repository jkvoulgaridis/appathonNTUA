    <description>Data presented are the number of participants who experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), other non-serious AEs and deaths during the study including the 30-day follow-up. A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which 2 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or 4 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity based on Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE), excluding alopecia, which was considered by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to IMC-A12.</description>

    <description>Half-Life (t1/2) is the time measured for the plasma concentration of the drug to decrease by one half. The analysis was not performed for the 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dosing groups due to insufficient PK data.</description>

    <description>Vss is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug at steady-state. The analysis was not performed for the 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dosing groups due to insufficient PK data.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment to study completion up to 215 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PR and PD were assessed by investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or a new lesion. Participants with a global deterioration of their health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time were to be reported as &quot;symptomatic deterioration&quot;</description>

        <description>The MTD was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which 2 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or 4 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity based on Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE), excluding alopecia, which was considered by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to IMC-A12.</description>

            <description>15 mg/kg IMC-A12 administered I.V. once a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 4 doses per cycle. Cycle 1 was followed by a 2-week observation.
Participants with an objective response after Cycle 1 could have received additional treatment cycles at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or withdrawal criteria were met. Participants with SD could have received up to 2 additional 4-week treatment cycles at the same dose and schedule.</description>

          <description>Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PR and PD were assessed by investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or a new lesion. Participants with a global deterioration of their health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time were to be reported as &quot;symptomatic deterioration&quot;</description>
