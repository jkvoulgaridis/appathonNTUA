  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate HIV infection and associated conditions by monitoring infected
      patients. The study will also serve as a means for recruiting HIV-infected individuals to
      NIAIDs ongoing clinical and laboratory studies and supporting the institute s infectious
      disease training program by providing Infectious Disease fellows with ongoing training in the
      management of HIV infection.

      People 18 years of age and older with suspected or confirmed HIV infection who live in the
      Washington, D.C., metropolitan area may be eligible for this study. Physician referral is
      required.

      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center a minimum of once every 3 to 4 months for
      evaluation with a physical examination; blood tests for research purposes, safety, immune
      status and viral load; and response to any treatment they may be receiving. Other procedures,
      such as a biopsy, are done only as needed for standard medical practice, and informed consent
      is obtained before any such procedure is done. Treatment offered is consistent with standard
      medical practice; no experimental treatments are offered under this protocol.

      This study is designed as a prospective natural history study with ongoing monitoring of HIV
      infection and HIV-related disease processes. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit will
      include: monitoring of immune status and viral load, routine safety laboratory tests, and
      collection of blood for research and storage. Treatment plans will be in accordance with
      standard medical practice, and the number and length of additional visits and diagnostic
      evaluations will vary accordingly. Specific treatment regimens will be in accordance with
      standard medical practice.

        The first subgroup will consist of patients recruited from the Washington DC metropolitan
        area who will receive long-term care for their HIV infection through the NIAID/CCMD HIV
        clinic. The second subgroup will consist of patients with known or suspected HIV infection
        who have been referred to a NIAID/CCMD investigator for reasons such as further testing to
        diagnose or exclude HIV disease, assistance with the diagnosis or management of specific
        HIV-related problems, or complicated opportunistic infections. This latter subgroup of
        patients will be followed on a short-term (12 months or less) basis until the reason for
        referral has been adequately addressed. Following discharge from theprotocol, Group II
        patients will be returned to the care of their referring physicians.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are subject to selection by the Principal Investigator, and will satisfy all of
        the following inclusion criteria:

          1. HIV-infection as documented by positive HIV ELISA and Western Blot or positive assay
             for HIV RNA (serum or plasma). Patients may also be included if they have laboratory
             or clinical evidence suggestive of possible HIV-infection.

          2. Age 18 years or older.

          3. Ability and willingness of subject to understand study requirements and give written
             informed consent.

          4. Group I patients are required to have a primary care provider outside NIH to manage
             non-HIV medical problems. Group II patients must have a referring physician or clinic
             that will continue to manage HIV and non-HIV medical care.

          5. For Group I patients, residence within the greater Washington DC area (approximately
             within a 100-mile radius of the NIH Bethesda campus) is required.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A prospective study subject will be ineligible for this study if he or she satisfies either
        of the following criteria:

          1. Has active drug or alcohol use or dependence or any other condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          2. Refuses to allow collection and storage of samples for research purposes.
