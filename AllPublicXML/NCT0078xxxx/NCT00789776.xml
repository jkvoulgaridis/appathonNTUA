      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of donor natural killer (NK)
      cell therapy and to see how well it works when given together with fludarabine phosphate,
      cyclophosphamide, total-body irradiation, donor bone marrow transplant, mycophenolate
      mofetil, and tacrolimus in treating patients with hematologic cancer. Giving chemotherapy,
      such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation before a donor
      bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's
      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells
      (donor lymphocyte infusion) may help the patient's immune system see any remaining cancer
      cells as not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them (called graft-versus-tumor
      effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against
      the body's normal cells. Giving mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus after the transplant may
      stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identification of the maximal feasible dose of NK cells that can be infused one week after
      nonmyeloablative, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant
      (HCT). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Once the maximal feasible dose has been identified, accrual will be limited to the cohort
      containing this cell dose to determine:

      I. Incidence of relapse. (Phase II)

      II. Incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (Phase II)

      III. Incidence of non-relapse mortality. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of donor NK cell therapy followed by a
      phase II study.

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6 to
      -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo total-body
      irradiation on day -1.

      DONOR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor bone marrow transplantation on day
      0.

      POST-TRANSPLANTATION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      day 3 and mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 4 to 40, followed by a
      taper until day 84 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive tacrolimus IV continuously
      or IV once daily (QD) over 1-2 hours or PO twice daily (BID) on days 4 to 84, followed by a
      taper until day 180 in the absence of GVHD.

      DONOR NK CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo donor lymphocyte infusion of NK cells on day 7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years,
      and then every year thereafter.
