  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system works in
      treating patients with complex atypical hyperplasia or grade I endometrial cancer. High
      levels of estrogen can cause the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Progesterone can help
      balance the amount of estrogen present. Hormone therapy using levonorgestrel, a type of
      progesterone, may fight endometrial cancer by helping regulate hormone levels.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (IUD)
      (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) to treat complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH)
      and grade 1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (G1 EEC).

      II. To determine if response to therapy can be predicted based on the molecular profile of
      the tumor or by change in gene expression after therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess quality of life outcomes in patients treated with levonorgestrel IUD.

      II. To document the toxicity profile of the levonorgestrel IUD in the treatment of complex
      atypical hyperplasia and grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer.

      III. To evaluate the molecular profile of the hysterectomy specimen of patients treated with
      the levonorgestrel IUD. Compare molecular profile in pretreatment tissue to hysterectomy
      tissue between responders and non-responders to levonorgestrel IUD therapy.

      IV. To evaluate long-term survival, disease status, and fertility outcomes in patients with
      levonorgestrel IUD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo placement of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then periodically for up to 5 years.

    <measure>Change in expression levels as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be tested with a paired t-test. Because genetic profile information is highly skewed, natural log transformations will be made to the data prior to calculating change from baseline and completing the t-test. Change in immunohistochemical expression will be analyzed for association with response using a chi-square analysis. Proteins relevant to proliferation and estrogen-signaling will be assessed by IHC.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the percentage of subjects who have period prevalence and incidence of recurrence along with a 95% confidence intervals. Incidence is calculated as the number of patients who recur divided by person-time follow-up. Summary statistics will be completed on LIUD toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life score using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a patient self-reported survey that measures health status across 8 subscales and is scored using weighted sums of the questions in the different subscales. Each subscale score is transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. Higher scores reflect better functioning, while lower scores reflect poorer functioning: physical functioning- ability to perform physical activities; role-physical - ability to work or perform daily activities due of physical health; bodily pain- higher scores reflect less pain and fewer limitations due to pain; general health- reflect better evaluation of personal health; vitality- reflect more &quot;pep&quot; and energy; social functioning- reflect better ability to perform normal social activities without interference due to physical or emotional problems; role-emotional- reflect better ability to work or perform daily activities due to emotional problems; mental health- reflect better feelings of peacefulness, happiness and calm.</description>
