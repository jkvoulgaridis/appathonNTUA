    <textblock>
      Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province was chosen as the research site, and a general hospital was
      randomly selected. The &quot;Chinese version of hypertension health literacy scale&quot; of the tutor
      of this research group was used to evaluate the health literacy level of inpatients with
      hypertension in the Department of Cardiology, and the patients with critical and lack of
      health literacy were selected as the research objects. In the control group, routine health
      management was carried out. On the basis of the control group, the intervention group used
      health education tools combined with health literacy intervention to implement interactive
      health management for 12 months. The results of the intervention measures were compared to
      evaluate the effects of the intervention measures on improving the health literacy level,
      Hypertension Self-care ability, quality of life and reducing systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, physiological and biochemical indicators of
      the patients, so as to provide theoretical basis and practical reference for the further
      development of prevention and treatment strategies of hypertension patients.

    <textblock>
      First, the Chinese version of hypertension health literacy scale was used to evaluate the
      health literacy of inpatients in a hospital, and then the critical and lack of health
      literacy patients were selected as the research objects.

      Then, taking a place in Huzhou City of Zhejiang Province as the research site, a general
      hospital was randomly selected. According to the ratio of male to female = 1:1, the
      hypertension patients who meet the inclusion criteria were screened until the intervention
      group and the control group reached the required sample size. Patients were randomly assigned
      to the intervention group and the control group.

      After the patients signed the informed consent, the patients were intervened. Finally, data
      collection and statistical processing are carried out

    <description>The scale consists of 15 items and 5 dimensions, with a total score of 0-60. One score will be given if one question is answered correctly. The higher the score is, the higher the HL level is. According to the TOFHLA classification standard, HL level is divided into three levels. If the score is less than 32, the HL level is deficient; if the score is 32-40, the HL level is critical; if the score is more than 40, the HL level is sufficient. The score of the scale before and after the intervention was compared.</description>

    <description>Combination of health education tools and health literacy intervention: on the basis of the control group, the hypertension health education tools are used as the education media to encourage patients to find out the elements of the tool chart, use the picture content to guide the topic development, encourage patients to discuss with each other, realize heuristic questions, rather than a single indoctrination, so as to deepen the understanding and memory of patients. At the end of the course, patients are encouraged to set short-term goals to encourage behaviors that continue to achieve larger goals. At the same time, health literacy lectures were organized during the hospitalization. Health literacy lecture is mainly to learn the information that hypertension needs to pay attention to in order to improve the health literacy of hypertension patients and other indicators.</description>

    <description>On the basis of the control group, the intervention measures to improve the health literacy of patients were implemented and self-made health education tools were used. During hospitalization, health knowledge lectures shall be organized for patients. Before the activity, the theme of the activity shall be clarified. Each participant shall be organized by the educator to sit on the tool chart in a U-shape. According to the theme of the tool map, patients interact with educators. And learn the knowledge content related to hypertension health literacy. Before the end of the activity, the educator will review all the contents discussed in the activity quickly, answer the questions in the activity, and help the participants to sort out and consolidate the knowledge acquired in the education. Follow up intervention for patients after leave hospital.</description>
