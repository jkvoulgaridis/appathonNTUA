      Obese women with history of gestational diabetes are in great danger to develop type 2
      diabetes (T2D) within 5-10 years after delivery. Aim of the study is to investigate if 12
      months' liraglutide treatment could decrease the risk of T2D in obese women who have had
      gestational diabetes. The women are randomized either to liraglutide (Victoza ® 1.8 mg) or
      placebo group, once daily. Same laboratory tests are taken and instructions given at baseline
      6 month and one year. After one year visits once a year until 5 years with same laboratory
      tests and measurements are taken.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing along with pandemia of obesity. Gestational
      diabetes is the major risk factor for T2D in women and more than every tenth will develop
      gestational diabetes during pregnancy. T2D can be prevented by weight loss. Health care
      professionals should take advantage of this opportunity to prevent this devastating disease
      in women.

      Aim of the study is to investigate if 12 months' liraglutide treatment (1.8 mg) once daily
      could decrease the risk of T2D in obese women who have had gestational diabetes needing
      treatment with metformin and/or insulin.

      100 women, who have had gestational diabetes with treatment with metformin and/or insulin and
      who have stopped lactation and are not pregnant are enrolled between 6 to 18 months after
      delivery. BMI should be ≥30 kg/m2. The women are randomized either to liraglutide (Victoza ®
      1.8 mg) or placebo group. Both treatments are given by similar device s.c. once daily during
      365 days. Before starting the treatment, clinical examination and laboratory test are done.
      Similar dietary instructions are given. Same laboratory tests are taken and instructions
      given at 6 months and at one year after baseline. Additional follow-up call (AE reporting) is
      scheduled at 3 months and a drug dispensing visit at 9 months. After one year visits once a
      year until 5 years with same laboratory tests and measurements are taken. Primary end-point
      is development of T2D (fasting P-glucose &gt;7 mmol/l and/ or 2 h &gt;11 mmol/l in oral glucose
      tolerance test 75g, and/or HbA1c≥ 6.5 %) from year 1 to 5.
