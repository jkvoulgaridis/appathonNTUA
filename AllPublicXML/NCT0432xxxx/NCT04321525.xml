  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most prestigious psychological treatment for
      depression. However, not only do we need to increase its efficacy but also to widen the
      repertoire of evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions. The importance of the patient's
      engagement in treatment is highlighted in the literature as a key factor for a good
      therapeutic outcome over and above the type of therapy. In this sense, personal construct
      therapy (PCT), with some promising supporting evidence, is particularly suited to fit the
      personal values and attitudes of each patient. In contrast to CBT, PCT does not educate
      patients about depression and give them directions on the changes to be made in their
      dysfunctional behaviors or cognitions. Rather, PCT explores their coherence with respect to
      the person's sense of identity, their construction of self and others, and works with the
      conflicts or dilemmas that appear during this conjoint exploration using the Repertory Grid
      Technique (RGT). In this project, for the first time, the RGT will be implemented using
      Virtual Reality (VR). This format could be highly appealing for young people, thus
      facilitating their involvement in therapy. The efficacy of this innovative application of PCT
      using VR (PCT-VR) will be compared to usual PCT, and to CBT in a randomized clinical trial.
      The Beck Depression Inventory-II is the primary outcome measure for calculating both
      statistical and clinical significance, but other measures will also be used at pre-,
      post-therapy and six-month follow up. The trial will be done in a natural health context,
      mostly the usual primary care center of each patient, with those who consult during the
      active period of the study.

      Our research group has been working on both depression and personal construct theory for more
      than two decades (this includes our previous funded projects), particularly with a
      dilemma-focused intervention aimed to resolve the cognitive conflicts detected with the RGT.
      By fostering a technological innovation with VR, it is expected to boost the current efficacy
      of psychotherapy by increasing the engagement of young people and obtaining better outcomes.
      If these goals are met, a pathological evolution of the patient with its associated personal,
      health and social costs could be avoided.

    <textblock>
      This project will allow to test the hypothesis that a novel brief psychotherapeutic
      intervention, personal construct therapy with virtual reality (PCT-VR) will be more
      efficacious in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression of young adults than current
      treatments such as the well-established Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and the
      promissory personal construct therapy (PCT). It is expected that the enhancement of a current
      psychotherapy with VR, based on the immersive exploration of the patient's self-identity,
      will increase the positive effects of existing psychological therapies (at least the other
      therapies included in the study) in terms of symptom reduction of depressive symptoms
      (primary outcome), and bettering of psychological functioning, wellbeing and satisfaction. It
      is assumed that the use of the VR device created for this study, will make the treatment more
      attractive for young adults, this increasing their engagement in the therapy process. It is
      hypothesized that an immersive exploration of the personal constructs used to perceive self
      and others will facilitate self-understanding and change. As a secondary hypothesis, it is
      expected that PCT, thanks to its personalized and non-prescriptive nature, will be more
      efficacious than CBT. Also, as reflected in the literature, it is expected that the quality
      of the therapeutic alliance will be associated to outcome, but whether this association
      varies in its intensity across therapy modalities will be also explored.

      General objectives With this project, it is pursued the goal of increasing the efficacy of
      psychological therapies for mild-to-moderate depression in young adults. It is expected to
      obtain better clinical results with the promissory and novel treatment modalities (PCT and
      PCT-VR) than with the current most prestigious CBT. By obtaining supporting evidence for
      these therapies, the range of psychotherapeutic alternatives for depression will be increased
      and this will benefit the potential for adapting the interventions to the personal styles,
      characteristics and preferences of each patient. An optimal personalization of the treatment
      favors the patient engagement in therapy and strengthens the therapeutic alliance which, in
      turn, should be reflected in a facilitation of the change process.

      Specific objectives

      1. To assess the efficacy of an innovative VR-enhanced treatment modality of psychotherapy
      (PCT-VR) which has never been tested before. Differential outcomes will be considered not
      only in terms of statistical but also clinical significance and remission rates. In addition
      to the reduction of depressive symptoms our study is aimed also to better psychological
      functioning, wellbeing and satisfaction with the services provided.

      2- To evaluate the efficacy for mild-to-moderate depression in young adults of PCT, a
      psychotherapeutic approach with some supporting evidence for a variety of disorders and
      conditions but still insufficient to be considered efficacious for depression.

      3- To verify the good levels of efficacy shown by CBT in the treatment of depression, mostly
      in international studies.

      4- To identify baseline variables predicting differential outcome such as symptom severity
      (also comparing mild with moderate depression), and characteristics of the personal construct
      system such as the level of cognitive conflict.

      5- To gauge the significance of the therapeutic alliance in the different treatment
      modalities of the study and its influence in the therapeutic outcomes measured.

      6- To explore the personal views of patients with respect to the therapy process that they
      will have experienced as a way to advance our knowledge of the therapy process (including
      potential adverse effects) of each treatment. To compare this knowledge with the quantitative
      results of the study might be helpful for a better understanding of the entire process.

    <description>Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II; Beck, Steer &amp; Brown, 1996). It is a 21-item self-report instrument to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Both the original and the Spanish version (Sanz, Perdigón, &amp; Vázquez, 2003) showed good psychometric properties and acceptability.</description>

    <description>Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM; Evans et al, 2002). It is a 34-item self-report questionnaire for the assessment of subjective wellbeing, symptoms or problems, life functioning and risk. It has good psychometric properties (Trujillo et al, 2016) and it has been adapted into Spanish for free distribution (www.ub.edu/terdep/core) . The short version (CORE-SFB) of 18 items will be used for session-to-session monitoring of the therapy process.</description>

    <description>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). This 21-item version of the DASS comprises 7 items for its three scales (depression, anxiety and stress) which are moderately correlated with each other. The scores for each scale range from 0 to 21. There have been studies of validation with Spanish population finding satisfactory psychometric properties (Bados, Solanas, &amp; Andrés, 2005).</description>

    <measure>Session Rating Scale 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>SRS 3.0 is administered routinely after every session, through intervention completion (10 weeks), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Session Rating Scale 3.0 (SRS 3.0; Duncan et al., 2003). It is a brief questionnaire designed to assess therapeutic alliance at the end of the session. It is composed of 4 items that have to be answered through a visual analog scale (VAS) of 10 centimeters. They measure the appreciation of the relationship with the therapist, agreement with the therapist about the goals and issues discussed in the session, agreement with the method or approach of the therapist, and global assessment of the session. The Spanish version obtained good levels of validity and reliability (Moggia, Niño-Robles, Miller, &amp; Feixas, 2018)</description>

    <measure>Change Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>administered at the end of therapy (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change Interview (Elliott, Slatick and Urman, 2001). This semi-structured interview was created to assess the changes produced throughout therapy, the useful aspects, and the adverse effects of interventions from the patient's perspective. The patient is asked about the (positive) changes he/she has experienced with the intervention, as well as the negative changes if there has been any. Questions are also asked about the attribution of such changes, and their probability of occurrence without intervention. Its functions in this study are to identify both changes that patients are aware of (in their own words) which might go unnoticed with standardized questionnaires and adverse effects (too often neglected in psychotherapy research).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at the end of therapy (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The Adherence to protocol scale created in a preliminary study will be used for assessing the adherence of therapists to the protocols of the assigned treatment condition. The higher the score the better the adherence in a scale from zero to ten. Two graduate students blinded to the treatment conditions and trained to use the scale reliably will rate the audiotapes of 10 sessions of CBT, PCT and PCT-VR.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Consumer Reports Effectiveness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>administered at the end of therapy (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Consumer Reports Effectiveness Scale (CRES-4 Feixas, Pucurull, Roca, Paz, García-Grau y Bados, 2012). It consists of four items designed to evaluate whether patients are satisfied with the therapy they have received and if it has been perceived as effective or not. The total score is intended to reflect the degree of satisfaction with treatment received. To interpret CRES-4 globally, a score is considered that is on a scale ranging from 0 to 300 points. The higher the total score, the greater the effectiveness of the treatment according to the patient.</description>
