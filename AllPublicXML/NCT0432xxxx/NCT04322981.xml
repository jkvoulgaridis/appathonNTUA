  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized
      persons in Canada. During the interferon treatment era, certain circumstances precluded
      individuals from receiving treatment, most notably mental health concerns or active substance
      use. In addition to the tolerability and efficacy of all-oral direct acting antivirals
      (DAAs), novel diagnostic strategies have also increased engagement in the care cascade.
      Point-of care and/or dried blood spot antibody as well as RNA testing allow for diagnosis
      without the need for phlebotomy, a major barrier for those with a history of past or current
      injection drug use. Despite these advances in diagnostic streamlining and increased cure
      rates, engagement post-diagnosis continues to be a major gap. Although the exact mechanism of
      HCV acquisition may not be clear - people who inject drugs, persons who are street-involved
      or low-income, or persons who are difficult-to-reach for other reasons, often experience both
      structural and geographic challenges to obtaining care. Community pharmacists may be the
      first point of contact for higher risk populations and may avoid testing and/or treatment for
      fear of judgement or poor treatment in hospital/specialist settings. While studies have
      demonstrated the feasibility of treating people receiving opioid against therapy (OAT), it
      remains unclear whether Canadian pharmacists can safely and effectively screen, and/or
      confirm HCV, work-up patients for HCV treatment, and prescribe with minimal oversight. If
      this model proves successful, it may have global utility especially in areas of the world
      where pharmacists are the initial point of contact for healthcare issues. The aim of this
      study is to determine whether being tested and linked care and treatment will be more
      effective in a community pharmacy than a referral to a tertiary care hospital for management
      of HCV among people on stable OAT, or other populations who experience barriers to care but
      use community pharmacy services.
