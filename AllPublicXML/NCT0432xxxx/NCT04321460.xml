      The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of LRG-002 investigational
      medicinal product, capsules (Lek d.d., Slovenia) in comparison with placebo, as an adjunct
      treatment for prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in patients with acute
      respiratory diseases (ARDs) receiving a standard antimicrobial therapy.
