      Phase 1, single -centre study in 2 parts. The study designs for each part are well
      established for first-in-human studies and are appropriate to assess safety, tolerability and
      preliminary pharmacokinetics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1:

      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending single dose study in
      healthy adult participants, 6 cohorts, up to 2 additional cohorts may be considered if needed
      according to the observed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics results.

      A sentinel dosing strategy will be implemented at each dose level to ensure the best
      conditions of safety. Each cohort will be divided into at least 2 subgroups. The first group
      (sentinel cohort) will include 2 participants that will be dosed on the first day, with 1
      participant receiving MMV533 and 1 participant receiving placebo. The safety and tolerability
      data from the sentinel cohort up to and including 96 hours post-dose will be reviewed by the
      Principal Investigator, the Medical Monitor and the SponsorÂ´s Medical Director. Following a
      satisfactory safety review, dosing of the remaining participants in the cohort may proceed.

      Part 2:

      Open label, 2-period cross-over, randomized, pilot food effect study to provide preliminary
      information on the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of a single-dose oral
      administration of MMV533 to healthy male and female participants aged between 18-55 years
      old. Part 2 may be conducted in parallel to or after completion of Part 1 at the discretion
      of the SRC. The dose will be selected by the SRC based on PK and safety results obtained in
      Part 1 and also taking into account the human efficacious dose/exposure predicted from
      preclinical efficacy studies in rodent malaria models.

             local recurrence or metastases.

         28. Any vaccination within 28 days of screening.

         29. Any medical condition that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or delegate
