  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early
      treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors
      combined with machine learning algorithms to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools
      for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of
      physical disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life
      improves long-term outcomes. However, the investigators are currently held back by
      inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests
      are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long-term predictive
      value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the
      early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant
      development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with
      existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants.
      To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, the investigators will
      obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded
      while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into
      feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine
      learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other
      ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many
      aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores.

    <description>The spontaneous movements of infants aged 1 to 5 months will be classified with the GMA. The GMA is a qualitative observational scale of infant movement. Normal infant movement is described as a writhing movement at earlier ages, characterized by small, circular and elegant movements, and fidgety movements at older ages.</description>

    <description>Arm (Study) 2: To discover the features related to long-term motor development.

Here using video data from 1200 infants, plus those gathered from Arm 1 and Arm 2, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement.</description>

    <intervention_name>PANDA Gym</intervention_name>
    <description>Infants will lie supine on a flat surface and will be placed in the PANDA gym where they either move by themselves or will interact with an instrumented toy. We will collect video, mat, and toy data from PANDA gym under two conditions: 1) infants playing supine without a toy and 2) infants reach, grasp and kick of the new PANDA toy. A test session will proceed as follows: The infant will be placed on his or her back at a predetermined position on the gym mat for the 2-minute no toy condition. Next, the toy will be given to the baby and adjusted for the infant to reach or kick. A caregiver will be seated at the head of the baby (out of a baby's sight) to provide comfort if needed. Testing will be done in NICU or at daycare or the rehabilitation robotics lab at University of Pennsylvania.</description>

    <description>The parent or legal guardian will be consented first via the virtual rounding mobile app. They will also be asked to fill out general surveys including, a demographic survey, and a case report form, and a user feedback survey that provides relevant information, on both the family's and infant's medical history and experience. (see the flow-chart for the app). Within the caregiver survey, we will request the pediatrician (or primary care physician) name. We believe that with the baby name, caregiver name, zip code, and physician name, we will be able to locate the physician if needed.
Parents or legal guardians or the research will be asked to collect video via the MOBILE app. They will be instructed to ensure that the infant lies supine in no more than one-layer of tight-fitting clothing (i.e. infant onesie) while calm and awake. In all cases, we will have video recordings of the baby. They will be asked to upload the video to the app.</description>
