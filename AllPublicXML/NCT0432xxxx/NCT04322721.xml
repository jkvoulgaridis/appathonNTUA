      The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between coagulopathy during the
      perioperative period (before the operation and on the first day after the operation) and the
      long-term survival of traumatic brain injury patients undergoing surgery, as well as to
      explore the predisposing risk factors that may cause perioperative coagulopathy.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide,
      and it represents a global health concern and financial burden [1, 2]. The main causes of
      early death in trauma victims are acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy, which are related
      to each other and influence each other. Thus, this vicious circle is often referred to as the
      &quot; trauma triangle of death &quot; [3, 4]. Trauma-induced coagulopathy manifests as a state of
      hypercoagulopathy trending towards thrombosis [5] and a state of hypocoagulopathy with
      progressive intracranial hemorrhage and increased systemic bleeding [6, 7].

      There are many studies continuously proving that trauma-induced coagulopathy is common in
      traumatic brain injury patients [8-10] and the incidence of coagulation disorders has great
      heterogeneity, ranging from 7% to 54% [11, 12]. Reasons that cause this variation include the
      different techniques and definitions used, the heterogeneity of the patients and the various
      testing times [13]. Secondary coagulopathy after traumatic brain injury represent an
      important factor for unfavorable prognosis [14, 15], resulting in a nine-fold higher risk of
      death and a 30-fold higher risk of poor prognosis than in TBI patients without secondary
      coagulation disorder [7, 9, 16]. Mortality in TBI patients with coagulopathy is also highly
      heterogeneous, ranging from 22% to 66% [17, 18]. TBI patients with coagulopathy tend to
      suffer from delayed or progressive intracranial hemorrhage, as well as from microvascular
      thrombosis [19, 20].

      Many retrospective and observational studies have focused on coagulation upon admission or
      the presence of any coagulation disorders during the whole period of hospitalization [21,
      22]. A multicenter study described the course of coagulopathy in patients with isolated TBI,
      and associated it with CT characteristics and outcomes [15]. The previous study mostly
      focused on the coagulopathy on admission, while the association between coagulopathy in
      perioperative period and long-term survival of TBI patients has not been explored. It is
      important to explore this relationship because many TBI patients require surgical treatment,
      and it has been well established that the surgical intervention have an impact on the
      coagulation functions. We therefore investigated for the first time whether coagulopathy
      during the perioperative period, with the use of coagulation function tests performed before
      the operation and on the first day after the operation, was related to the long-term survival
      of these patients. Furthermore, we investigated the predisposing risk factors that may cause
      coagulopathy in the perioperative period, to the extent that these risk factors could be
      controlled and managed for avoiding coagulopathy.

        The clinical data of TBI patients were retrospectively collected from January 1, 2015 to
        April 25, 2019 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University.
        We included patients who recorded an intracranial injury as the main diagnosis or the
        coexisting diagnoses upon admission. Intracranial injuries were identified by WHO ICD-11
        codes from NA07.0 to NA07.9.
