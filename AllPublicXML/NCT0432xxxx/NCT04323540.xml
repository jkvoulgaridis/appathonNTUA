  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will aim to compare two modalities in the reconstructive treatment of
      peri-implantitis defects. More specifically, the control group will be a reconstructive
      approach (xenograft bone graft granules and collagen membrane, BioOss and BioGide, Geistlich,
      Wolhusen). The test group will be the same with the exception of an autologous sub-epithelial
      connective tissue palatal graft, sutured beneath the flap, which will be used in addition to
      grafting materials.

      Outcomes will include CAL, PD, MR, defect resolution, PI, BoP, SUPP, patient-reported outcome
      measures including an aesthetic self-evaluation.

      The study will aim to compare two modalities in the reconstructive treatment of
      peri-implantitis defects.

      More specifically, the control group will be a &quot;pure&quot; reconstructive approach (xenograft bone
      graft granules and reservable collagen membrane, BioOss and BioGide, Geistlich, Wolhusen).
      This is in accordance with gold standard practices of reconstructive therapy of peri-implant
      defects.

      The test group will be treated with the same approach and materials, with the exception of an
      autologous sub-epithelial connective tissue palatal graft, sutured beneath the flap, which
      will be used in addition to the grafting materials. The graft will be harvested from the
      homolateral palate (molar region).

      Outcomes will include CAL, clinical attachment level (primary outcome), PD or probing depth,
      MR or mucosal recession, defect resolution (composite outcome made up of simultaneous absence
      of PD&gt;5 mm, BOP/SUP and bone level changes &gt;0.5 mm, PI, BoP or bleeding upon probing,
      suppuration SUP on probing, SUP on palpation, patient-reported outcome measures including an
      aesthetic self-evaluation.

      The measures will be recorded at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24 months. Radiographic bone
      levels will be compared with 2 week image at 12 and 24 months

    <description>For both arms (excluding the already included information): defect debridement, removal of debris using titanium curettes, titanium brushes on the implant surface, irrigation with saline, application of sterile cotton pellets with saline solution. Grafting with (experimental) xenograft and soft tissue, or xenograft alone (control). Suture.
Specific to control group (active comparator): the peri-implant defect will be filled with xenograft, and a collagen membrane will be fitted and trimmed to the defect area.
Specific to test/experimental group: same as above (for control). In addition a soft tissue graft will be harvested from the palate and sutured to the buccal flap. The entire flap will then be sutured to the lingual flap.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Â· Be able and willing to provide consent and sign the informed consent form.

               -  Be able and willing to comply with study procedures and follow-up appointments
                  required by the study protocol.

               -  Age&gt;18 years

               -  Presence of at least one implant affected with peri-implantitis, defined as the
                  following con-dition: at least one site presenting peri-implant probing depth
                  (PPD) &gt;6 mm and simultane-ous presence of profuse BoP/SUP and a radiographically
                  documented change in bone level greater than initial bone remodeling. In the
                  likely event that a baseline radiographic image is absent, the bone level will be
                  compared to where it would likely have been at the time of implant insertion and
                  a difference of &gt;3 mm from that level will be considered.

               -  Implants in function (i.e. loaded) for at least 1 year.

               -  Screw- and cement-retained suprastructures for both fixed and removable
                  prostheses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Compromised systemic health which contraindicates the study procedures.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Cigarette smoking&gt;5 per day

          -  Systemic conditions compromising healing (i.e. diabetes mellitus). Patients with
             diabe-tes mellitus types I or II will be asked to provide information regarding their
             most re-cent HbA1c values. Only patients with HbA1c&lt;7% will be enrolled.
