  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the onset of prosthesis use following lower extremity amputations,body shows
      biomechanical changes according to the amputation level and consequently develops adaptation
      mechanisms both on the healthy and ampute side. Adaptations in the lumbo-pelvic and lower
      lumbar regions cause asymmetries in the muscle tissue by causing changes in the morphological
      structure of the muscle, especially in the muscles of the waist, hip and knee and
      recruitment.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of stairing up and down activity on the
      mechanical properties of lumbal paravertebral muscles in TFA and TTA and its relation with
      lower lumbar region pain.
