  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised trial investigating the effect of a preemptive
      administration of levosimendan on postoperative cardiac NT-proBNP concentrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major cardiovascular complications occur in about 3 % of all patients undergoing noncardiac
      surgery and are even higher in patients with increased preoperative risk factors. N-terminal
      pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) increases in over two third of patients undergoing
      surgery and is a strong predictor for perioperative myocardial complications. Levosimendan is
      a positive inotropic Ca2+ sensitizer and significantly reduces postoperative BNP
      concentration in cardiac surgery. The evidence in the non-cardiac surgery setting, however,
      is weak. Therefore, we will test our primary hypothesis that the perioperative administration
      of levosimendan significantly will reduce postoperative NT-proBNP concentrations in patients
      undergoing moderate- to high-risk non-cardiac surgery. We will also test the secondary
      hypotheses that levosimendan will reduce postoperative maximum troponin T (maxTnT)
      concentration, the incidence of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), myocardial
      infarction and death within 30 days and one year after surgery.

    <description>The administration of levosimendan improves LVEF and myocardial oxygen perfusion, which will be reflected in a decrease of postoperative NT-proBNP concentration.Since NT-proBNP is a strong predictor for postoperative cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, we want to test the efficiency of levosimendan to decrease postoperative maxNT-proBNP concentrations in patients with increased cardiac risk factors undergoing moderate- to high-risk noncardiac surgery.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of MINS (myocardial injury in non cardiac surgery)</measure>
    <time_frame>First three postoperative days</time_frame>
    <description>Levosimendan decreases the incidence of MINS during the first 3 postoperative days as compared to placebo in patients with increased cardiovascular risk factors undergoing moderateto high-risk noncardiac surgery. MINS is defined as: (i) a non-high-sensitivity troponin T &gt;_30ng/L2 and (ii) a high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) of 20 to &lt;65 ng/L with an absolute change of at least 5 ng/L—this change threshold is independently associated with 30-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.52-6.25]—or an hsTnT level &gt;_65ng/ L. Furthermore, an absolute change of at least 5 ng/L is independently associated with 30-day mortality and will also be defined as MINS. TnT will be measured within 2 hours after surgery, on the first, second and third postoperative day.</description>

    <measure>Myocardial Infarction</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Levosimendan reduces the event rates of myocardial infarction and death during 30 days and 1 year after surgery as compared to placebo. Myocardial infarction is defined as a rise of TnT at least one value is above the 99th percentile URL and with at least one of the following: (i) symptoms of acute myocardial ischaemia; (ii) new ischaemic ECG changes; (iii) development of pathological Q waves; (iiii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium; (v) new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic ethiology; (vi) identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography including intracoronary imaging or autopsy.</description>

    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We evaluate the WHODAS 2.0 score before surgery on the day of consent, 30 days after surgery, and 1 year after surgery per phone call. For analyzing we use simply scoring. Each score is assigned to each of the following items - &quot;none&quot; (0), &quot;mild&quot; (1), &quot;moderate&quot; (2), &quot;severe&quot; (3), and &quot;extreme (4).
We will simply add up the scores from the items without recoding or collapsing of response categories, thus, there is no weighting of the individual items. As a result, the simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains constitutes a statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of functional limitations.</description>

NT-proBNP values have been stratified to the previous published thresholds to predict mortality or MI after surgery.</description>
