  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders in the United States.
      Conservative treatments generally consist of pharmacological agents and physical therapy.
      Unfortunately, such conservative care is often mismanaged, and little data is collected on
      clinical outcomes. The proposed investigation utilizes a novel and state-of-the-art mobile
      application (DETP) to guide an at-home exercise therapy program for non-operative knee pain.
      The purpose of this study is conducting a single-blind randomized, controlled, superiority
      study to compare the DETP to conventional physical therapy (PT). The investigators will seek
      to determine improvement in pain and function in PROMIS measures as the primary outcome. The
      investigators will also evaluate satisfaction with the application as a secondary outcome.

             pain).

          -  Participants must be diagnosed with a knee injury and the next step of care is either
             a home exercise program or external physical therapy ordered at the academic center.

          -  Prescribed external physical therapy (i.e., therapy not completed at Mayo Clinic in
             Rochester/Minneapolis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously completed series of physical therapy visits for knee injury within the past
             12 months for the same injury (received one introduction PT session as seen in
             executive program will not be considered an exclusion).

          -  Recommended by a physician for consideration of total knee replacement.

          -  Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, gout in the knee, or other systemic
