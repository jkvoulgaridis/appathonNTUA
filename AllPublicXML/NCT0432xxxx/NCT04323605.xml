  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the initial monitoring period during hospitalization and isolation, patients with
      recent transplants are regularly monitored in monthly consultations but are still fragile,
      immunosuppressed and undergoing many treatments. The implementation of an outpatient
      assistance program for transplant patients should be feasible and allow for the improvement
      in medical-psycho-social care for the patients during this fragile and risky period, improve
      the satisfaction and quality of life for these transplant patients and assist in their
      socio-professional and familial reintegration.

A file is received at 100% if the 4 following tasks are fully completed:

- completion of medical-psycho-social questionnaire (AMA-ALLO phone call form) by nurse with the patient's responses
- information and transmission of questionnaire results by nurse to the transplant physician
- physician/nurse decision for potential intervention (specialized consultation, consultation with the transplant physician, hospitalization, modification of treatments, additional exams to carry out, etc.)</description>
