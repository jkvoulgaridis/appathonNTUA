      Open label randomized controlled study, for Harmonic versus Ligasure in transoral endoscopic
      thyroid surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a prospective randomized controlled study. The principal investigator or another
           clinical investigator in charge will individually inform the patients about the study,
           on the day before surgery.

        -  When informed consent is obtained, an investigator in charge of randomization only, will
           randomize the patients.

        -  According to randomization, the experimental group will Ligasure and the control group
           will use Harmonic ACE 7+. Other than the randomized use of energy devices, the protocol
           for TOETVA is performed as usual.

        -  Operation time (from insertion of the laparoscopic camera to removal of the camera),
           number of times the camera was cleaned, intraoperative blood loss will recorded.

        -  Postoperative hospital stay, visual analog pain scale, blood cell count and inflammatory
           parameters, postoperative drain amount will recorded.

        -  Complications of thyroid surgery (vocal cord dysfunction, hypoparathyroidism) are
           compared for safety assessment.
