    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based clinical practice
      guideline in the prevention and management of neonatal extravasation injury, and to examine
      the change in nurses' knowledge of and adherence to the guideline.

    <textblock>
      A study with controlled before-and-after design was conducted. The clinical practice
      guideline was developed and a multifaceted educational program was delivered for nurses.
      Neonatal outcomes were collected at baseline and after completion of the intervention. The
      changes in nurses' level of knowledge and adherence to the guideline were also measured.
