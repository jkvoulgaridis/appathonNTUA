  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of mindfulness training on prenatal maternal
      anxiety using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). An RCT of mindfulness training for
      prenatal anxiety has distinct clinical and scientific advantages.

      The investigators will use the Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) intervention
      in this study to build on previous findings by focusing on anxiety in pregnancy while also
      teaching mindfulness skills shown to promote positive childbirth appraisals and sensitive
      parenting through mindful parenting skills that have been shown to be linked to
      maternal-infant stress physiology in other work.

      This study will enroll pregnant women with elevated anxiety (N = 60) who will be randomly
      assigned to the MBCP condition (n = 30) or an active control condition (a treatment as usual
      (TAU) condition; n = 30) which is a standard childbirth education class. Mothers will be
      assessed pre- and post-intervention and postpartum. Infant multi-modal neuroimaging will
      occur at age 1 month, at home questionnaire follow-up will occur at age 3 months, and a
      behavioral observation of parenting and child social-emotional functioning will occur at age
      12 months. The hypothesis is that there will be greater benefits from MBCP relative to TAU
      controls, and enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and relevant cortico-limbic areas in
      from MBCP relative to TAU controls.

      Baseline (Pre-Class) Visit : Once study eligibility has been confirmed, the participant will
      come to the lab for an in-person visit. If they choose to continue in the study after reading
      and signing the consent form, they will complete a series of questionnaires and collect
      saliva samples at home.

      Childbirth Education Intervention: The participant will be randomly assigned to one of two
      childbirth and parenting education groups (either the MBCP course offered at UW Health or a
      TAU course). Participants in the TAU group will be provided options of courses to select.
      Courses may last up to 9 weeks long. The course is provided as part of the study.
      Participants are asked to complete the course before the 37th week of pregnancy.

      Post-Intervention (Post-Class) Visit: After completing the childbirth and parenting education
      course, the participant will complete a series of questionnaires and collect another set of
      saliva samples. This can happen in person or remotely.

      1-Month Follow-Up Visit: One month after birth, the participant and their child will come to
      the lab for an MRI scan of the child's brain while he or she sleeps as well as complete
      another series of questionnaires.

      3-Month Follow-Up Visit: Three months after birth, the participant will complete a series of
      questionnaires.

      12-Month Follow-Up Visit: Twelve months after birth, the participant and their child will
      come to the lab for one final visit to do a behavioral assessment as well as complete a final
      series of questionnaires.

    <measure>Maternal Stress Physiology as Measured by Change in Slope for Salivary Cortisol from Pre-Class to Post-Class Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-class and post-class phases approximately within a 12 week window</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary cortisol will be collected at home 3 times per day (upon waking, 40 minutes post waking, and before bed) for 3 days to provide measures of cortisol diurnal rhythm. Kits will be sent home for participants to use. Mean diurnal cortisol will be reported for each time point (waking, 40 minutes post waking, and before bed). Then the change in slope from the pre-class samples to the post-class samples will be investigated. Collection will occur within 1 week of completion of pre-class questionnaires and within 1 week after completion of the childbirth education course and post-class questionnaires.</description>

    <description>The MBCP program is a fully manualized childbirth and parenting preparation course. Developed in 1998 in a clinical context, MBCP is an enhanced version of the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program tailored for addressing the concerns of pregnancy and early parenting. Through MBCP, pregnant women and their partners learn mindfulness skills for coping with the anxiety and stress of pregnancy and parenting, and the pain and fear of childbirth. They are given explicit instruction in skills for cultivating positive emotion and developing mindful, sensitive parenting. MBCP groups meet weekly for 9 weeks, with a retreat day between weeks 6 and 7.</description>

    <description>TAU control participants will undergo standard (real-world) hospital- or community-based childbirth education that does not have a mindfulness focus. They will be able to choose whichever class they want from the list. If they prefer a class that is not on the list, then study staff will obtain the syllabus for that class to check whether there is a mindfulness component.</description>
