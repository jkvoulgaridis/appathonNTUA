      To study whether Somfit is substantially equivalent to an existing approved device (i.e.
      Compumedic's Grael System) to assist in elucidating sleep disorders.

      Sleep is recognized as one of the three pillars of health (i.e. nutrition, exercise and
      sleep). Poor quality and fragmented sleep leads to an increase in the risk for development of
      chronic health conditions. Given the importance of good quality sleep and its critical role
      in overall well-being, there is a need for regular monitoring and assessment of sleep quality
      in individuals. However, current technologies will only allow for this to be performed in
      sleep clinics and with the help of full polysomnography (PSG) systems which require the
      patients to spend a night at the clinic with several wired electrodes connected to their
      scalp. This will cause discomfort for the patients in a long run. To solve this problem,
      Compumedics has recently developed a miniaturized, portable and affordable sleep monitoring
      system with code name of &quot;Somfit&quot; which can be used in the comfort of patients' home. The aim
      of this study is to validate Somfit for home based sleep studies.

        30 volunteers were invited to participate in this study. 15 participants will be selected
        among healthy volunteers, by advertising to the general public. The remaining 15 will be
        among patients with diagnosed sleep apnea who visit SleepMetrics clinic as part of their
        routine treatment.
