  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute pericarditis is empiric and is based on treatment with medications
      with anti-inflammatory properties such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and
      corticosteroids. However, this therapy is given as a relatively long course of therapy (â‰¥ 3
      weeks) and can be associated with substantial side effects.

      Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that has not been investigated an alternative to
      conventional therapy in patients with acute pericarditis.

      Dexamethasone is an inexpensive drug and can be given in an oral tablet form. It has a quick
      onset of action, relatively long duration of action and is therefore often given in high
      doses for short periods.

      Dexamethasone has been shown to be a safe therapeutic option in ITP (Immune
      Thrombocytopenia), another disease in which steroids are an accepted treatment option. The
      abundant data on using dexamethasone in comparison to longer prednisone-based regimens has
      been evaluated in this disease and has shown to be effective and without the longer exposure
      time to steroids and potential side effects. This data shows that dexamethasone can be a safe
      therapeutic option.The investigators hypothesize that therapy with short term, high dose
      dexamethasone will offer better clinical responses to conventional therapy in the treatment
      of acute pericarditis with less potential side effects compared to conventional therapy.

      The Investigators aim to conduct a randomised, non-blinded trial assessing the use of
      dexamethasone as an alternative to conventional therapy for use in patients with acute
      pericarditis.

      Dexamethasone compared to conventional therapy in the treatment of acute pericarditis: a
      superiority randomized controlled trial (Dexa-P)

      Objectives:

      The investigators hypothesize that therapy with short term, high dose dexamethasone will
      offer better clinical responses to conventional therapy with less potential side effects
      compared to conventional therapy

      Trial design:

      A randomised, non-blinded trial assessing the use of dexamethasone as an alternative to
      conventional therapy for use in patients with acute pericarditis.

      Quality Assurance:

      After the first 3 participants have been enrolled and completed a month of follow up, the
      preliminary findings will be forwarded to the quality control committee of the Helsinki
      Ethics Committee of Rabin Medical Center

      Withdrawal of participants:

      Participants are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time and without
      prejudice to further treatment.

      A participant may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:

        -  Subject withdrew consent.

        -  Severe Adverse Event (As described below) Reasons for withdrawal will be documented. In
           cases of more than one reason for early withdrawal from the study, the most significant
           reason will be stated.

      Replacement of withdrawn participants:

      Withdrawn randomized participants will not be replaced.

      Discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions:

      If a participant has incessant pericarditis within one month of therapy:

        -  Participants in the dexamethasone arm will be given another cycle of dexamethasone
           therapy of 20mg for 4 days can be given. If there is a further persistence, prednisone
           therapy will then be initiated.

        -  Participants in the conventional therapy arm will be changes to prednisone therapy

      Definition of incessant pericarditis:

      Recurrence of pleuritic chest pain and one or more of the following signs:

        1. Pericardial friction rub

        2. Electrocardiographic changes specific to pericarditis (concave ST elevation, PR
           depression)

        3. Echocardiographic evidence of pericardial effusion

      3) An elevation in inflammatory markers (white-cell count, or C-reactive protein level)
      without a symptom-free interval of 6 weeks or longer after the first acute event.

      If participant is hospitalized with a possible side effect, the treating physician will be
      notified to assess for modifying the participant allocation.

      Concomitant care:

      There are no prohibited concomitant medications. Participants should continue to take drugs
      for other co-morbidities as usual.

      Participant Timeline:

      The enrollment will be done within 72 hours of initial assessment. Each participant will
      undergo eligibility screen and suitable participants will receive informed consent. The
      allocation will be determined immediately after the participant will be found to be eligible
      and will be made randomly.

      Once participants are identified with an initial episode of acute pericarditis and informed
      consent is given, an initial assessment will be done.

      This will include baseline blood tests - including baseline liver and renal function tests,
      full blood count and C-reactive protein.

      All participants will undergo echocardiographic imaging at baseline. There are two possible
      interventions: dexamethasone therapy or &quot;conventional&quot; therapy.

      Participants will be followed up at 1 weeks, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after treatment
      initiation.

      The follow up will be telephonically at 1 week, 6 months and 12 months. At the 1 month follow
      up, clinical assessment, inflammatory marker and a repeat echocardiogram will be performed.
      This follow up will be at the pericardial disease clinic at Rabin Medical Center .

      Sample size:

      Assuming a recurrence rate of 26.6% in the control group at 12 months, 269 participants in
      each arm will allow for a 80% power to detect a 10% absolute reduction in the recurrence rate
      in in the Dexamethasone arm at a significance level of 5%.

      Recruitment:

      Investigators will include physicians in the emergency room and admission setting to help
      identify and recruit participants.

      Methods: Data Collection, management and analysis

      Enrollment:

      First assessment including baseline variables and suitability of the participant to the study
      will be made during the enrollment, by the study coordinators.

      In addition demographic and clinical characteristics will be recorded. The data will be
      collected during an interview of the participant or with assistance of the computerized
      medical records.

      Furthermore, laboratory tests such as blood count, liver and kidneys functions and C reactive
      protein will be made and be recorded for each participant.

      Interventions:

      The type of intervention will be recorded by the study coordinators for each participant
      according to the allocation group.

      Assessments of outcomes:

      The primary outcome at each follow up, both telephonically and on clinical follow up The
      secondary outcomes will be assessed telephonically and using the medical computerized
      systems.

      Data management:

      All data regarding the participant's hospitalization: Baselines variables, interventions and
      glucose levels will be stored in secured excel documents for each study group.

      Data regarding the participant's outcomes will be stored in a different secured excel
      documents for each study group.

      The coding of the documents and the separation between the hospitalization and follow up
      period data is designated to ensure the investigator blinding.

      Statistical analysis:

      The primary outcome is the occurrence of Recurrent Pericarditis within 12 months. This will
      be calculated by bivariate analysis as relative risk. The secondary outcome of time to
      recurrence will be plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the Log-rank test
      (unadjusted analysis), Hazard ratio for the risk of the primary analysis between the control
      and Dexamethasone arm will be calculated using a univariate cox proportional hazards ratio
      model (unadjusted analysis). Further secondary outcomes will be analysed by bivariate
      analysis.

      Methods: monitoring Harms: Side effects will be monitoring during therapy as defined
