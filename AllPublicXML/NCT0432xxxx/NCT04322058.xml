           responsibility outcomes from program entrance to six months post-exit?

        3. How was program dose related to change in parenting, relationships, and financial
           responsibility from program entrance to six months post-exit?

        4. How was program support utilization related to change in parenting, relationships, and
           financial responsibility outcomes from program entrance to exit?
