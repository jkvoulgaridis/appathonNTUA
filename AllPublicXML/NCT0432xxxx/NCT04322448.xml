  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a non-blinded two cohort design consisting only of symptomatic patients
      with CuTS or compressive peroneal neuropathy or in need of peroneal nerve decompression. The
      first cohort will be - patients with CuTS. Evaluation of each CuTS patient will include
      assessment by the treating surgeon and a certified hand therapist. Patients who have clinical
      examination and history consistent with a diagnosis of CuTS based on subjective and
      functional assessment outlined below will be consented to this study. The second cohort will
      be patients in need PND for compressive neuropathy of peroneal nerve. PND patients will be
      evaluated by clinical exam and have imaging with high resolution ultrasound or MRI negative
      for mass lesion.

        -  During surgery, the surgeon will perform an MMG immediately pre-decompression and
           immediately post-decompression of the nerve. This will entail placing a sensor and probe
           on the nerve that will be decompressed.
