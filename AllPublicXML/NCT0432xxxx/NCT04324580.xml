  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if splinting and formal physical therapy are necessary
      following surgical fixation (open reduction internal fixation) of distal radius fractures
      (broken wrist). Currently there is no consensus for post-operative protocol following
      fixation of distal radius fractures. The decision to splint (late mobilization) and prescribe
      formal physical therapy vs. not to splint (early mobilization) and use self-guided physical
      therapy is based on surgeon or institutional preference. The goal of this study is to
      determine if early mobilization leads to improved outcomes and decreased costs without
      increasing pain or the loss of hardware fixation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      188 patients treated for distal radius fractures with open reduction internal fixation using
      volar locked plating will be split into two study groups: a group that is immobilized in a
      splint post operatively and given formal physical therapy and a group that does not receive
      either of these post operative interventions. The primary outcome will be loss of fixation.
      Secondary outcomes will include pain, cost, Quick Dash, range of motion, and grip strength.
      Data will be recorded at the pre-operative visit, as well as at post-operative visits at 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.

    <description>This will be measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which measures pain using a 10 point scale. On a scale of 1-10 where following pain scale is: no pain (0), mild pain(1-3), moderate pain (4-6), and severe pain (7-10).</description>

    <description>Participants will be placed into a volar-based plaster splint post-operatively. Participants will be asked to keep non-weight bearing (on the operated wrist) but no restrictions for range of motion, keeping the dressing in place until first post-operative visit at 2 weeks. After that, participants will be placed into a custom thermoplastic splint by a therapist. This will be worn for 5 weeks. Supervised physical therapy will be prescribed 1- 2 times per week for a total of 8 weeks along with a home exercise program. Active range of motion and strengthening exercises will be performed at home twice daily for 20 minutes for a total of 8 weeks. The splint will be removed only for formal and home physical therapy and hygiene.</description>
