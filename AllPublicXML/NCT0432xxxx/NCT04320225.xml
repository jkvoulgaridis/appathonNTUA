  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. The objective
      is to find out if there is a connection between vitamin D level and the efficacy of
      dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed primary immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP).

    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a prospective, observationalï¼Œnon-randomized
      control trial of 60 ITP adult patients. Dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per
      day for 4 days, two-cycles with an interval of 10 days) will be used in the target patients.
      Vitamin D level will be detected before the utilization of treatment measures. Depend on the
      vitamin D level, the patients will be divided into 2 groups(higher vitamin D level group and
      lower vitamin D level group).Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated
      before and after treatment.
