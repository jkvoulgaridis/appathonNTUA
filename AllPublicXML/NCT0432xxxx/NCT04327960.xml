    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate different scores of risk assessment in patients with
      pulmonary embolism. This study aim to compare the accuracy of these scores in predicting
      mortality during hospital admission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with a
      high mortality rate.Approximately 1% of all hospitalized patients and 10% of all in-hospital
      mortalities are PE related. Adding to this, acute PE is linked to comparatively high (≥13%)
      short-term mortalities that occur either in hospital or within 30 days.

      Some studies have demonstrated that PE may indicate increased 1-year mortality rates up to
      25%,,. Therefore, PE is considered a potentially fatal disease, although patients who escape
      a PE-related death are still endangered by hematologic mishaps, especially recurrence of VTE
      and/or PE, or on the contrary, serious hemorrhage5.

      Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate
      therapeutic management approach. Risk classification of PE can discriminate low-risk
      patients, who can be medicated as outpatients, from others at high risk, in whom a profit
      from intensive care unit admission or even in-hospital thrombolytic therapy is expected.

        The present study is a cross-sectional study. All patients consecutively admitted to Assuit
        University Hospital, diagnosid with PE will be included.

        At least 80 patients will be included in the present study. Sample size was calculated
        using Epi- Info version 7, based on a previous study conducted by Yousif and Hussein
        (2019), which demonstrated that the mortality rate from pulmonary embolism was 13.7%, with
        a confidence limit of 5% and a confidence level of 80%. To overcome the dropouts the sample
        may be extended to 100 patients.
