  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While undergoing chest wall resection, a surgeon's major concern is obtaining an appropriate
      surgical margin. Difficulty or failure to do so can result in prolonged operative time, need
      for re-operation due to a positive resection margin, or need for complex chest wall
      reconstruction due to unnecessarily wide resection. Over the last decades, surgical
      navigation systems have been developed to improve operative precision in various surgical
      fields. This is achieved by integrating patient images with intraoperative findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integration of CT imaging systems into the operating room now provide real-time 3D images of
      patient anatomy during surgery. This better adjusts for anatomical deformation and tissue
      excision compared to using preoperative images alone.

      Twenty patients scheduled for chest wall resection will be enrolled over the study duration
      of 2 years. Patients will undergo imaging and surgery in the GTx-OR at Toronto General
      Hospital, as part of the GTx Program of the TECHNA Institute. All patients will be asked to
      consent to receiving their care in a research environment. They will also be asked to consent
      to having the intraoperative image acquired and used to generate a navigation view in the
      GTx-OR. Instead of resecting the chest wall lesion according to the preoperative images alone
      with intraoperative findings as per standard-care procedures, the navigation view will be
      used as an additional reference for surgeons during the operation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to provide informed consent

          2. Scheduled to undergo surgical resection of a chest wall lesion

          3. At least 18 years of age

          4. Must sign and be given a copy of the written informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unresectable lesions or unstable patient condition, for which surgery is not
             recommended

          2. Participants with metallic implantation, such as ribs fixations, a pacemaker, or
             pedicle screws, which may affect the accuracy of CBCT

          3. Excluded at the discretion of the clinical investigator/surgeon, if they are enrolled
             in other studies that will result in combined radiation exposure exceeding standard of
             care

          4. Pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the period of the
             evaluation
