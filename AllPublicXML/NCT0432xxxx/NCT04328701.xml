  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine multiple risk factors as predictors of pain and function
      following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Risk factors will be measured pre-surgically using
      psychophysical testing procedures, multimodal evaluation of sleep, standardized
      questionnaires. Additionally, this study will collect pilot data on a brief mindfulness-based
      cognitive-behavioral treatment that may help to improve long-term TKA outcomes.

      The present study seeks to collect pilot data on a brief mindfulness-based
      cognitive-behavioral treatment to determine the feasibility of this intervention and its
      potential benefits. The study includes 6 total contacts, 1 visit before surgery and 3 after
      surgery, and 2 phone calls. The last visit will be about 6 months after surgery. The study
      includes evaluation of peoples' pain, physical functioning, medication use, and physiological
      responses to sensory stimuli such as heat and cold. The research takes place at the Brigham &amp;
      Women's Pain Management Center, 850 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill.

    <description>Mindfulness-based CBT methods are based on pain self-management paradigms, and involve the identification and reduction of maladaptive pain-related cognitions (i.e., catastrophizing), the enhancement of self-efficacy for managing pain, and training in the use of adaptive pain-coping strategies such as relaxation, distraction, and self-talk.</description>
