  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV are living longer as their disease is controlled with antiretroviral
      medications. Yet they are experiencing frailty more often and more than ten years earlier
      than those without HIV. In elderly persons without HIV, frailty is associated with decreased
      muscle strength and chronic inflammation. Less is known about what is driving early frailty
      in HIV or effective prevention measures for aging adults with HIV.

      It may be that having HIV infection impairs energy production by mitochondria within the
      cells and contributes to the muscle weakness and inflammation accompanying frailty in people
      living with HIV . This study will examine the impact of six weeks of moderately paced walking
      on energy production in the cells, inflammation markers and frailty scores in people living
      with well-controlled HIV who are aged 50 to 65.
