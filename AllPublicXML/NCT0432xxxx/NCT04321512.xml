  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to discover the functions of circulating white blood
      cells, called monocytes, and associated circulating substances in heart attack and ischemic
      stroke patients. Ischemic Strokes (clots) occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood
      vessel supplying blood to the brain. A type of monocyte carrying a surface marker called
      &quot;P2X4&quot; helps the immune system sense and respond to danger signals from the body such as
      heart muscle and brain tissue injuries.

      The researchers expect to learn more about how these monocyte cells react to heart and brain
      tissue injury, and how the cells may then produce proteins or other chemical substances which
      promote the healing of heart muscle after heart attack and brain tissue after an ischemic
      stroke.

      The research objective here is to perform a pilot study in determining the level of such
      monocytes in MI/stroke patients at various times after the acute ischemic event. As controls,
      both stable coronary disease and healthy control subjects will be enrolled in whom these
      circulating cells will be determined.

      The research objective will be accomplished via the following specific aim:

      The specific aim will determine the levels of P2X4 monocytes, Flt-1/VEGFR-1 and CD13
      monocytes. The researchers may collect three blood samples at various time points. The
      samples will be collected within 48 hours of admission to the hospital, 3-5, and 30-90 days
      following MI/stroke. As a control, levels of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocytes in
      age- matched healthy subjects and in SCAD subjects will be used. Additionally for CD13
      monocytes, the researchers plan to test if CD13 is phosphorylated in the circulating
      monocytes of patients who have undergone myocardial/cerebral infarction and determine its
      utility as a biomarker of infarct size.

      Although the study is not designed to determine whether those MI/stroke patients within the
      top quartile of P2X4 or Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) or CD13 monocyte levels are more prone to develop
      severe tissue or organ dysfunction, the study will collect baseline and subsequent clinical
      data set and should position the study team to test this hypothesis in the future.

      The researchers might expect to show that MI/stroke patients have a higher level of P2X4,
      Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and/or CD13 monocytes as well as circulating cytokines and metabolites as
      compared to SCAD and age-matched healthy controls. The researchers might also expect that
      thrombectomy samples from ischemic stroke patients will have higher inflammatory cytokines
      and inflammatory monocytes.

      Objectives:

        -  To obtain blood samples from STEMI patients for determination of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+)
           and CD13 monocyte levels as well as circulating cytokines and metabolites on the days:
           1(within 48 hours of admission), 3-5, and 30-90 days after the MI.

        -  To obtain blood samples from NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation MI) patients for
           determination of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocyte levels as well as circulating
           cytokines and metabolites on the days: 1(within 48 hours of admission hospital), 3-5,
           and 30-90 days after the MI.

        -  To obtain blood samples from ischemic stroke patients for determination of P2X4, Flt-1+
           (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocyte levels as well as circulating cytokines and metabolites on
           the days: 1(within 48 hours of admission), 3-5, and 30-90 days after the ischemic event.
           In addition, thrombectomy samples which are normally discarded, when obtained and
           available, will be used.

        -  To obtain blood samples from age-matched SCAD and healthy control subjects for a
           one-time determination of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocyte as well as
           circulating cytokines and metabolites levels.

        -  To compare the levels in STEMI, NSTEMI and ischemic stroke vs. those of SCAD and healthy
           control subjects.

      Hypotheses:

      STEMI, NSTEMI and stroke subjects will have a higher level of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR- 1+) and
      CD13 monocytes than age-matched SCAD and healthy control subjects.

        Recruitment will take place at UConn Health Center. The target populations of 300 will be
        those with STEMI (60 subjects), NSTEMI (60 subjects) and SCAD (60 subjects), ischemic
        stroke (60 subjects), and age-matched non-disease subjects (60 subjects). The researchers
        anticipate that 5% of all recruited subjects will be African American and another 3% will
        be Latinos and Asians. This represents the distribution of populations recruited in the
        past for heart disease studies.
