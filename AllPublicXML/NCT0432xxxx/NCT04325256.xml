  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labour (IOL) nowadays is a common procedure in obstetric practice. Presently,
      IOL is done for 20% of pregnancies for various maternal and fetal indications and nearly 20%
      of labour inductions end up in caesarean deliveries. The success of IOL mainly depends upon
      &quot;favourability&quot; of the cervix which is usually assessed by manual examination and Scored as
      Bishop Score. However, this method is limited by subjectivity and reproducibility and though
      done in all the patients prior to IOL, several studies have demonstrated poor correlation
      between Bishop Score and outcome of IOL
