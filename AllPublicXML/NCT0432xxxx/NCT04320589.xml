    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytoma (pheo) is a catecholamine secreting tumor arising from chromaffin cells of
      the adrenal medulla in 90% of cases &amp; in 10% is extra-adrenal arising from the sympathetic
      chain. It is malignant in 10% of cases, bilateral in 10% of patients &amp; 10% of all pheo are
      inherited (Familial Pheo) as autosomal dominant either alone or as a part of multiple
      endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.In this prospective work, the investigators will try to
      compare the peri-operative hemodynamic course of Dexmedetomidine &amp; magnesium sulphate (MgSo₄)
      infused patients with the traditional anesthetic technique (α₁ &amp; β-adrenergic blockers plus
      vasodilators) during open surgical resection of Pheo. The investigators are aiming to check
      the safety &amp; efficacy of the recommended technique on the peri-operative hemodynamic
      stability &amp; controlling the hypertensive crisis during tumor manipulation.

      Pheochromocytoma (pheo) is a catecholamine secreting tumor arising from chromaffin cells of
      the adrenal medulla in 90% of cases &amp; in 10% is extra-adrenal arising from the sympathetic
      chain. It is malignant in 10% of cases, bilateral in 10% of patients &amp; 10% of all pheo are
      inherited (Familial Pheo) as autosomal dominant either alone or as a part of multiple
      endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.The anesthetic management of Pheo during surgical
      resection is usually challenging &amp; faces many cardiovascular risks as tachycardia,
      arrhythmias, severe hypertension &amp; may be pulmonary edema &amp; profound hypotension after
      surgical devascularization of the tumor. These dangerous events are sequelae of catecholamine
      excess and often are refractory to management . The proper anesthetic control is based on the
      use of α₁ &amp; β-adrenergic blockers (phenoxy-benzamine, phentolamine, propranolol, labetalol)
      and vasodilators such as glycerine trinitrate (GTN) &amp; sodium nitroprusside (SNP) .The
      rational of using magnesium sulphate MgSo₄ infusion to control catecholamine levels &amp;
      catecholamine-related crisis has been established in several clinical emergencies such as
      severe tetanus &amp; preoperative management of pre-eclampsia &amp; eclampsia . MgSo₄ beneficial
      cardiovascular effects may be attributed to its ability to reduce catecholamine release from
      the adrenal medulla &amp; to reduce α-adrenergic receptors sensitivity to catecholamines . MgSo₄
      is also a direct vasodilator &amp; a potent anti-arrhythmic drug particularly with high
      circulatory catecholamine level . The safety of MgSo₄ in the routine clinical range of 2-4
      mmol/Liter is well settled in many clinical works.

      There is strong evidence that the sympathetic nervous system is intact in Pheo patients &amp;
      neurons-released noradrenaline plays a fundamental role in blood pressure BP regulation.
      Dexmedetomidine is a short acting &amp; highly selective central α₂-agonist that inhibits
      neuronal firing &amp; thereby induces analgesia, anxiolysis, bradycardia &amp; hypotension. It has
      been tried to attenuate the sympathetic pressor effect of tracheal intubation, cardiac
      surgeries &amp; emergence from anesthesia .The unique adventitious anesthetic pharmacology
      induces preoperative sedation, intra-operative hemodynamic stability beside reducing the
      anesthetic requirements and adding to post-operative analgesia . Its peri-operative use has
      been suggested in both pediatric &amp; adult patients of Pheo.

      In this prospective work,the investigators tried to compare the peri-operative hemodynamic
      course of Dexmedetomidine &amp; MgSo₄ infused patients with the traditional anesthetic technique
      (α₁ &amp; β-adrenergic blockers plus vasodilators) during open surgical resection of Pheo. The
      investigators are aiming to check the safety &amp; efficacy of this recommended technique on the
      peri-operative hemodynamic stability &amp; controlling the hypertensive crisis during tumor
      manipulation.
