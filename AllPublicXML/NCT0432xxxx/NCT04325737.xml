    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will be conducted in 2 cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2). Cohort transition
      will be determined by the Safety Review Team (SRT) before the start of Cohort 2.

      For each cohort, the target number of subjects completing the treatment period is defined as
      8 for SEP-363856 group and 4 for placebo group. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either
      group. Dosing of the SEP-363856 group in Cohort 1 will be initiated at 50 mg SEP-363856 as an
      oral once daily dose for 3 consecutive days, followed by 75 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once
      daily dose for 4 consecutive days, and followed by 100 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once daily
      dose for 7 consecutive days. The SEP-363856 group in Cohort 2 will be dosed at 25 mg
      SEP-363856 as an oral once daily dose for 3 consecutive days, followed by 50 mg SEP-363856 as
      an oral once daily dose for 3 consecutive days, followed by 75 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once
      daily dose for 4 consecutive days, and followed by 100 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once daily
      dose for 7 consecutive days. In the placebo group, placebo will be orally administered
      according to the same administration schedule as the SEP-363856 group in each cohort.
