      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of a nano-fill and a bulk fill
      resin composite in class II restorations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with a split-mouth design, 50 patients will be received at least one pair of
      restorations, restored with a nanofill resin composite (Filtek Ultimate [FU]) and with a bulk
      fill resin composite (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill [TB]). Each restorative resin will be used
      with its respective adhesive system according to the manufacturers' instructions. A total of
      104 class II restorations will be placed by two operators. The restorations will be blindly
      evaluated by two examiners at baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8- year using
      modified US Public Health Service Ryge criteria. The comparison of the two restorative
      materials for each category will be performed with the chi-square test (a=0.05). The baseline
      scores will be compared with those at the recall visits using the Cochran Q-test.

    <measure>Marginal adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 year the change of restorations will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Observers will evaluate the restorations will be performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal adaptation.
Marginal adaptation will evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches will be performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1: Harmonious outline Alpha 2: Marginal gap (max 100μ) with discoloration (removable) Bravo: Marginal gap (&gt; 100μ) with discoloration (unremovable) Charlie: The restoration is fractured or missed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Marginal discoloration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 year the change of restorations will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Observers will evaluate the restorations will be performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal discoloration.
Marginal discoloration will be evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches will be performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha: No discoloration anywhere along the margin between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Bravo: Slight discoloration along the margin between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Charlie: The discoloration penetrated along the margin of the restorative material in a pulpal direction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 year the change of restorations will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Observers will evaluate the restorations will be performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding retention rate.
Retention rate will be evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1:Clinically excellent Alpha 2: Clinically good with slight deviations from ideal performance, correction possible without damage of tooth or restoration Bravo: Clinically sufficient with few defects, corrections or repair of the restoration possible Charlie: Restoration is partially missed Delta: Restoration is totally missed</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anatomic form</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 year the change of restorations will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Observers will evaluate the restorations will be performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding anatomic form.
Anatomic form will be evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1: Continuous with existing anatomical form Alpha 2: Slightly discontinuous due to some chipping on the proximal ridge Bravo: Discontinuous with existing anatomical form due to material loss but proximal contact still present Charlie: Proximal contact is lost with ridge fracture.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Color change</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 year the change of restorations will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Observers will evaluate the restorations will be performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding color change. Color changes will be evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failedand needs to be replaced. Alpha: The restoration matches the adjacent tooth structure in color and translucency. Bravo: Light mismatch in color, shade or translucency between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Charlie: The mismatch in color and translucency is outside the acceptable range of tooth color and translucency.</description>
