      The Goal of the study is to identify trait-homogenous groups of cancer patients in regards to
      their physical activity associated health literacy. Based on these Groups, individualized
      exercise protocols and educative strategies can be developed which may increase the efficacy
      of the exercise therapy and increases the likelihood that patient get involved in physical
      activity.

    <measure>Questionnaire: Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>

    <measure>Questionnaire: Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's level of physical activity will be assessed with the SQUASH Physical Activity Questionnaire. It includes multiple activities referring to a 'normal' week. Activity dimensions asked include actively commuting physical activity (walking, cycling), physical activity at work or school, household activities, leisure time activities (sports, walking, gardening, cycling).</description>
