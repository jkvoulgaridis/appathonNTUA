      This is a single-arm, open label, Phase II study of 12-week use of Roflumilast in
      stable-state non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis subjects.

      Bronchiectasis refers to a suppurative lung condition characterized by pathological
      dilatation of bronchi. The predominant aetiology of bronchiectasis in the Western population
      is related to cystic fibrosis (CF), which is genetically determined. Bronchiectasis due to
      other causes are generally grouped under the term &quot;non-CF bronchiectasis&quot;, which accounts for
      practically all cases that are seen commonly in Hong Kong and many other Chinese populations.

      The main pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis involves airway inflammation, abnormal mucus
      clearance and bacterial colonization, resulting in progressive airway destruction and
      distortion. This destructive process perpetuates in a vicious circle even when the initial
      insult has subsided, which is commonly due to an infective process like tuberculosis in Hong
      Kong. Patients with extensive bronchiectasis present with chronic cough, copious purulent
      sputum, haemoptysis, progressive lung function loss, and episodes of infective exacerbations.

      The current treatment strategies mainly focus on targeting the key elements in the
      pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis. Apart from regular chest physiotherapy and postural
      drainage to help clearing mucus from bronchiectatic airways, inhalational and parenteral
      antibiotics have also been used to reduce the bacterial load in destroyed airways, thus
      controlling and preventing infective exacerbations. In recent years, accumulated evidence has
      suggested a central role of airway inflammation and immune dysregulation in the evolution of
      non-CF bronchiectasis.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive destructive process on exposure
      to noxious environmental agents (e.g. tobacco smoke) that affects both the airways (chronic
      bronchitis) and lung parenchyma (emphysema), leading to loss of lung function and exercise
      capacity. Both COPD and bronchiectasis share similarities in clinical presentation and
      pathogenetic mechanisms. Neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial colonization are also the
      cornerstone in the airways of patients with COPD. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)
      inhibitor, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in COPD resulting in reduction in
      exacerbation frequency. This is the first-in-class and the only one clinically available PDE4
      inhibitor that is approved worldwide (including Hong Kong) for treatment of severe COPD with
      frequent exacerbations.

      At the time of writing, the exact role and clinical evidence for roflumilast in dampening
      airway inflammation in non-CF bronchiectasis is still lacking. Given the common pathogenetic
      mechanism via neutrophilic inflammation between non-CF bronchiectasis and COPD, as well as
      the robust clinical activity of roflumilast in COPD, this study is designed to provide
      initial scientific evidence on the activity of roflumilast on neutrophilic airway
      inflammation in patients with stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of 12-week treatment with roflumilast on
      neutrophilic airway inflammation in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 4-week crossover study in 38 patients with COPD, roflumilast 500μg daily significantly
      reduced sputum absolute neutrophil count, IL-8 and neutrophil elastase compared with placebo
      treatment. Interestingly, the mechanism of anti-neutrophilic inflammation with roflumilast
      treatment in patients with COPD was recently found to be mediated through decreasing prolyl
      endopeptidase activity and acetyl-proline-glycine-proline (AcPGP), thus providing a clear
      biological plausibility for clinical activity of roflumilast. The clinical benefits of
      roflumilast treatment in COPD were subsequently demonstrated in 2 identical RCTs involving
      3,096 patients with COPD having severe airflow limitation and history of exacerbations.
      Treatment with roflumilast 500μg daily resulted in better prebronchodilator FEV1 (by 48 ml in
      52 weeks) and lower rate of exacerbations (reduction by 17%) compared with placebo treatment.
      The benefit of roflumilast on lung function has also been confirmed in another 2 identical
      RCTs among those patients with moderate to severe COPD already treated with long-acting
      bronchodilators (salmeterol or tiotropium). The mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was
      significantly improved with roflumilast compared to placebo treatment for 24 weeks by 49ml
      and 80ml respectively in patients with COPD already treated with salmeterol and tiotropium
      respectively. More recently, among patients with more severe COPD requiring combination
      ICS/long-acting β2 agonist, roflumilast treatment for 52 weeks significantly reduced the rate
      of moderate-to-severe exacerbations by 13.2% compared to placebo group. The safety and
      adverse effects of roflumilast have been well-tolerated, resulting in worldwide (including
      Hong Kong) approval for clinical use in COPD. The common adverse effects of roflumilast
      treatment include weight reduction (&gt;10% loss in 7% subjects), decreased appetite (2%),
      insomnia (2%), headache (4%), diarrhea (10%) and nausea (5%).

      Our group has previously embarked on various clinical studies in non-CF bronchiectasis: a
      4-week treatment of inhaled fluticasone (ICS) compared with placebo (1), a subsequent 52-week
      randomized controlled trial of inhaled fluticasone in 86 patients (4), and a separate study
      on sputum elastase in 30 patients (2). These support the feasibility of conducting similar
      clinical trials, like the current proposal, on non-CF bronchiectasis in our unit. To prepare
      for the current study proposal, we have conducted a pilot and feasibility study of 4-week
      treatment of roflumilast in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis with the exact
      inclusion/exclusion criteria as the current proposal (HKU/HA HKW IRB approval no. UW 17-444)
      since March 2018. Up to January 2019, we have successfully recruited 15 eligible study
      subjects. The initial study protocol mandated the starting dose of roflumilast at 500
      microgram daily. The first two study subjects experienced intolerable gastrointestinal side
      effects within 1-2 weeks of treatment, leading to premature treatment cessation. An amended
      study protocol (HKU/HA HKW IRB approval dated 24 July 2018) was approved that allowed a lower
      initiating dose of 250 microgram daily, which is in line with the current recommended
      prescription in COPD patients. Nine out of the subsequent 13 subjects (including the most
      recent 8 subjects consecutively) were able to complete roflumilast 250 microgram daily
      treatment for a total of 4 weeks, with less than grade 1 toxicities. The characteristics of
      the nine per-protocol study subjects include: M:F=4:5, age of 69.9 ± 9.1 years (mean ± SD)
      and baseline 24-h sputum volume of 30.00 ± 26.93 ml (for all 15 subjects: 27.47 ± 22.59 ml).
      The preliminary results showed insignificant change in sputum volume and a trend of reduced
      sputum IL-1β (pre- vs post-treatment: 10.84 vs 2.63 ng/ml, p=0.102). This indicates a
      possible anti-inflammatory effect of roflumilast in non-CF bronchiectasis with just 4 weeks
      of treatment, though this pilot was meant for feasibility study and not powered to detect
      significant change. The true benefit will likely require a longer duration of treatment (thus
      proposing 12 weeks in this study) with sufficient sample size.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of 12-week treatment with roflumilast on
      neutrophilic airway inflammation in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis. The primary outcome
      measure is 24-h sputum volume. The extent of airway inflammation in non-CF bronchiectasis is
      indicated by sputum leukocyte density, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-alpha,
      LTB4 and IL-17) and neutrophil elastase. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key
      secondary outcome. We hypothesize that 12-week treatment of roflumilast in stable-state
      non-CF bronchiectasis can result in: (1) reduction in 24-h sputum volume (primary
      hypothesis); (2) reduction in sputum leukocyte density; (3) reduction in sputum
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-17) and LTB4; (4) reduction in
      sputum neutrophil elastase; (5) no change in sputum bacterial colonization and load; (6)
      improvement in HRQoL.

    <time_frame>Improvement in HRQoL in 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' HRQoL will be measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Hong Kong Chinese version (SGRQ-HK). SGRQ-HK is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in patients with obstructive airway disease. It consists of 2 parts with 50 items. It addresses frequency and severity patients' symptoms, as well as activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness. The scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The minimally important difference is a mean change of 4 units for slightly efficacious treatment, 8 units for moderately efficacious change and 12 units for very efficacious treatment. SGRQ-HK has been validated in patients with bronchiectasis and is considered a valid and sensitive instrument for determining quality of life in bronchiectasis patients.</description>

    <description>Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor is approved worldwide (including Hong Kong) for treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with frequent exacerbations. Roflumilast has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effect in patients with COPD, with significant reduction of sputum absolute neutrophil count, IL-8 and neutrophil elastase compared with placebo treatment. Roflumilast can also improve the lung function parameters in patients with COPD and reduce the rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations.</description>
