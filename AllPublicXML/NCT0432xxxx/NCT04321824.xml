  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the end of 2018, the Care and Orientation Center (CASO)of Marseille corridnated by
      Medecins du Monde has been investigated an innovative program aimed at direct referrals to
      primary care for vulnerable and precarious population with access barriers to healthcare
      system (no being coveraged at time of the study).

      Patients consulting at the CASO MDM in Marseille are accompanied and were received, free of
      charge, by primary care professionals (general practitioners, specialists, pharmacy, analysis
      laboratory, etc).

      This is an observational, comparative study, with two arms: the CASO MDM in Marseille for the
      intervention site and the CASO MDM in Bordeaux for the control site (where the innovative
      program does not exist).

      A total of 610 patients will be included (305 in the innovative group / 305 in the control
      group).

      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the innovative programm (PASS de
      ville) compared to the standard of care by assessing the rate of emergency departement visits
      at one year in each group.

      Duration of inclusion: 12 months; Duration of follow-up: 18 months; Total duration of the
      study: 36 months.

      Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted to address overall outcomes.

      Univariate and multivariate analyzes will be performed on the primary outcome as well as the
      secondary outcomes in order to highlight significant differences between the two groups and
      to identify predictive factors for improved effectiveness. The analysis will be conducted in
      accordance with Good Epidemiological Practices, and the final report will be written
      according to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) recommendations. An
      intention to treat analysis will be conducted.
