        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is male or female and 0 to &lt; 18 years old.

          2. Patient has a diagnosis of Pompe disease, based on documentation of one of the
             following:

               1. Deficiency of GAA enzyme

               2. GAA genotyping demonstrating variants associated with IOPD

          3. Patient does not currently qualify for an Amicus sponsored on-going clinical trial.

          4. Patient is currently being treated with an approved ERT and is declining (eg,
             worsening in motor function, respiratory function/parameters, cardiac function, etc)
             based on treating physician's clinical judgement.

          5. The patient's legal guardian or representative has given informed consent (and assent
             when age appropriate for regional requirements) to treatment prior to administering
             ATB200/AT2221 in a manner consistent with all national requirements.

          6. If of reproductive potential and sexually active, female subjects agree to use a
             highly effective method of contraception throughout the duration of the treatment and
             for up to 90 days after their last dose of ATB200/AT2221.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a hypersensitivity to any of the excipients in ATB200, alglucosidase alfa,
             or AT2221

          2. Patient has a medical or any other extenuating condition or circumstance that may, in
             the opinion of the investigator and/or Amicus, pose an undue safety risk to the
             patient.

          3. Concomitant use of miglitol (eg, Glyset), non-AT2221 form of miglustat (eg, Zavesca),
             acarbose (eg, Precose or Glucobay), voglibose (eg, Volix, Vocarb,or Volibo)
