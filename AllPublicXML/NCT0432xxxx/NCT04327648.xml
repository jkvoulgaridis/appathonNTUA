  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current study try to find out whether social interaction treatment is effective for ASD
      children. ASD children will be divided into three groups, social interaction treatment group,
      neuronal cognition treatment and routine treatment group. Based on excited recognition
      training treatment effect on the core symptom of ADHD by tablet computer, the investigators
      propose that tablet computer social interaction treatment may induce a significant
      improvement in ameliorating the social disorder of ASD.

      Appropriate and effective treatment coupled with home training can help ASD children restore
      the ability of language, behavior and learning. However, there is no suitable and effective
      behavior intervention for home training yet. Current study try a 3 months' randomized
      double-blinded clinical trial to find out whether tablet computer social interaction
      treatment at home is effective for ASD children. 90 3-6 years old ASD children will be
      included and divided into three groups, social interaction treatment group, neuronal
      cognition treatment and routine treatment group respectively. During the treatment days,
      children in social interaction treatment group will have 30min social interaction each day
      for 3 months. Children in neuronal cognition treatment group will experienced neural
      cognition training 30min each day for 3 months. Children in routine treatment group will keep
      the same initial treatment. All ASD children are followed up closely. The primary observed
      indicator is the score of Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) at the inclusion, one month
      and 3 month after treatment to evaluate the effect of tablet computer social interaction
      treatment on ASD children.

    <time_frame>The baseline and 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>CARS is a behaviour-rating scale used to assess the presence and severity of the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder(ASD), with scores ranging from 15 to 60 and high scores indicating severe symptoms. Change of the CARS from baseline to 3 months after treatment to evaluate the effect of tablet computer social interaction treatment on ASD children.</description>

    <description>SRS is a questionnaire used to assess the presence and severity of social impairment, with high scores indicating severe symptoms. Change of the SRS from baseline to 3 month after treatment to evaluate the effect of computer social interaction treatment on ASD children.</description>

    <description>The ADOS is a structured play session conducted by clinicians, with the total score combines the Social and Communication domain items, with high scores indicating severe symptoms. Change of the ADOS from baseline to 3 months after treatment to evaluate the effect of tablet computer social interaction treatment on ASD children.</description>

    <time_frame>The baseline and 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Head fNIRs is a non-invasive, non-ionizing method for measuring and imaging the functional hemodynamic response to brain activity. It measures changes in hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations within the brain by means of the characteristic absorption spectra of Hb in the near-infrared range. Changes in the head fNIRs results of the subject before and after treatment.</description>
