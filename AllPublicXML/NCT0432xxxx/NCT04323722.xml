  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is assessing how Bladder filling variations and thus mesorectal movements are less
      when radiotherapy treatment is received with an empty bladder in rectal cancer

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to show that the variations of bladder volume and mesorectal
      movements are less with empty versus filled bladder in rectal cancer.

      In this study, patient will be treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) radiotherapy
      with a filled bladder condition, as per standard care, in supine position. A total dose of 45
      or 50 Gy in 25 fractions, 5 fractions per week is received.

      A Chest, abdomen and pelvis imaging will be performed before treatment start. Patients
      receive planning CT scan with filled bladder and then with empty bladder on the same day.
      Only planning CT scan with filled bladder will be used patient treatment.

      During radiotherapy treatment, patient will receive CBCTs with filled ans empty bladder on
      Day 1 ; 2 and 3 on the first week and once a week after.

      Multiple parameters will be assessed before treatment (using planning CT scan) and during
      radiotherapy treatment (CBCTs) in empty ans filled bladder conditions : Bladder volume,
      mesorectal movements.

      A dosimetric study will be performed in Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in empty and
      filled bladder conditions
