  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of low dose IV ketamine infusion
      in the treatment of patients with PTSD and comorbid chronic pain.

      Hypothesis: A single ketamine infusion should be associated with significantly greater
      reduction in core PTSD symptom levels after the treatment and such an effect is not only due
      to its analgesic properties but also through unknown mechanism of action that maybe related
      to NMDA/AMPA receptor modulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, treatment options (i.e. psychotherapy, antidepressant medications) for patients with
      PTSD, are relatively few, and considering their limited efficacy, novel therapies have gained
      interest among researchers and treatment providers alike. Among patients with chronic pain
      about one third suffer from comorbid PTSD, which further complicates their already
      challenging pharmacological regimens. Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD,
      and in treatment of chronic pain, however they have not been studied in comorbid population
      and under rigorous control conditions. The investigators compared the effects of a single
      dose of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg) over a 40-minute of IV infusion in
      chronic pain patients with and without PTSD, in double blind, randomized study. Measures were
      collected before, during, 1 day and 7 days after the infusion.

Single IV infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) was administered over 40 minutes.
