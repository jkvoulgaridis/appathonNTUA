  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the effect of Nitroglycerin paste on wound healing and
      scarring. Previous research has shown that Nitroglycerin paste can improve the blood flow to
      a wound, which may be associated with better wound healing, and ultimately, better scarring.

      This will be a single-center, patient-blinded, (breast) randomized trial utilizing
      nitroglycerin paste on their breast reduction scar. The study team aims to randomize 100
      patients, or 200 breasts. Each patient will receive treatment, but the breast that received
      treatment will be random. This will allow for a control breast to compare to. Patients will
      be followed for 12 months postoperatively to observe wound healing.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients who agree to participate will be randomized during their bilateral breast reduction procedure. Each patient will be randomized to &quot;LEFT BREAST&quot; or &quot;RIGHT BREAST.&quot; The randomization result will determine which breast receives the nitroglycerin paste. Their breast reduction will be done using the Wise pattern, and all incisions will be sealed with Dermabond. At the conclusion of the procedure, 1g of topical nitroglycerin (2%) will be placed on the breast which the randomizer indicated. Patients will be monitored for AEs during the remainder of their hospital stay.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The patient will be masked and will not know which breast received the nitropaste. The investigator who applied nitropaste will know which breast was treated, but the investigator who conducts the follow-up visits will not.</masking_description>
