  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in China only. The purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety
      of once weekly dosing of TransCon hGH, a long-acting growth hormone product, compare to
      once-daily dosing of human growth hormone (hGH) after 52 weeks of treatment in prepubertal
      children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
