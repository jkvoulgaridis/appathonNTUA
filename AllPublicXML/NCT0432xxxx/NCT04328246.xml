  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study assesses the superiority of IES supplementation to the standard of care
      alone (offloading pressure every two hours) in improving the prevention and treatment of
      sacral and ischial pressure injuries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Modified Braden Scale score of 14 or less. The Modified Braden Scale score is
             calculated as follows:

             Braden Scale score (Ranges from 6 to 23)

               -  1 for Low Serum Albumin

               -  1 for Type II Diabetes

          2. Anticipated length of stay of at least 4 days

          3. BMI &lt; 35

          4. Participants capable of giving informed consent, or if appropriate, participants
             having an acceptable individual capable of giving consent on the participant's behalf.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Existing pressure injuries above Stage II and injuries classified as DTI or
             unstageable

          2. Neuromuscular blocking drugs &amp; myasthenia gravis: may prevent the ability of
             electrical stimulation to induce muscular contraction

          3. Unstable spinal, pelvic, or hip fractures that may be displaced by a forced
             contraction

          4. Rhabdomyolysis

          5. Use of a Pacemaker
