  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a temporary mechanical
      circulatory support that has been increasingly used over the last decade to restore and
      maintain adequate end-organ perfusion, with data suggesting improvement in outcome for
      patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. Nevertheless, VA-ECMO weaning should be
      questioned every day during patient's support. Indeed, studies have shown that the incidence
      of severe complications related to ECMO is associated with longer circulatory support
      duration. Inotropes such as dobutamine are currently used to improve myocardial contractility
      during VA-ECMO support with the aim to enhance left ventricular ejection, aortic valve
      opening and to shorten ECMO duration. However, many data suggest an increase in mortality
      related to predisposition to myocardial ischemia and arrythmias. Levosimendan is a calcium
      sensitizing inotropic agent with systemic, coronary and pulmonary vasodilatory properties and
      specific cardioprotective effect without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. The use of
      levosimendan in patients undergoing VA-ECMO may therefore be of interest both to reduce the
      duration of mechanical support and to minimize severe complication with few data suggesting a
      potential benefit of levosimendan for VA-ECMO weaning and survival in post-cardiotomy low
      cardiac output syndrome with improvement of endothelial function and hemodynamics.
      Investigators therefore sought to investigate whether the use of levosimendan improves
      weaning for patients undergoing VA-ECMO support for refractory cardiogenic shock hospitalized
      in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU).

    <description>Clinical data are collected from the medical record of the institution. At admission, date were collected on age, gender, body mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, history of stroke or congestive heart failure, coronary or peripheral artery disease, renal failure with dialysis, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction(LVEF), Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, ScvO2, presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump and biochemical parameters. During hospitalization data were collected on reason for initiation of VA-ECMO and its characteristics (duration, type, flow L/min, RPM, FiO2), length of stay in ICU, catecholamines and inotropes maximal dose and length of administration, patients with heart transplantation or LVAD. In patients with levosimendan treatment, timing of administration regarding ECMO canulation was collected</description>

Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages and compared using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Survival at day 28 was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Investigators conducted a multivariable logistic regression with propensity score matching, which was defined as the probability of exposure to levosimendan. Results were reported as odd ratios (ORs) together its 95%CI assuming a 5% level of statistical significance. All analyses were carried out using STATA 15.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas 77845 USA).</description>
