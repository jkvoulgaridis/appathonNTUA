      The purpose of this study is to optimize the complex treatment of non-ischemic dilated
      cardiomyopathy by supplementing the standard drug therapy with intracoronary administration
      of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells.

      Sixty patients will be selected and randomly divided into the main and control groups in a 1:
      1 ratio.

      Patients of the main group will receive complex treatment based on the addition to the
      standard drug therapy of intracoronary administration of 10 million mesenchymal stromal cells
      of the umbilical cord, and patients of the control group will receive only standard drug
      therapy.

      Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of chronic heart failure, with maximum
      tolerated dosage without side effects.

      The day of infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be divided
      into 0-1,1-3 and 3-6 months.

      Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 6 months of followup.

    <description>After performing cardiac catheterization, selective coronary angiography will be performed abruptly to assess the condition of the coronary canal by access through the right radial or common femoral artery on the right after 70 U/kg of heparin iv. Then 20 ml of the finished suspension (1×10(7) umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells diluted in 20 ml of heparinized saline) will be administrated into the mouth of the left coronary artery (LCA) without occlusion of the vessel with a balloon catheter and without stopping the coronary blood flow. Cell injection will be carried out using a standard 6 Fr catheter for selective coronary angiography with perfusion for 10 minutes at a volume rate of 2 ml/min, thereby introducing 1×10(6) cells per minute</description>
