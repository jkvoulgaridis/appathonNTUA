      This study uses magnetic anchored guidance system to treat early gastric cancer by endoscopic
      mucosal dissection to test the advantages of magnetically anchored guidance system for
      surgical field exposure during endoscopic mucosal dissection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the second most common malignant tumor in China, with the highest mortality
      rate among all types of malignant tumors. Surgical resection is still the most effective
      treatment for gastric cancer. Minimally invasive surgery breaks the traditional surgical
      concept that the laparotomy must be performed by laparotomy. It can complete the operation
      that required a large incision with minimal incision trauma, and has the advantages of less
      trauma, faster recovery and fewer complications. At present, the application of gastroscopy
      and laparoscopy for early gastric cancer has reached consensus at home and abroad. Endoscopic
      mucosal resection of early gastric cancer is suitable for patients with intramucosal cancer
      and no lymph node metastasis. However, the unclear exposure of the surgical field during the
      operation causes difficulty in operation or conversion to open surgery is a difficult problem
      facing this technique. The project designed a magnetic pulling unit that can be connected
      through an endoscope, including external abdominal magnets, internal abdominal magnets,
      connecting hooks, and micro surgical tweezers. Using magnetic anchoring technology, the
      magnetic pulling unit is anchored to the abdominal wall, and micro surgical tweezers are
      used. The tumor tissue is pulled indirectly, so that the mucosa is lifted up, which is
      beneficial to the peeling of the submucosa. This method increases the operating space of the
      main hand of the endoscope, and at the same time, the magnetic clamp is used to connect the
      clamps so that they can move in all directions, so as to achieve the desired traction of the
      tumor tissue site, fully expose the surgical field, and facilitate surgical anatomy.
