  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maximal fat oxidation during exercise (MFO) and the intensity of exercise that elicits MFO
      (Fatmax) has been recognized as potential determinants of endurance performance.

      The purpose of this study was to determine the possible interaction between the effects of
      diurnal variation (morning vs. afternoon) and caffeine ingestion on MFO, Fatmax and VO2 max
      in endurance-trained men. Specifically, the investigators sought to elucidate whether the
      stimulant actions of caffeine could reverse the decrements of MFO and Fatmax observed in the
      morning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body weight, height, body composition (DXA), exercise test (MFO and VO2max assessment) will
      be measured during the 4 evaluations.

      Participants were randomized into 4 exercise test conditions:

        1. Exercise test in the morning with placebo intake

        2. Exercise test in the evening with placebo intake

        3. Exercise test in the morning with caffeine intake

        4. Execrise test in the evening with caffeine intake
