      The goals of this study are as follows:

        1. To rigorously establish and characterize heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of
           Takotsubo Syndrome (TS).

        2. To rigorously test the contribution of TS triggering events and mental stress
           responsiveness to 1-year prognosis after TS event.

      Newly admitted patients with a validated diagnosis of Takotsubo Syndrome (TS; n=246) will be
      enrolled from 3 large medical centers in the Providence, Rhode Island area. Between 2 and 4
      weeks after discharge, clinically stable patients will undergo an in-person comprehensive
      interview to identify the events proximal to the onset of TS symptoms, complete a battery of
      psychosocial questionnaires and undergo a validated laboratory stress protocol. Baseline and
      reactive changes in measures of autonomic nervous system activity (epinephrine and
      norepinephrine - primary outcome), and in the secondary outcomes of cardiac vagal control and
      left ventricular function (ejection fraction; regional and global longitudinal strain
      assessed with speckle tracking echocardiography) will be assessed. Echocardiographic
      evaluations will be repeated 12 months thereafter together with information on major adverse
      cerebrovascular events.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change (in pg/mL) in plasma epinephrine levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for plasma epinephrine are collected 10-min into Baseline, 10-min into Emotion Recall, and 10 minutes into Recovery Phase. Change will be calculated by subtracting Baseline epinephrine levels from Emotion Recall levels.</description>

    <measure>Mean change (in pg/mL) in plasma norepinephrine levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for plasma norepinephrine are collected 10-min into Baseline, 10-min into Emotion Recall, and 10 minutes into Recovery Phase. Change will be calculated by subtracting Baseline epinephrine levels from Emotion Recall norepinephrine levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in high frequency power heart rate variability (hf-HRV) in Ln msec (square)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>High frequency power heart rate variability (hf-HRV) will be determined by averaging high frequency values for 4-min segments within each phase (Baseline, Emotion Recall), and change will be calculated (Emotion Recall minus Baseline). Data will be collected using a Digital Holter ECG Recorder - 5 Lead, 2 Channel.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Left ventricular ejection fraction (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A trans-thoracic echocardiogram will be performed with computation of ejection fraction according to current guidelines.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite of death from any cause, recurrence of TS, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction.
The definition of each event will be based on current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) diagnostic criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) will be assessed using off-line analysis software (TomTec imaging systems). GLS will be calculated as the average left ventricular longitudinal strain across the segments obtained using apical two, three, and four-chamber views. Because myocardial contraction results in left ventricular shortening in systole, GLS is a negative value.</description>

    <description>The protocol consists of Resting Baseline (BL), Emotion Recall (ER), followed by a Recovery Phase (RP).
Resting Baseline (BL - 15 min). The participant is instructed to rest quietly.
Emotion Recall (ER - 15 min). The participant is instructed to think about the incident associated with the onset of their cardiac event and bring to mind details of the incident. When the participants have the incident clearly in mind, they are instructed to relate the incident and their experience out loud; frequent questions to re-elicit the emotion are asked.
Recovery Phase (RP - 30 min). Upon completion of RP, the catheter is removed and participants are de-instrumented; heart rate and blood pressure are assessed again (15 min and 30 min of recovery) before participants are released. Blood samples for plasma catecholamines, assessments of heart rate variability, and echocardiograms are performed 10-min into BL, 10-min into ER, and 10 minutes into RP.</description>
