    <description>HEC68498 is a potent,highly selective inhibitor of class 1 isozymes of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian(PI3K) and of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It has shown good activity against fibrosis and inflammation in vitro and in vivo, with a lower effective dose and better efficacy than pirfenidone and nintedanib.</description>
