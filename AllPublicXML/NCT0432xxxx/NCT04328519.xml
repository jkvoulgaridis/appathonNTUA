      Objective: The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a comorbidity scale used widely throughout
      the world. It uses patients' preoperative and intraoperative morbidity factors to evaluate
      morbidity and mortality risk. Though the CCI has widespread use, it has not been evaluated in
      patients attending at ES, and its relationship with patient readmission has not been shown
      previously. In this study, we aimed to show whether there is a correlation between the CCI
      value and the number of repeated admissions to emergency services and that the CCI value can
      be used as a predicted factor for the serious patients.

      Matherials and Methods: This was a prospective observational cross-sectional study. Age,
      gender, vital signs of the patients who agreed to participate in the study was recorded.
      Numbers of emergency service applications in the last 6 months and CCI score have been
      recorded.
