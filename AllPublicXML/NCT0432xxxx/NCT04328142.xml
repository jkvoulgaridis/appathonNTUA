      Objective:

      This study investigated the effectiveness of a Physiotherapy treatment versus a Qigong
      exercise programme for the improvement of the quality of life of subjects with Fibromyalgia.

      Design:

      A single-blind randomized clinical controlled trial.

      Setting:

      University of Extremadura, Spain

      Subjects:

      Women with Fibromyalgia

      Interventions:

      141 Participants were randomized to a Qigong exercise program group (n=47), a physiotherapy
      treatment group (n=47) and control group (n=47) for 6 weeks.

      Main Measures:

      Measures were taken at baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention
      (week 6). The primary outcome measure were quality of life (Spanish Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire (SFIQ), pain (VAS), perceive exertion (Borg scale), spirometry measures
      (Spirobank-G MIR spirometry) and balance (Wii-Fit, Nintendo ©). The secondary outcome
      measures were flexibility (Wells and Dillon test and Sit and Reach test), Range of movement
      (goniometer), muscle strength (Lowett scale).

    <measure>Change from the Spanish Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (SFIQ) at post intervention (week 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention (week 6).</time_frame>
    <description>SFIQ measures the level of quality of life of subjects with Fibromyalgia with a score of 0 to 100. A higher score indicates more impact of the condition on the life of the person and therefore less quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at post intervention (week 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention (week 6).</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual analogue scale measures the level of pain with a score of 0 to 10 where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates maximun pain.</description>

    <measure>Change from Borg Scale of perceived exertion at post intervention (week 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention (week 6).</time_frame>
    <description>Borg scale measures the perceived exertion of a subject with a score of 0 to 10 where 0 is the minimum exertion and 10 is the maximun exertion.</description>

    <description>Spirometry measures respiratory values being the reference values (Knudson model) for a 50 year old woman with 1,65 cm of height and 65 kilos weight: FVC (Forced vital capacity)= 3.611, FEV1 (Forced expiratory volume) = 2.7505, FEV1%= 76.17%, FEF (Forced expiratory flow) 25-75%= 2.625, PEF (peak expiratory flow)= 6.222</description>

    <measure>Change from the centre of gravity registered with Wii-fit Nintendo®</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention (week 6).</time_frame>
    <description>Static balance and postural control is the ability to maintain the centre of gravity within the base of support. Centre of gravity is measured in percentage through posturography study. A higher percentage means better balance</description>

    <measure>Change from the monopodal stance test registered with Wii-fit Nintendo®</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention (week 6).</time_frame>
    <description>Monopodal stance test measures static balance in percentage through posturography study. It is measure in percentage from 0 to 100 and a higher percentage means a better result.</description>

    <description>Shoulder and hip range of movement.Lovett scale is a modification of Daniels and Worthingham. The scale is measured from 0 to 5 where 0 means no muscle activation strength and 5 means normal strength against resistance</description>

    <description>The Qigong experimental group performed the 20 figures to improve health and longevity described by the master of Qigong 'Wang Ziping'. These are based on therapeutic exercises of Traditional Chinese Medicine. They work on breathing, flexibility and balance. Each figure was repeated 6 times. The sessions were administered twice a week during 45 minutes and were guided by a Doctor in Western Medicine who is also qualified as a Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong teacher.</description>

    <description>The physiotherapy experimental group completed an active exercises program guided by a qualified physiotherapist. The exercise programme was based on active shoulder, hips and spine kinesiotherapy. It included a warm up of 3-5 minutes walking, followed by 6 repetitions of shoulder and hip exercises in standing, cervical spine exercises in sitting or standing, according to the comfort of the patient, thoracic and lumbar spine exercises performed in supine on a mat and balance exercises in standing. Stretching exercises were also performed at the end of the session. The exercises were accompanied by gentle breathing coordinated with the movements. The sessions were administered twice a week during 45 minutes.</description>
