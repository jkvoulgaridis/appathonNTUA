    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility and acceptability of parent-completed
      screeners of child social/emotional development, social determinants of health, and adverse
      childhood experiences in the setting of a pediatrics primary care clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are beginning to implement universal screening in our pediatric primary care clinic
      practices, and plan to assess feasibility and acceptability of screening by querying parents
      of children in order to determine their expectations, perceptions, and opinions about the
      screeners. Study activities include a brief, anonymous survey given to all families in clinic
      who complete the screener. We will also use data from electronic health records to examine
      the impact of screeners on referrals and healthcare utilization. We will be examining
      correlations between demographics and preferences indicated in the survey and via electronic
      health record data, among other relationships.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A primary objective of this study is to assess feasibility of parent-completed screeners of child social/emotional development, social determinants of health, and adverse childhood experiences in the setting of a pediatrics primary care clinic.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of a well child appointment, the provider/nurse/clinical or research staff will give parents/caretakers an anonymous feasibility/acceptability questionnaire on paper. The questionnaire will start with a brief introduction asking parents/caretakers to complete the survey after their appointment; explain the purpose of the questionnaire, and indicate that completion of the survey is entirely voluntary. If parents/caretakers choose to participate, they will complete the questionnaire; if they do not wish to participate, they will be instructed to leave the survey blank.
Subject selection will be equitable because the questionnaire will only be given to parents/caregivers who present for well child care between 0-3 years of age, effectively 6500 visits over the next 18 months of the study.
The screeners that will be given to parents/caregivers are the Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC), social/emotional and developmental screeners, as well the parental ACEs.</description>

We are trying to gather general opinions from parents/caretakers about the screeners administered during their child's visits; this is exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the impact of screening on referral rates and healthcare utilization across a broad range of demographic factors.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data extracts from Epic and/or from DEDUCE will be used to evaluate referral rates and healthcare utilization. For the targeted chart review, we will look specifically at families who are enrolled in or who qualify for Healthy Steps Tier 2 and Tier 3, subsets of the whole practice who are receiving additional co-located behavioral supports during standard well child care.
Demographic factors include: medical record number, date of birth, patient address, gender, race/ethnicity, diagnostic codes, referrals, screening results, and encounters.</description>
