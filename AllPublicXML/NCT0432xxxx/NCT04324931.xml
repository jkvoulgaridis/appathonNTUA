      Effect of Biomechanical Correction of Tibia on Medial Joint space loading, Varus deformity
      and functional tasks in patients with medial tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis in which
      participants will be taken which are divided into two equal groups one is experimental group
      and the conventional group. The outcome measures taken are Trauma CAD Software, NPRS,
      Goniometery and will be measured at the baseline after 3rd week of the intervention.

      Background: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is very prevalent chronic disease of joint which
      causing the functional disability and pain specifically in older adults.

      Objective: Purpose of the study is to see that the biomechanical correction on tibia and
      varus deformity is effective with the conventional treatment on participants with the KOA.

      Study Design: A Randomized two group Pretest-Post test Clinical Trial. Methodology: Total 'n'
      subjects were included in the study with the age of 40 to 60 years based on exclusion and
      inclusion criteria. Subjects will be divided in the biomechanical correction group and
      conventional physiotherapy group. For the pain, the NPRS will be taken, goniometer taken for
      the measurement of q-angle, CKOAI will be taken for the physical activity measurement and CAD
      Software will be taken to see the alignment of the affected limb. In both the group
      conventional treatment will be given.

      Conclusion: Biomechanical correction shows the significant improvement and improves the
      subject's physical activity and reduces the pain and stiffness.

    <description>This study has evidenced a large percentage of population as borderline OA; therefore, it depends mainly on the prevention of modifiable risk factors to preserve at ease movement in elderly population through awareness programs.</description>

    <description>the atrophic phenotype of knee OA was associated with a decreased likelihood of progression of JSN and cartilage loss compared to the non-atrophic knee OA phenotype.</description>

    <description>Although elevated BMI increases the risk of knee OA progression, the effect of BMI is limited to knees in which moderate malalignment exists, presumably because of the combined focus of load from malalignment and the excess load from increased weight.</description>
