  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fully covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) has been widely used in ERCP patients with
      malignant or benign biliary stricture, difficult CBDS, post-EST bleeding, bile leak or
      perforation. Compared with uncovered SEMS, FCSEMS can be removed several months later and has
      the advantage of longer patency. Proximal or distal migration is one of major disadvantages
      of FCSEMS. The migration rate ranged from 7.0%-33% in previous reports.

      We hypothesized that the fixation of the distal end of FCSEMS by a metal clip could decrease
      the migration rate and migration-related cholangitis.
