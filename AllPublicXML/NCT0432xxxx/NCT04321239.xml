  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning chronic pain self-management skills can help patients improve daily functioning and
      quality of life, while avoiding risks associated with opioids and other pharmacological
      treatments. Community health workers (CHWs) may help make chronic pain self-management
      interventions more accessible to older adults living in underserved communities. The goal of
      this study is to conduct a randomized pilot and feasibility trial of a positive
      psychology-based chronic pain self-management intervention delivered by CHWs, in conjunction
      with mobile health tools, in a sample of 50 older adults recruited from community sites in
      Detroit, Michigan. This study will involve the use of mixed quantitative and qualitative
      methods to assess participant engagement and satisfaction, and change in pain-related
      outcomes.

    <description>After completing the follow-up telephone survey, individuals in the control condition will be given access to the online program, a wearable physical activity tracker to use and keep, and will be invited to attend a one-time 2.5-hour in-person or telephone workshop that summarizes intervention content and that will be led jointly by study staff and a community health worker.</description>

    <intervention_name>Positive STEPS</intervention_name>
    <description>Individuals in the intervention group will meet with a community health worker at an in-person or virtual study orientation session. At this session, they will be introduced to the program, learn how to use the online modules and any associated materials, and choose a day and time for future weekly telephone sessions. Participants will also be given a wearable physical activity tracker at the orientation session to use throughout the course of the program. They can choose to report daily step counts either by automatically syncing to an app or by manual reporting via text message. The program will be delivered over 6 weeks. Each week participants will complete a web-based module and have one telephone session with the community health worker to discuss that module and to set a related goal. Participants will also set weekly goals related to walking, which will be informed and tracked by daily step-counts from the physical activity tracker.</description>

    <ipd_description>Self-reported survey data (baseline and 8 weeks from baseline) on pain and functioning, as well as other health and demographic information from a telephone survey of 50 pilot study participants. For 25 of these participants, we will also have up to six weeks of daily activity (step count) data. Two anonymized datasets will be created: 1) survey data only; 2) survey data plus, for the subset of 25 participants, activity data linked to survey data. In order to maintain confidentiality, outliers, dates, and personal identifiers will be removed from the data set.
Notes from post-program qualitative interviews (n=25). These are in-depth, semi-structured interviews about challenges, facilitators, and satisfaction with various aspects of the program and its implementation. We will share de-identified copies of detailed notes from these interviews (we do not plan on producing verbatim transcripts) but not audiorecordings.</ipd_description>
