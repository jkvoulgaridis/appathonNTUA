  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Colonoscopy is accepted to be the gold standard for screening of colorectal cancer (CRC).
      Most CRCs develop from adenomatous polyps, with colonoscopy accepted to be the gold standard
      for screening of CRC. An endoscopist's ability to detect polyps is assessed in the form of an
      Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR). Each 1.0% increase in ADR is associated with a 3.0% decrease in
      the risk of the patient developing an interval CRC. There remains a wide variation in
      endoscopist ADR.

      More recently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer aided diagnosis in
      endoscopy has been gaining increasing attention for its role in automated lesion detection
      and characterisation. AI can potentially improve ADR, but previous AI related work has
      largely focused on retrospectively assessing still endoscopic images and selected video
      sequences which may be subject to bias and lack clinical utility. There are only limited
      clinical studies evaluating the effect of AI in improving ADR.

      The CADDIE device uses convolutional neural networks developed for computer assisted
      detection and computer assisted diagnosis of polyps.

      Primary objective: To determine whether the CADDIE artificial intelligence system improves
      endoscopic detection of adenomas during colonoscopy.

      Primary endpoint: The difference in adenoma detection rate (ADR) between the intervention
      (supported with the CADDIE system) and non-intervention arm

      Study design: Multi-Centre, open-label, randomised, prospective trial to assess efficacy and
      safety of the CADDIE artificial intelligence system for improving endoscopic detection of
      colonic polyps in real-time.

    <ipd_access_criteria>We will make provision for and consider data sharing requests from bona fide researchers who must abide by the following principles: data will be collected with an high level of quality assurance, data will be held securely with appropriate documentation, data will not be put into the public domain or otherwise shared without explicit ethical review or legal obligation, and they will aim to use any data generated to the maximum public good. These datasets are governed by data usage policies specified by the data controller (UCL). If a conflict exists that severely restricts the analyses that can be undertaken, we would endeavour to support outside researchers by hosting them as visiting workers in our team so that they can access the data.
