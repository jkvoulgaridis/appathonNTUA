  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of
      the administration of phenobarbital sodium injection in neonates who have suffered from
      electrographic or electroclinical seizure. As neonatal seizures can have long-term adverse
      effects, including death, placebo-controlled studies are not appropriate for this population.
      This study is designed to show intravenous phenobarbital is effective at preventing
      subsequent seizures by demonstrating greater efficacy at a higher dose compared to a lower
      dose.
