  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the rising problem of overweight and obesity, many strategies are implemented to
      combat this issue and one of the most common ways is exercise training. Aerobic exercise is a
      popular and effective conservative strategy for weight and adiposity management and commonly
      used exercise protocols are moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and interval
      training (IT). MICT is typically defined as continuous effort that elicits 55%-70% of the
      maximal heart rate or promotes oxygen consumption equivalent to 40%-60% of the maximum oxygen
      intake. IT involves repeated exercise with periods of recovery, which includes high intensity
      interval training (HIIT) and Sprint interval training (SIT). HIIT is exercising at 80% to
      100% of maximal heart rate while SIT involves &quot;all-out&quot; or &quot;supramaximal&quot; effort at the
      intensity of 100% of maximal oxygen uptake. Multiple systematic reviews on the effect of SIT
      on aerobic capacity or comparisons between other forms of exercise protocols to reduce body
      adiposity has been conducted, but so far no systematic review has been carried out to
      evaluate the efficacy of this protocol solely on anthropometric measures on young obese and
      overweight adults alone. Hence, in this study, a systematic review of the effect of SIT on
      anthropometric measurements in young obese or overweight adults will be reviewed, filtered
      and assembled.

      Keywords using &quot;obese&quot;, &quot;overweight&quot;, &quot;sprint interval training&quot;, &quot;interval training&quot;,
      &quot;anthropometric measures&quot;,&quot;body mass index&quot;, &quot;fat %&quot; lean muscle mass will be searched
      through e-databases namely Pubmed (including MEDLINE), Pedro-search, Science Direct, Google
      Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library for the suitable original full text
      studies. Only randomized control trails will be included in this study and the &quot;Tool for the
      assEssment of Study qualiTy and reporting in EXercise&quot; (TESTEX) would be utilized to assess
      each individual study. TESTEX has been validated and is specific to exercise training. The
      authors wish to use TESTEX as it addresses several shortcomings that PEDro does not e.g.
      exercise adherence, withdrawal, relative exercise training intensity. In addition, study
      quality assessment of training studies is more robust with TESTEX. 2 independent evaluators
      will examine and screen each study for its efficacy to be included in the data analysis.
