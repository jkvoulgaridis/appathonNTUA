    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a dose dense administration of Rituximab in
      newly diagnosed acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and determine relapse rate
      following this treatment.

      Correlative studies will be performed as outlined in the appendices.

      Quality of Life will be measured using the KIT as outlined in the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Subjects must be ≥ 1 year and ≤ 21 years of age.

          -  Diagnosis: Patients must have newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of ≤ 20 x 109
             per Liter. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed to rule out malignancy
             in the bone marrow.

          -  High-risk features : In addition, patients must have one of more of the following
             high-risk criteria:

               -  Age ≥ 10 years

               -  Grade II-IV bleeding at diagnosis

               -  ANA positivity

               -  No history of preceding infection within 2 weeks prior to ITP diagnosis

          -  Performance Status: Patients must have a performance status ≥ 50%. Use Karnofsky for
             patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky for patients less than or equal to 16 years of
             age. See Appendix I for performance score.

          -  Prior Therapy

               -  Patients may not have received any treatment for ITP prior to start of therapy.

               -  Patients may not receive systemic steroids ≥ 0.5 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent)
                  within 2 weeks prior to diagnosis.

          -  Concomitant Medications Restrictions:

               -  Steroids are only warranted as premedication prior to rituximab.

               -  Patients who receive thrombopoetic agonists, eltrombopag or romiplostim will be
                  taken off protocol.

          -  Organ Function Requirements

               -  Adequate Renal Function Defined As: estimated CrCl &gt; 60 mL/min or &gt;30% of GFR for
                  age based on the Schwartz formula

               -  Adequate Liver Function Defined As: AST and/or ALT less than 5 times the upper
                  limit of normal, and/or direct bilirubin less than the 2 times of the upper limit
                  of normal

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with a history of Grade III-IV allergic reaction to rituximab

          -  Patients with bone marrow neoplastic infiltration

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis B infection

          -  Pregnancy and Breast Feeding

               -  Female patients who are pregnant are ineligible (insert the reason: &quot;due to risks
                  of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies&quot; or
                  &quot;since there is yet no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic
                  toxicities&quot;).

               -  Lactating females are not eligible unless they have agreed not to breastfeed
                  their infants.

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential are not eligible unless a negative
                  pregnancy test result has been obtained.
