  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as an open label, feasibility, single-center, cross-over prospective
      study in women with stress urinary incontinence. Subjects served as their own control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this feasibility study were to evaluate the short-term efficacy of
      the Nolix device by measuring a reduction of SUI following a modified 1-hour PWG test and to
      measure the safety of the Nolix device based on adverse events that were reported by subjects
      during the study. The secondary objective was to assess usability and patient satisfaction
      using the Nolix device.

    <measure>Continuous percent change in urine leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>Pads were measured before and immediately after the 1 hour PWG test</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous percent change in urine leakage is defined as: 100%*(PWG without Nolix - PWG with Nolix)/PWG without Nolix.</description>

    <measure>Change in the dryness of the pad</measure>
    <time_frame>Pads were measured before and immediately after the 1 hour PWG</time_frame>
    <description>Success (&quot;1&quot;) if following the 1-hour PWG test, the pad weight increases by no more than 1 gram or Failure (&quot;0&quot;) if following the 1-hour test, the pad weight increased by more than 1 gram.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dichotomous change in urine leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>Pads were measured before and immediately after the 1 hour PWG</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with FDA recommendations, the clinically meaningful level of improvement in PWG is at least 50%. Therefore, the dichotomous change is defined for each patient as follows: Success (&quot;1&quot;), if continuous percent change in PWG &gt; 50% or Failure (&quot;0&quot;), if continuous percent change in PWG &lt; 50%</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort during Nolix use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort during Nolix device use will be measured through the Satisfaction Questionnaire, using a 10-point scale (where 1 is the most negative response and 10 the most positive, during the use of the device).
Comfort during Nolix device use will be measured through the Benefit, Satisfaction, and Willingness to Continue Questionnaire, using a 10-point scale (where 1 is the most negative response and 10 the most positive, during the use of the device)</description>
