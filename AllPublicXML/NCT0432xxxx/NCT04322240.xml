      Patients with type 2 DM who are following will be enrolled into the study. Two visits were
      scheduled for data collection, physical examination and laboratory testing of the patients:
      the first prior to initiation of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) administration (baseline visit) and
      the second at the end of the third month following initiation of ALA (2nd visit).

      This prospective, Interventional study will be conducted at Benha university hospital for 3
      months. Patients with type 2 DM who are following at the outpatient internal medicine &amp;
      diabetes Clinics in Benha Univeristy Hospital and are eligible to participate, will be
      enrolled into the study. Inclusion criteria comprise the following(1) patient's agreement to
      participate; (2) diabetic peripheral neuropathy diagnosis (3) treatment with alpha lipolic
      acid (ALA), had to be stable for 3 months during the study.

      Two visits were scheduled for data collection, physical examination and laboratory testing of
      the patients: the first prior to initiation of ALA administration (baseline visit) and the
      second at the end of the third month following initiation of ALA (2nd visit).

      evaluation include:

        1. full neurological evaluation including motor, sensory, ankle reflex, Tests for cardiac
           parasympathetic action

        2. nerve conduction study

        3. neuromuscular ultrasound

        4. HbA1C 5- HDL-C&amp; LDL-C
