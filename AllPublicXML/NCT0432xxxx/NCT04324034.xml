  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and safety of laparoscopy are no longer to be demonstrated, especially in the
      field of gynecology, but this technique often causes post-operative pain. New techniques are
      being developed to overcome the inconvenience of laparoscopy, notably endoscopic transluminal
      surgery using a natural orifice (NOTES). It avoids incisions and therefore scarring, and
      could reduce post-operative pain. It is now developing in the field of transvaginal
      gynecology (vNOTES).

      This study is the first prospective randomized study comparing the vNOTES technique to
      laparoscopy with postoperative pain assessment for performing a salpingectomy. The hypothesis
      is that the use of vNOTES transvaginal endoscopic surgery would reduce the post-operative
      pain of patients compared to laparoscopy in the context of a salpingectomy.
