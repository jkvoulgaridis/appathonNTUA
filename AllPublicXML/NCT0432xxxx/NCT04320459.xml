  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study included 55 patients having Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) for at least 1 year
      diagnosed according to the ASAS classification criteria who presented to our hospital's
      outpatient clinic and 55 healthy subjects. Demographic data were recorded for 55 AS patients
      who were subsequently assessed using the BASMI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index)
      in terms of elasticity and spinal mobility as well as the BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Functional Index) to determine functional status, the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Disease Activity Index) to assess the disease activity and the ASQoL (Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Quality of Life Questionnaire) to evaluate quality of life. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20
      (TAS-20) was used for assessment of alexithymia and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) for
      depression among patients.

    <description>It characterises the spinal mobility of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Cervical rotation, tragus-wall distance, lateral lumbar flexion, anterior lumbar flexion (modified schober), intermalleolar distance were measured. The total score of the 5 measurements was taken, the score range was 0-10, the low score meant that the spinal movement was better.</description>

    <description>It evaluates quality of life. Each statement on the ASQoL (18-item) is given a score of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. A score of &quot;1&quot; is given where the item is affirmed, indicating adverse QoL. All item scores are summed to give a total score or index. Scores can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL).</description>

    <intervention_name>Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20)</intervention_name>
    <description>It assess alexithymia. It is a 20 item questionnaire and each item is evaluated in a Likert type scale with five intervals (1= strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). The total alexithymia score is the sum of responses to all 20 items, while the score for each subscale factor is the sum of the responses to that subscale. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia.</description>

    <description>It assess depression status. It is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, each set is ranked in terms of severity and scored from 0 to 3 with a total summed score range of 0-63. Higher scores indicate greater depressive severity. Conventional cutoffs are 0-9 for normal range, 10-18 for mild to moderate depression, 19-29 for moderate to severe depression, and 30-63 for severe depression.</description>
