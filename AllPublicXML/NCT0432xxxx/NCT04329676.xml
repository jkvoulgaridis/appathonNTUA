  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain clinical outcome data on safety and effectiveness of
      the directSTIM DBS system when used on-label, according to the instructions for use.

      All participants will undergo bilateral implant in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and data
      collected in common practice will be recorded during six months post-implant and analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      directSTIM DBS Therapy for Movement Disorders is indicated for patients with disabling tremor
      or symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

      Subjects selected to participate in the study will be Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients who
      are eligible for bilateral DBS for STN therapy and meet the inclusion criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Primary safety and effectiveness endpoints data will be collected through 6 months of
      follow-up. The values used for comparison are derived from a review of literature spanning
      from 2001 to 2019.

      After completing the 6 month follow-up, subject will exit the study, and continue to be
      followed by their physician per usual care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in UPDRS III score without medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Part 3 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III), is a series of questions evaluated by the clinician in presence of the patient, focusing on motor symptoms of PD.
Score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 108. This score is evaluated at baseline and 6 months post-implant without any anti-Parkinson medication taken.
A decrease at 6 months compared to baseline indicates an improvement. The average difference of scores between the two time points is calculated for the whole study subject population.
This value is to be compared to the results of a meta-analysis performed on data extracted during a literature search.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Materiovigilance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics on the occurrence of the following categories of adverse events (AEs):
Device-related AEs
Procedure-related AEs
Stimulation-related AEs</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic Window (TW)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The therapeutic window is the difference of electrical current values between the stimulation settings that provide maximum alleviation of motor symptoms and the settings for which the first stimulation-induced side effect appears (e.g., eye deviation, muscle contraction, speech impairment).
The wider this window, the more flexibility is offered to the patient for stimulation without causing side-effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PDQ-39 score without medication.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, a patient-filled questionnaire focusing on quality of life, is completed by study subjects at baseline and 6 months post-implant.
Score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 100. A decrease at 6 months compared to baseline indicates an improvement.
The average difference of scores between the two time points is calculated for the whole study subject population.
This value is to be compared to the results of a meta-analysis performed on data extracted during a literature search.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>UPDRS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Other parts (I, II and IV) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale are evaluated at baseline and 6 months post-implant.
Part I is a series of 4 questions assessing Mentation, Behavior and Mood. Patient's score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 16.
Part II is a series of 13 questions assessing Quality of Life in daily activities. Patient's score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 52.
Part IV is a series of 10 questions assessing Complications of Therapy. Patient's score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 23.
A decrease at 6 months compared to baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dopaminergic medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) is expressed as Levodopa equivalent mg/day and measured through the whole study duration.
Evolution of this value is followed and the difference between baseline and 6 months post-implant timepoints is to be compared to the results of a meta-analysis performed on data extracted during a literature search.</description>
