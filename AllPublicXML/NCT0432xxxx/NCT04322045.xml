  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the incidence of prostate cancer among males in Nanjing and
      whether a combination of PSA, multi-parametric MRI and targeted biopsy is a feasible approach
      for screening prostate cancer in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to collect serum samples and clinical information from men aged
      ≥50 years taking physical examination in community health service centers in Nanjing. The
      investigators will propose mpMRI for those with serum PSA ≥4 ng/mL. Transperineal systematic
      biopsy (TPSB) combined with MRI /ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy (TB) will be offered for
      those scored ≥3 on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2).
      TPSB alone will be offered for those scored &lt;3 and serum PSA ≥10 ng/mL. Subjects with serum
      PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL and PI-RADS score ＜3 points will be referred to follow-up
      examinations every 6 months.
