    <textblock>
      The relationship between the immune system and the myocardium after myocardial ischemia is an
      evolving field of research. Crosstalk occurs between macrophages and cardiac myocytes to
      promote cardio-protection and resolution of inflammation after myocardial ischemia and
      reperfusion injury (MI/R injury).

      Myeloid-epithelial-reproductive tyrosine kinase (MerTK), a member of the TAM family of
      tyrosine kinase receptors (Tyro-Axl-MerTK), is a macrophage receptor that mediates
      efferocytosis, anti-inflammatory signaling, and resolution of inflammation. After MI/R
      injury, intact MerTK is necessary for the phagocytosis of dead cardiac myocytes and to
      promote anti-inflammatory signaling. Proteolytic cleavage of MerTK to its inactive form,
      soluble MER, restricts the capacity of macrophages to phagocytize dead cardiac myocytes and
      impairs MerTK-dependent anti-inflammatory signaling resulting in suppressive effects on
      cardiac remodeling and function.

      The Thorp lab at Northwestern University has previously measured soluble MER levels in both
      adult mice and humans and found that soluble MER concentrations increase after MI/R injury.
      In adult MI patients, soluble MER was measured post coronary artery reperfusion and was found
      to be increased (average 3200 pg/mL compared to 1700 pg/mL) compared to controls with stable
      cardiovascular disease. Based on murine data, the lab further postulated that reperfusion
      injury may directly interfere with MerTK-dependent cardiac repair as reactive oxygen species
      formed during reperfusion injury induce proteolytic cleavage of MerTK to soluble MER.

      Myocardial infarctions are rare events in pediatric patients. However, pediatric hearts are
      exposed to periods of hypoperfusion, ischemia, and inflammation during times of stress such
      as cardiac bypass and critical illness, and it is unknown how soluble MER levels change in
      response to these events. Thus, I was interested in investigating how soluble MER levels
      change after MI/R injury induced by cardiac bypass as well as in the utility of soluble MER
      as a biomarker of cardiac inflammation and injury in pediatric patients.
