    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess foot complications among patients with diabetes in Canada, using
      patient data collected during diabetes foot assessments performed by the LMC Chiropody Team
      between February 27, 2018 and April 17, 2019.

    <textblock>
      Among patients with diabetes, one of the major causes of increased morbidity and mortality
      include lower-extremity complications. Patients who have peripheral neuropathy and peripheral
      arterial disease are at risk of developing foot ulcers and infection, which can lead to
      lower-extremity amputations. Adults with diabetes in Canada are 20 times more likely to be
      hospitalized for a nontraumatic lower limb amputation than adults without diabetes. Thus, the
      prevention, education and early treatment of diabetes foot complications are an important
      component of caring for patients living with diabetes.

      In addition to neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease, risk factors for developing foot
      ulcers include increased levels of glycated hemoglobin, onychomycosis, microvascular
      complications, previous foot ulcer or amputation, structural deformity, and limited joint
      mobility. To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of foot complications, such as
      onychomycosis, and the association of diabetes foot complications with glycemic control and
      other diabetes risk factors, has not been assessed before in a large sample of Canadian
      patients. To better understand foot complications among patients with diabetes in Canada, the
      investigators will retrospectively examine patient data collected during diabetes foot
      assessments performed by the LMC Chiropody Team. The LMC Chiropody Team is part of LMC
      Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, which is one of the largest endocrine practice groups globally.
