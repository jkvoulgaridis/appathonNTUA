      This study compares the survival rates of both direct and indirect resin-based composite
      restorations in the treatment of severe tooth wear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tooth wear can lead to pain, discomfort and unsatisfying dental attractiveness and when
      severe, it can compromise the dentition's prognosis. Restorative therapies for treatment of
      severe tooth wear should be preferably minimally invasive and adhesive.

      This study compares two different treatment techniques for severe tooth wear. The first
      technique is regarded as the 'standard' technique. This is a full rehabilitation using only
      direct composite restorations (AP-X, Kuraray, Japan).

      The second technique comprises a full rehabilitation using both direct and indirect resin
      composite restorations (Estenia C&amp;B, Kuraray, Japan). 10 indirect restorations are placed on
      specific elements i.e. first molars and palatal sides of all maxillary anterior teeth. Other
      elements are restored conform the direct protocol.

      An important benefit for the patients is the rehabilitation of their worn dentitions.
      Functionality (teeth are less sensitive, improved chewing ability, better occlusal stability,
      etc) and aesthetics will be improved immediately after finishing the treatment.

      Indirect techniques have the advantage of a superior control over form of restorations.

    <intervention_model_description>After written informed consent, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assigned to an experimental group using block randomization with a block size of eight and the trial design had an intended allocation ratio of 1:1. Patients were allocated randomly to one of the two restorative treatment protocols: (1) Direct protocol: using direct composite restorations on all teeth or (2) Hybrid protocol: using both indirect and direct composite restorations.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>All teeth were reconstructed using non-prep direct hybrid composite restorations (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray, Japan). Restorations were placed following the DSO-technique ('Direct Shaping by Occlusion').
Adhesion was acquired using a 3-step etch-and-rinse procedure, including 37% phosphoric acid (DMG, Germany), Clearfil SA Primer and Clearfil Photobond (Kuraray). If a pre-existing composite restoration was present, a repair procedure was performed; The adhesive surface was roughened by a bur, air-abraded ((CoJet (3M) and Danville MicroEtcher CD (Danville Materials, USA)) and a non-hydrolyzed silane coupling agent (Clearfil Porcelain Activator (Kuraray)) was mixed into the adhesive resin.
Where needed for esthetical reasons, buccal veneers were made using a nanofilled composite (IPS Empress direct, Ivoclar Vivadent, Lichtenstein). If a buccal veneer was made in a separate session from the palatal direct restoration, then a repair procedure was used.</description>

    <description>Teeth were restored using a combination of indirect and direct composite restorations. As a result this protocol actually is a hybrid protocol. 10 indirect restorations per patient were made; tabletop restorations on all first molars (n=4) and palatal veneers on maxillary anterior teeth (n=6) using Estenia C&amp;B (Kuraray, Japan).
Small retention grooves or pits were prepared and sharp edges on occlusal surfaces were polished using fine-grit burs. Silicone impressions were made for the fabrication of the indirect restorations. Indirect restorations were shaped and cured by a dental technician.
Adhesive bonding was acquired using selective etching and ED-primer II (Kuraray, Japan). Before cementation, all indirect restorations were pretreated using phosphoric acid and a silane layer (Clearfil Ceramic Primer, Kuraray, Japan). Panavia F was used for cementation.
Subsequently, all remaining teeth were restored with direct composite restorations according to the direct protocol.</description>
