  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) involves the creation of small gastric reservoir based on lesser
      curvature of the stomach, which is fashioned by a longitudinal gastrectomy that preserves the
      antrum and pylorus together with its vagal innervation. Recently SG is viewed as a
      multi-purpose bariatric procedure that restricts the stomach size to induce satiety and
      resects fundal ghrelin-producing cells to decrease appetite. However, the risk of staple line
      leak and bleeding remains one of its challenging complications. Despite the fact that there
      are a large number of studies assessing various methods of making the staple line secure,
      there is to date, no consensus on which technique is best for reducing the risk of stapler
      line bleeding and leak. Hence, this study aims to compare staple line suturing reinforcement
      methods in sleeve gastrectomy using plication and over-sewing techniques.

    <description>Sleeve gastrectomy procedure will be performed laparoscopically. The greater curvature of the stomach will be mobilised, and stomach will be sleeved using 39F calibration tube as the stent using 5-6 60 mm-stapler reloads depending on the length and thickness of the stomach. The staple-line is then reinforced using 3/0 absorbable sutures continuously throughout the staple-line. The two staple-line suturing methods in this study include over-sewing (through and through) and plication (Lembert).</description>
