      The overall goal of this study is to assess the impact of RTS,S (malaria) vaccination and PBO
      nets on malaria infection and transmission, independently and how they interact when they are
      introduced together.

      The specific objectives for the study are as follows:

        1. To estimate the impact of PBO nets and RTS,S vaccine on Plasmodium infection prevalence
           and transmission, independently and how they interact when they are introduced together
           in Malawi (Phase 1).

        2. To assess the feasibility of evaluating the impact of RTS,S vaccine and PBO nets
           independently in a larger scale future study.

      Introduction: The decline in malaria incidence has stalled globally and incidence is
      increasing in some high transmission settings of sub-Saharan Africa, including Malawi. The
      situation is worsening despite the scale-up of previously effective interventions, raising
      concerns that the impact of current malaria control and prevention strategies maybe
      compromised.

      Problem: There is an urgent need for innovative approaches to malaria control and Malawi is
      currently positioned to assess two of the most promising new interventions. The Malawi
      Ministry of Health (MOH) is launching large scale projects to evaluate a new formulation of
      insecticide-treated bed nets with a chemical synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), designed to
      enhance the insecticidal effect of pyrethroids and the new malaria vaccine RTS,S (RTS,S). In
      an effort to gain the most information from these, interventions Malawi's National Malaria
      Control Programme (NMCP) have invited the Malawi International Center for Excellence in
      Malaria Research (ICEMR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the two interventions (alone and in
      combination) on malaria prevalence and transmission.

      Objective: In this proposed implementation study, we propose to assess the impact of PBO nets
      and RTS,S vaccine on Plasmodium infection prevalence and transmission.

      Study type and methodology: We will enroll children in a prospective cohort study in which
      the follow-up will be at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th month. We are selecting two health center
      catchment areas: one in which both RTS,S and PBO nets are available through the government
      health system and one in which there is no RTS,S vaccine available and standard long-lasting
      insecticide-treated nets (LLINS) have been distributed through the public section. At each
      visit, we will collect specimens to identify malaria infection and detect gametocyte
      infections. We will also collect and analyze mosquitoes from 100 households in both catchment
      areas to provide an entomological evidence of the force of infection. Children in households
      that are scheduled to receive both PBO nets and RTS,S vaccine will be compared to children in
      households that are not scheduled to receive either of these interventions.

    <intervention_name>RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine</intervention_name>
    <description>Malaria vaccine: RTS,S is a subunit vaccine that includes a portion of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) co-expressed with Hepatitis B surface antigen combined with an adjuvant. The Phase 3 trial of three doses administered to 5-17-month-olds confirmed moderate protection, with overall efficacy estimates of 50.4% against clinical malaria and 34.8% against severe malaria after three doses. Efficacy, which waned over time, was marginally improved by boosting at 18 months. The European Medicines Agency adopted a positive scientific opinion of the vaccine for use outside of the European Union. The World Health Organization has created the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Program (MVIP) and selected Malawi as one of the sites to explore the feasibility, efficacy and safety of RTS,S vaccination in the context of routine use.</description>

    <description>PBO nets: The PBO nets represent a new formulation of insecticide-treated bed nets with a chemical synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), designed to enhance the insecticidal effect of pyrethroids. They seem to be helpful in areas like Malawi where insecticide-resistance is increasing. PBO inhibits the enzyme that detoxifies the pyrethroid, allowing the pyrethroid to act on the mosquito. The impact of PBO net use was also detectable in key entomological measures including Anopheles density, sporozoite rate and entomological inoculation rates. Following these promising preliminary results in Tanzania, Malawi's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) is piloting the use of PBO-nets iin one of our two study sites, presenting us with the opportunity to study the effectiveness of these nets in the context of real-world program setting</description>
