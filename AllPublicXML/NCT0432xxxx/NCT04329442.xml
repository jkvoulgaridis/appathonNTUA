  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will pilot-test an accelerated PrEP initiation approach among young
      high-risk Black/African American (B/AA) men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women
      (YMSM/TW) at the point of care in community contexts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will provide a free 30-day supply of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to
      young Black MSM and TW identified as PrEP-eligible and interested in taking PrEP to reduce
      their risk of HIV acquisition. This intervention is intended to assist youth at high risk for
      HIV acquisition in successfully initiating PrEP use.

    <description>PrEP adherence self-efficacy will be assessed via a 9-question scale focused on respondents' belief that they could continue to take PrEP when experiencing barriers to adherence. Each item is scored on a 0-10 scale, where 0 means &quot;cannot do at all&quot; and 10 means &quot;completely certainly can do.&quot; This scale has been adapted from the Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (Johnson et al., 2007).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ages 18-24;

          2. assigned male at birth, identify as a man (cisgender), transgender woman, or gender
             non-conforming or genderqueer;

          3. identifying as Black, African American, or multiracial with at least one parent
             identifying as Black or African American;

          4. not currently taking PrEP or attending a visit to initiate PrEP;

          5. self-report being HIV-negative;

          6. reporting one of the following HIV risks in the last 6 months (Hosek, Rudy et al.
             2015, Hosek, Rudy et al. 2017): a. condomless anal intercourse with an HIV-infected
             male partner or a male partner of unknown HIV status; b. anal intercourse with 3 or
             more male sex partners; c. exchange of money, gifts, shelter, or drugs for anal sex
             with a male partner; d. sex with a male partner and has had a sexually transmitted
             infection; e. sexual partner of an HIV-infected male with whom condoms were not
             consistently used; f. anal intercourse where the condom broke or slipped off

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We are excluding those individuals who were assigned female at birth (female birth
             certificate) and/or cis-gender women (those assigned female at birth and identify as
             women) from the all phases of this study as this study is intended to explore the HIV
             prevention behaviors of B/AA young men who have sex with men and young transgender
             women (assigned male at birth) as these two groups represent the highest risk groups
             for HIV infection in the US, yet only a small percentage are aware or currently use
             PrEP for HIV prevention.
