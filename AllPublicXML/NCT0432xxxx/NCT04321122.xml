      Traditional ciliary body photocoagulation treatment uses the photocoagulation of
      long-wavelength laser to destroy the ciliary body tissue that can produce aqueous humor.
      Therefore, it is a kind of palliative treatment which has proved efficacy but causes great
      pain to patients. The &quot;ultrasonic glaucoma treatment instrument&quot; produced by French EYE TECH
      CARE company is referred to as EyeOP1. It uses high-intensity focused ultrasound technique to
      make target part of the ciliary coagulative necrosis, reduce the production of aqueous humor
      and thereby lower the intraocular pressure. EyeOP1 is ergonomic and suitable for the human
      eye, making the treatment process more accurate, simple and fast.

      1. Efficacy: 1. Main objective: (1)Assess the decrease in postoperative intraocular
           pressure from baseline and evaluate the final results (the percentage of patients whose
           conditions have significant improved and the variation of the percentage of median
           intraocular pressure. (2)Assess the amount of medication after surgery.

        2. Secondary goals:(1) Compare median intraocular pressure with baseline at each
           postoperative follow-up and access the variation of median intraocular pressure from
           baseline at each postoperative follow-up. (2) Count the number of intraocular pressure
           lowering drugs at each postoperative follow-up.

      b.Safety: Investigate the incidence of all device-related(or procedure-related) adverse
      events during the study (intraoperative and postoperative follow-up).
