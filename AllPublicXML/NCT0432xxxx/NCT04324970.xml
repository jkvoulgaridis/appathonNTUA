    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to assess whether the TOOKIE vest is an effective intervention
      in reducing line fall out. All oncology patients with a tunneled central line will be
      approached to participate in this study. Following informed consent they will be issued with
      a TOOKIE vest.

      All oncology patients with a tunneled central line will be approached to participate in this
      study. Following informed consent they will be issued with a TOOKIE vest. Lines will be
      studied for the duration they are in situ. This will vary depending on the underlying
      diagnosis and treatment regime. One hundred central line insertions for oncology patients
      will be prospectively identified and be given the &quot;TOOKIE Vest&quot; to wear. Data will be
      collated for each group regarding age, gender, diagnosis, type of central access inserted,
      duration of line, reason for removal, in cases of infection the infected organism will be
      documented, date of each fall out.
