  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      8 young people (aged 12-15yrs) with type 1 diabetes will be interviewed along with their
      families during this qualitative study. The interviews will explore factors identified by the
      young people and their families as important in diabetes management. Comparison of these
      factors will then be made between the young people with higher and lower HbA1c levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family is an important factor in the self-management of type 1 diabetes by children and young
      people. Existing research has explored the experience of living with diabetes, considered
      from the perspective of children and parents, but has not provided children's diabetes teams
      with the information they need to support young people with higher blood glucose levels, and
      therefore higher risks of long term complications related to their diabetes.

      During this qualitative study the researcher will meet with young people (aged 12-15yrs) and
      their families for a joint interview, held in the family home, exploring the factors which
      they consider important in diabetes self-management.

      One interview will be held with each family. Recruitment of 8 families is planned.

      The interviews will be recorded and transcribed to allow thematic analysis, allowing
      identification of common factors considered to be important by families.

      The HbA1c of young people with diabetes is checked regularly in clinic and provides an
      assessment of blood glucose levels over the preceding months. Higher HbA1c levels are
      associated with higher risk of long term complications.

      The index young people will be recruited in 2 groups: one group will have lower risk of long
      term complications (identified by an HbA1c level of &lt;58mmol/mol). The other will have higher
      risk (HbA1c 75-100mmol/mol). A comparison will be made between the families in each group, to
      identify which themes are more common in the lower or higher risk groups.

        Young people aged 12-15yrs with HbA1c in one of the two groups (4 from each group) will be

        invited to participate in interviews along with at least one parent/carer, and up to 4
        other people (including children) which they identify as important in their diabetes
        management.
