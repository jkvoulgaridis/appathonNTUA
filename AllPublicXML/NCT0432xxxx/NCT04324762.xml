  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bedside use of ultrasound after central venous catheter (CVCs) insertion has lagged
      behind other applications in medicine, thus presenting an opportunity for innovative,
      evidence-based research that will influence clinician behavior. This research focuses on
      bedside ultrasound applications as an example, to evaluate clinical practice change. Chest
      radiographs are associated with delays in initiating time-critical interventions and present
      an unexamined opportunity for improving patient care by evaluating the use of ultrasound in
      lieu of chest radiographs after CVC insertion. Strategic interventions for implementation are
      needed to hasten the adoption of this clinical innovation (ultrasound guided CVC confirmation
      protocol) allowing them to de-implement chest xrays when no longer indicated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The placement of central venous catheters (CVCs) is a common procedure performed in
      critically ill patients, with millions placed annually. The routine use of chest radiographs
      for CVC confirmation is outdated. Chest radiographs are associated with delays in initiating
      time-critical interventions and present an unexamined opportunity for improving resource
      utilization and associated costs. Radiography has been used for over 50 years for this
      purpose in the absence of other options. Emerging evidence suggests that a post-procedure
      chest radiographs are unnecessary when ultrasound is used to confirm catheter position and
      exclude pneumothorax (PCEP). Yet few in the medical community are likely aware of these data
      and even among those who are aware, chest radiographs continues to be the routine modality
      used for CVC PCEP.

      The average 17 years it takes to translate clinical research into practice is too long and
      presents an opportunity to expedite implementation of innovations in critical care medicine.
      For the proposed project, &quot;De-Implementation Of Routine Chest Radiographs After Adoption of
      Ultrasound Guided Insertion and Confirmation of Central Venous Catheter Protocol (DRAUP)&quot;,
      the hypothesis is that identifying determinants of behavior for intervention development (Aim
      1) will increase the likelihood of developing successful strategies that will yield faster
      clinical adoption. Understanding the behavioral adaptations that have to occur is key to
      developing strategies that increase the uptake of evidence into healthcare practice and
      improving health outcomes. These strategies (targeting adoption and substitution) will then
      be implemented in a local Emergency Department (Aim 2) to determine if these selected
      implementation strategies will increase provider adoption, fidelity, and organizational
      penetrance (Aim 3) of ultrasound-guided CVC PCEP. A good clinical outcome would be a decrease
      in provider dependence on chest radiographs after ultrasound-guided CVC PCEP.
