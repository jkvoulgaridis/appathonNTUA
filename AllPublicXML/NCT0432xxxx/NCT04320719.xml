    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia is frequent (prevalence of 30% in general population) and constitue with
      diabetes, obesity and arterial hypertension a major risk factor of atherosclerosis that leads
      to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis of the
      arterial vessel wall and to thrombosis is the foremost cause of premature mortality and of
      disability-adjusted life years in Europe, and is also increasingly common in developing
      countries. In the European Union, the economic cost of CVD represents annually €192 billion
      in direct and indirect healthcare costs. The main clinical entities are coronary artery
      disease (CAD), ischaemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The causes of these
      CVDs are multifactorial. Some of these factors relate to lifestyles, such as tobacco smoking,
      lack of physical activity, and dietary habits, and are thus modifiable. Other risk factors
      are also modifiable, such as elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemias, or
      non-modifiable, such as age and male gender. LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is one of the major risk
      factors for CVD, through its role in the development of atherosclerosis The efficacy of
      statins has been demonstrated by a considerable amount of literature not only in lowering LDL
      cholesterol levels but also in reducing cardiovascular events, both in diabetes and
      non-diabetes patients. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia have emerged from
      different countries. Thereby, in 2016 the French Society of Endocrinology (SFE) and the New
      French Society of Atherosclerosis (NSFA) published a consensus statement on the management of
      dyslipidemias integrating features from European recommendations. However, LDL-C goal
      attainment has rarely been assessed specifically in diabetes population, in which CVD is of
      particular importance.

      This study aimed to assess the rate of patients which requiered an management in
      cardiovascular risk treatment according to european recommendations.

      This observationnal study was carried in Diabetes-Nutrition unit of the University Hospital
      of Montpellier - France. Data of age, sex, tobacco smoking, body mass index, hypertension,
      presence and type of CVD (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease),
      treatment by statins (intensity, molecule, dosage), diabetes complicaion (nephropathy,
      retinopathy) were collected at admission. Management of cardiovasculare risk treatment
      (initiation, modificiation of dosage, molecule or others …) were collected during
      hospitalization and at discharge of hospitalization. LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides levels
      calculated with the Friedewald formula, and glomerular filtration rate calculated according
      to the CKD-EPI formula were obtained from blood samples taken within 24 hours of
      hospitalization admission. Cardiovascular risk level and LDL-c target values were definied
      according to ESC guidelines.
