  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate whether orally administered oxytocin (24IU) can
      modulate neural and behavioral responses to positive and negative valence stimuli during
      basal (emotional scenes) and higher order (facial stimuli) emotional processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of previous studies have reported both neural and social cognition effects of
      intranasally administered oxytocin, although it is unclear whether functional effects are
      mediated by the peptide directly entering the brain or indirectly via raising peripheral
      concentrations. The investigators hypothesize that one method of producing a similar pattern
      of increased peripheral oxytocin concentrations but without the possibility of direct entry
      into the brain would be to administer the peptide lingually. In the current double-blind,
      between-subject, placebo controlled study 80 healthy male subjects will be recruited and
      receive either oxytocin (24IU) or placebo control administered orally (lingual). 45 minutes
      after treatment subjects will be required to complete both face emotion and emotional scene
      processing tasks during fMRI scanning. After the tasks, subjects will be required to rate
      their valence, intensity and arousal response to the same emotional face and scene stimuli
      which were presented during MRI acquisition. Blood samples will be taken before and 30 min
      after the oral treatment interventions to assess oxytocin blood concentrations. All subjects
      will be asked to complete a range of questionnaires before treatment to control for possible
      pre-treatment confounders in terms of personality traits and mood: Beck Depression Inventory
      II (BDI), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Second Version of Social
      Responsiveness Scale(SRS-2), and Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).

    <measure>Effect of oral oxytocin administration of oxytocin on neural responses to positive and negative valence emotional faces, as assessed by task fMRI</measure>
    <time_frame>45-90 minutes after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of neural activation as assessed by functional MRI on the whole brain level between oral administration of oxytocin and placebo by means of treatment (oxytocin, placebo) x emotion (happy, neutral, angry, fear) ANOVAs and emotion-specific comparisons between the treatment groups. We hypothesized that if the effects of oxytocin administration reported following intranasal administration are primarily produced via an increase in peripheral concentrations then oral administration should produce similar effects on neural systems involved in emotional and brain reward processing. If on the other hand some, or all, of the effects of intranasal oxytocin are mediated via a direct action on the brain then oral administration should result in either no effect or alternatively a different pattern of functional effects.</description>
