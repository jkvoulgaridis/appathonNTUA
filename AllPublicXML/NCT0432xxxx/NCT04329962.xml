  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a group of compounds found in blueberries called anthocyanins are
      absorbed into the body from 2 different types of blueberry confections (blueberry extract and
      whole blueberry powder). Blueberries contain several compounds which may be beneficial for
      human health and prevention of disease. These compounds can be consumed as part of a complex
      matrix in the whole fruit or also in a simplified matrix in the form of a fruit extract.
      Studying the absorption and metabolism of these compounds may help researchers understand how
      they influence health and disease, as well as determining the role of the food matrix on
      absorption of berry phytochemical.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare urinary flavonoids composition, compliance and sensory acceptability of 2
      blueberry-based amorphous functional confections one containing blueberry extract and the
      other of a whole blueberry powder) formulated to deliver the 320 mg of anthocyanins.

      II. Assess the effect of blueberry source (extract versus [vs] whole fruit powder) on urinary
      metabolomics profile.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants undergo a washout on days -7 to -1 and then consume blueberry extract
      confection on day 0. Participants undergo a second washout on days 1-7 and then consume
      blueberry powder confection on day 8.

      GROUP II. Participants undergo a washout on days -7 to -1 and then consume blueberry powder
      confection on day 0. Participants undergo a second washout on days 1-7 and then consume
      blueberry extract confection on day 8.

    <description>Will measure bioavailability of the various berry interventions using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of blueberry phytochemicals and metabolites in urine at the day 1 timepoint, after consumption of the test product. Baseline comparisons for anthocyanins found in urine between trials will be performed a paired t-test. Total anthocyanins in 24-hour urine after consumption of one blueberry treatment will be compared to each participant's baseline urine and to total anthocyanins after consumption of the blueberry treatment in a paired t-test.</description>
