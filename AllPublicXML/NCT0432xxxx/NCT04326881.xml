      This study will be a single-center, randomized, parallel, open-label, single dosing (SHR-1314
      240mg) bridging study in healthy subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of two
      formulations of SHR-1314.

      The study will consist of a 14-days screening period (-14~-1 days); an observation period
      (1-3 days) and the follow-up period (4-113 days); Subjects will be randomly assigned to three
      group.
