  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is

        1. to investigate the differential and shared neural underpinnings of facial emotion
           processing within Conduct disorder (CD) and Autism-Spectrum disorder (ASD) and

        2. to investigate the interaction between deficits in emotion processing and dysfunctional
           cognitive control processes.

      Differences in emotion processing and the underlying neural underpinnings of such differences
      will be assessed by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) without any
      contrast agent, combined with adapted emotion processing paradigms and eye tracking
      techniques.

    <description>The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI‐2) is a screening instrument developed for detecting mental health needs in youth aged 12‐17. Designed as a low‐cost, easily administered tool, it screens for multiple issues and can be administered in 10‐15 minutes. It is divided into seven scales composed of 52 questions that are designed to detect alcohol/drug use, angryirritable behavior, depression‐anxiety, somatic complaints, suicide ideation, thought disturbance, and traumatic experience. Youths answer YES or NO concerning whether each item has been true for them &quot;within the past few months.</description>

    <description>The Interpersonal Reactivity Index is a measure of dispositional empathy that takes as its starting point the notion that empathy consists of a set of separate but related constructs. The instrument contains four seven-item subscales (seven Likert items each), each tapping a separate facet of empathy (Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, Personal Distress, and Fantasy). The 28-item IRI contains four subscales</description>

Responses are coded on 4-point scales (1 = no development and 4 = completed development). For girls, a yes-no question about onset of menarche is weighted more heavily (1 = no and 4 = yes). For both genders, ratings are then averaged to create an overall score for physical maturation.</description>

      <textblock>
        German speaking children and adolescents (10-18 years of age) attended at the Kinder- und
        Jugendpsychiatrischen Klinik Basel (KJPK) and with a confirmed diagnosis of CD or ASD.

        Typically developing children will be recruited using leaflets (will be distributed in the
        KJPK clinics and in socioeconomically diversesecondary schools within the Canton of
        Basel-Stadt).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For all participants: age between 10 and 18 years and an intelligence quotient score
             of 70 or higher.

          -  For patient groups: confirmed clinical diagnoses according to Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual (DSM)-5 of CD or ASD (depending on the group), without comorbid
             depression or anxiety psychological disorders.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For all participants: low intelligence (IQ&lt;70, as they might otherwise not fully
             understand what they are expected to do inside the scanner), insufficient German
             language skills or any contraindications for MRI (e.g. pregnancy, any non-removable
             metal within the subjects' body, claustrophobia).

          -  For patient groups: severe developmental disorders, comorbid depressive and/or anxiety
             disorders will also be excluded from the study since it was shown that these patients
             might have problems in attention allocation under emotional stimulation.

          -  For typically developing participants: suspicion of an undiagnosed clinical disorder
