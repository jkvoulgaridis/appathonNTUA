  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The making of an ostomy in patients is experienced as traumatic. The stoma changes body
      image, self-esteem and is responsible for increased anxiety. These changes affect the quality
      of life of patients. To reduce the negative impact of the stoma, patients are seen in
      preoperative consultation by the stoma nurses. This consultation allows to show the patients
      the appearance of a stoma (through a photograph), the equipment used and how it works.

      In 2016, McKenna et al. showed the interest of marking (with felt pen) the ostomy site on the
      abdomen in preoperative. In this study, patients with preoperative marking had a higher
      post-operative quality of life score than patients without marking (p=0.03).

      Quality of life was assessed using the STOMA-QOL score. This quality of life score is
      specific for ostomy patients. It assesses 4 dimensions: sleep, intimate relationships,
      relationships with family and close friends, relationships with people other than family and
      close friends. This questionnaire includes 20 questions and has been validated in 5 languages
      including French.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the post-operative quality of life of ostomy
      patients who have benefited from a preoperative therapeutic education session with the
      placement of the 3D printed ostomy button versus felt-tip marking, during the 15 days prior
      to the operation.

    <description>Total score on the Stoma-QOL (Quality-Of-Life) questionnaire The points obtained for each of the 20 questions are added together to obtain an overall score. This raw summary score per patient in the 20-80 range will be converted into a final score &quot;0-100 score&quot; where 0 indicates the worst Quality of Life and 100 the best Quality of Life.</description>
