  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of obesity and is
      associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The hallmark feature of
      NAFLD is an increase in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content. Data from studies conducted
      in rodent models suggest increased IHTG content can alter hepatic vagal afferent nerve (HVAN)
      activity. In rodent models of obesity and NAFLD, HVAN activity is reduced leading to impaired
      insulin sensitivity and glucose control. The reduction in HVAN activity is likely due to
      increased hepatic release of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, attributable to increased
      expression of GABA-Transaminase (GABA-T). Pharmacological inhibition of GABA-T in obese mice
      by treatment with vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-T improves glucose tolerance
      and reduces hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. It is not known if
      vigabatrin can also improve metabolic function in people. We propose to conduct a randomized
      clinical controlled trial to determine the effect of vigabatrin on insulin sensitivity and
      oral glucose tolerance in adults with obesity and NAFLD.
