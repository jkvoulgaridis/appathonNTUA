    <textblock>
      A non-inferiority trial in JAMA Psychiatry showed that written exposure therapy (WET) was
      non-inferior to a gold standard CBT treatment. In comparison to other trauma-focused CBT
      protocols, WET generally demands less therapist-time, and specifically, less than half
      compared to CBT that consists of 12 weekly sessions á 60 minutes. The aim of this study is to
      translate and replicate these results in a Swedish context. This first step is a small
      feasibility trial which will guide a subsequent large-scale trial.

    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 5 and follow-up at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms of post traumatic stress from baseline to post treatment and follow up (6 months). The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. All items are scored on a 0-4 scale. Higher score indicate worse severity</description>

    <measure>Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - Self-report (MADRS-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 5 and follow-up at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post treatment and follow up (6 months). The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - Self-report (MADRS-S) is a 9 item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. All items are scored on a 0-6 scale. Higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Euroqol, EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 5 and follow-up at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in overall health from baseline to post treatment and follow up (6 months). EQ-5D is a standardised self-report measure of overall health status measured in terms of five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using a three-level scale: 1 having no problems, 2 having some problems and 3 having extreme problems. A higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

    <description>The manual is based on established CBT interventions in trauma such as exposure. In short, the treatment is that the participant should be able to approach their intrusive memories and by doing this repeatedly, the memory will give rise to less discomfort.</description>
