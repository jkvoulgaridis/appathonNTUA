  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant proportions of TGM report desired child-bearing and many engage in receptive
      vaginal intercourse with cisgender men or transgender women. Despite the frequency of desired
      fertility among TGM, secondary amenorrhea and associated infertility are common in those
      undergoing treatment with testosterone. Although testosterone is the mainstay of gender
      affirming care in this population, the mechanism of androgen-induced menstrual suppression is
      unknown due to the limited quantity of well-designed, clinical research investigating
      hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function in testosterone-treated TGM. We hypothesize that
      gender affirming testosterone therapy causes infertility in transgender men through impaired
      gonadotropin secretion, altered ovarian function, or a combination of these effects. We
      therefore propose to study the effect of high-dose, exogenous androgen administration on
      pituitary function, ovarian folliculogenesis, and ovulatory function in transgender men.
      Please note that administration of testosterone cyprionate, at a dose of 50 mg (T50) per
      week, will be done at Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest by Dr. Kyle Bukowski. Who
      is the Associate Medical Director. In the first of our studies, in order to determine whether
      normal feedback mechanisms responsible for induction of gonadotropin responses to circulating
      steroid hormones are altered in TGM on testosterone, we will transiently administer steroid
      hormones and measure resultant changes in gonadotropin secretion among TGM before and during
      testosterone therapy, and in untreated cisgender female control subjects. In the next study,
      to determine whether testosterone alters ovarian follicle function and steroidogenesis, we
      will assess granulosa cell production of estradiol in response to FSH stimulation in TGM
      before and during testosterone therapy.

      Thirteen transgender men (TGM) and 13 cisgender female (CGF) control subjects with congruent
      female gender identity and sex will be enrolled in the following studies.

      i. Ovarian follicle responses to FSH stimulation All subjects in each study group will
      undergo assessment of follicle responsiveness to intravenous (i.v.) recombinant FSH (r-FSH)
      stimulation 150 IU based on our previously published studies. Prior to testosterone treatment
      in TGM, r-FSH stimulation will be performed in the early follicular phase (EFP) of the cycle
      to approximate basal serum estradiol levels observed in the testosterone-treated TGM. Blood
      samples will be obtained before, and at 12 and 24 hours following each i.v. r-FSH injection
      for measurements of gonadotropins and sex steroid hormones. Subsequent r-FSH stimulation will
      be conducted on a random day at three- and six- months after testosterone treatment as we
      expect testosterone-treated TGM to be anovulatory. Blood samples will be obtained before, and
      at 12 and 24 hours following each i.v. r-FSH injection for measurements of sex steroid
      hormones.

      ii. Gonadotropin responses to steroid hormone feedback On the morning of study day 1 (t=0) of
      study each subject will have a blood sample drawn in the morning for baseline hormone
      determinations. Subsequently, an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of estradiol valerate, 5 mg,
      will be administered. On study day 2 (t=48 hr), each subject will be administered an i.m.
      injection of progesterone in oil, 50 mg. Blood samples will be obtained t=0, +24, +48, +60,
      and +72 hr for the assessment of gonadotropin and steroid hormone levels. Serum FSH and LH
      levels following steroid administration in TGM will be compared to those observed in
      untreated TGM and CGF.

      All subjects in each study group will undergo the same intervention as described above. TGM
      subjects will be studied during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle before and
      after three and six months of testosterone therapy. Should amenorrhea occur during T50
      therapy, then study will be performed on a random day within one week of the three- and six-
      month time points. Untreated CGF controls will be studied once during the early follicular
      phase of the menstrual cycle.
