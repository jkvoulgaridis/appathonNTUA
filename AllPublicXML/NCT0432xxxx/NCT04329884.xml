      This will be a multi-center, prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial to
      investigate the effectiveness of using cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) for the
      treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) hip pain and function in subjects treated with CRFA compared
      with standard of care intra-articular steroid injections

    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial investigates the effectiveness of
      using cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) hip pain
      and function compared with standard of care intra-articular steroid injections. This study
      also aims to determine if CRFA is more effective at decreasing hip pain from OA after
      treatment and improving hip function in terms of range of motion and walking mobility when
      compared to corticosteroid hip injections. The primary outcome of interest is a decrease in
      visual analog scale (VAS) pain as reported following treatment with either a hip injection or
      following RFA treatment for patients who are not candidates for total hip arthroplasty (THA).
      Secondary objectives include physical performance at each follow-up time point including
      range of motion and 50 ft walk test, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)
      and PROMIS questionnaires at each follow-up time point, patient satisfaction at 24 weeks
      after treatment, and the number of subjects requesting additional treatment for hip pain
      during the follow-up period.

      The assessments will be conducted by comparing patients with pain from hip OA who get CRFA
      treatment versus patients who get a hip corticosteroid injection. The research hypothesis is
      that CRFA will lead to a greater reduction in pain up to 24 weeks +/- 2 weeks following
      treatment compared to a hip corticosteroid injection. This may result in patients having
      greater relief of their hip pain which may improve joint function and quality of life with
      the availability of a new alternative to treat hip OA.

    <description>VAS Pain score is is scored using a ruler where the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in post-surgical patients who described their postoperative pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <description>PROMISÂ® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. PROMIS measures use a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue, more Physical Function). Thus a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the average referenced population.</description>

The minimum value will be 1 and the maxim value will be 5. Higher scores are a better outcome, while lower scores are a worse outcome.</description>
