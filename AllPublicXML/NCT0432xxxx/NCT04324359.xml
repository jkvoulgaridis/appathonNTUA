  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SURF-201 is being studied for the treatment of eye inflammation and pain in people who are
      undergoing cataract surgery. SURF-201 is an investigational drug (which means the study drug
      is currently being tested) in the form of a sterile eye drop.

      The purpose of this research study is to see how well SURF-201 works and what side effects
      there are, and to compare it with Vehicle (placebo). This study will involve about 80 study
      participants at several different research sites in the United States.

             the study will not be required.

          4. Subjects must have a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of at least +1.0 log of the
             minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (Snellen equivalent of 20/200) in the non-study

          3. Subject has a history of diabetic retinopathy and/or previous vitrectomy in the study
             eye within the last 2 years prior to Screening which, in the investigator's opinion,

             cataract surgery.

          4. Subject has a diagnosis of severe dry eye in the study eye.

          5. Subject has any sign of iritis or scleritis in the study eye.
