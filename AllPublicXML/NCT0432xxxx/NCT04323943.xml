  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of stroke survivors have difficulties to dorsiflex the ankle and clear the
      ground during walking. This impairment, termed as &quot;foot drop&quot;, is caused by an association of
      weak dorsiflexors and increased spasticity and stiffness of the plantar-flexors. As a
      consequence, walking performances are reduced and energy cost of walking is deteriorated.
      This may increase performance fatigability, as the locomotion will be realized at a higher
      percentage of the subjects' capacities. In order to overcome these issues, different
      treatments are proposed. One of the most conventional solutions are the use of ankle foot
      orthosis (AFO) and it is the most commonly prescribed device used to compensate for &quot;foot
      drop&quot;. There is a very large choice of AFO on the market which can be proposed to patients
      with foot drop.

      The aim of this study is thus to assess the mechanical effects of using a manufactured carbon
      AFO in by comparison to a custom-made thermo-plastic AFO on walking capacity (distance and
      energy cost), fatigue and &quot;foot drop&quot; control throughout the gait phase in patients with
      hemiparetic stroke.

    <description>The experimental protocol will require 4 visits: one inclusion visit and 3 visits for evaluations. Each visit corresponds to one condition: C-AFO, CM-AFO or NO (according to a random order).
Visit #1 will consist in a clinical evaluation and a familiarization session with the measuring devices and methodologies used in visit#2 #3 and #4.
During #2, #3 and #4 visits (14 days between each session), the subject will perform with C-AFO, CM-AFO or NO according to the random order :
5 x 15m overground at a comfortable walking speed (CWS) where EMG, ground reaction force and kinematics will be measured
6MWT where energy cost will be measured
5 x 15m overground (immediately after the 6MWT) at a comfortable walking speed</description>
