  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is the fourth group of pulmonary
      hypertension (PH) according to clinical classification. Pulmonary endarterectomy（PEA) is the
      preferred treatment for patients with CTEPH, however, PEA has its limitations, it only
      applies to the thrombi in the main, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries for patients with
      CTEPH, and the postoperative residual PH is found to be of high percentage. With the
      development of interventional techniques, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has been used
      to treat chronic thrombotic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) with favorable results and has
      been identified as an effective and safe treatment for technically inoperable CTEPH. Balloon
      pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has been accepted as a therapeutic strategy in accordance with
      the 2015 ESC/ESR guidelines, especially for patients with technically inoperable, an
      unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio of the PEA. This study was a single-center prospective
      study that collects 3 time points data (before BPA, after final BPA, and follow-up ) to
      verify long-term safety and efficacy of BPA, as well as comparing the efficacy with targeted
      medical therapy, evaluating the complications of BPA, the survival of patients, and the
      postoperative quality of life.

    <description>The study will measure pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at three time points (baseline before BPA, after final BPA, and follow-up) using right heart catheterization to assess pulmonary hemodynamics by comparing the changes of PVR at above 3 time points.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline, from enrollment to end of final BPA at 9 months, at 3 months after BPA, at 9 months after BPA, at 15 months after BPA, at 27 months after BPA</time_frame>
    <description>The principal complications associated with BPA are pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular injury, which may lead to symptoms such as hemoptysis, coughing or hypoxia. The study will collect data to assess the incidence of complication and identify risk factor for complications of BPA procedure.</description>

    <measure>To observe changes of baseline mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) comparing to the final BPA and during follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, from enrollment to end of final BPA at 9 months, at 3 months after BPA, at 9 months after BPA, at 15 months after BPA, at 27 months after BPA</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with CTEPH commonly manifest hypoxia and decreased exercise capacity due to lower respiratory efficiency. This study will collect oxygen-dynamic data associated with BPA to evaluate respiratory efficiency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess changes of baseline quality of life by calculating SF-36 score comparing to the final BPA and during follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, from enrollment to end of final BPA at 9 months, at 3 months after BPA, at 9 months after BPA, at 15 months after BPA, at 27 months after BPA</time_frame>
    <description>It has been proved that BPA improve hemodynamic in patients with inoperable CTPEH, but the effect of BPA on QoL has rarely been reported. Each patient will be asked to fill out the SF-36v2 QoL questionnaire before BPA, after final BPA and follow-up period. QoL will be evaluated on 8 scales: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE) and mental health (MH).Then the investigator will collect 3 time points data to assess changes of QoL in patient with CTEPH.</description>

    <description>The primary end point for overall survival analysis is all-cause death. Long-term survival from the initial BPA procedure, the final BPA procedure and follow-up period will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>Ballon pulmonary angioplasty(BPA) is a stepwise procedure requiring several separate sessions. The interval of a series of BPA is one month. In a series of BPA, there are 2 sessions, which are repeated at a 2-week interval. BPA is performed primarily on one side of the lung in the first session, then after 2 weeks, performed on the other side of the lung. In each session, the fluoroscopy time or the amount contrast are less than 60min and 200ml, respectively.</description>

    <description>Percutaneous vascular access for BPA is via the femoral vein using Seldinger technique. A 5Fr sheath is inserted into the vein, through which a 6Fr long introducer sheath is advanced into the pulmonary artery. Subsequently, a 6Fr guiding catheter is advanced into the pulmonary artery being treated. Generally, selective pulmonary angiography should be performed to evaluate lesion feature before BPA. Then a 0.014-inch guidewire is used to cross the lesion, a balloon catheter of an appropriate diameter is selected to dilate the lesion.</description>
