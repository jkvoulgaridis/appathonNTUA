  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rise of oral therapies in the management of cancers has considerably changed the patient
      care path. If the oral route is preferred by patients because it offers a better quality of
      life, it is not without impact for patients and the health professionals involved in their
      management in their care. Indeed, the use of the oral route shifts part of the responsibility
      for monitoring treatment towards the patient, thereby leading to compliance problems, drug
      interactions and the management of adverse effects.These risks can cause complications or
      compromise the effectiveness of treatment, and generate additional costs for the
      investigator's health system. The study proposes to involve Healthcare Facilities Pharmacist
      and the Dispensary Pharmacist with all other health professionals.First, the hospital
      pharmacist will operate before the initiation of an oral route to perform a clinical
      pharmaceutical analysis of drug prescriptions. Then after the primary prescription and
      finally during a follow-up consultation 3 months after the initiation of treatment. The
      hypothesis of the study is that the coordinated intervention of the hospital pharmacist and
      of the dispensary pharmacist would improve the tolerance of oral treatments by reducing the
      number of serious adverse effects found, as well as improve the, quality of life, patient and
      professional satisfaction

    <description>Adherence to the oral therapy measured with the Girerd questionnaire wich is composed of 6 questions with an expected answer yes or no. A &quot;yes&quot; answer is worth 1, &quot;No&quot; answer is worth 0. The maximum score obtained is 6; the minimum score is 0. Final Score&gt; 2: low compliance ; Final score = 1 or 2: average compliance ; Final score = 0: good compliance.</description>

    <description>The coordinated experimental pharmaceutical path consists of 7 pharmaceutical interviews or consultations. One initial pharmaceutical consultation with the hospital pharmacist. Five follow-up pharmaceutical interviews with the dispensary pharmacist. One follow-up pharmaceutical consultation with hospital pharmacist.
Each pharmaceutical interview or consultation will result in the drafting of a pharmaceutical report to be sent to the other participating health professionals. At each pharmaceutical consultation or interview, the pharmacists requested perform a clinical pharmaceutical analysis of drug prescriptions; Evaluate the patient's understanding; Detect adherence problems, Identify drug related problems; Alert the oncologist and / or the attending physician.</description>
