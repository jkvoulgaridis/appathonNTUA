    <textblock>
      Introduction: Shoulder pain is a condition of high prevalence in the general population.
      Studies indicate that physiotherapeutic treatment with exercise is effective in reducing pain
      and restoring function in patients with shoulder pain. Patients may have difficulty accessing
      the physiotherapy service due to the cost of treatment, transportation to the service, and
      long waiting lines. A possible solution is the use of a web-based exercise prescription
      instrument to increase access to physiotherapy for shoulder pain patients. Objective: To
      verify the effects of an intervention with a web-based instrument compared to a in person and
      supervised intervention. Methods: This study is a controlled, randomized, blinded clinical
      trial. There will be 184 individuals with shoulder pain who will be randomly assigned to two
      groups. One group will receive the mobile application intervention and the other group will
      receive the in person and supervised intervention. The intervention will consist of
      strengthening exercises with emphasis on the lateral rotator and scapulothoracic muscles. The
      primary outcome will be pain and disability (SPADI, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index), and
      the secondary outcomes will be function (DASH questionnaire, Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder and Hand), self-efficacy (CPSS, Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale), kinesiophobia
      (Cover Scale), patient expectation of treatment (7-point Likert Scale), and patient
      satisfaction (Global Change Assessment Scale). All outcomes will be measured before and after
      12 weeks of treatment (2x/week), after 6 months and 12 months from the end of treatment.
      Normality of data will be verified by Kolmogorov Smirnov's test. Differences between groups
      will be verified using the mixed linear models with the interaction terms versus time. The
      effect size will be calculated for the variables between the groups. The significance level
      will be set at 5%.
