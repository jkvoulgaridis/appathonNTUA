  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attitudes among healthcare professionals can possibly affect the treatment given in cardiac
      arrest situations. The attitudes of healthcare professionals towards cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) has been poorly studied. The few existing previous international results
      shows attitudes reported by nurses as hesitation, fear of defibrillation, anxiety and fear of
      harming the patient.

      The aim of this study was to describe the attitudes towards performing cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation among in-hospital healthcare professionals, furthermore to assess if experience
      in performing CPR has an effect on attitudes.

      Data will be collected using questionnaires containing attitude questions. The questionnaires
      contains questions regarding attitudes towards being required to perform CPR (6 questions),
      previous experience in performing CPR (time since last performance and number of
      performances) and attitudes during the latest CPR performance (8 questions). All attitude
      questions are constructed as multiple choice questions.

      Results regarding attitudes towards being required to perform CPR and attitudes during the
      latest CPR performance will be presented descriptively. To analyse a possible effect of time
      since CPR performance and number of CPR performances on attitudes during the latest CPR
      performance logistic regression will be used. Response variables will be &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on 8
      specific attitude questions with predictors consisting of time since CPR performance (0-3
      months ago, 4-23 months ago and &gt;24 months) and number of CPR performances (1-3 times, 4-10
      times and &gt;10 times).

    <description>The effect of previous experience in CPR on attitudes during a cardiac arrest situation will be analysed using binary logistic regression. Each of the eight questions concerning attitudes during a cardiac arrest situation will serve as a dependent variable with &quot;yes&quot; as the response. Independent variables consists of number of previous CPR performances, time since last CPR performance and workplace. Independent variables associated with the dependent variable at a level of p &lt;0.1 will be included in a multiple model. The model will be adjusted for profession and number of years in profession.</description>
