  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is a
      significant health care problem. It affects 1-2% of the population and imposes an enormous
      burden on patients, families and the health care system. Due to the recalcitrant nature of
      the disease, patients have high rates of health care utilization with multiple emergency
      department visits and hospitalizations. These in turn lead to school and work absenteeism,
      job loss, divorce and even disability. CVS is also associated with multiple comorbid
      conditions such as anxiety and depression, which further contribute to disease severity. Both
      neuroimaging studies and other data demonstrate the role of the central nervous system in the
      pathophysiology of CVS with stress being a significant trigger for episodes of CVS. In
      summary, CVS is common, disabling and expensive and is associated with significant
      psychosocial comorbidity that contributes to impaired quality of life . Our current
      healthcare delivery model is disease-centric and does not adequately address the psychosocial
      barriers that contribute to poor health in this patient population. We propose a novel,
      collaborative, integrative health care model that shifts the paradigm of care from one that
      is episodic and disease-centered to a patient-centered approach that addresses psychosocial
      determinants of health not addressed in our current traditional health care system. We will
      incorporate meditation practices that have been shown to reduce psychological distress and
      also add a care coordinator to our health care delivery team. The primary role of the care
      coordinator is to identify patient goals, preferences and barriers to self-management and
      address psychosocial and environmental issues that determine health. Patients will be
      randomized to either the integrative health care model or usual care. The primary aim of our
      study is to determine the impact of our proposed integrative health care model on health care
      outcomes which will include a reduction in psychological distress, improvement in coping
      skills for managing chronic disease, cognitive symptom management, improvement in
      health-related quality of life and reduction in health care utilization. This collaborative
      effort between physicians, community partners, and allied health personnel will redesign the
      health care delivery system, facilitate access to appropriate healthcare services, optimize
      chronic disease management and improve overall healthcare outcomes.

      Background &amp; Aims: Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is associated with psychosocial comorbidity
      and often triggered by stress. The current disease-centered model of care does not address
      psychosocial factors that impact patient outcomes. The investigators hypothesized that a
      holistic, patient-centered care model integrating meditation and addressing psychosocial
      needs through a care coordinator, will improve healthcare outcomes in CVS.

      Methods: The investigators conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 49 patients
      with CVS (mean age: 34 Â± 14 years; 81% female) who were randomized to conventional healthcare
      (control group) or Integrative Health Care (IHC) (27: control group, 22: IHC group;). In the
      IHC group, patients were assigned a care coordinator and received meditation sessions from
      certified trainers from the Heartfulness Institute. Outcomes including psychological
      distress, coping strategies to manage chronic stress, cognitive symptom management, and
      Health-Related Quality of Life were measured with validated tools. An intention-to-treat
      analysis was performed.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were prospectively randomized to either the integrative health care model (IHC model) or usual care (UC)/control group after signing informed consent. Demographics, clinical characteristics and outcomes of interest were measured at baseline before the intervention, and at 3 and 6 months. Global psychological distress ,depression, catastrophizing, anxiety/pain-related fear, and social support were assessed using validated tools. Coping skills were measured with the validated short version of the COPE questionnaire. Quality of sleep was assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). HRQoL was measured with the NIH PROMIS Short Forms. Health care utilization was recorded.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Basic symptom inventory The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) consists of 53 items covering nine symptom dimensions: Somatization, Obsession-Compulsion, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation and Psychoticism; and three global indices of distress: Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Distress Index, and Positive Symptom Total. The global indices measure current or past level of symptomatology, intensity of symptoms, and number of reported symptoms, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>COPE questionanire: The COPE questionnaire consists of the following. Five scales (of four items each) measure conceptually distinct aspects of problem-focused coping (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, restraint coping, seeking of instrumental social support); five scales measure aspects of what might be viewed as emotional-focused coping (seeking of emotional social support, positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial, turning to religion); and three scales measure coping responses that arguably are less useful (focus on and venting of emotions, behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement).</description>
