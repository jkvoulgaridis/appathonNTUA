  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will to identify factors (performance ability, physical function,
      psychosocial function, fear of cancer progression, social support, demographic
      characteristics, and disease-related characteristics) that impact the Return to work and work
      status in survivors of HNC within one year after completion treatment. Head and neck cancer
      survivors who have attended a rehabilitation education care program (RECP) intervention will
      have better performance ability, physical function, psychosocial function, fear of cancer
      progress, social support, and lower return to work to patients who not attended with the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-year project will involve a randomized controlled clinical trial to
      evaluate the 3-months RECP. Eligible participants will be recruited from initial completion
      treatment to 6 months after completion treatment and randomized into a control group and an
      experimental group, with the control group patients receiving routine hospital care and the
      experimental group patients receiving the 3-months RECP. Outcomes will be assessed using
      Return to Work Barrier Scale (RTWBS), Fear of Progression Questionnaire (FoP-Q-SF), Social
      Support Scale (SSS), University of Washington Quality of Life Scale (UW-QOL), Karnofsky's
      Performance Score (KPS), Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), and Instrument
      Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL). Subjective data will be collected at four time
      points: baseline (6 months after completion of treatment)(T0) and then 9, 12, and 18months
      after completion of treatment (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). Objective data will be assessed
      at the same time points. The mixed-model repeated measure ANOVA will be used to analyze the
      data. The investigators plan to recruit 30 subjects for each group.
