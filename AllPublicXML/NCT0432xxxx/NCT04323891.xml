      Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of training of the Resources
      Allocation Exercise (RAE) training programme for higher trainees (HT) and service doctors
      (SD) in the Hospital Authority (HA) using an evidence-based structured and comprehensive
      evaluation framework to identify areas for quality enhancement.

      Design, Setting and Subjects: A longitudinal study will be conducted using the Action
      Learning and Audit Spiral methodologies to measure whether the target standard of training
      intended by the RAE training programme is achieved. Each cluster coordinator will be invited
      to complete a questionnaire on structure and process of training. All eligible HT and SD will
      be invited to complete a questionnaire on the process of training and their training and
      education background. All HT and SD will also be included in the evaluation on the outcomes
      of training programme.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are the proportion of clusters that have
      satisfied each of the structure criteria, HT and SD who have reported the criterion process
      of training, and HT and SD who have rated the training programmes to be of educational value.

      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics on standard of training will be calculated. Regressions
      will be used to identify factors that are associated with quality of training.

      Hypothesis: The quality of training of the RAE training programme will be determined. Areas
      of deficiency and possible areas for quality enhancement will be identified. The results of
      this study will provide empirical evidence on the quality of RAE training programme for HT
      and SD. It also provides information on the effectiveness of RAE training programmes for
      improving skills and knowledge of primary care doctors.

      The structure, process and outcomes of special training programmes for service doctors and
      family medicine trainees in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong will be evaluated by two
      audit cycles from 2011 to 2012.

      Data Collection

      All records of released training sessions of doctors or trainees of all public primary care
      clinics in Hong Kong, the training curriculum, the participation rates, and participant
      rating on effectiveness will be reviewed.

      Outcome Measures

        1. Participation rate

        2. Annual participation frequency per doctor

        3. Proportion of doctors rating the training effective

        4. Success rate in end of training examination pass rate.

      Expected results The information will inform whether the special training programmes for
      service doctors and trainees are effective in enhancing knowledge, skills and success in
      professional examination.
