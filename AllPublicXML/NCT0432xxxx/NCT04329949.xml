  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with relacorilant in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel, according to blinded independent central review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The goals of
      this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of relacorilant in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma.

      Eligible patients are those with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) who have
      received at least 2 prior lines of therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in any
      setting, including at least 1 prior gemcitabine-based therapy and at least 1 prior
      fluoropyrimidine-based therapy.

      Patients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) (per RECIST v1.1) as
      determined by the Investigator, experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment
      discontinuation criteria are met. All patients will be followed for documentation of disease
      progression and survival information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent
      treatment.

        according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
        (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0.

             a chronic nononcologic indication within 21 days.

        therapeutic window.

        Concurrent treatment with mifepristone or other Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) antagonists.

        Any clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) or any medical condition which in the
        opinion of the Investigator places the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities
        or impair study participation or cooperation.

        Any major surgery within 21 days prior to enrollment.

        Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with persistence of any of the following:

             virus (HBV). (Patients with chronic or active hepatitis B as diagnosed by serologic
             tests are excluded from the study. In equivocal cases, hepatitis B or C polymerase
             chain reaction results may be performed and must be negative for enrollment.) A rapid
             decline in KPS score or serum albumin (≥20%), or have progressive pain symptoms
             indicative of rapid clinical deterioration, in the opinion of the Investigator, prior
             to enrollment. These patients will become ineligible if rapid decline is observed
             during the Screening Period.
