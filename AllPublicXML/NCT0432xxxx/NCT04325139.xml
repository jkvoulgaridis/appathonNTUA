  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation is closely lined to the quality of colonoscopy, inadequate bowel
      preparation (IBP) could lead to higher miss rate of adenomas, patients' discomfort and higher
      health expense. For the patients with possible IBP before the examination, it may be better
      to cancel the colonoscopy and repeat bowel preparation through modified or enhanced
      strategies. This study aimed to externally validate the efficiency of a procedure-based model
      in predicting inadequate bowel preparation

    <description>Before colonoscopy, the following information was obtained by the colonoscopists through asking patients: the characteristics of last stool, the time of drinking first dose of laxative, the time of first defecation, the time of drinking last dose of laxative. The beginning time of colonoscopy was also recorded. During withdrawal phase, the quality of bowel preparation was evaluated based on BBPS scale.</description>
