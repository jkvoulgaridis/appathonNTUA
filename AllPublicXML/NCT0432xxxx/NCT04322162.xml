  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effectively identifying and treating risk factors for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic
      attack (TIA) is important to patients, their family members, and healthcare systems. While
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known risk factor for stroke and TIA that is present in
      more than 70% of stroke/TIA survivors, testing for OSA is infrequently performed for patients
      and within healthcare systems. The Addressing Sleep Apnea Post-Stroke/TIA (ASAP) study
      intends to improve rates of guideline-recommended OSA testing and treatment through local
      quality improvement initiatives (QI) conducted within and across 6 VA Medical Centers. ASAP
      will also determine the impact of these local QI initiatives on rates of OSA diagnosis, OSA
      treatment, treatment adherence, recurrent vascular events, and hospital readmissions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 11,000 Veterans present to a VAMC annually with an acute ischemic stroke or
      TIA. The cornerstone of secondary stroke/TIA prevention includes delivering timely,
      guideline-concordant vascular risk factor management. Over the past decade, OSA has been
      recognized as a potent, underdiagnosed, and inadequately treated cerebrovascular risk factor.
      OSA is very common among patients with stroke/TIA with a prevalence of 70-80%. Despite being
      highly prevalent, 70-80% of patients with OSA are neither diagnosed nor treated. Untreated
      OSA has been associated with poor outcomes among patients with cerebrovascular disease
      including higher mortality and worse functional status. The mainstay of OSA therapy is
      positive airway pressure (PAP). PAP reduces recurrent vascular events, improves neurological
      symptoms and functional status among stroke/TIA patients with OSA. The evidence favoring
      neurological recovery is strongest when interventions are applied early post-stroke/TIA.
      Guidelines recommend diagnosing and treating OSA for stroke and TIA patients; however, within
      VHA, very few stroke or TIA patients receive OSA screening. This guideline recommendation was
      informed in part by clinical trials utilizing an acute OSA assessment protocol developed and
      implemented by the investigators' group. To address the observed gap in care, the
      investigators propose a Hybrid Type I, randomized, stepped-wedge trial at 6 VAMCs to increase
      the rate of timely, guideline-concordant diagnosis and treatment of OSA among Veterans with
      ischemic stroke/TIA and thereby reduce recurrent vascular events and hospital readmissions.
      The investigators will identify matched control sites for each ASAP implementation site to
      examine temporal trends in outcomes among non-intervention sites. For example, the
      investigators will use administrative data to examine the use of polysomnography across
      stroke/TIA patients in the VA system and compare changes in matched controls versus the
      intervention sites on the diagnostic rate. The same adjustment approach will be used for ASAP
      intervention sites and for control sites.

    <description>PAP initiation within 30 days of presentation to the facility. For this outcome, the denominator will be patients diagnosed with OSA. Patients with a prior diagnosis of sleep apnea and those who die within 7 days of presentation will be excluded. Because the denominator in this secondary effectiveness measure includes the patients who are diagnosed with OSA, it is variable and depends on the primary effectiveness outcome of diagnostic rate.</description>

    <measure>Implementation Outcome - Adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured throughout active implementation and sustainability periods</time_frame>
    <description>Information regarding implementation of acute OSA diagnosis and treatment approaches will be collected at each site on an ongoing basis during brief phone calls every month between the local RA and/or local champion with members of the ASAP implementation team using the &quot;local adaptation real-time tracking system&quot; developed by a team of VA investigators. Local adaptations will also be recorded by local RAs in response to the monthly site assessments.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation Outcome - Champion Development</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured throughout active implementation and sustainability periods</time_frame>
    <description>Champion development will be evaluated quarterly through structured assessments of each champion using a 14-item champion measure developed by the PRIS-M QUERI and based on a validated instrument from business. During these quarterly assessments, two members of the ASAP implementation team plus the local RA will independently conduct a formative assessment of the champion, looking back over the preceding 3-month period and rating the champion in 14 different areas using a 5-point Likert scale.</description>

    <measure>External Facilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured throughout active implementation and sustainability periods</time_frame>
    <description>External facilitation changes over time based on the needs of the team. However, the core elements of relationship-building, methods training, communication, facilitating team-based problem solving, and monitoring performance over time will be preserved through external facilitation from a Lean Six Sigma Black belt experienced in stroke QI work and ASAP investigators experienced in implementation of post-stroke/TIA OSA programs. External facilitation activities will be recorded and will later be classified by type of contact, topic, and dose/duration.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Audit and Feedback</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured throughout active implementation and sustainability periods</time_frame>
    <description>To support the sites' use of data, the local teams will receive explicit training in team-based reflecting &amp; evaluating, goal-setting, and planning. Meeting as a group, local teams will be encouraged to formally ask and answer questions like: &quot;How are we doing?&quot; &quot;Are we where we want to be?&quot; &quot;What performance goals do we want to set as targets?&quot; &quot;What do we need to do to achieve our goals?&quot; &quot;How will we know how far or how close we are to hitting our targets?.&quot; Data usage will be monitored by the web-based data platform known as the ASAP &quot;hub.&quot;</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sustainability - mixed methods analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured throughout sustainability period</time_frame>
    <description>The sustainability analysis will include: a comparison of the change in the diagnostic rate from the baseline data period to the sustainability period. This will be obtained from the multilevel models as described for the Aim 1 analysis. The investigators will explore whether sites that use HST as their primary diagnostic approach, that continue to actively review their audit and feedback data, and that have champions who continue to engage with systems redesign demonstrate the greatest program sustainability.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sustainability - Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured prior to and at the end of active implementation period and at the end of the sustainability period</time_frame>
    <description>Those agreeing to participate will receive a link to complete the Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT), an online tool which allows users to: (1) understand factors associated with sustainability; (2) assess the sustainability of a program; (3) review their sustainability report, and; (4) develop an action plan to enhance the chances of programmatic sustainability. This tool assesses the facility's overall capacity for sustainability and across the specific domains of: environmental support, funding stability, partnerships, organizational capacity, program adaptation, communications, and strategic planning. Reports are generated by this tool, ranking the facility from 1 (little to no extent) to 7 (to a great extent) and provides guidance on what areas can be addressed to maximize sustainability.</description>

    <description>This four-year stepped-wedge evaluation includes a total of 6 sites, where active implementation is initiated in 3 waves, each of which includes 2 sites. The project involves three phases at each of the six sites: two 7-month increments (total of 14 months) in the baseline phase, two 7 month increments in active implementation phase. The stepped-wedge design allows for 7 mutually exclusive, 7-month data periods. The baseline data period is the time prior to the date of the baseline site visit. The active implementation data period extends 14 months after the site visit. The stepped-wedge design allows site-level estimates of proportions on seven different cross-sectional samples. Thus, the investigators will have repeated information on each site. Here, &quot;arm&quot; 1 corresponds to Wave 1.</description>

    <description>The intervention program includes: (1) a systems redesign Virtual Collaborative, and; (2) data monitoring and is designed to aid each of the 6 participating VAMCs in developing, implementing, and evaluating the implementation of an acute OSA testing and treatment protocol for ischemic stroke/TIA patients. The sites will choose a diagnostic strategy (i.e., unattended polysomnography [PSG]/home sleep test [HST], in-laboratory PSG, direct to auto-titrating [auto]-PAP) and a therapeutic strategy (i.e., in-laboratory PAP titration, auto-PAP). The intervention will employ 4 implementation strategies: (1) local adaptation; (2) champions; (3) external facilitation, and; (4) audit and feedback.</description>

             admissions per year and have at least 1.0 FTE staff dedicated to systems redesign

               -  The sites were chosen because they are diverse in terms of geography and sleep
                  infrastructure

          -  Local site investigators and their care teams will identify patients eligible for the
             QI intervention, specifically patients with ischemic stroke/TIA without a prior

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  VAMCs were excluded if they had &lt;=50 stroke/TIA admissions per year and did not have
             at least 1.0 FTE staff dedicated to systems redesign

          -  Local site investigators and their care teams will prioritize the protection of
             patients from harm and use their clinical expertise in identifying patients who would
             not be candidates for PAP therapy

               -  e.g., palliative care/hospice, inability to use PAP therapy [e.g., orofacial
