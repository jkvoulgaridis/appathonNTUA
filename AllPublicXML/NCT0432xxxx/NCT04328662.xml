  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of ixazomib citrate
      (Ninlaro) to fulfill the regulatory authority's requirement of intensive drug monitoring
      (IDM) in Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional study in Chinese participants with RRMM, NDMM and
      non-myeloma who are undergoing or will receive at least one dose of ixazomib citrate. Data
      will be collected to assess safety information used in the real world, based on known risks
      and missing safety information.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. The data will be collected
      prospectively as part of routine clinical visits of participants. Participants will be
      assigned to one of the two observational cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Participants with RRMM

        -  Cohort 2: Participants with NDMM, RRMM, and Non-myeloma

      The multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall duration of study will be
      approximately 57 months. All participants will be followed up for 21 months unless withdrawal
      of Informed Consent Form, lost or death, whichever comes first.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
