      This phase I trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab before and after
      surgery in treating children and young adults with high grade glioma that has come back
      (recurrent) or is increasing in scope or severity (progressive). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the relative changes in cell cycle-related genetic signature of the tumor
      microenvironment post administration of neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo, ipilimumab and
      placebo, and nivolumab and ipilimumab in children and young adults with recurrent or
      progressive high grade glioma (HGG) when compared to a cohort of archived non-treated
      recurrent pediatric HGG samples.

      II. To characterize the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo,
      neoadjuvant ipilimumab and placebo, and neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by
      adjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab in children and young adults with recurrent or progressive
      HGG.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 6 month and 12 month overall survival (OS) in children and young adults
      with recurrent or progressive HGG treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo, ipilimumab
      and placebo, or nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by adjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      II. To determine the 6 month and 12 month progression-free survival (PFS) in children and
      young adults with recurrent or progressive HGG treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and
      placebo, ipilimumab and placebo, or nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by adjuvant nivolumab
      and ipilimumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure relative changes in interferon gamma associated genetic signature within the
      tumor microenvironment post administration of neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo, ipilimumab
      and placebo, or nivolumab and ipilimumab in children and young adults with recurrent or
      progressive HGG compared to archived non-treated recurrent pediatric HGG samples.

      II. To explore the correlation of interferon-gamma-associated genetic signature, cell
      cycle-related genetic signature and infiltrating T lymphocyte (TIL) density and clonality
      with clinical responses for each treatment arm.

      III. To measure TIL density post administration of neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo compared
      to neo-adjuvant ipilimumab and placebo, and neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab in children
      and young adults with recurrent or progressive HGG.

      IV. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) in children and young adults with recurrent
      or progressive HGG treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo, neoadjuvant ipilimumab and
      placebo, or neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by adjuvant ipilimumab and
      nivolumab.

      V. To evaluate the association between advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters
      (apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), relative cerebral
      blood volume (rCBV) on dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI, pre-contrast T1
      shortening on T1-weighed images, and/or magnetization transfer ratio with asymmetric analysis
      (MTRasym) on pH-weighted amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-echo planar
      imaging (EPI)) and tumor and peripheral blood immune responses.

      VI. To measure relative change in peripheral T-cell response and post administration of
      neo-adjuvant nivolumab and placebo, ipilimumab and placebo, or nivolumab and ipilimumab in
      children and young adults with recurrent or progressive HGG.

      VII. To measure PD-1 and PDL-1 expression by immunohistochemistry for children and young
      adults with recurrent or progressive HGG post neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo, neoadjuvant
      ipilimumab and placebo, or neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab, and evaluate the differences
      between the three arms as well as between each group and archived non-treated recurrent
      pediatric HGG samples.

      VIII. To explore the correlation of tumor mutational load with clinical response for children
      and young adults with recurrent or progressive HGG treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and
      placebo, neoadjuvant ipilimumab and placebo, or neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab followed
      by adjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab.

      recurrent or progressive HGG treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and placebo, neoadjuvant
      ipilimumab and placebo, or neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by adjuvant
      ipilimumab and nivolumab.

             this trial

          -  All assessments are to occur within 14 days of registration except where otherwise
             noted. The participant and their legal parent/guardian must be thoroughly informed
             about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule and required
             evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written informed
             consent must be obtained from the participant and legal parent/guardian prior to
             enrollment

             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation and 4 months after completion
             of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  MRI within 28 days prior to registration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an
             investigational device

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency

          -  Has tumor primarily localized to the brainstem or spinal cord

          -  Has presence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease or extracranial disease

          -  Has received systemic immunosuppressive treatments (such as methotrexate, chloroquine,
             azathioprine, etc.), aside from anti-neoplastic chemotherapy or systemic
             corticosteroids within six months of registration

          -  Participants with a concurrent condition requiring systemic treatment with either
             corticosteroids (&gt; 0.25 mg/kg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive
             medications within 14 days of start of study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids,
             and adrenal replacement steroid doses &gt; 0.25 mg/kg daily prednisone equivalent, are
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease

          -  Unable to taper steroids due to ongoing mass effect; a maximum dexamethasone dose of
             0.1 mg/kg/day is allowed, but preferably have been discontinued (inhaled or topical
             use of steroids is allowed)

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment
             within 3 years of registration. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone
             potentially curative therapy

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active non-infectious pneumonitis

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study therapy products

          -  Has a known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

               -  NOTE: Testing for HIV must be performed at sites where mandated locally

          -  Any prior positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating
             presence of virus, e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, Australia antigen)
             positive, or hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive (except if HCV-ribonucleic acid
             (RNA) negative)

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the participant to receive protocol therapy or
             interfere with interpretation of study results
