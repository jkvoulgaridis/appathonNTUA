  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AL2846 is a multi-target tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor with obvious selective to c-met,
      suggesting that its anti-tumor effect mainly inhibits the activation of key downstream
      oncogenic pathways by inhibiting expression of c-met, tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell
      migration.
