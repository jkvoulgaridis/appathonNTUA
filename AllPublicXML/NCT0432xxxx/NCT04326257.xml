  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase II trial of personalized immunotherapy in R/M HNSCC, gene expression of LAG3
      and CTLA4 by RNA seq will be determined to select the appropriate agent (Ipilimumab or
      Relatlimab) to add to Nivolumab in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M HNSCC) who have failed prior immunotherapy with anti-PD-1
      or PD-L1 mAb therapy. The agent, either Ipilimumab or Relatlimab will be chosen based on the
      highest relevant immune gene expression (CTLA4 or LAG-3) as long as the minimum difference
      required is met.

      In this Phase II non-randomized trial, n=40 eligible patients will have tumor tissue (core or
      excisional/incisional) for gene expression of LAG3 and CTLA4 via RNA seq per OmniSeq Immune
      Report Card to determine which drug (either Relatlimab or Ipilimumab) will be added to
      Nivolumab for treatment. The patient will then receive the prescribed therapy continuously
      for up to 24 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks of treatment). The drug to be added to Nivolumab will
      be based on which relevant gene has the highest expression as long as the minimum difference
      required is met. If the minimum difference is not met than a patient will be randomized to
      either Nivolumab plus Relatlimab or Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab.

      The patient will then receive the prescribed therapy continuously for up to 24 cycles (1
      cycle = 4 weeks of treatment) with repeat imaging prior to every 3rd cycle until progression
      of disease. Response, evaluated by RECIST 1.1, with modifications to allow for continued
      therapy until progressive disease is confirmed if the patient is clinically stable, will be
      used in the trial. If the patient has confirmed progression the patient may be eligible to
      undergo a second biopsy and second treatment on trial. If these criteria are met the patient
      will then be treated with this new combination with repeat imaging prior to every 3rd cycle
      as per initial treatment, until progression of disease.

             pregnancy within 1 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will
             be required.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 1 methods of birth
             control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 5

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. SCC of salivary gland origin or cutaneous SCC of the head and neck. HNSCC of unknown
             origin ARE eligible.

          2. Patients who received Ipilimumab or Relatlimab in the recurrent/metastatic setting
             will be excluded.

          3. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational

          5. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, or targeted small molecule therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier
             (alopecia is an exception). Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, ototoxicity,

             rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid
             injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable

             cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment based on the discretion of the PI.
             When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be
             conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are &lt; 2 x
             ULN, the subject may undergo a cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment,
             based on the discretion of the PI.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
