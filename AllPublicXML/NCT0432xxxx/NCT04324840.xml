  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study CC-90010-GBM-002 is for newly diagnosed WHO Grade IV glioblastoma to determine the
      safety and tolerability and evaluate escalating doses of the investigational drug CC-90010
      when combined with standard of care treatment temozolomide (TMZ) with or without radiotherapy
      (RT).

      The standard of care for ndGBM includes surgical resection to the extent that is safely
      feasible, followed by RT plus concomitant TMZ chemotherapy, and up to 6 months of adjuvant
      TMZ. The study also aims to determine whether the addition of CC-90010 can control the
      disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will initially explore escalating oral doses
      of CC-90010 in combination with adjuvant TMZ to estimate the MTD (Maximum tolerated dose)
      and/or the RP2D (recommended Phase 2 Dose) of CC-90010 as adjuvant therapy. After two dose
      escalation levels (or earlier as decided by the Safety Review Committee ) are assessed as
      safe and tolerated in the Adjuvant Therapy dose escalation, the Concomitant Therapy dose
      escalation will start, exploring escalating oral doses of CC-90010 in combination with
      concomitant TMZ+RT, to estimate the MTD and/or the RP2D of CC-90010 as concomitant therapy.

      The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010
      administered at or below the MTD determined for the Adjuvant Therapy and the Concomitant
      Therapy in Part A, in expansion cohorts of approximately 20-30 evaluable subjects each, in
      order to further define the RP2D. Parts A and B will consist of three periods: Screening,
      Treatment, and Follow-up periods.

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
