  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neladenoson bialanate is currently under clinical development for a condition in which the
      heart has trouble pumping blood through the body (chronic heart failure). Liver impairment is
      a condition in which the liver is not working as well as they should. The goal of the study
      is to learn more about the safety of neladenoson bialanate, how it is tolerated and the way
      the body absorbs, distributes and excretes the study dug given as a single oral dose
      neladenoson bialanate in participants with liver impairment and healthy participants matched
      for age-, gender-, and weight

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
