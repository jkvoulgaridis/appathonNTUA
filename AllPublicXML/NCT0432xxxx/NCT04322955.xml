  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of immunotherapy nivolumab and the
      targeted therapy cabozantinib prior to removal of the kidney, will increase the number
      subjects who are without any visible kidney cancer in their body at some point during the
      course of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with metastatic kidney cancer are usually treated with medications to slow the growth
      of the cancer. In addition, people who still have the kidney where the cancer started may
      have the kidney removed during the course of treatment in order to decrease the amount of
      tumor in the body. This surgery is referred to as a cytoreductive nephrectomy. In the current
      study, nivolumab is being administered in combination with cabozantinib. Both of these drugs
      are FDA approved medications for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Previous studies
      have demonstrated that these two medications can be combined together without significantly
      increasing the side effects beyond what is expected from each medicine individually. The
      combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer is an
      investigational regimen and not FDA approved for the treatment of kidney cancer.

    <description>All study participants will receive the same study medications, cabozantinib and nivolumab. The study drug, nivolumab, will be administered through an IV infusion every 4 weeks and cabozantinib will be administered orally daily. Initially participants will receive study treatment for 12 weeks. The cabozantinib will then be stopped prior to the nephrectomy. The first three to six subjects (group 1) will have the cabozantinib held for three weeks prior to removal of the kidney. If there are no unexpected side effects from the surgery, then future subjects (group 2) will have the cabozantinib stopped for two weeks prior to the nephrectomy.</description>
