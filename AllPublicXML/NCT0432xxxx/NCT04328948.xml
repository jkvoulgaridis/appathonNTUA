  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to investigate whether modified chemoradiotherapy with elective nodal
      irradiation reduces the locoregional recurrence that cannot be completely resected by salvage
      endoscopic resection and preserve esophagus without compromising overall survival.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or basaloid
             cell carcinoma.

          2. All lesions located in the thoracic esophagus. Secondary lesions with an absolute
             indication for endoscopic resection (EMR/ESD) may not be confined to the thoracic
             esophagus.

          3. Clinical N0M0 with cervical to abdominal contrast-enhanced CT.

          4. The deepest lesion is diagnosed as cT1b (SM1 / SM2 / SM3) with upper gastrointestinal
             endoscopy. If it is difficult to differentiate cT1a-MM and cT1b-SM1 clinically, the
             wall depth is diagnosed as cT1b-SM1.

          5. Aged 20 years and older.

          6. ECOG Performance status 0 or 1.

          7. No previous therapy against esophageal cancer except for complete resection by EMR/ESD
             with either pT1a-LPM (pM2) / pT1a-MM (M3) disease or pT1a-MM (M3) disease without
             vascular infiltration.

          8. No history of radiotherapy for the neck, chest, and upper abdomen for any cancers. No
             chemotherapy or hormone therapy with less than 3 years of disease-free interval for
             any cancers.

          9. Major organ function is preserved. 1) WBC&lt;=12,000/mm3 2) ANC&gt;=1,500/mm3 3) Hb&gt;=10.0 g
             /dL 4) PLT&gt;=10,000/mm3 5) T-bil&lt;=1.5 mg /dL 6) AST&lt;=100 IU/L 7) ALT&lt;=100 IU/L 8)
             SpO2&gt;=95% 9) Ccr&gt;=60 mL/min

         10. Patients do not have a preference to receive a surgical resection as an initial
             therapy after receiving explanations.

         11. Written informed consent is obtained.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Simultaneous or metachronous (within 5 years) double cancers, except for intramucosal
             tumor curable with local therapy.

          2. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          3. Fever over 38 degrees Celsius

          4. Female during pregnancy, within 28 days of post parturition, or during lactation. Male
             who wants a partner's pregnancy.

          5. Psychological disorder, which is difficult to participate in this clinical study.

          6. Receiving continuous systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressant treatment.

          7. Positive for HBs antigen or HIV antigen.

          8. Diabetes mellitus, which is uncontrollable with continuous use of insulin or
             hypoglycemic agents.

          9. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension.

         10. History of unstable angina pectoris within three weeks or myocardial infarction within
             six months before registration.

         11. Uncontrolled valvular disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic
             cardiomyopathy.

         12. Severe emphysema, interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary fibrosis based on chest CT.

         13. With a history of cerebrovascular disorder within 6 months.

         14. Drug allergy for iodic drugs.
