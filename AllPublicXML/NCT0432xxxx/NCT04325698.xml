  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of
      PF-06439535 (CN) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizimab sourced
      from the European Union (bevacizumab-EU) with paclitaxel and carboplatin in Chinese
      participants with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in the first-line treatment setting.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>1. Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Week 19</measure>
    <time_frame>25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ORR refers to percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 19 of the study in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 which was subsequently confirmed by Week 25. A participant achieved CR if both target and non-target lesions achieved CR, no new lesions; achieved PR if target lesions achieved CR or PR, non-target lesions were assessed as non-CR/non-PD (non-progressive disease), indeterminate or missing, and no new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions, normal nodes (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: &gt;= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target lesions, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels and all lymph nodes must be normal in size; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or combination SCLC and NSCLC. Squamous-cell tumors and
             mixed adenosquamous carcinomas.

          -  Evidence of a tumor that compresses or invades major blood vessels or tumor cavitation
