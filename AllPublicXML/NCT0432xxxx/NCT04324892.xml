  <brief_summary>

      Objectives:

      To elucidate the effects of achieving sustained simple disease activity index (SDAI)
      remission in the progression of joint space outcomes using high-resolution peripheral
      quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA), and what the
      independent effects of erosion /JSW progression are on patient's function.

      Hypothesis to be tested: Effective control of inflammation in ERA patients who can achieve
      sustained SDAI remission will have less progression of joint damage then patients who cannot
      achieve sustained SDAI remission.

      Design and subjects: 110 consecutive ERA patients will participate in this 1-year
      prospective, hospital-based, cohort study.

      Study instruments Metacarpophalangeal joints 2-4 will be measured using HR-pQCT Interventions
      All participants will receive 1-year tight-control treatment according to a standardized
      protocol aiming at SDAI remission. Physical function will be assessed by Health Assessment
      Questionnaire (HAQ) at each visit. HR-pQCT and radiographs will be performed at baseline, 6
      (HR-pQCT only) and 12 months. Quantitative analysis of joint space width (JSW) and volume,
      erosion number and volume, and marginal osteosclerosis (bone apposition at the base of the
      erosion) will be evaluated by HR-pQCT. Radiographic progression will be scored using van der
      Heijde-Sharp (SvdH) score.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome is the change in JSW and volume over a period of 12
      months. Main secondary outcomes include changes in the i) number and size of erosion, ii)
      SvdH score and iii) HAQ over a period of 12 months.

      Expected results: Patients who can achieve sustained SDAI remission will have less joint
      damage and functional loss compared

        Starting from July 2020, all new cases referrals to the rheumatology clinic of the Prince
        of Wales Hospital (PWH) and four other regional hospitals in Hong Kong will be screened by
        a research assistant. Patients referred as RA, possible RA or undifferentiated arthritis
        will be contacted through telephone. Patients with at least 1 tender and swollen joint and
        with duration of symptoms less than 2 years and with no previous use of DMARDs will be
        invited to a screening visit at the early arthritis clinic of the PWH within 2 weeks of the
        referral, where they will be formally assessed by a rheumatologist.
