  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a kind of clonal myeloid tumor. The major manifestation is
      decrease of tri-lineages of blood due to ineffective and abnormal hematopoiesis, some of
      which can progress to acute myeloid leukemia. According to the international prognosis
      scoring system (IPSS) of MDS, about 10% low/intermediate risk-1 MDS patients have severe
      thrombocytopenia (PLT &lt; 30 × 109/ L). These patients have both decreased platelet count and
      platelet dysfunction, resulting in a high risk of bleeding. In the new prognostic score, such
      as IPSS-r, the degree of thrombocytopenia is regarded as a poor prognostic factor. Platelet
      transfusion is mainly used in the treatment of this kind of patients. The indications of
      transfusion include bleeding events or severe platelet count reduction (&lt; 10 × 109 / L).
      However, platelet transfusion can only lead to short-term platelet elevation, while repeated
      transfusion increases the possibility of infection and ineffective platelet transfusion. TPO
      is a newly discovered hematopoietic promoting factor, which can specifically bind to the TPO
      receptor on the cell and participate in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation,
      maturation and division of megakaryocyte to form functional platelet. The efficacy and safety
      of the TPO receptor agonists eltrombopag and romiplostim in the treatment of thrombocytopenia
      in low/intermediate risk-1 MDS patients have been successfully confirmed in foreign studies.
      Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is also a kind of a TPO receptor agonists which is
      highly specific platelet stimulating factor. At present, there is no large report on the
      application of rhTPO in such patients. The purpose of this study is to explore the short-term
      and long-term therapeutic effect and safety of rhTPO on low/intermediate risk-1 MDS patients.
