  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic intensification followed by an autograft of hematopoietic stem cells is a
      standard of care for young patients with myeloma from the first line and for lymphoma from
      the second or third line of treatment. This procedure remains toxic in the short and medium
      term with significant mortality and morbidity: the average mortality varies from 1.4 to 5%.
      The causes of death are linked to a severe infection, visceral bleeding or vital organ
      failure. This risk of mortality is partly correlated with sarcopenia.

      Sarcopenia is defined by the reduction of muscle mass and strength. It was first described in
      the elderly and classified as geriatric syndrome such as dementia, falls or frailty. It
      varies from 5 to 13% between 60 and 70 years and between 11 and 50% beyond 80 years and is
      classified as primitive, that is to say related to age It can however be secondary to
      neoplasia. This event has been described in patients with hematologic malignancies during
      chemotherapy and can reach 55% of patients in the elderly. It is proportional to the
      intensity of the treatments. It emerges as an independent prognostic factor which is
      detrimental to survival in these patients. Physical exercise combined with nutritional
      support could reduce it.

      The positive impact of adapted physical activity (APA) has been shown in numerous
      publications on reducing the incidence and risk of relapse for several cancers (breast, colon
      prostate). It is less obvious in hematology in view of studies published on APA with
      different physical activity programs depending on the time of the intervention or according
      to the type, duration and intensity.

      The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of an APA program in patients
      requiring an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It is expected that the program
      will have a protective effect on the appearance of induced sarcopenia and on the
      complications related to the procedure in the short and medium term regardless of the
      hematology center for patients receiving intensive treatment with support for autologous
      hematopoietic stem cells.

      This is a feasibility study.
