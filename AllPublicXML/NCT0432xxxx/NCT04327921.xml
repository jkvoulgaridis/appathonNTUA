  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective antiretroviral therapy has led to an increased lifespan for persons living with HIV
      (PLWH), when diagnosed early and engaged in care. This transition to HIV as a chronic illness
      has resulted in cancer being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in PLWH. The
      increased risk of cancer is due in part to a high prevalence of risk factors for cancer —
      most notably tobacco use. Smoking prevalence is substantially higher in PLWH (40%) compared
      with the general population (15%) and is associated with increased rates of lung cancers, and
      other malignancies. Furthermore, combined data from three national surveys showed that the
      proportion of deaths attributed to AIDS-defining cancers decreased from 2000 to 2010, while
      the proportion of deaths attributed to non-AIDS-related cancers increased significantly over
      the same period of time. Smoking cessation studies in PLWH have demonstrated disappointing
      outcomes, with low quit rates, poor adherence to therapy, and a lack of sustained abstinence.
      In an HIV and smoking review, it was suggested that research develop focused interventions
      that targets: 1) adherence to smoking cessation medications, 2) self-confidence for quitting,
      and 3) social support for smoking cessation. The investigators are proposing is specifically
      designed to address these 3 targets by using peer navigators to facilitate access to
      effective smoking treatments and to support abstinence. This study is highly innovative in
      its application of peer navigators to improve HIV-positive smokers' access to and utilization
      of existing resources to improve smoking cessation outcomes. The proposed study will provide
      initial evidence of whether targeting mechanisms of behavior change (self-efficacy and social
      support) during a quit attempt using peer navigators is effective at improving outcomes. If
      demonstrated to be successful, it has significant implications for the transformation of
      current clinical approaches to smoking cessation in HIV clinics. This approach could then be
      widely implemented to improve outcomes in this group of smokers.

      Aims - The specific aims are to examine: (1) the feasibility, acceptability, and initial
      efficacy of Peer Navigation for Social Support - Smoking in a 24-week randomized pilot study;
      (2) to compare the effect of Peer Navigation for Social Support, relative to standard care,
      on mechanisms thought to underlie smoking abstinence in HIV-positive smokers.

      Methodology - The investigators will adapt an existing, highly effective peer navigation
      training program to increase engagement in care within the HIV clinic. The peer navigator for
      smoking cessation will be a former daily smoker who quit smoking 1-2 years ago and has
      remained smoke-free. The investigators will train the peer navigator, enroll 6 HIV-positive
      smokers to test the intervention, and finalize the protocol. The investigators will refine
      the protocol based on feedback from the peer navigator, the 6 participants, and the study
      nurses. Next, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized trial (N = 72) to test the
      feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of peer navigation in a randomized, 2-group,
      repeated measures design. The investigators will randomize 36 HIV-positive smokers to each
      condition: Peer Navigation or standard care. Assessments will be collected at baseline, and
      at 4-, 12-, and 24-weeks.

      Participant Population - Participants for this study will include 78 participants recruited
      from Providence, Rhode Island.

    <intervention_model_description>Once the baseline interview is complete, the principal investigator, who is not involved in conducting assessments, will randomize eligible participants to one of two study conditions. Urn randomization will be used to ensure the groups are balanced on gender and Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score. The Research Assistant will not be informed of treatment condition assignment. All participants will be scheduled for a week 1 session with a study nurse within one week of the baseline appointment. The nurse will use a detailed counseling manual to ensure standardization of treatment delivery.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>36 HIV-positive smokers will have a 30-minute session with the study nurse to discuss smoking cessation. They will also discuss the importance of social support for quitting and the role of a Peer Navigator. Those participants who set a quit date will choose medication/s in collaboration with the nurse and/or physician. The Peer Navigator will be introduced and will reinforce adherence to medication. The Peer Navigator will ensure that the patient picks up the medication, and will help to manage side effects via physician/nurse consultation. The Peer Navigator will provide social support for quitting via weekly phone calls for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>36 HIV-positive smokers will receive standard care. Participants will meet for a 30-minute session with a study nurse. They will receive counseling based on the 5A's. The nurse will ask about current smoking habits, advise the participant to quit, assess readiness to quit, and assist by providing resources (community programs, Quit line phone number). The nurse will calculate Lung Age which will serve as a motivation tool to encourage smokers to quit. Those willing to set a quit date will be instructed to call their physician for cessation medication and will provided with the National Cancer Institute self-help pamphlet. Those participants not willing to set a quit date will be instructed to contact their physician when they are ready.</description>
