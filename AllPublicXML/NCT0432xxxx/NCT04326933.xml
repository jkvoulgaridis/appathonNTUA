    <textblock>
      CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with unique biological and clinical features.

      CML accounts for 15_20% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemias among adults. CML can present
      in three clinical phases : chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast phase.

      CML is characterized by prodction of a breakpoint cluster region abelson(BCR-ABL) fusion
      protein with ABL kinase activity. This is due to reciprocal translocation between chromosome
      9 and 22.

      Imatinib &amp; Nilotinib, an ABL kinase inhibitors, which has revolutionized the CML therapy, are
      a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

      The aim of the study is to determine the changes of liver enzymes and electrolytes in
      relation to hematologic response during treatment period.
