  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of immunotherapy
      (checkpoint inhibitor therapy) in advanced bladder cancer when given intermittently. An
      unanswered question with the use of CPI (checkpoint inhibitor) is the duration of therapy
      required for optimal clinical benefit. In the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable
      toxicities, there are currently no specified criteria for treatment discontinuation.
      Strategies to reduce toxicity and maximize benefit require investigation. Thus, novel dosing
      schedules, early discontinuation considerations, and biomarkers of response are needed to
      identify patients who can sustain disease regression while off of therapy.

      A phase II study design to investigate the use of any CPI on an intermittent dosing schedule.
      Patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC) who treatment refractory or cisplatin
      ineligible will receive CPI of choice as per standard dosing. Patients who have initial
      &gt;/=10% tumor burden reduction will discontinue the CPI until they experience a &gt;/=20% disease
      progression following 24 weeks +/- 4 weeks of immunotherapy, at which time CPI therapy will
      be restarted.

      All patients who do not meet criteria for the CPI intermittent phase of the study will be
      treated until unacceptable toxicity or RECIST-defined PD. Patients with RECIST-defined PD may
      continue CPI therapy at the discretion of the treating MD. These patients will continue with
      normal imaging every 12 weeks. In cases where a patient is continued on therapy after PD and
      develops subsequent PD (&gt; 20% increase in sum of target lesions compared to the initial PD
      tumor measurements, the patient will come off study).

      Patients who meet criteria for the intermittent phase (i.e., have &gt;/=10% tumor burden
      reduction) will not receive CPI therapy. Imaging will continue per protocol (every 12 weeks
      from the initial date they stopped CPI therapy). Patients who have RECIST defined PD on the
      intermittent phase should reinitiate CPI therapy. Patients who have a subsequent decrease in
      tumor burden &gt;/=10% can then restart CPI therapy as per protocol.

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria. PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm and the appearance of ≥1 new lesions is also considered PD.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

          -  Patients are excluded if they have known HIV/AIDS.

          -  Major surgery (eg, cystectomy) less than 28 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 7 days prior to
             the first dose of study drug. Inhaled steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses &gt;

             interpretation of safety results.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because animal studies have demonstrated
             that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.
             Breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may be
             excreted in human milk and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
             infants.
