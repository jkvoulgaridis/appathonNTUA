  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease affecting millions of Canadians. Exercise
      is a core treatment for knee OA, and is advocated by all clinical guidelines. However, the
      safety of recreational running in the presence of knee OA is unclear. There are no studies
      available to provide direct data to appropriately inform runners and clinicians whether
      running should be advocated for joint health. Our research study will address this gap.
