      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of adult autologous
      mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as MSCs) in patients with osteoarthritic knee and compare
      to intra articular injection of Synvisc-One.

      Study Participants:

      This study will involve patients affected by osteoarthritis who comply with the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. 30 patients, between the age of 18 and &lt;65, will be enrolled in the study
      and randomized into three groups to receive either an injection of MSCs, hyaluronic acid (HA)
      or no injection.

      Type of Study: This is a randomized control study.

      Treatment method: Each patient will randomly be assigned to one of the following treatment
      groups:

      Group A) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) Group B) Hyaluronic acid (HA) Group C) No injection

      Treatment:

      Group A) Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treatment (MSCs) The MSCs treatment group patients
      will receive an intra-articular injection of a mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) suspension in the
      affected knee.

      The treatment will be carried out after the patient has received a blood test and clinically
      evaluated at T0.

      T0: Beginning of the study, blood test and bone marrow aspiration. T30: Intra-articular
      injection of MSCs T44: Adverse events follow up 2 weeks after intra-articular injection (by
      phone)

      Group B) Hyaluronic acid (HA) The patient will be given a single intra-articular injection of
      hyaluronic acid sodium salt, Synvisc-One (TRB Chemedica Ltd.) The hyaluronic acid will be
      purchased for the patient from the manufacturer or from the pharmacy of the hospital.

      The intra-articular injection will be carried out after the patient has received a clinical
      evaluation at T0.

      T0: Beginning of the study T30: Intra-articular injection of Synvisc-One (HA) T44: Adverse
      events follow up 2 weeks after intra-articular injection (by phone)
