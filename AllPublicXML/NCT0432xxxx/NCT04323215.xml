  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate if a web-based digital support system aiming to replacing or
      complement standardized pediatric behavioural obesity treatment. The hypothesis is that a
      digital system of communication between the family and the clinic can generate improved
      treatment results (change in BMI SDS) and reduce the number of missed visits.

    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity treatment is time consuming for both the health care system, and for the
      involved families. There is an association between the intensity and the outcome of
      treatment.

      In this study all children who start treatment for childhood obesity will use a digital
      support system as a complement to behavioral treatment. The digital support system includes
      daily weighing on scales that do not show any digits, linked to a mobile app where weight
      development is shown as a moving average in the form of BMI standard deviation score (SDS).
      The app also provides an individual target curve visualizing the expected weight journey.
      Weight in growing children is complex to interpret why BMI SDS is used. Objective data from
      scale are automatically transferred to the database and the clinic and the family have direct
      contact with the clinic via the app.

      The evaluation will be carried out when approximately 120 children have had the opportunity
      to be treated with the support system for one year. The results will be compared with a
      matched control group from the BORIS childhood obesity treatment register.
