      â€¢ To evaluate the results of Metzenbaum 's technique in correction of the Caudal end septal
      deviation on nasal airway obstruction
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deviation of Nasal septum in different parts may have various functional or aesthetic effects
      . The etiology of a deviated septum is generally congenital, but may also be as a result of
      trauma or iatrogenic causes. Most important is the Caudal septal deviation which narrows the
      airway and impairs major mechanisms supporting the tip, leading to tip-ptosis and airway
      collapse. .The correction of caudal septal deviations can be a challenging problem so many
      techniques have been described and tested to correct caudal septal deflections . Attempts to
      correct nasal septal deformities were described in the medical literature as early as the
      late 19th century , and till now there is not one specific technique that is agreed upon by
      surgeons worldwide.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the caudal end deviation of the nasal septum corrected is measured by photographic documentation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs will be taken in the 6 dimensional (frontal,basal, lateral and oblique) views of the nose at two points ,First photograph set will be taken in preoperative period. The second photograph set will taken at six months follow up. Both these photographs will be shown to the patient and he/she was asked to give a score to rate the difference in appearance on a 4 point scale 4 point scale for evaluating postoperative outcome
Little/no photographic evidence of residual caudal septal deviation.
Marked improvement but was still detectable by careful observation.
Mild improvement/not improved.
Made worse after surgical intervention.</description>

    <description>The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale score is a questionnaire that each patient will take to compare the symptoms of air way obstruction improvement after surgery . the patients will take it at two points , first in pre - operative assessment and second in post operative follow up after 2 month</description>
