  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality rate of sepsis remains as high as 30 to 40%. Early diagnosis and treatment of
      patients with sepsis reduce mortality significantly. The most commonly used biomarkers in
      clinical practice are C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). In terms of exploring
      new diagnostic tools of sepsis, monocyte distribution width (MDW) was first reported in 2017.
      It was reported as part of the white blood cell (WBC) differential count. MDW greater than 20
      and abnormal WBC count together were reported to provide a satisfactory accuracy. The area
      under curve (AUC) in predicting sepsis-2 is 0.852. It was proposed as a novel diagnostic tool
      of sepsis in the emergency setting. Nonetheless, the performance of MDW compared with the
      conventional biomarkers remained unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic
      accuracy of MDW and PCT on sepsis in the emergency department.

        Based on a target of 75% sensitivity and lower limit of 65%, a minimum of 63 (will target
        100) septic patients would be required. Higher numbers may be enrolled in the study to
        ensure adequate representation of sepsis cases. Given the estimated prevalence of the
        disease in the emergency department population (5-10%%), the number of non-septic patients
        is predicted to be significantly higher than septic. Based on the estimated prevalence of
        subjects who present and have blood draw, a minimum of 100 non-septic cases will be
        collected.
