  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alignment of the prosthesis with the stump is performed through the socket. Good socket stump
      fit provides near-normal posture and weight-transfer pattern. It also ensures that the walk
      is painless and low-energy. Recently, studies have been carried out to use 3D printers in
      socket production. 3D method is accepted as an effective and reliable method in prosthetic
      socket production. The purpose of this study is to compare the pressures distrubution in the
      sockets produced by conventional and 3D scanners and printers in the transtibial amputee.
