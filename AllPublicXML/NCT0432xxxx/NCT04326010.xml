      Primary objective

      The primary objective of this study is to characterize survivorship of the Echo Bi-Metric
      Microplasty stem in unilateral or bilateral primary total hip arthroplasty at 5 years
      postoperative.

      Secondary Objectives

      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events over
      time to 10 years postoperative.

      Clinical, functional, radiographic, and quality of life outcomes will be assessed over time
      to 7 years postoperative. Clinical Outcomes will be measured using the Harris Hip Score and
      Physical Exam form. Radiographs will be reviewed to assess alignment, radiolucencies and
      other radiographic parameters. Health status and functional ability will be measured using
      the EQ-5D-3L and the UCLA Activity score.

        The study population will comprise a cohort of a minimum of 200, and no more than 225, hips
        enrolled across up to 10 centers from subjects who require primary total hip arthroplasty.
        Subjects must be willing and able to attend required follow-up appointments. Candidates who
        express interest in study participation will undergo an informed consent procedure, be
        required to sign an IRB-approved informed consent with required HIPAA authorization1, and
        eligibility will be determined based upon the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

               -  Patient is skeletally mature

               -  Patient qualifies for primary unilateral or bilateral total hip arthroplasty
                  based on physical exam and medical history including at least one of the
                  following:

               -  Osteoarthritis

               -  Patient has no history of previous total hip arthroplasty or arthrodesis of the
                  affected hip joint(s)

               -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations as
