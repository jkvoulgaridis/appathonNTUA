  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease is the most common neurodegenerative brain disease that causes cognitive
      impairment in the elderly but also behavioral and psychological symptoms. Among these
      symptoms, agitation is one of the most dangerous because it put the patient and their
      caregivers in danger. Sleep disorders can be the cause of many psychiatric symptoms leading
      directly or indirectly to agitation. Music therapy is the non-drug therapy which has been
      shown to be the most effective in managing agitation and sleep disorders. With the MAGE
      protocol, the investigators propose to take care of behavioral disorders in severe Alzheimer
      patients living in nursing home through sequences of music therapy (stimulation, relaxation)
      automatically initiated by an actigraph that will detect sleep disorders. These subjects will
      be exposed for 2 weeks over a month. Behavioral and sleep disorders will be evaluated
      objectively by actigraphy but also by standardized scales, as the others neuropsychiatric
      symptoms found classically in this disease. Thanks to this project, the investigators hope to
      improve the quality of life of these patients by preventing them from putting themselves in
      danger, by reducing their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their use of medication, which has
      often deleterious side effect and also by reducing the workload of caregivers.
