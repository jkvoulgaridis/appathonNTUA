  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, post-market study to evaluate the clinical utility of
      IRIS, a 3D anatomical modeling software, with standard CT scans during pre-operative planning
      and intra-operative navigation for nephrectomy. The study will be conducted over the course
      of 21-24 months and enroll approximately 60-120 subjects.

    <description>Intuitive's IRIS 1.0 system is a software only device and service intended to create and deliver segmented image studies (3D anatomical models) based on patients computed tomography (CT) scans. It is intended as software for preoperative surgical planning, and as software for the intraoperative display of the aforementioned multidimensional digital images.</description>
