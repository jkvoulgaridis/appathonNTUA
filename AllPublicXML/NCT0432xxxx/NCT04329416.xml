  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The authors developed a formula for predicting the accurate depth of DLT insertion into the
      appropriate bronchus based on height as follows [The predicted insertion depth of left DLT
      (cm) equals 0.249 × (BH)0.916] [R]. That pilot study showed comparable correlations between
      five formulae [Brodsky et al, Bahk and Oh R, Takita et al, Chow et al, Lin]. However, that
      formula developed has not been validated yet.

      We hypothesized that previously published formula would predict the accurate depth of
      left-sided DLT insertion. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of this formula to estimate
      the optimum insertion depth of the DLT using a flexible bronchoscope and decrease the
      incidence of DLT displacement into the appropriate bronchus, the need for bronchoscopic
      adjustment, and complications including soreness of throat and mucosal injury.

      Accurate placement of the double-lumen tube [DLT], the commonly used tool to provide one-lung
      ventilation during thoracic surgery, is a real challenge for the thoracic anesthesiologists.
      Optimal DLT depth, defined as the blue endobronchial cuff below the carina, would decrease
      the incidence of obstructing the trachea and the contralateral bronchus (Brodsky).
      Additionally, deep insertion of the bronchial cuff of the DLT would obstruct the upper lobe
      bronchus (Brodsky). The careful adjustment of the depth and optimal positioning of the DLT
      using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope need a skilled anesthesiologist to reduce the time
      to DLT intubation. (Charles D. Boucek et al)

      There are several methods have been described to predict the proper depth of DLT insertion.
      Chow et al. documented the validity of the developed formula based on the
      clavicular-to-carinal distance of trachea and height in 78% of patients studied. Brodsky et
      al. demonstrated that a height-and-gender-based formula could predict the depth of DLT
      insertion. Liu et al. reported an accurate depth of DLT insertion in 90% of patients studied
      measuring the distance between the vocal cord and carina according to the chest CT.
