  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery of the knee is a very common procedure which can be very painful and sufficient
      postoperative pain treatment is often problematic. The aim of this work was to study the
      effects of supplementation of intra-articular bupivacaine dexmedetomidine with lidocaine 5%
      patch after arthroscopic knee surgery under general anesthesia and its role in improving
      quality of anesthesia.
