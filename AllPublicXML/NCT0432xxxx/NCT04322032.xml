      This study is a randomized, open-label, fasted, single dose, crossover study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic profiles and safety of CKD-389 in healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      To healthy subjects of thirty-four (34), following treatments are administered dosing in each
      period and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days. Reference drug(D759 and D308), Test
      drug(CKD-389) Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected up to 48 hrs. The pharmacokinetic
      characteristics and safety are assessed.
