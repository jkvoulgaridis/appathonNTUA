    <textblock>
      Investigators postulate that the metabolic effects of LSG would be augmented with the use of
      liraglutide leading to additional excess weight loss, improved glucose homeostasis, decreased
      intrapancreatic and intrahepatic fat than either of them individually. However there are no
      studies till date which have evaluated the combined effects of two modalities of weight loss
      on the above mentioned parameters. This study plans to compare the effects of liraglutide in
      post- LSG obese patients in a placebo controlled design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various studies have shown that bariatric surgery is associated with significant durable
      weight loss with associated improvement in obesity related comorbidities and quality of life.
      The degree of effect on obesity related comorbidities depends on the bariatric surgery
      approach, typically classified as restrictive and/or malabsorptive effect. Data from
      International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Diseases states that most
      common surgical procedures being performed are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (45%), sleeve
      gastrectomy(37%), adjustable gastric banding(10%) and biliopancreatic division with or
      without duodenal switch(2.5%)5. . LSG is technically a simpler procedure compared to RYGB
      with lesser operative and long term nutritional complications. The mechanism for weight loss
      in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is gastric restriction and possible changes in gut
      hormones resulting from higher level of GLP-1, and lower levels of ghrelin, as a consequence
      of resection of gastric fundus.

      Therefore,investigators postulate that the metabolic effects of LSG would be augmented with
      the use of liraglutide leading to additional excess weight loss, improved glucose
      homeostasis, decreased intrapancreatic and intrahepatic fat than either of them individually.
      However there are no studies till date which have evaluated the combined effects of two
      modalities of weight loss on the above mentioned parameters. This study plans to compare the
      effects of liraglutide in post- LSG obese participants in a placebo controlled design.
