      The trial is a phase 2 randomised, open, non-inferiority within patient-controlled
      multi-centre trial.

      Male and female subjects with a diagnosis of Crohn´s Disease and a clinical indication for an
      MRE examination, who are at least 18 years of age and who provide a written informed consent,
      will be eligible for inclusion.

      The trial period will be up to 16 weeks and consists of 7 visits (see schedule of events).
      All patients who have attended at least 1 of the Magnetic Resonance Enterography
      (MRE)/Computerised Tomography Enterography (CTE) examinations should go through the end of
      treatment procedures at visit 7.

      Subjects will attend two examinations during the course of the trial:

        -  A CTE

        -  An MRE The Crohn's disease activity will be assessed radiologically on the MRE and CTE
           scans by identifying the presence and severity of a number of morphologic entities and
           dynamic signs in the SB and colon as described in the RCDAS.

      Additional evaluation of CD activity and disease complication on the MRE and CTE images will
      be performed using the CDMRIS scale and Lémann Index respectively

      The trial is a phase 2 randomised, open, non-inferiority within patient-controlled
      multi-centre trial.

      Patient recruitment will take place at 1 or more study centres by clinicians specialised in
      gastroenterology. MRE and CTE examinations will be performed at the department of Radiology
      at a hospital or private practise that performs radiology. Participating radiology department
      or private practice need to be certified to perform the examination at Skåne University
      Hospital, SUS, Malmö, Sweden.

      Male and female subjects with a diagnosis of CD and a clinical indication for an MRE
      examination, who are at least 18 years of age and who provide a written informed consent,
      will be eligible for inclusion.

      The trial period will be up to 16 weeks and consists of 7 visits (see schedule of events).
      All patients who have attended at least 1 of the MRE/CTE examinations should go through the
      end of treatment procedures at visit 7.

      Subjects interested in participating in the trial will be screened for eligibility at visit
      1. After receiving information about the trial according to the procedures for subject
      information and consent (see section 14.3) and found eligible according to the in-/exclusion
      criteria, patients will be included in the trial and randomised. After randomisation, the
      subject's demography, medical history and concomitant illness and medical treatment will be
      noted

      Subjects will attend two examinations during the course of the trial:

        -  A CTE

        -  An MRE The order in which the MRE and CTE-L is performed will be randomised. Date and
           time for the patient's MRE examination will be booked at the department of radiology
           when the subject have been randomised. The date of CTE examination will then be booked
           two to three weeks apart from the MRE, either before or after according to the
           randomisation, to ensure both a proper washout period of given medical compounds and a
           minimal risk of change in status of the disease.

      The Crohn's disease activity will be assessed radiologically on the MRE and CTE scans by
      identifying the presence and severity of a number of morphologic entities and dynamic signs
      in the SB and colon as described in the RCDAS.

      The radiologist assessment, according to the RCDAS, of the CTE and MRE examinations will be
      performed by the investigators specialised in abdominal imaging at the department of
      radiology. The radiologist assessment of one patient's CTE and MRE examinations will not be
      performed by the same investigator in order to avoid that one assessment influence the other.
      Appointment of assessor for each examination will be performed by randomisation.

      Pseudonymised assessment of CTE and MRE scans will be performed in batches of approximately 5
      scans. Patient identification details will be removed from the scans and replaced by a code
      and the scans will be saved in a separate archive. The assessor will not have access to the
      code list.

      After the completion of the trial, a blinded assessment of all pseudonymised images will be
      performed where the investigators assess the images initially assessed by the other
      investigator. The data will be used to document inter-reader variability.

      Additional evaluation of CD activity and disease complication on the MRE and CTE images will
      be performed using the CDMRIS scale and Lémann Index respectively once all subjects have
      completed the trial. The CDMRIS scale and Lémann Index are described below. All assessments
      of the CTE and MRE images will be performed by the investigators at the department of
      radiology. Only the principal investigator will assess images according to Lémann and CDMRIS.

      Other assessments:

      During the time the subjects drink the contrast agent prior to the MRE/CTE scan, they will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire assessing taste, smell, consistency, fullness and ability
      to swallow the contrast agent.

      The subjects will be contacted 2 days after the MRE and CTE examination for control of any
      potential AE and concomitant medication.

      Subjects' experience of anxiety level at the CTE and MRE examinations will be investigated by
      the use of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults questionnaires. The State
      questionnaire STAI-S consists of 20 statements that evaluate how respondents feel at the
      moment in terms of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry. The inventory might also be
      used to evaluate how respondents felt at a particular situation in the recent past. STAI-S
      has been found to be sensitive to changes in transitory anxiety. The Trait questionnaire
      STAI-T consist of 20 statements that evaluate how respondents feel in general and react to
      stressful situations. The subjects will respond to the STAI-S directly after the CTE, and
      MRE, as well as after optional capsule and ultrasound examinations respectively, when
      remaining at the clinic, and also to the STAI-T directly after the second radiology
      examination is performed.

      A subset of up to 20 subjects will be asked to perform a capsule endoscopy examination and/or
      ultrasound examination.

        -  The capsule examination enables visualisation of both the small bowel and the colon
           mucosa in one procedure. The Crohn's disease severity and presence of strictures, ulcers
           and other lesions will be evaluated. In the small bowel and colon.

        -  The ultrasound examination enables visualisation of bowel wall thickening and flow and
           presence of ulcers, strictures, fistulas and abscesses.
