  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASA inhalation powder is an inhaled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-device combination
      that has been developed to reduce the risk of vascular mortality in patients with suspected
      acute myocardial infarction (MI), an FDA approved indication for oral formulations of
      aspirin.

      The primary goal of study OTP-P0-926 is to collect pharmacokinetic (PK)and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) pilot data to determine onset and extent of aspirin response after administration of
      varying doses of inhaled ASA (50-100mg) and 162 mg Non-Enteric-Coated Chewable ASA. PD will
      be assessed using standard methods to measure platelet inhibition by aspirin including
      platelet aggregation, serum thromboxane,and urinary thromboxane. Furthermore, the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASA will be determined and compared to PD measurements. Results of
      this pilot study will guide dosing in a subsequent larger Phase II study.
