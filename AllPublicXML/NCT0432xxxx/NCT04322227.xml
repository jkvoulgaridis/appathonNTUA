  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of foliglurax on brain wave patterns
      (electric signals) in healthy subjects and in patients with PD
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All Treatment Periods (P1 to P3) consist of 7 days of dosing (D1 to D7) with either:

        -  10 mg foliglurax bis in die (BID) (treatment A)

        -  30 mg foliglurax BID (treatment B)

        -  Placebo BID (treatment C)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy subjects

          -  The subject has an acceptable resting EEG at the Screening Visit, as judged by the
             investigator

          -  The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, generally healthy based on the
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, body weight, ECG,
             and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology, and
             other laboratory tests.

        Patients with PD

          -  The patient has an acceptable resting EEG performed at the screening period, as judged
             by the investigator.

          -  The patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, fit for enrolment in the study
             based on the assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, body
             weight, ECG, and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis,
             serology, and other laboratory tests.

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with idiopathic PD for ≥3 years, with a current disease
             severity of 2 to 4 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale in the 'off' state.

          -  The patient has dyskinesia that is not too severe to cause discomfort for the patient
             during the EEG assessments

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The subject has taken disallowed medication &lt;1 week prior to the first dose of
             Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) or &lt;5 half-lives prior to the Screening Visit
             for any medication taken.

          -  The subject has significant alcohol consumption

          -  The subject has taken any investigational medicinal product &lt;3 months prior to the
             first dose of IMP.

          -  The subjects has a known genetic disorder of human UDPglucoronosyltransferase

          -  The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

        Other in- and exclusion criteria may apply
