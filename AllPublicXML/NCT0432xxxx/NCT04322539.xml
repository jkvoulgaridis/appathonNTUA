    <textblock>
      This is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical
      trial to compare the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib plus best supportive care (BSC)
      versus placebo plus BSC in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
      Approximately 520 subjects will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms in a 2:1
      ratio, fruquintinib plus BSC or placebo plus BSC.

      This is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical
      trial to compare the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib in combination with BSC versus
      placebo in combination with BSC in advanced colorectal cancer patients who have progressed
      on, or were intolerant to, chemotherapy, biologics, and TAS-102 or regorafenib. Patients with
      MSI-H/MMR deficient tumors must have also received an immune checkpoint inhibitor if approved
      and available and if deemed appropriate.

      Metastatic colorectal cancer cannot be cured by surgery. Therefore, treatment principals are
      primarily aimed at controlling disease progression and prolonging survival. Standard first-
      and second-line therapy includes cytotoxic drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and
      irinotecan; anti-VEGF therapy; and, if RAS wild type, anti-EGFR therapy. After the first two
      lines of chemotherapy, standard third-line treatment is either TAS-102 or regorafenib. There
      are currently no effective treatments for patients who have progressed on standard, approved
      therapies, and treatment options include reuse of prior therapies, clinical trials or BSC.
      Consequently, there is an unmet medical need for additional safe and effective treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent;

          -  Age ≥18 years;

          -  Histologically and/or cytologically documented metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
             RAS, BRAF, and microsatellite instability microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch
             repair (MMR) status for each patient must be documented;

          -  Subjects must have progressed on or been intolerant to treatment with either
             trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) or regorafenib. Subjects are considered intolerant to
             TAS-102 or regorafenib if they have received at least 1 dose of either agents and were
             discontinued from therapy for reasons other than disease progression. Subjects who
             have been treated with both TAS-102 and regorafenib are permitted. Subjects must also
             have been previously treated with standard approved therapies: fluoropyrimidine-,
             oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and,
             if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy;

          -  Subjects with microsatellite-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors
             must have been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors if approved and available in
             the subject's country unless the patient is ineligible for treatment with a checkpoint
             inhibitor;

          -  Subjects who received oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting must have progressed within
             6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy;

          -  Body weight ≥40kg;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1;

          -  Have measurable disease according to RECIST Version 1.1, assessed locally. Tumors that
             were treated with radiotherapy are not measurable per RECIST Version 1.1, unless there
             has been documented progression of those lesions;

          -  Expected survival &gt;12 weeks.

          -  For female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with partners of
             childbearing potential, agreement to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception,
             that results in a low failure rate (&lt;1% per year) when used consistently and
             correctly, starting during the screening period, continuing throughout the entire
             study period, and for 90 days after taking the last dose of study drug. Such methods
             include: oral hormonal contraception (combined estrogen/ progestogen, or
             progestogen-only) associated with inhibition of ovulation together with a barrier
             method (eg, diaphragm, always containing a spermicide), intrauterine device (IUD),
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized
             partner, or sexual abstinence. Oral contraception should always be combined with an
             additional contraceptive method (ie, barrier method) because of a potential
             interaction with the study drug. The same criteria are applicable to male subjects
             involved in this clinical trial if they have a partner of childbirth potential, and
             male subjects must always use a condom.

             investigational product;

          -  Other disease, metabolic disorder, physical examination anomaly, abnormal laboratory
             result, or any other condition (e.g., current alcohol or drug abuse) that
             investigators suspect may prohibit use of the investigational product, affect
             interpretation of study results, or put the patient at undue risk of harm based on the
             investigator's assessment;
