  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed randomized controlled trial will examine whether gamified micro-learning is a
      feasible and effective way to promote long-term learning about child abuse and its reporting.
      After completing the interactive online learning program, iLookOut for Child Abuse, early
      childhood professionals will receive brief (5-10 minute) gamified learning exercises to
      complete on their smart-phones. By measuring knowledge (and other outcomes) over time, the
      investigators will determine how much knowledge decays over various time periods, how well
      micro-learning can remediate that decay, and whether such a 2-phase intervention is feasible
      for helping early childhood professionals be better prepared to identify and report suspected
      child abuse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of child abuse in the U.S. (&gt;670,000 confirmed annually) causes massive harm to
      children and the adults they become. Surprisingly, &lt;1% of these substantiated cases of child
      abuse are identified and reported by early childhood professionals (ECPs) -though they take
      care of &gt;10 million American children.

      In the parent study, the online learning program, iLookOut for Child Abuse (iLookOut), has
      been shown to significantly improve ECPs' knowledge and attitudes about child
      abuse/reporting; and preliminary data from an NICHD-sponsored randomized controlled trial
      suggest that iLookOut also improves ECPs' actual reporting of suspected abuse -ie, a greater
      likelihood of reports being screened-in, and screened-in reports leading to findings of abuse
      and/or social services being recommended.

      It is known that for gains in knowledge to be sustained, they must be reinforced â€¦and
      reinforced again -because newly acquired knowledge decays over time unless it is put into
      use. To that end, the investigators have built and piloted a micro-learning platform that
      delivers gamified, interactive, micro-learning activities to 1) reinforce information taught
      in iLookOut's (3-hour) core learning program, 2) augment this learning with new material, and
      3) provide opportunities to practice applying what has been learned. ECPs can complete
      micro-learning activities on their smartphones, and receive 3 additional hours of
      professional development credit (at no cost). Since deploying this platform, the majority of
      ECPs enrolling in the parent iLookOut study have engaged in &gt;1 hour of micro-learning.

      Because so many ECPs are willing to engage in iLookOut's micro-learning, and because spaced
      retrieval and spaced practice are known to improve learning, the investigators have reason to
      believe that this new intervention can help sustain ECPs' preparedness to appropriately
      identify and report suspected child abuse. What is not known is the rate of knowledge decay
      following iLookOut's core learning program; whether a multi-faceted implementation strategy
      (core + micro-learning) helps remediate decays in knowledge; and what is the best timing to
      introduce this reinforcement -immediately, or after a delay of some months.

      iLookOut's micro-learning platform is fully integrated with the learning management system
      for iLookOut's core learning program, and a cognitive sequencing map helps ensure that
      micro-learning content is fully aligned with the core learning program. Upgrading the
      functionality of the current micro-learning activities will enable the investigators to
      capture the kind of granular, question-level data needed for rigorous research. Conducting a
      randomized controlled trial in Pennsylvania (where micro-learning has not yet been
      introduced) will allow the investigators to evaluate how well interactive, micro-learning
      activities improve learning, and more generally how a multi-faceted implementation strategy
      that utilizes mobile technology-based learning (ie, using smartphones) can better prepare
      ECPs to appropriately identify and report suspected child abuse.

    <description>Evaluate whether a multi-faceted implementation strategy that includes learners completing an initial core training followed by using a micro-learning program is a feasible way to educate ECPs about child abuse and its reporting. We will judge the iLookOut intervention feasible if:
&gt;75% of participants report endorsing the iLookOut micro-learning program, as measured by the a net promoter score that is &gt;0. The net promoter scale consists of one question, How likely would you be to recommend this learning program to a fellow early childhood professional?, with responses measured on a -100 to +100.</description>

    <description>The iLookOut knowledge measure includes 26 knowledge items. Each item has a correct and incorrect response that is scored for correctness. The knowledge score will be measured at 5 time-points: 1) prior to the core learning program; 2) immediately after the learning program; 3) immediately prior to micro-learning; 4) immediately after micro-learning; and 5) three months after completion of micro-learning. The average knowledge score will be compared at each time-point.</description>

    <measure>Knowledge score decay and remediation measured by change in average knowledge score on the iLookOut knowledge assessment over 5 time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The iLookOut knowledge scores collected at each of 5 time points will be compared to determine the change in knowledge at each time-point. A reduction in knowledge score from a prior assessment of knowledge will be considered a decay in knowledge. An increase in knowledge score after such a decay will be considered remediation. Knowledge scores will evaluate the natural course of knowledge decay, the degree of remediation following completion of micro-learning activities, and then any subsequent knowledge decay. Knowledge will be measured at 5 time-points: 1) prior to the core learning program; 2) immediately after the learning program; 3) immediately prior to micro-learning; 4) immediately after micro-learning; and 5) three months after completion of micro-learning. The average knowledge scores at each time-point will be compared.</description>
