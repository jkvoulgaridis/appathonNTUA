    <textblock>
      The trajectory of dementia patients within the national health system and their recent
      temporal trends remains to be fully elucidated. To study the dementia incidence, mortality
      and case-fatality, we implemented a longitudinal cohort study with the linked electronic
      health records of 5.6 million population in the UK from 1998 to 2016 (CALIBER). A matched
      case-control study design was used to investigate the causes of hospitalization and death
      comparing individuals with and without incident dementia.

        We implement two study designs, first a longitudinal cohort study to assess dementia
        incidence and second a matched case-control study for mortality, cause of death and
        hospitalization.

        We identify individuals aged 30 years or older and registered in the current primary care
        practice for at least one year. Individuals are excluded if they had a prior history of
        dementia before study entry. For the nested case-control study, controls are matched to
        incident dementia patients according to sex and age (10-year age strata).
