      PCOS is a complex disease that is diagnosed by the presence of two of the following three:
      oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries by
      ultrasound . PCOS affects 4% to 21% of females in reproductive age . Although subfertility is
      abundant in women with PCOS, a majority of these women will achieve pregnancy naturally or by
      treatment.

      Different treatment modalities are present for ovulation induction. Life style modifications
      including weight loss are encouraged for those who are overweight or obese. Pharmacological
      induction of ovulation represent the first line therapy for induction of ovulation. Options
      include aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole), Clomiphene Citrate (CC) or Metformin, alone or in
      combinations.

      For second line treatment either Gonadotropins (Gn) or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS) are
      the recommended options .

      the objective of the trial is to study the effectiveness and safetey of surgical induction of
      ovulation strategy and compare it to medical induction strategy with Gonadotropins

      PCOS is a complex disease that is diagnosed by the presence of two of the following three:
      oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries by
      ultrasound . PCOS affects 4% to 21% of females in reproductive age . Although subfertility is

      Different treatment modalities are present for ovulation induction. Life style modifications

      For second line treatment either Gonadotropins (Gn) or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS) are
      the recommended options .

      Systematic reviews done comparing LOD to Gn found no differences in live birth, clinical
      pregnancy or miscarriage rates. However, there was significant decrease in OHSS and multiple
      pregnancies with LOD . Giving these advantages together with being cheap, the surgical
      strategy may be a more favorable choice as second line treatment of anovulation . Also
      several randomised controlled trial (RCTs) reported normalization of ovarian reserve
      parameters after LOD, making it a long-lasting option compared to the one-cycle effect of
      medical treatment the objective of the trial is to study the effectiveness and safetey of
      surgical induction of ovulation strategy and compare it to medical induction strategy with
      Gonadotropins

    <description>LOD will be done in the follicular phase.Follow up will be done on the next cycle by performing a TVUS examination at CD 13 and measuring the dominant follicles. Ovulation is considered if a follicle reached &gt; 17 mm and is confirmed by measuring serum progesterone at CD 21.If ovulation is not achieved in the cycle following LOD, women will be prescribed Letrozole by the dose of 2.5 mg daily for 5 days starting from CD 3, and ovulation monitoring will be done similarly. If ovulation is not achieved, the dose is increased by 2.5 mg daily in the subsequent cycle until reaching the maximum dose of 7.5 mg daily for a total of 3 cycles.With persistent resistance to Letrozole in inducing ovulation, Gn will be prescribed for 3 cycles as in Gonadotrophin strategy</description>

    <description>A low-dose step-up protocol will be implemented. This starts on CD 3,The rFSH will be given through (IM) or(SC) injections with 75 IU and will be given once daily.Monitoring of the treatment will be done on CD 7 by TVUS and serum E2. Monitoring is individualized according to the response. Depending on the response and follicular growth, the dose may be adjusted by increasing 37.5 IU. If follicular growth failed, the dose is furtherly increased by the same amount until at least one follicle reaches 10 mm. The dose is maintained until at least one follicle reaches a diameter of 18 mm and no more than 2 follicles are bigger than 15 mm. Once reaching the desired diameter, the rFSH will be stopped and a trigger of ovulation by an IM injection of 5000 IU of hCG and sexual intercourse is encouraged on the day of trigger and the next day. Then serum P will be done 7 days after hCG injection to detect the occurrence of ovulation.</description>
