  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elderly are weakened by the accumulation of chronic diseases. Their acute decompensation
      often leads to unscheduled hospitalization, which constitutes a breach of care with often
      serious consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. Few studies have identified all the
      risk factors for unscheduled hospitalization in the very elderly. This project deals with the
      impact of air pollution on the very elderly as a source of physiological decompensations
      leading to unscheduled hospitalizations, in association with other individual and
      environmental risk factors. It complements the Rieho cohort that followed 973 elderly people
      on the same objective and enriches it with the use of sensors measuring the peri-individual
      atmospheric environment.

      In order to facilitate the perspective and scientific valorization of these data, the
      experimental design and population characteristics reproduce those of the RIEHO cohort
      (Coordinator P Aegerter), which aims to identify individual and environmental risk factors
      for unscheduled hospitalization of the elderly and included 973 people over 80 years of age
      with a 2-year follow-up, closed in early 2017. Indeed, the workforce mobilized in the Rieho-C
      study is undersized to measure an association between air quality and a major health impact
      (hospitalization or death), this objective can only be achieved by adding Rieho-C data to
      those of Rieho.

    <description>Subjects benefit from a standardized, comprehensive geriatric evaluation in accordance with the recommendations of good practice during a geriatric consultation. It is completed by a measurement of the gripping force using a dynamometer and a measurement of the respiratory parameters (vital capacity) using a spirometer. The following acts are added to the consultation: the completion of questionnaires, a semi-directed interview focused on the perception of air pollution, the wearing on the chest for one week of an individual mobile physiological signal sensor (DM with CE marking) and the wearing (on the belt or in a bag) for one week of a portable device with two air pollution sensors.</description>

          -  Subject under guardianship or curatorship,

          -  Subject living in collective housing (retirement home) or entering an institution
             within 2 weeks,

          -  Abundant thoracic hair causing poor contact of the ECG electrodes of the physiological
             sensor,

          -  Rejection of patient's contact information, refuses to answer questionnaires and
             follow-up visits, or refuses to wear sensors, Impossibility, during the initial
