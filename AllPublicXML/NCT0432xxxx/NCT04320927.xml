    <textblock>
      Iatrogenic withdrawal symptomes has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and
      the and the derived symptoms such as fever and agitation has been shown to cause
      significantly prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. The incidence of IWS in the adult
      general ICU ranges from 16,7-55%. To this date, the incidence of IWS has not been studied in
      patients with TBI.
