  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of Remote Ischemic Conditioning(RIC) as
      adjuvant therapy for Parkinson's Disease(PD). Sixty patients will be randomized into 2groups:
      RIC group receiving Remote Ischemic Conditioning except conventional therapy（n=30）and control
      group with conventional therapy (n=30).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a procedure whereby ischaemia is induced to a limb for
      short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms to above systolic pressures
      (mmHg). This procedure induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such
      changes often result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the
      body, as well as improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. RIC has been shown to improve
      outcomes in patients with heart attacks, strokes, but is not investigated for PD. We argue
      that RIC may exert neuroprotective effect on PD due to its multiple mechanisms. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the impact of RIC on long term outcomes in patients with PD.

    <description>The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅲ is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson´s disease. Each of the 27 sub-items in the UPDRS III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The total scores therefore ranges from 0 (Best score possible) to 108 (Worst score possible).</description>

    <description>remote ischemic conditioning is a physical strategy performed by an electric auto-control device with cuffs placed on bilateral arms: five cycles of 5-min inflation and 5-min deflation one or two times per day. The duration of the treatment is six months.</description>

    <description>5 cycles of 5 minutes of upper limb ischaemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion. This will be delivered using a manual sphygmomanometer applied to the upper arm and activated to go through 5 such cycles automatically. The blood pressure cuff in the active treatment arm will inflate to 200 mmHg. RIC will be completed 1-2 times per day for six months.</description>
