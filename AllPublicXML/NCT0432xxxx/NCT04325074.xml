  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous
      system which produces both motor and cognitive dysfunctions. MS causes a decline in the
      performance of activities of daily living (ADL) due to impairments affecting limb function.

      Aim: This pilot study sought to determine whether the use of mental practice (MP) or the
      combined use of MP and the training of manipulative skills would improve the manipulation
      motor skills and treatment satisfaction among people with MS.

      Methods: The study participants were people with MS. Blinded evaluators performed three
      assessments for each patient (pre-treatment, post-treatment and at a three month follow up).
      The patients were divided into three groups with alternate allocation: (A) Mental practice,
      (B) Mental practice + skills training and (C) Control group.

      Keywords: activities of daily living; manual dexterity; mental practice, motor image;
      multiple sclerosis.

    <description>During each of the 12 treatment sessions, the patient was asked to select two tasks from a list of MP activities, graded by level. Once the task was selected, patients received the specific visual or audio instructions and subsequently performed the task. The recording was viewed three times and the audio instructions were repeated two times. To listen to the audio instructions, the participants were requested to close their eyes in order to aid concentration. After listening to the recordings, the patient was asked to perform the task once again, practicing what had been learnt. After the process was completed, the participant completed a questionnaire and scored each task.</description>

    <description>In this option, six sessions of MP were alternated with six sessions of skills training (ST). The MP protocol was the same as in group A: selecting, performing, visualizing, listening to and scoring the selected tasks. The activities performed in the skills training were based on the Kamm et al. (2015) protocol and bimanual tasks. After the performance of each task, the patients were allowed to rest for 1 or 2 minutes to avoid the appearance of fatigue.</description>

    <description>The control group only received their usual physical therapy and occupational therapy treatments provided by their association. The treatment mainly consisted of the application of the Bobath concept and the Vojta method, dry needling, myofascial induction therapy, passive mobilizations, training of gross and fine motor coordination of the upper limbs, resistance training and static and dynamic balance training.</description>
