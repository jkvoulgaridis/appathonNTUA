  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to compare repeatability, reproducibility and agreement of
      three different AS-OCT devices and Pentacam.

      The investigational devices are approved biometry and keratometry devices to perform
      biometric/keratometric measurements preoperatively before cataract surgery. The measurements
      are used to calculate the needed IOL power.

      Measurements with all four devices will be performed 3 times consecutively by two trained
      observer. The order of the observer, the order of devices as well as the eye (left/right) is
      randomized.

      Examinations will be implemented in accordance with the approved investigational plan on
      subjects and includes: repeated biometry/keratometry with four different devices

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to compare repeatability, reproducibility and agreement of
      both, AS-OCT(s) and Pentacam. In our department three different AS-OCT devices and a HR
      Scheimpflug imaging device are currently in use for clinical routine to measure the cornea.
      Among refractive and anterior segment surgeons, there is no preferred and accepted method for
      accurate measurements of the corneal curvature. The four diagnostic tools are based on
      different technical and physical imaging principles and to date only limited information on
      their comparability exist. One advantage of ASOCT represents faster imaging speed when
      compared to Scheimpflug imaging. Thus, imaging misalignment, segmentation errors and defocus
      aberration can most likely be avoided by AS-OCT. Chen et al demonstrated that HR Scheimpflug
      imaging measurements of CCT were systematically higher than the measurements provided by FD
      AS-OCT. Further, repeatability, reproducibility and agreement of AS-OCT and Scheimpflug
      imaging device will be assessed during follow-up.
