  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to prospectively evaluate the performance of the
      electromechanical window according to a phonographic method, as a mean of diagnosis of long
      QT syndrome, and to compare its performance with routine tests used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary cardiac disorder in which most affected
      family members have delayed ventricular repolarization manifest on the electrocardiogram
      (ECG) as QT prolongation. This disease is associated with an increased propensity to
      palpitations, syncope, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and sudden arrhythmic death. The
      diagnosis relies mostly on resting ECG findings and on genetic testing. In clinical practice
      however, this diagnosis is complicated by 2 main reasons: 1) a significant overlap in ECG
      findings between healthy and diseased individuals and 2) a frequent identification of genetic
      variants of unknown significance. Recent studies have suggested that echocardiographic
      measurement of the electromechanical window (EMW - the delay between the end of mechanical
      contraction and electrical activation of the heart) has better performance in the diagnosis
      of LQTS. The echocardiographic technique is however too complicated for routine clinical use.
      Preliminary work conducted at the University Hospital of Bordeaux and at the University
      Hospital of Reunion Island has demonstrated that a phonocardiographic approach leads to
      similar results with an improved feasibility and a good reproducibility.

    <description>A standard ECG is recorded along with a phonocardiographic recording. The phonocardiographic recording is obtained by using a specific electronic stethoscope plugged into the auxiliary port of the ECG machine. The recording takes less than 30 seconds. The two recording methods are concomitant.
QT interval is measured on the ECG recording, EMW is measured with ECG coupled to phonocardiography.</description>
