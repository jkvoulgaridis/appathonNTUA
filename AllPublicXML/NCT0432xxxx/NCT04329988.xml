  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is a very important public health concern. In France UAU is the
      second cause of avoidable death after tobacco smoking. In 2014, 31% of the French adult
      population presented with unhealthy alcohol use. Primary care practitioners have access to
      validated questionnaires in French such as the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test
      (AUDIT) and the Fast Alcohol Consumption Evaluation (FACE). These tests are not often used
      because of their length.

      In 2009 a study by Smith et al in the USA compared a single question with the AUDIT-c (a
      short version of the AUDIT). The single question was &quot;How many times in the past year have
      you had X or more drinks in a day?&quot; Where X is 7 for men and 6 for women. This study found
      that the single question had a comparable sensitivity and a specificity, respectively 81,8%
      and 79,3%.

      The aim of the study is to validate this question in French. First the question has been
      translated from English to French following the WHO method. The aim of the present study is
      to validate the French translation by comparing it with the AUDIT and the FACE. A
      questionnaire will be given to patients with inclusion criteria in general practitioners
      waiting rooms (15 different locations). This questionnaire will be composed of the single
      question, followed by the AUDIT and FACE, and three socio-demographic questions. The
      questionnaire will be anonymous.
