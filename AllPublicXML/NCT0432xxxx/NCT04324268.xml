    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and bioavailability
      of subcutaneously administered Antolimab (AK002) in adult healthy volunteers. Subjects will
      receive a single dose of intravenous AK002 or subcutaneous Antolimab (AK002) assigned in a
      double-blind, randomized fashion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provided written informed consent.

          2. Male or female aged ≥18 and ≤65 years at the time of signing the ICF.

          3. Determined by the Investigator to be in good health as documented by medical history,
             vital signs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, ECG, and by general
             observations.

          4. Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg and have a BMI between 18 g/m2 and 30 kg/m2,
             inclusive.

          5. Negative urine drug screen at Screening.

          6. Subjects must have the ability and willingness to attend the necessary visits to the
             study center and the ability to communicate effectively with the study site personnel.

          7. Negative screening ova and parasite test.

          8. Female subjects must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year with FSH level &gt;40
             IU/mL at Screening or surgically sterile (tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral
             oophorectomy) for at least 3 months, or if of childbearing potential, have a negative
             pregnancy test and agree to use dual methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual
             activity from Screening until the end of the study, or for 120 days following the last
             dose of study drug, whichever is longer.

          9. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a
             highly effective method of contraception from Screening until the end of the study or
             for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. All fertile
             men with female partners of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the
             Investigator immediately if they suspect their partner might be pregnant (e.g., missed
             or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count &gt;300/µL.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study drug.

          3. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             participating in the study.

             Investigator.

          5. Any disease of condition (medical or surgical) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk.

          6. History of malignancy except carcinoma in situ in the cervix, early stage prostate
             cancer, or non-melanoma skin cancers.

          7. Treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the preceding 6 months.

          8. Treatment for a helminthic parasitic infection within 6 months of screening.

          9. Use during the 30 days before Screening (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) or use
             during the Screening period of omalizumab, dupilumab, systemic immunosuppressive
             drugs, or systemic corticosteroids, except if receiving as part of a premedication
             protocol.

         10. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of
             treatment in the study, during the treatment period, or vaccination expected within 5
             half-lives (4 months) of study drug administration.

         11. Positive hepatitis serology results, except for vaccinated subjects or subjects with
             past but resolved hepatitis, at Screening.

         12. Positive HIV serology results at Screening.

         13. Alcohol, drug, or other substance abuse or dependence.

         14. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, makes
