  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance training (RT) is one of the most important stimuli for muscle hypertrophy and it
      plays an important role on weight loss and fatty acid oxidation increase. RT affects anabolic
      pathways but the differences among various training techniques has been till now were poorly
      investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different intensity of
      training, high-intensity interval resistance training (HIIRT) and traditional resistance
      training (TRT), on muscle signalling pathway.

      Nine young healthy subjects performed HIIRT and TRT protocol in two different moments and
      with different legs. HIIRT technique consisted of three sets of: 6 repetitions at 6RM (6
      repetitions maximum) and then 20 seconds of rest and 2/3 repetitions (until exhaustion)
      repeated for 3 times with 2'30&quot; rest between sets; while TRT consisted of 3 sets of 15 reps
      with 75 sec of rest between sets. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken at baseline
      (pre), immediately (0h) at the end of training, 6 hours (6h) and 24 hours (24h) after
      training. Western blot and RT-PCR mRNA (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction)
      analysis were performed to assess muscle signalling pathway activation
