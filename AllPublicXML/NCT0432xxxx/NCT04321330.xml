    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions 4 weeks apart, as determined by the Investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Objective Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from initial response to disease progression or death among patients who have experienced a CR or PR (unconfirmed) during the study. Duration of response will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 3.5 years</time_frame>
