  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of an in-season mixed training
      program on several physiological parameters of soccer players. Twenty-one U19 elite soccer
      players recruited and randomly assigned to either an 8-week specific training experimental
      group or a control group. The program will include an eccentric hamstring exercise, static
      balance exercises and core muscles strengthening exercises. Isokinetic hamstring and
      quadriceps strength, single leg static balance and lumbopelvic stability will be measured
      prior and after the intervention.

      A total of 123 male Under-19 (U19) players from several soccer teams were initially invited
      for participation in the study after signing informed consent forms. following a second
      contact with the participants, questionnaire forms with inclusion and exclusion criteria were
      send for completion.

      Based on their self-report and a clinical examination by a health professional, of the 103
      players, 42 did not meet the inclusion criteria, while 12 players did not participate for
      personal reasons. Of the remaining 69 players, 48 players were excluded, including 3 players
      reporting an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 14 because of lower extremity injury
      led to more than two weeks absence from training and 10 players because of secondary injuries
      or health problems that led to loss of training the past 3 months.

      A neutral, blinded investigator with no further involvement in the study was responsible for
      randomized allocation of participants in two groups. All training sessions in the training
      group will be supervised by a fitness coach, who will ensure that the exercises are performed
      according to protocol.

    <measure>Average speed of CoP</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline assessment at 8 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>For the balance exercise the participants will perform one-legged stance of certain duration, on a stable surface.
For the sliding leg curl exercise the participants lay supine on a mat, wearing only socks in order to create a slippery surface between their heels and the gym floor. The player begins by extending the hip and having the working leg on knee flexion. The contralateral limb is on hip flexion and knee flexion. The base of support is the shoulder blades, the elbows and the heel of the working leg. After assuming this position, the player begins to extend the knee, as slowly as possible, resisting the low friction properties of the ground.
The core stability program consists of front plank, side planks, supine bridge, leg lowering and superman exercise. These exercises will be performed at the end of the training session, in contrast to the balance and hamstring exercises which will be executed before the training session.</description>
