  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective or even the
      only way to cure blood malignant diseases. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a serious early
      complication of allo-HSCT. Its high incidence and poor prognosis can cause a series of
      terminal organ diseases such as CMV pneumonia, encephalitis, and enteritis,which seriously
      affecting the prognosis of patients post allo-HSCT.

      Our data show that rapid reconstruction of NK cells after transplantation can reduce the
      incidence of CMV infection. Patients with a rapid reconstruction of NKG2C after
      transplantation have a low CMV infection rate, and patients with strong secretion of
      IFN-gamma of NK after transplantation have low CMV infection.

      Our previous research showed that trophoblast cells transfected with IL-21 and 4-1BBL can
      achieve a large number of clinical-grade expansion of NK cells (mIL-21 / 4-1BBL NK cells),
      and mIL-21 / 4-1BBL NK cells It is safe to treat patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)
      positive AML after transplantation, and can induce MRD to turn negative. Previous studies
      have shown that adoptive infusion of expanded NK cells after haplotype transplantation is
      safe and can improve the functional reconstruction of NK cells. Therefore, we hypothesized
      that the infusion of NK cells can improve the antiviral capacity of NK cells, thereby
      effectively reducing the CMV infection. Incidence.
