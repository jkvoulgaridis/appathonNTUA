      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) of single and multiple ascending oral doses of PF-07059013 in healthy
      adult participants. Additionally, effects of different formulations and food on parameters,
      including PK may be explored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female (of non-child bearing potential) participants must be 18 to 55 years
             of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the ICD.

          2. Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, including blood pressure,
             pulse rate, respiratory rate and temperature measurement, standard 12 lead ECG,
             laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring.

          3. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.

             Weight:

          4. BMI of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

          5. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in this
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy).

          3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;
             positive testing at screening for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis
             B core antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). As an exception a positive
             HBsAb test due to hepatitis B vaccination is permissible.

          4. Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant
             inappropriate for the study.

          5. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             intervention.

          6. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study
             intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).

          7. A positive urine drug test at screening or admission.

          8. A positive urine cotinine test at screening or admission in Part 1 and 2.

          9. Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least
             5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the
             BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used
             to determine the participant's eligibility.

         10. Baseline 12 lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTc
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), signs of an acute or
             indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of
             myocardial ischemia, second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or serious
             bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450
             msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the Fridericia method and the
             resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450
             msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average
             of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.
             Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading
             ECGs before excluding participants.

         11. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

               -  AST or ALT level ≥1.5 × ULN;

               -  Total bilirubin level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's
                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is ≤ ULN;

               -  PT/INR &gt;1.2 × ULN;

               -  aPTT ≥1.5 × ULN;

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;11.0 g/dL;

               -  Lactate &gt;1 x ULN.

         12. For Part 2 only, participants with absolute reticulocyte count &gt;150,000/uL at
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary.

         13. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).

         14. Use of tobacco/nicotine containing products for Part 1 or 2, and use of more than 5
             cigarettes/day for Part 3.

         15. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

         16. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations
             section of this protocol.

         17. Investigator site staff or Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the
             study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective
             family members.
