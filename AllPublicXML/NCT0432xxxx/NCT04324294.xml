  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether quantitative contrast-enhanced endoscopic
      ultrasound (CE-EUS) improves the evaluation of pancreas tumors and precursor lesions,
      including cysts, compared to conventional endoscopic ultrasound.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective trial of CE- EUS in which the conventional EUS that is part of
      standard clinical care is conducted after injection of intravenous contrast agent.

      The study population will include those patients already undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for
      standard pancreatic indications at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The primary procedures will
      include conventional EUS to evaluate a pancreatic lesion as part of standard of care, IV
      contrast agent during the procedure if deemed necessary by the investigator, collection of
      time intensity curves for pancreas and lesions from the EUS processor. The study includes one
      standard of care visit for EUS, and the enrollment period will be 24 months. All enrolled
      patients will be followed by chart review or phone call for a period of 12 months.

      All of the subjects will be undergoing an EUS for standard of care. These patients will also
      receive an IV contrast agent (Lumason) during the procedure, which is not part of standard of
      care, and is for research use only. FNA will be performed only on those patients deemed to
      require FNA based solely on the standard EUS.

      If the aims of the study are achieved, it ill confirm that contrast-enhanced EUS can be used
      to differentiate various pancreatic lesions and, in future, may aid in risk-stratification of
      precursor lesions for pancreatic cancer.

    <measure>The results obtained by EUS versus contrast EUS to diagnose pancreas cystic lesions, mass lesion, and origin of pancreatitis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The endoscopist will perform conventional EUS and classify the lesion, which will be recorded by the research assistant prior to CE-EUS. Contrast will then be administered and the classification of CE-EUS will be recorded in real time. Using pathology and one-year clinical follow-up as the gold standard, the yields of the modality will be calculated. In addition, we will evaluate whether the use of CE-EUS impacted assessment of size and diagnosis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Parameters of Pancreas Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative parameters of pancreas mass lesions will be performed by comparing the quantitative parameters post processing of adenocarcinoma, other pancreatic lesions, and chronic pancreatitis. The final diagnosis will be based on pathology and 3 , 6 and 12 month follow up. Variables to compare will include time to peak (SECONDS), rise time (SECONDS), mean transit time (SECONDS), and time from peak to one-half (SECONDS).</description>
