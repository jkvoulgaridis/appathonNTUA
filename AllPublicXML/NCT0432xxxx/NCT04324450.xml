  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumours are the leading cause of cancer-related death and morbidity in children,
      adolescents and young adults. The brain is also one of the most sensitive organs to
      treatments used in pediatric oncology, even for cancers not related to the central nervous
      system. Therapeutic index is therefore a major issue in pediatric neuro-oncology. The
      efficacy of the therapy as well as its toxicity are difficult to measure using standard
      tests. In order to optimize therapies that could have an impact on the brain, and
      consequently on the quality of life of patients, it becomes crucial to optimize the means of
      evaluation.

      Few studies to date have focused on the various components of memory impacted following
      treatment of a posterior fossa tumour. However, supra-tentorial structures such as the
      hippocampus, which have long been described for their role in memory, are either partially
      irradiated (irradiated in their lower part due to their proximity to the target volume during
      irradiation of the posterior fossa) or completely irradiated (e.g. included in the
      prophylactic irradiation of medulloblastoma prior to dose supplementation in the posterior
      fossa). On the other hand, the cerebellum plays a central role in learning and procedural
      memory involved in motor and cognitive learning, as it enables automation and procedural
      retention such as reading (automation of the grapho-phonemic conversion procedure) or
      arithmetic (mental arithmetic).

      IMPALA study is aimed at investigating the impact of different irradiation doses received by
      children treated with radiotherapy on cognitive functions related to the hippocampus and to
      the cerebellum.

      This exploratory study will thus provide elements enabling a better limitation of
      radiotherapy doses on regions linked to the development of cognition and memory. The project
      brings together researchers and clinicians with complementary expertise in oncology,
      neurology and imaging in both children and adults. This study will also provide a better
      understanding of the role of the cerebellum in memory and executive functions, and develop a
      method that can then be used in a prospective longitudinal multicentre form.
