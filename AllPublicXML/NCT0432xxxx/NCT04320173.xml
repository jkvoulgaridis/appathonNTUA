  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the adhesion performance of ZTlido®
      (lidocaine topical system) 1.8% compared to adhesion performance for Lidoderm® (lidocaine
      patch 5%) and Versatis® (lidocaine medicated plaster 5%).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Adhesion Score (FDA scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion of the product to the skin is assessed by the FDA 0-4 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion is indicated as follows: 0 = ≥ 90% Adhered (essentially no lift off the skin), 1 = ≥ 75% to &lt; 90% Adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin), 2 = ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% Adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin), &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% Adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off), and 4 = 0% adhered (patched completely detached). Adhesion is assessed every 3 hours for 12 hours. The mean cumulative adhesion score is calculated as the sum of scores at each assessment time point divided by the total number of observations.</description>

    <measure>Mean Adhesion Score (EMA scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion of the product to the skin is assessed by the EMA 0-6 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion is indicated as follows: 0 = &lt; 70% Adhered, 1 = &gt; 70% Adhered, 2 = &gt; 75% Adhered, 3 = &gt; 80% Adhered, 4 = &gt; 85% Adhered, 5 = &gt; 90% adhered, and 6 = &gt; 95% Adhered. Adhesion is assessed every 3 hours for 12 hours. The mean cumulative adhesion score is calculated as the sum of scores at each assessment time point divided by the total number of observations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermal Response Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12.5 and 14 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Product tolerability is assessed by Dermal Response Score. The application site is evaluated 30 minutes and 2 hours after product removal (12.5 and 14 hours post-dose, respectively). Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test (i.e., application) site.</description>

    <description>Subjects received all three topical lidocaine products in Periods 1, 2, and 3. The sequence in which they received the lidocaine products was determined by random assignment. For subjects in Arm 1, 3 lidocaine 1.8% patches were applied in Period 1, and 3 lidocaine 5% patches were applied in Period 2, and 3 lidocaine 5% medicated plasters were applied in Period 3.</description>
