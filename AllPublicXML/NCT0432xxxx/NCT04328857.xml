  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical investigation plan is a pivotal controlled study with two parallel
      groups, has a total duration of 12 months and involves the recruitment of 34 pediatric
      patients suffering from acquired brain injury.

      The primary objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the improvement of joint stiffness
      through the use of sensorized pseudoelastic orthoses for the rehabilitation of pediatric
      patients with acquired brain injury.

      The effectiveness of the treatment in terms of joint stiffness (primary outcome) will be
      assessed and the effect of the treatment will be quantified with clinical evaluation scales
      and instrumental measurements by means of an optoelectronic system and isokinetic machine.
      The tolerability and acceptability of the device will also be checked.
