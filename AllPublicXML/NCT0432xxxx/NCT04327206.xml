    <textblock>
      Phase III, two-group multicentre, randomised controlled trial in up to 10 078 healthcare
      workers to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 during
      the 2020 pandemic.

    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers are at the frontline of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. They
      will be randomised to receive a single dose of BCG vaccine or 0.9% NaCl placebo. Participants
      will be followed-up for 12 months with notification from a Smartphone application (up to
      daily when ill) and surveys to identify and detail COVID-19 infection. Additional information
      on severe disease will be obtained from hospital medical records and/or government databases.
      Blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and at 3 and 12 months to determine
      exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Where required,
      swab/blood samples will be taken at illness episodes to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The trial includes a pre-planned meta-analysis with data from 2834 participants recruited in
      the first phase of this study, where participants were randomised to receive BCG or no BCG
      vaccine at the time of receiving influenza vaccination.

    <masking_description>The control group will receive a placebo of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Members of the research team doing the follow-up of participants and analysis will be blinded to the group allocation (by the removal of this variable and all other variables related to BCG from the dataset) until the formal detailed statistical analysis plan is confirmed and signed by all investigators and all data cleaning/preparation is complete.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over 18 years of age

          -  In Europe: Healthcare worker who over the next few months of COVID-19 pandemic will be
             working onsite in patient areas or having face-to-face contact with patients.

             -Note that this may include staff in either hospitals or other patient care
             facilities, such as nursing homes. Proof of registration as patient care worker will
             be required at enrolment.

          -  In Australia: Employed by one of the hospitals involved in the study

             - Note that this is not restricted to clinicians or nurses and include all individuals
             who work within the participating hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak.

          -  Provide a signed and dated informed consent form

          -  Has received the influenza vaccine at least 72 hours prior to randomisation

             - Note that this criteria only applies in to Australian participants

          -  Pre-randomisation blood collected

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has any BCG vaccine contraindication

          -  Fever or generalised skin infection (where feasible, randomisation can be delayed
             until cleared)

          -  Weakened resistance toward infections due to a disease in/of the immune system

          -  Receiving medical treatment that affects the immune response or other
             immunosuppressive therapy in the last year. These therapies include systemic
             corticosteroids (more than or equal to 20 mg for more than or equal to 2 weeks),
             non-biological immunosuppressant (also known as 'DMARDS'), biological agents (such as
             monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha).

          -  Has a congenital cellular immunodeficiency, including specific deficiencies of the
             interferon-gamma pathway

          -  Has a malignancy involving bone marrow or lymphoid systems

          -  Has any serious underlying illness (such as malignancy). Please note: People with
             cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and/or chronic respiratory disease are
             eligible if not immunocompromised

          -  Known or suspected HIV infection, even if asymptomatic or has normal immune function.
             This is because of the risk of disseminated BCG infection

          -  Has active skin disease such as eczema, dermatitis or psoriasis at or near the site of
             vaccination. A different site (other than left arm) can be chosen if necessary

          -  Pregnant Although there is no evidence that BCG vaccination is harmful during
             pregnancy, it is a contra-indication to BCG vaccination. Therefore, we will exclude
             women who think they could be pregnant.

          -  Another live vaccine administered in the month prior to randomisation

          -  Require another live vaccine to be administered within the month following BCG
             randomisation If the other live vaccine can be given on the same day, this exclusion
             criteria does not apply

          -  Known anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredient present in the BCG vaccine

          -  Previous active tuberculosis (TB) disease

          -  Previous adverse reaction to BCG vaccine (significant local reaction (abscess) or
             suppurative lymphadenitis)

          -  BCG vaccine given within the last year

          -  Has previously had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result

          -  Already part of this trial, recruited at a different hospital

          -  Participation in another COVID-19 prevention trial
