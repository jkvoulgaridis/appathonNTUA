  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the safety and blood levels of study drug KAE609 given in the vein.
      The study consists of two parts:

        -  Part A is a single ascending dose (SAD) study with 4 cohorts of 8 subjects each, where
           participants will receive 1 dose of KAE609 or placebo (contains no medicine).

        -  Part B is a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study with 2 cohorts of 9 subjects each, where
           participants will receive 5 doses of KAE609 or placebo.

      A review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data will be conducted at the completion of each
      cohort prior to dosing of the next subsequent cohort.

    <intervention_model_description>In Part A, sequential cohorts of 8 subjects/cohort will be randomized to receive successively higher single iv doses of KAE609 or matching placebo. The randomization ratio will be 3:1 to KAE609 (6 subjects/cohort) or matching placebo (2 subjects/cohort).
In Part B, sequential cohorts of 9 subjects/cohort will be randomized to receive successively higher iv doses of KAE609 or matching placebo. Two planned dose cohorts will be included in Part B (B1 and B2). For B1, subjects will receive a 60 mg dose of KAE609 or matching placebo iv q24h for 5 days. For B2, subjects will start with a single loading dose of 120 mg or matching placebo on Day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg or matching placebo iv q24h for the subsequent 4 days. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to KAE609 (6 subjects/cohort) or matching placebo (3 subjects/cohort).
In case of a need for another dose level due to any findings (e.g. AEs or unexpected PK), other cohort(s) may be investigated.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a subject and investigator-blinded study. Site staff may be unblinded to the treatment assignment of one or more subjects (within a single cohort or across cohorts as necessary), or an entire cohort at interim analyses and at dose escalation timepoints if deemed appropriate to aid decision-making. The decision to unblind site staff at dose escalations will be determined by the clinical trial team based on need and documented in dose escalation meeting minutes.
Drug product will be supplied in bulk, so an unblinded pharmacist who is independent of the study team will be required in order to maintain the blind.
The following unblinded sponsor roles are required for this study :
Unblinded field monitor(s)
Unblinded clinical staff managing drug re-supply to site
Unblinded sample analyst(s) (PK)
The study statistician will be able to access the full randomization list from the start of the study and is allowed to share unblinded information with the rest of the clinical trial</masking_description>
