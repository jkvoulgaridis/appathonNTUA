      This study is a phase I/II study of single drug TJ004309 and PD-1 monoclonal antibody
      injection combine treatment for Advanced solid tumor. This study include two stages. First
      stage is dose escalation and second stage is dose extension. The purpose of part A is to
      confirm the MTD or MED and the clinical dose. The purpose of part B is to observe the safety,
      effectiveness, Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biomarker properties for effective
      subjects.
