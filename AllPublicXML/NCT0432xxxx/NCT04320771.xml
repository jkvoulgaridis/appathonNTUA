  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neladenoson bialanate is currently under clinical development for a condition in which the
      heart has trouble pumping blood through the body (chronic heart failure). Renal impairment
      which co-occurs in patients with heart failure is a common condition in which the kidneys are
      not filtering the blood as well as they should. The goal of the study is to learn more about
      the safety of neladenoson bialanate, how it is tolerated and the way the body absorbs,
      distributes and excretes the study dug given as a single oral dose of 10 mg immediate release
      tablet in participants with renal impairment and healthy participants matched for age-,
      gender-, and weight

      Study was originally designed with 4 arms (normal renal function, mild, moderate, and severe
      renal impairment), however as the study was prematurely terminated, there was no participant
      with normal renal function enrolled
