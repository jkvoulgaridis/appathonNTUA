  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect data in a real-world environment, for a digital
      therapeutic that delivers CBT-I through a decentralized clinical trial, open to participants
      with chronic insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-access, open-label, decentralized clinical trial to collect real-world
      evidence for PEAR-003A, a digital therapeutic delivering CBT-I.

      Potential participants will answer an online prescreening questionnaire to determine
      eligibility. Qualifying participants will proceed to complete 6 weekly modules through their
      personal mobile phone or tablet in nine weeks. A series of the assessment and questionnaires
      will be administered at set points during the study. Participants will be asked to complete a
      follow-up module about 26 weeks, and at Day 243 and Day 428 after completing treatment.

      A subset of approximately 34 participants will also be asked to partake in a optional user
      experience sub study. The participant will be asked to provide study feedback by either
      completing a five-day diary or an interview.
