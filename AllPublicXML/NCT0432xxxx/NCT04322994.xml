  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      THRIVE (Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange) refers to the use of
      high-flow nasal cannula to augment the ability to oxygenate and ventilate a patient under
      general anesthesia. The use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation during
      anesthesia for surgical procedures has been a recent development in the adult population,
      with limited data analyzing the pediatric population. This study will determine whether high
      flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation during surgical or endoscopic procedures can
      prevent desaturation events in children under anesthesia and improve the outcomes of that
      surgery.

    <description>Treatment subjects will undergo the scheduled procedure, with the difference being that a high-flow nasal cannula will be applied prior to the start of the procedure and removed following the procedure's conclusion. While applied, the cannula will deliver high- flow rate oxygen, air, or a mixture of variable oxygen concentration (21-100%) depending on the surgical conditions and requirements. The rate will be set at 1-4L/kg/min with a maximum of 70L/min. Participants in the treatment arm will then proceed to the recovery area as usual. Following recovery from anesthesia, a brief questionnaire will be provided to applicable patients or their parents / guardians / representatives.
