  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a brain stimulation technique known
      as transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS, on the benefits of Prolonged Exposure
      therapy, or PE, which is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
      tDCS has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for influencing brain activity by passing
      a weak electrical current through the scalp. In this study, tDCS is provided in addition to
      PE treatment, through the National Crime Victim's Research and Treatment Center at MUSC, or
      the PTSD Clinical Team Clinic within the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.

      This project implements a multiple baseline within-subject clinical trial design aiming to
      test whether tDCS targeting excitation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can enhance a
      standard course of PE in a sample of adult civilians and Veterans (ages 18-65) who meet full
      DSM-5 criteria for chronic PTSD (i.e., &gt; 3 months post-trauma; N = 20). All participants will
      receive a total of ten 60-min. sessions of manualized PE, preceded by 20 min. of either
      active or sham HD-tDCS. The stepped-wedge multiple baseline design features tDCS as a 2-level
      within-subject factor (Sham tDCS+PE vs. Active tDCS+PE), and between-subject comparisons
      based on stratified random assignment to cross-over from sham to active tDCS just prior to
      sessions 4 through 8. Strata will be defined by dichotomous classifications of possible
      confounds, including baseline severity (moderate vs. severe), psychotropic medication status
      (no vs. yes), and sex (female vs. male). The sample will consist of treatment-seeking
      civilian and Veteran participants referred by either of two of our consortium sites,
      including the National Crime Victim's Research and Treatment Center (NCVC) at MUSC, or the
      PTSD Clinical Team (PCT) at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC, as well as community participants who
      respond to study advertisements.

    <masking_description>Customized software involving use of a coding scheme will be used to allow complete blinding to whether active or sham tDCS is administered. The participants, tDCS administrators, therapists, and outcome assessors will remain blind to tDCS condition.

    <description>Participants will receive 20 min. of either sham or active tDCS prior to PE sessions using a 1 x 1 tDCS device with a ring electrode configuration that allows relatively excitatory and focal stimulation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Electrodes consist of sponges in a silicone rubber holder with a metal mesh conductor saturated with normal saline. A center anode (2.5 cm diameter) and a ring-shaped cathode (diameter inner/outer: 9.2/11.50 cm) will be centered over the dmPFC, with the anode placed the midline at 15% of the Fz to FPz distance. Active stimulation will commence with a 15 sec. ramping up period to target current (1.5 mA), followed by constant current for 20 min., and a 15 sec. ramping down period. For all sham sessions, stimulation will be immediately ramped down over a 15 sec. period following the initial ramping up period, and subsequently ramped up over 15 sec. prior to the final ramping down period.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive 10 weekly sessions of standard Prolonged Exposure Therapy, or PE, which is a gold standard trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatment for PTSD. The first sessions (1-2) predominately consist of psychoeducation about PTSD and the rationale for treatment, whereas subsequent sessions (3-10) consist of imaginal and in vivo exposure, involving repeated, prolonged, systematic, and deliberate practice approaching trauma reminders, as well as cognitive and emotional processing reactions to an index trauma memory.</description>
