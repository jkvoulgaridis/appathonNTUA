    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized and controlled study of the effects of
      weight loss and reduced visceral fat on non-alcoholic fat infiltration into liver after a
      very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCK diet) (Pronokal® Method) versus a hypocaloric diet,
      with a 6-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will include obese patients with BMI higher than 30 kg / m2 to follow a
      standardized multidisciplinary weight-loss program (PronoKal® Method), which consists of a
      very-low-calorie diet, into which natural foods are gradually reintroduced, accompanied by
      physical exercise and emotional support, versus hypocaloric diet.

      The aim of this study are see the reduction of fatty liver, visceral fat and improvement of
      hepatic stiffness during the weight loss treatment.

      Patients will be visited monthly and data will recorded on 4 occasions: pre-inclusion,
      initial visit, 2-months visit (end of ketosis) and 6-months visit.

      Hepatic fatty infiltration and visceral fat will be scanned by MRI and hepatic stiffness will
      be assessed by MR Elastography at: baseline, 2 months and 6 months. Also will be recorded
      anthropometric data (weight, BMI, waist circumference) and complete blood tests.
