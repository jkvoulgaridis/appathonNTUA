  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 28 patients who were followed-up in our clinic and received botulinum toxin
      injection of lower extremities in the last month were randomized to two groups in the study.
      Group 1 received conventional physiotherapy and Group 2 received robot-assisted gait
      training. The treatment period was 30 min/day, five sessions in a week, 15 sessions in total,
      for both groups. The study population was evaluated using range of joint motion evaluation
      chart, the Modified Ashworth Scale, The Gross Motor Function Classification System, The Berg
      Balance Scale, the functional independence measure for children, and the Edinburgh Visual
      Gait Score

    <measure>The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Classification System or GMFCS is a 5 level clinical classification system that describes the gross motor function of people with cerebral palsy on the basis of self-initiated movement abilities.</description>

    <measure>The Edinburgh Visual Gait Scale (EVGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh visual gait score is an evaluative tool that uses software and video cameras to provide 3D video gait analysis as well as onscreen drawing and measurement tools to evaluate each portion of gait. The software will then generate a EVGS report, with illustrative images from the video if desired, in PDF format.</description>
