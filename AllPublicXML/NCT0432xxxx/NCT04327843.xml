  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed, three phase project will refine and test a first-ever care approach in SSA that
      combines LAI with a behavioral program specifically intended to promote medication adherence
      in chronic psychotic disorders (CPDs). In addition to the novel focus, innovative elements
      include: 1.) a manualized curriculum that targets specific barriers and facilitators to
      medication adherence in Tanzanians with CPD, 2.) targeting known, high-risk individuals with
      CPD (those who miss â‰¥20% of prescribed antipsychotic medication, and 3.) using existing
      injection clinic health workers to deliver the adherence promotion program. Strengths include
      the highly generalizable methods and use of LAIs that are available in low-resource settings.

    <textblock>
      In this Phase 3 portion, the study team will select appropriate measures, train staff and
      build capacity in measure implementation, and finalize the intervention for delivery by
      healthcare workers. Finally, in a training/proof-of-concept exercise, the healthcare workers
      will implement the adapted CAE-L in a high-risk sample of Tanzanians with CPD (individuals
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have had recent medication adherence
      problems). Taken together, the proposed project has substantial public health importance. It
      will provide the prerequisite materials, training and infrastructure needed for a prospective
      trial in reducing CPD burden and improving brain health in Tanzania and other countries in
      Sub-Saharan Africa.

      The focus of this project is on feasibility, patient acceptability, and research
      capacity-building. Therefore a specific hypothesis is not being tested. The investigators
      will assess descriptive statistics and change from baseline in the primary and secondary
      measures using standard pre-post techniques.

    <measure>Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The TRQ evaluates adherence to medications via a brief self-report instrument that has been validated in populations with bipolar disorder medication adherence. The TRQ identifies nonadherent individuals, defined as those who miss 20-30% or more of their medication in the last week or month. Total scores are represented as a percentage and range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater level of nonadherence (higher scores indicate worse adherence to medications).</description>

    <measure>Long-Acting Injectable Adherence (LAI Adherence)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>LAI injection adherence will be determined as a proportion of LAI injections received at the appropriate time (within 7 days of scheduled time).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>DAI-10 scoring ranges from -10 to +10 with a total score &gt;0 indicating a positive attitude toward psychiatric medications and a total score of &lt;0 indicating a negative attitude toward psychiatric medications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS measures levels of mania. There are 24 items, scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 to 6. Total scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating higher levels of mania.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The minimum possible score is 1 and the maximum score is 7. A higher score implies a worse condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFAS measures social and occupational functioning independent of the overall severity of the individual's psychological symptoms. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher rating implies a higher level of functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item screening tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems. Questions 1-8 are scored on a scale of 0-4 and questions 9 &amp; 10 are scored on a scale of 0-2. A score of 8 or more is considered to indicate hazardous or harmful alcohol use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The ASSIST is an 8 item questionnaire designed to be useable across a variety of cultures to screen for use of the following substances: tobacco products, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), sedatives and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines), hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, 'other' drugs. The ASSIST determines a risk score for each substance which is used to start a discussion (brief intervention) with clients about their substance use. The scores from questions 2 through to 7 are added together across each individual substance to produce an ASSIST risk score for each substance.
A score of 0-3 (0-10 for alcohol) indicated a lower risk of dependency. A score of 4-26 (11-26 for alcohol) indicates a moderate risk of dependency. A score of 27+ indicates a high risk for dependency.</description>

    <intervention_name>Customized Adherence Enhancement</intervention_name>
    <description>Customized Adherence Enhancement (CAE): CAE targets key areas relevant to adherence in chronic psychotic disorders (CPD): 1.) inadequate understanding of mental disorder, 2.) lack of adequate medication-taking routines, 3.) poor communication with care providers and 4.) substance use which interferes with adherence and recovery. CAE delivered components are selected based upon findings from the ROMI and AMSQ. CAE will be delivered in approximately 8 sessions by a nurse interventionist, ideally at the same time that the long-acting injectable (LAI) is administered.The intervention is guided by a detailed manual and uses components and resources that are available in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Social worker interventionists will be trained to deliver CAE-L.</description>

    <intervention_name>Haloperidol Decanoate</intervention_name>
    <description>Long-acting injectable (LAI): Patients on oral haloperidol will be switched to haloperidol decanoate per manufacturer's package insert. Individuals not on antipsychotic medication at the time of screening assessment or who are on a different antipsychotic medication, will receive an oral tolerance test (OTT) consisting of up to 14 days of oral haloperidol 2-5 mg once or twice daily. If the OTT suggests good tolerability, the participant will then receive LAI (haloperidol decanoate) intramuscularly after completion of baseline assessments. Dosing of LAI will be as clinically indicated using conservative dosing to minimize drug-related adverse effects. In the CWRU studies, mean end-point dose of haloperidol decanoate was 68.0 mg, SD 21.1, Range 50-100 mg/monthly injection. It is anticipated that patients will continue on the same dose for 6 months, although dose changes will be permitted based upon clinical status. Each study participant will receive up to 8 injections during the study.</description>
