  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected with osteoarthritis knee have associated with pain and inflammation of the
      joint capsule, impaired muscular stabilization, decrease range of motion and functional
      disability. Laser therapy, phonophoresis, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
      conventional physiotherapy exercises has innumerable benefits to the patients with knee
      osteoarthritis (KOA).However, it is still not clear which treatment is effective among them
      in rehabilitating the patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Aim is to establish
      the benefits of High intensity Laser therapy, phonophoresis, tDCS and conventional
      physiotherapy in the treatment of patient with chronic KOA living in the hilly terrain. A
      total of 160 patients with chronic KOA will be recruited by the simple random sampling
      (random number generator) to participate in randomized, double blind randomized controlled,
      study. Recruited patients with chronic KOA will be randomly divided into four groups, high
      intensity-laser therapy (HILT) group, ibuprofen gel phonophoresis (IGP) group, transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) group and conventional physiotherapy (CPT) group. Duration
      of the treatment will be 8 minutes in one session/knee joint for HILT and IGP and 30 minutes
      in one session for tDCS each day for 3 days/week for 8 weeks. Thus, each patient with chronic
      KOA will receive 24 sessions in total. The Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Digitalized pain pressure algometer (ALGO-DS-01) and 36-Item
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire are the outcome measures will be recorded at
      baseline, end of 8-week post-intervention period.

    <description>Pain intensity will be measured using calibrated digitalized pain pressure algometer (ALGO-DS-01) in patients with KOA. Sensor digital algometer is force gauge with computer size which is highly accurate. The ALGO-DS-01 is chosen for the assessment of pain for Mechanical sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which is a reliable and valid tool for assessing sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The inter rater reliability of pressure pain algometer was demonstrated to be moderate to good reliability with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of (0.62-0.84)</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be measured at baseline and end of 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) will be was used to evaluate the disease-specific self-reported symptoms of OA.48 This form is comprised of 24 questions in three categories including pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and physical function (17 questions). These 24 items are presented in a five-point Likert (0-4) scale, where higher scores indicate the higher intensity of the related symptom. The minimal clinical important difference of WOMAC at 2 month of intervention is found to be, 14.1 The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be measured at baseline and end of 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) is a very popular instrument for evaluating Health-Related Quality of Life (QoL). The SF-36 measures eight scales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). There are two distinct concepts measured by the SF-36: a physical dimension, represented by the Physical Component Summary (PCS), and a mental dimension, represented by the Mental Component Summary (MCS). SF-36 is used to assess QoL in patient with KOA.
The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
