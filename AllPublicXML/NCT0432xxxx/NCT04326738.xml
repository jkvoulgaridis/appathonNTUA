  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone is commonly used in clinical practice.However, intravenous dexamethasone sodium
      phosphate may cause perineal discomfort.With the popularization of comfortable medical
      technology, patients have higher and higher requirements for comfortable medical
      treatment.Perineal pruritus caused by intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate may cause
      adverse physiological and psychological effects on patients and increase the incidence of
      unpleasant experiences during anesthesia.Therefore, it is very important to find a practical
      and effective method of inhibition.Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine commonly used
      in clinical practice, which has been proved to effectively inhibit the itching caused , while
      its effect on the itching caused by dexamethasone has not been reported.By observing the
      effect of pre-injection midazolam on the perineal itching caused by dexamethasone sodium
      phosphate, this experiment intends to preliminarily explore its possible mechanism .

    <textblock>
      Nighty patients scheduled for selective surgery,aged 18-65years,ASA physical status I~II,BMI
      18~30kg·m-2 were selected in this study.The patients were equally randomized into two groups:
      midazolam (M) group and normal saline (N) group, 45 cases in each group. Before anesthesia
      induction, M group received intravenous injection of 0.03mg·kg-1 (1mg·ml-1) midazolam, while
      N group received corresponding intravenous normal saline of the same volume. After 1 min,
      both groups received intravenous injection of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection of
      10mg (injection was completed in 2s). The anesthesiologist assessed perineal irritation in
      both groups and recorded the number of cases,visual analogue scores (VAS) ,duration of
      itching or pain,Ramsay scores and observed the occurrence of adverse reactions such as
      dizziness and respiratory depression in the two groups.
