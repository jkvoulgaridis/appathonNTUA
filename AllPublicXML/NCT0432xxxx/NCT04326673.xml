  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate Sal-T against standard biomarkers of male gonadal status based on
      serum T, calculated free T and BAT. The optimal salivary sampling in terms of fasting and
      time of day will also be defined.

      The ultimate aim is to add Sal-T into the Trust's repertoire of tests in investigating
      suspected hypogonadism in men.

      To investigate whether salivary (free) testosterone is subject to similar prandial variations
      reported for serum total testosterone.

      Study 1:

      Assessment of diurnal variation in salivary testosterone adjusted for prandial state in 20
      healthy men.

      Study 2:

      Measurement of salivary and serum testosterone and related biomarkers before and after a
      standard 75g oral glucose load in 40 men.
