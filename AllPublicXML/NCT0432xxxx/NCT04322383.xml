      Background:

      Most people with hairy cell leukemia have a BRAF gene mutation. They can be treated with BRAF
      inhibitors, drugs that target this mutation. For people who do not have this mutation, BRAF
      inhibitors are not a treatment option. We found that in hairy cell leukemia, when BRAF is not
      mutated, the MEK gene frequently is. Binimetinib is a MEK inhibitor which targets MEK. It is
      important to determine if this drug can be a good treatment option in those who cannot
      benefit treatment with BRAF inhibitors.

      Objective:

      To see if binimetinib is an effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia that does not have a
      BRAF mutation.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with hairy cell leukemia without a mutation in the BRAF gene and
      whose disease either did not respond to treatment or came back after treatment

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Lung and heart tests

        -  Eye exam

        -  Bone marrow biopsy: A needle will be injected through the participant s skin into the
           bone to remove a sample of marrow.

        -  CT or MRI scan: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They
           might receive a contrast agent by vein.

      Before they start treatment, participants will have an abdominal ultrasound, pulmonary
      function tests, and exercise stress tests.

      Participants will take binimetinib by mouth twice daily in 28-day cycles. They will keep a
      medication diary.

      Participants will have at least one visit before every cycle. Visits will include repeats of
      some screening tests.

      Participants may continue treatment as long as their disease does not get worse and they do
      not have bad side effects.

      About a month after their last dose of treatment, participants will have a follow-up visit.
      They will then have visits once a year.

      Background:

        -  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell leukemia comprising 2% of all leukemias,
           or approximately 1900 new cases per year in the US.

        -  BRAF V600E mutation is very common in classic HCL.

        -  HCL variant (HCLv) is wild type for BRAF and is more aggressive compared to classic HCL
           due to its lower response and shorter duration of response to standard purine analog
           chemotherapy. The median survival is only ~6 years compared to &gt;25 years for classic
           HCL.

        -  CD25+ classic-appearing HCL-cells that express unmutated IGHV4-34+ immunoglobulin
           rearrangement, are wild-type for BRAF, and confer a poor prognosis when treated with
           standard purine analog chemotherapy.

        -  While BRAF and MEK combination inhibition is making an impact in the treatment of BRAF
           V600E mutated HCL, this treatment is not applicable for patients with BRAF-WT HCL/HCLv.
           Furthermore, with poor survival outcomes in this patient population, lack of targeted
           therapy constitutes a clear unmet need.

        -  Recently, several BRAF WT HCL/HCLv patients have received MEK inhibitors by
           compassionate use and have had lifesaving partial to complete remission, however the
           response has not been assessed systematically in clinical trials.

        -  Binimetinib (also known as MEK162) is an orally bioavailable, selective and potent
           mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK1 and MEK2) inhibitor, which is
           approved for use in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with
           BRAF-mutant melanoma

        -  We have described MAP2K1 (MEK) mutations which may drive the aggressive clinical
           behavior of BRAF WT HCL/HCLv patients, but MEK inhibition may be clinically useful even
           in these patients without known MAP2K1 (MEK) mutations.

      Objective:

      -To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to binimetinib, in patients with BRAF WT HCL
      and HCLv.

      Eligibility:

        -  BRAF WT HCL or HCLv with at least 1 prior purine analog treatment

        -  Need for treatment as evidenced by any one of the following: ANC &lt;1 x10^3/mcL, Hgb
           &lt;10g/dL, Platelet count &lt;100 x10^3/mcL, leukemia cell count &gt;5 x10^3/mcL, symptomatic
           splenomegaly, enlarging HCL mass &gt; 2cm in short axis.

        -  Greater than 18 years of age

        -  No uncontrolled infection, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, or secondary malignancy
           requiring treatment.

        -  No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
           prior to the start of study treatment.

      Design:

        -  Single arm phase 2 trial to determine ORR in patients with relapsed/refractory BRAF WT
           HCL and HCLv.

        -  2-phase minimax design will be used to rule out an unacceptable 10% in favor of an
           improved 25% ORR.

        -  Initially 16 evaluable patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more achieve a major response,
           then accrual will continue to a total of 31 evaluable patients.

        -  Binimetinib will be given at a dose of 45mg BID for as long as patients can continue
           dosing chronically without significant toxicity.

        therapy fluctuate and become ineligible up until the time of the initiation of study
        therapy.

          -  Refractory or relapsed disease - defined as either:

               -  Refractory- no response or disease progression in less than or equal to 1 year

               -  Relapsed- having relapsed following treatment with at least 1 prior purine-analog
                  treatments

          -  Patients must be BRAF WT as confirmed from fresh bone marrow aspirate and/or
             peripheral blood sample, or lymph node/mass by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI

          -  Patients who are ineligible for, unable to obtain in a timely manner, cannot access,
             unwilling to undergo or have failed Moxetumomab Pasudotox trial at NCI

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 3x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless
             consistent with Gilbert s (ratio between total and direct bilirubin &gt; 5)

          -  Fibrinogen greater than or equal to 0.5x lower limit of normal

          -  The effects of binimetinib on the developing human fetus are unknown therefore
             participants must use effective methods of contraception as directed below.

               -  Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) who are sexually active with a
                  nonsterilized male partner must use a highly effective method of contraception
                  and not donate ova prior to study entry and or the duration of study treatment
                  and until 30 days after the last dose of binimetinib. Periodic abstinence, the
                  rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not
                  surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                  complete hysterectomy) or those who are premenarchal or postmenopausal (defined
                  as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). A highly
                  effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure
                  rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Not all
                  methods of contraception are highly effective. Female subjects must use a
                  hormonal method in addition to a barrier method alone, to minimize the chance of
                  pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
                  her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
                  physician immediately.

               -  Non-sterilized male participants who are sexually active with a female partner of
                  childbearing potential must agree to use methods of contraception that are highly
                  effective or acceptable, and not donate sperm from study entry until 90 days
                  after the last dose of binimetinib.

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

          -  Must co-enroll in study 10-C-0066: Collection of Human Samples to Study Hairy Cell and
             other Leukemias, and to Develop Recombinant Immunotoxins for Cancer Treatment

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior
             to the start of study treatment.

          -  Prior therapy with binimetinib.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or have received an
             investigational agent within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment.

          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery less than or equal to 6 weeks prior to start
             of study treatment or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any component of binimetinib or its
             excipients.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of
             the study treatment, starting with the screening visit . Pregnant women are excluded
             from this study because binimetinib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with binimetinib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, cardiac disfunction (details as below), uncontrolled pulmonary infection,

               5. History or presence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (including
                  resting bradycardia, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or uncontrolled paroxysmal
                  supraventricular tachycardia);

               6. Triplicate average baseline QTcF interval greater than or equal to 480 ms.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or disease which may significantly alter the
             absorption of study drug (e.g., active ulcerative disease, uncontrolled vomiting or

          -  History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events less than or equal to 12 weeks
             prior to the first dose of study treatment. Examples include transient ischemic
             attacks, cerebrovascular accidents, hemodynamically significant (i.e. massive or
             sub-massive) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli.

        Note: Patients with either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not result in
        hemodynamic instability are allowed to enroll as long as they are on a stable dose of
        anticoagulants for at least 4 weeks.

        Note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or other
        procedures may be enrolled.
