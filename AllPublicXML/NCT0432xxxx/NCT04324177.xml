    <measure>Number of patients according to age groups and gender</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The demographic data (including age groups and gender).
Regarding age groups, the number of patients in each of three groups will be addressed:
1 month to 2 years of age
2 years to 12 years of age
12 to 18 years of age&quot;
Regarding gender, the number of patients will be allocated in 2 groups:
male
female</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients according to diagnosis on admission</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Provisional diagnosis on admission categorised by the system affected (respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological, renal, endocrinal and metabolic gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, multi system affection, others (post operative, post arrest, sepsis syndrome, malignancies, poisoning, coma of unknownorigin)). The data will be presented as number of patients in each group of system affected.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients according to referral site</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be allocated in 2 groups of referral sites of patients admitted to the PICU:
the ward
the emergency department. Data will be presented as number of patients in each group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients according to the need for mechanical ventilation and its duration</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be allocated in 2 groups based on the need for mechanical ventilation duringthe PICU stay. In case of need for mechanical ventilation, the duration will be recorded in days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of stay in days</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) will be presented as number of days spent by the patient from admission to discharge or death.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Risk of Mortality score on admission</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Risk of Mortlaity (PRISM) III score will be obtained from all patients within the first 24 hours of admission to the PICU. The maximum total PRISM III score is 74. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. For the analysis of mortality risk factors, patients will be allocated into two groups according to PRISM III 24 score values &gt;8 and â‰¤ 8, based on previously published data showing increased mortality risk in patients with PRISM III 24 score &gt;8.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>

improvent and transfer to the corresponding medical ward. (Survivors)
death. N.B. patients who will be discharged against medical advice (DAMA) will be excluded from the proposed data analysis, but will be pointed at.</description>
