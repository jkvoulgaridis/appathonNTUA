      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalency of two preparations of
      CM082 tablet in Chinese healthy volunteers under fasted state or after meal. In addition, the
      safety of single dose administration of CM082 tablet in Chinese healthy volunteers will also
      be evaluated.
