  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examine the feasibility and efficacy of Avanzando Juntas, a four-month
      community-based lifestyle intervention rooted in the evidence-based Moving Forward lifestyle
      intervention developed with and for AA breast cancer survivors. This intervention was adapted
      in collaboration with Hispanic/Latina BC &amp; GC survivors. It will offer twice-weekly sessions
      aimed at supporting adherence to ACS nutrition and physical activity guidelines to promote
      weight loss and improved quality of life.

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1. To adapt the Moving Forward weight loss intervention for overweight/obese Hispanic BCS
      using an iterative process engaging Hispanic BCS and a community advisory committee.

      Aim 2. To conduct a randomized pilot with 40 overweight/obese Hispanic BCS to establish the
      feasibility of the adapted Moving Forward program based on recruitment, adherence, retention
      and efficacy.

      Aim 3. To explore the effects of the adapted Moving Forward program (Avanzando Juntas) on
      anthropometric (weight, % body fat, lean mass), behavioral (dietary intake, physical
      activity) psychosocial (quality of life) and biological (cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c,
      adiponectin, leptin, inflammation, insulin resistance) outcomes.

      Hypothesis: Women in the weight loss program will exhibit improvements in outcomes compared
      to women in the wait list control group.

      Avanzando Juntas supports BC &amp; GC survivors in adopting physical activity and eating patterns
      to promote weight loss, bolster QOL and reduce the risk for comorbidities and, potentially,
      BC &amp; GC recurrence. A strong, multidisciplinary study team provides expertise in culturally
      competent programs for Hispanic BCS, cognitive behavioral lifestyle interventions, body
      composition, breast cancer and program adaptation.

      This study is novel in its focus on weight loss among Hispanic BCS and the incorporation of
      anthropometric, behavioral, biological and psychosocial outcomes. An additional strength is
      the foundation of community partnerships that will support the current study's efforts, as
      well as those for a larger trial, and, if successful, the dissemination of the program.

    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. PROMIS measures physical function, depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social roles, pain interference, social isolation, cognitive function, support, self-efficacy and sexual function. The final score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For negatively-worded concepts like pain interference, a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison, a pain interference T-score of 40 is one SD better than average.</description>

    <description>The Intervention will be conducted in a cohort of 20 (anticipated) and is designed to increase self-efficacy, social support and perceived access to healthy eating and exercise resources and promote weight loss. Participants assigned to the Guided Lifestyle Program will participate in twice weekly sessions - the first weekly session will be 120 minutes in length with the first hour addressing lifestyle change education and strategies. The second hour will be supervised exercise including aerobics and resistance training. The second weekly session will be a one-hour supervised exercise session. Participants will also receive 2-3 text messages weekly.They will also receive a participant informational binder with health and exercise information and tools as directed by ACS nutrition and physical activity guidelines.The Guided Lifestyle program is four months long (16 weeks). Please note, the Guided Lifestyle program participants will be offered a booster session off-study.</description>
