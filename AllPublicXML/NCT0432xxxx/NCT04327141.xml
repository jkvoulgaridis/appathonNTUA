    <textblock>
      This study will systematically quantify the effects of protein pacing and intermittent
      fasting (PP-IF) on total and regional (abdominal) body composition (lean mass and fat mass),
      blood glucose and lipids, and anti-aging biomarkers, hunger ratings, and the gut microbiome
      in 40 overweight/obese middle-aged men (n=20) and women (n=20) following a 12-week weight
      loss intervention. Participants will be enrolled in the study as a single cohort and
      participate in a 12-week weight loss (WL) trial consisting of a single dietary intervention
      phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown combined protein pacing and intermittent fasting (PP-IF; 1-2 days
      per week) combined with moderate (20-30%) caloric restriction (CR) favorably enhance weight
      loss, body composition, cardiometabolic disease risk, oxidative stress and toxin levels
      compared to a heart healthy diet in obese individuals following both weight loss and weight
      loss maintenance (Arciero et al. 2016; He et al. 2017; Zuo et al. 2016). However, less is
      known about whether a low sugar intake with this dietary pattern induces other significant
      health improvements, such as enhanced brain health (mood state) and gut microbiome anti-aging
      indices, compared to a heart healthy diet. The novelty of the current proposal is of
      particular relevance and importance given the heightened popularity of low sugar dietary
      patterns shown to enhance health status. Most notably, among these low sugar diets touting
      the health benefits, are the ketogenic, paleolithic and Mediterranean diets. In addition,
      there is a great deal of public health emphasis on reducing overall carbohydrate intake,
      especially simple sugars, to improve cardiometabolic, gut, and body composition health. The
      dangers of high simple sugar intake are numerous, including increased risk for
      cardiometabolic disease (high blood lipids, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, systemic
      inflammation, oxidative stress, obesity, elevated visceral fat, etc.). Thus, improvements in
      body composition and reductions in disease risk provides compelling evidence to pursue this
      study with vigor so as to generate a viable and healthy weight and fat loss strategy over the
      long term.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a low sugar protein pacing,
      intermittent fasting (PP-IF) diet versus a heart healthy diet on indices of body weight,
      total and regional body composition, mood state, anti-aging, and cardiometabolic outcomes,
      and the gut microbiome during weight loss (0-12 weeks). Specifically, this study aims to
      compare a PP-IF diet comprised of five days of a calorie-restricted (1200 calories/day women;
      1500 calories/day men) protein pacing diet (PP, 4 meals/day) followed by a 2-day fast (IF,
      ~350-450 kcals/day) for weeks 1-4, followed by 6 days of a PP diet and a 1 day IF for weeks
      5-12 compared to an established calorie-restricted (1200 calories/day for women; 1500
      calories/day men) heart healthy (HH) diet.
