    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate and utilize spinal cord stimulation (SCS) as an
      effective approach to eliciting weight loss and potentially alleviating Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (DM), as evidenced by increasing metabolism of adipose tissue.

      This research study aims to investigate possible activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT)
      metabolism by upper thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We believe that our
      multidisciplinary research team presents a unique opportunity to test whether SCS can
      activate BAT metabolism, as tested during a routine screening procedure for spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) for pain control. Our marker for BAT activation is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG) - positron emission tomography (PET), which has previously been used to gauge
      cold-evoked BAT activation, and other studies of BAT in humans. We believe this
      proof-of-concept study could pave the way for a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of
      morbid obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

    <description>All subjects will have two PET/CT scans on days 3 and 5 after SCS electrode implantation: (1) Baseline and (2) SCS-activated. Other than SCS activation, both studies will be conducted under identical conditions. For the first scan, subjects will be randomly assigned to either a baseline (no SCS during PET/CT) or with SCS during PET/CT prior to the day of their first scan. The second scan will complete the sequence with either a baseline or SCS-activated scan, as randomized.</description>

    <description>A second electrode will be placed percutaneously by Tuohy needle in the epidural space at the same time as the SCS trial implant; at lateral T1-2 area randomly assigned to the left or right side of the lateral epidural space, at the time of the procedure. Placement of electrodes is not experimental, but the placement of a second electrode is a research-driven procedure.</description>
