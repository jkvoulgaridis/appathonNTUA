  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled design with approximately 26 biweekly sessions over 12 months, the
      investigators propose to test the effectiveness of an ECHO-based intervention for improving
      the use of clozapine in people eligible for clozapine. The sessions will include: 1) active
      dissemination of knowledge and information by an expert &quot;hub&quot; followed by 2) clozapine case
      presentations and vignettes submitted by the &quot;spokes&quot;.

      This intervention, Clozapine CHAMPION-ECHO (Center for Help and Assistance for Maryland
      Prescribers- Improving Outcomes Network using Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes,
      will be referred to as &quot;CHAMPION&quot; throughout.. To minimize ANC monitoring barriers and
      maximize recruitment, the investigators will provide Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)-cleared ANC point of care (POC) monitoring devices to all study sites, including those
      in the control condition. The investigators will enroll at least 300 prescribers and
      additional clinical team members (up to 300) from 60 outpatient mental health clinics (OMHCs)
      and other treatment sites; approximately half the OHMCs will be randomized to CHAMPION and
      half randomized to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU).

    <measure>change in clozapine prescriptions using Medicaid claims data</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and endpoint changes after 12 month intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The data outcome is new clozapine prescriptions by provider based on a variable linking provider ID to clozapine prescriptions. The outcome is the increase in the proportion of patients treated with clozapine for those in the care of prescribers randomized to the CHAMPION relative to the ETAU condition.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in prescriber knowledge of clozapine use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and endpoint changes after 12 month intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 52 item Multiple Choice Questionnaire will be used to assess knowledge. The knowledge-based test questions will consist of 2 questions per 26 topic areas and will conform to best practices and guidelines for design of the questions. The total mean score will range from 0-52. The questions were developed and validated by the team.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported competence for clozapine use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and endpoint changes after 12 month intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a mean score on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-100 mm). We will have one for overall competence and then one for each of the 26 topic areas. Overall, self report scores and the global self report scores will be used.</description>
