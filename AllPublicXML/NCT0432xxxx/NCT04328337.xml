  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand the role of brain glucose transport in individuals
      with obesity and the association with cerebral hypometabolism and these individuals' response
      to plasma glucose elevations. The main premise is that obesity leads to reduced brain glucose
      transport and that we can measure this reduction with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
      The secondary premises are that this reduction is driven by elevated non esterified fatty
      acids which act to turn on specific signaling pathways that regulate brain GLUT1 levels.

      There are 2 aims of this study. The intent of aim 1 is to measure the effect of obesity on
      glucose transport and metabolism in the human brain. This study aim will be conducted in
      non-diabetic, obese individuals and age- and HbA1c-matched normal weight individuals. A total
      of 15 non-diabetic - normal weight individuals and 15 obese individuals will be enrolled.

      The second aim randomizes 40 non-diabetic, normal weight individuals. The intent of aim 2 is
      to determine whether acute elevation of NEFA levels in lean, healthy individuals will alter
      cerebral glucose transport. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either
      intralipid or normal saline.

      The focus of this protocol registration is the randomized portion of the study (aim 2).
