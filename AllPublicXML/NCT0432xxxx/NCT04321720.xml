  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to explore whether different dosages of mustard flour in footbaths cause different
      effects on warmth development as well as on general well-being and the autonomic nervous
      system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded, four-arm randomized controlled trial with crossover design to explore the
      dose-response relationship of footbaths with different dosages of mustard flour in healthy
      volunteers, compared to a placebo control (footbath with warm water only). The main focus is
      on thermogenesis and warmth distribution, as assessed by high-resolution infrared
      thermography and questionnaire data before, during and after the intervention. In addition,
      effects on the autonomic nervous system are assessed by measuring various parameters of heart
      rate variability and pulse wave analysis.
