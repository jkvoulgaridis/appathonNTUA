  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the potential effects of surgical drilling noise
      and/or vibration exposure on the hearing in the ear contralateral to the surgical site during
      skull-based surgeries

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-speed drills that are capable of producing elevated levels are used during skull based
      surgeries (Hilmi et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014). Recently, it has been shown that surgical
      drilling may have a temporary effect on the amplitude of the otoacoustic emissions of the ear
      contralateral to the surgical site (Baradaranfar et al., 2015; Shenoy et al., 2015), however
      the temporary effects of surgical noise or vibration on the hearing of the non-surgical
      related ear needs to be better quantified. This study aims to to measure the potential
      effects of surgical drilling noise and/or vibration exposure on the hearing in the non
      operative ear, during surgical site during skull-based or mastoid surgeries. As part of the
      study patient will receive Audiometry for extended high frequencies, DPOAE, ECochG before and
      after the procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  participants are undergoing a skull-based or mastoid surgery for treatment of an
             affected ear

          -  participants have normal or near-normal hearing thresholds in the un-operated ear

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  participants have hearing loss (PTA &gt; 40 dB HL) in pure tone audiometry testing before
             surgery in the un-operated ear

          -  participants have medical conditions after the surgery which prevents having hearing
             tests

          -  participants have abnormal tympanometric results
