  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates how people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders
      make approach-avoidance decisions and which brain regions are implicated in such decisions.
      In addition, the study test the role of the nociceptin receptor (NOPR) in MDD and anxiety
      disorders. Information collected through MRI, plasma assays, and behavioral tasks will be
      used to predict depressive symptoms in the future.

      The overarching goals of this research are to investigate: (1) neural substrates of
      approach/avoidance behaviors in current and remitted MDD and anxiety disorders; (2) effects
      of either 40 mg of a NOPR antagonist (BTRX-246040) or placebo on behavioral, neural and
      computational processes in current MDD and anxiety disorders; (3) stress-induced signaling in
      remitted individuals with past MDD; (4) neural markers that prospectively predict disease
      course.

      This will be achieved through an innovative integration of (1) functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) probes of the cortico-striatal-midbrain circuitry during an approach/avoidance
      decision-making task with the administration of BTRX-246040/placebo or a well-established
      stress manipulation (MAST) and (2) assessment of Plasma Orphanin FQ/Nociceptin (PNOC) Levels
      and its interactions with DA system.

    <description>For Study 1.1) BTRX-246040 is a selective orally bioavailable NOPR antagonist. During the MRI visit, under double-blind, a subsample of participants will receive either 40 mg of BTRX-246040 (28 per group) or placebo (28 per group). Because peak BTRX-246040 concentrations are achieved at a median of 2 to 4 hours after dosing with 40mg (similarly across sex), fMRI scanning will start 2 hours post-administration.</description>

        The subjects for this research will be 208 participants (Study 1.1: n = 112; Study 1.2: n =
        96) recruited from the community by the Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research
        (Director: Dr. Diego Pizzagalli, Ph.D.). For Study 1.1, participants will include: (1) 56
        participants with current MDD or anxiety disorders; and (2) 56 demographically matched
        healthy controls. For Study 1.2, participants will include: (1) 48 participants with past
        MDD; and (2) 48 demographically matched healthy controls.
