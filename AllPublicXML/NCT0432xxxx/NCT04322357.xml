  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will determine the potential of low dose weekend prednisone and whether
      exercise training can synergize to delay disease progression and improve muscle
      strength/physical function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Current standard
      of care (daily prednisone) is associated with adverse side effects. Evidence from DMD mouse
      models suggest that weekend dosing provides same efficacy without side effects. Appropriate
      exercise may also benefit but this area has not been adequately explored.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of DMD confirmed by 1) clinical history with features before the age of
             five, 2) physical examination, 3) elevated serum creatine kinase level and 4) absence
             of dystrophin expression, as determined by immunostain or Western blot (&lt;2%) and/or
             DNA confirmation of dystrophin mutation.

          -  Age 5.0 to 8 years: a lower age limit of 5.0 years is selected as children younger
             than that are likely unable to cooperate and comply with all of the exercise measures
             as needed. An upper age limit of 8 years has been set as boys with DMD tend to reach a
             rapid progression into a late ambulatory phase soon after this age.

          -  Ambulatory at the time of the first visit, defined as the ability to walk for at least
             100 m without an external assistive device and able to climb four stairs.

          -  Aim 1 only: GC-na√Øve at baseline (and prior 6 months)

          -  Aim 2 only: on stable daily GC regimen for 6 months prior to baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to an MR examination (e.g. aneurysm clip, severe claustrophobia,
             magnetic implants)

          -  Presence of unstable medical problems, significant concomitant illness including
             cardiomyopathy or cardiac conduction abnormalities

          -  Presence of a secondary condition that impacts muscle function or muscle metabolism
             (e.g. myasthenia gravis, endocrine disorder, mitochondrial disease)

          -  Presence of a secondary condition leading to developmental delay or impaired motor
             control (e.g. cerebral palsy)

          -  Presence of an unstable medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled seizure disorder)

          -  Behavioral problems causing an inability to cooperate during testing or understand
             exercise instruction

          -  Participation in other forms of drug or gene therapy during the period of the study
