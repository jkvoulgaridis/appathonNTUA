  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective dual-center single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the
      safety and feasibility of the SELUTION SLR™ (Sustained Limus Release) 018 drug eluting
      balloon (DEB) for the treatment of failed AV fistula in renal dialysis patients. Patients
      will be randomised to either SELUTION SLR or POBA.

    <measure>Primary Patency</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary patency: Defined as number of patients with uninterrupted patency after the initial intervention with regular ongoing dialysis until symptomatic recurrent stenosis of the dialysis circuit, or thrombosis, mandating repeat treatment, or further surgical intervention of the access circuit or eventual failure/abandonment of the circuit with creation of alternative access for dialysis. This endpoint will be analysed cumulatively at 6 months and with time-to-event methods (e.g. Kaplan Meier) on extended follow-up period to 2 years.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late lumen loss</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Late lumen loss (LLL) defined as the difference between the minimum lumen diameters after angioplasty and at the end of the 6-month follow-up angiogram.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Success</measure>
    <time_frame>During Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Device Success: Defined as successful balloon inflation of the SELUTION catheter for ≥2 minutes and retrieval of the catheter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anatomic success</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after angioplasty</time_frame>
    <description>Anatomic success: Defined as &lt;30% residual stenosis diameter measured immediately after angioplasty.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Success: Defined as an improvement from baseline in the clinical or hemodynamic parameter (e.g., blood flow, venous pressures) that was the initial indicator of fistula dysfunction and the resumption of normal hemodialysis for a minimum of at least 1 session following the procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binary Vessel Restenosis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Binary vessel restenosis: Angiographic restenosis rate defined as the incidence of stenosis ≥50% of the diameter of the reference vessel segment within the treated target lesion.</description>
