    <textblock>
      This study seeks to achieve two aims:

        -  To assess the implementation of Noona software for continuous symptom monitoring for a
           diverse population of patients with thoracic malignancies who are undergoing radiation
           and

        -  To validate remote collection of standardized PRO measures using Noona software.

    <description>It includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Patients respond on a four-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; for most items. Most items use a &quot;past week&quot; recall period. Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a single training session on how to use the Noona software no more than 4 weeks before starting standard of care therapy. They can start using the software immediately after the training session. Patients will be invited to complete either the Chest Radiotherapy (if radiotherapy alone) or Chemotherapy-18 (if chemoradiation therapy) at baseline, weekly throughout therapy, and every other week during follow up for 90-days. Patients will be encouraged by the treatment team to complete the baseline symptom report prior to starting any therapy and to complete the weekly reports during therapy and in follow up. Patients will also complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the NCCN Distress Thermometer at baseline (no more than 3 weeks before starting therapy), within 1 week of completing therapy, and at 90-days follow up. Patients will be encouraged to use Noona's other features beyond invited modules and PRO inventories, such as the diary during the study</description>

    <description>Enrolled patients will be provided with login information for their Noona account. Patients will log in to the Noona symptom monitoring system using their own computer hardware. Any type of personal computer or compatible mobile device will be allowed (i.e. iPhone, Android phone). Patients will be able to access the Noona system from any internet access point and will be provided with the hospital/clinic public WiFi information.</description>
