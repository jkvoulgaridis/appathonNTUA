  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to examine whether there is a discriminating ability of the
      breath sample analysis to capture biomarkers specific to the HCC in the breath of affected
      individuals. If positive, our research could open up a new horizon for cost-effective and
      feasible screening tools.

      20 Participants will be included in the study. Ten Cirrhotic patients with HCC and 10
      Cirrhotic patients without HCC.

      The first group is patients with HCC secondary to cirrhosis. The second group will be
      patients with cirrhosis who are currently on the standard surveillance program with no HCC.
      Confirmation of the absence of HCC would have been ensured via a recent advanced imaging
      modality (dynamic CT scan or MRI) in the ongoing surveillance programme.

      Participants will breathe into either a mouthpiece or collection tube then Breath samples
      will be analyzed via an analyzer to detect the VOC and quantitatively compare them
