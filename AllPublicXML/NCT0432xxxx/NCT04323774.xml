  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is a need to improve cancer risk communication and
      decision-making among adolescents and young adults. In this study, the investigators are
      looking at whether using a chatbot and online portal for cancer risk information helps
      improve communication and decision-making.

        -  Over 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.
           every year and up to 10% have genetic changes (or, mutations) that put them at a higher
           risk of developing new cancers during their lifetimes. These genetic mutations can
           result in cancer risk syndromes (such as, Lynch Syndrome or Li-Fraumeni Syndrome).
           Identifying cancer risk syndromes can allow for screening and early diagnosis of future
           cancers, which could ultimately save lives and offer more care choices for patients. As
           a result, genetic counseling and testing for cancer risk syndromes is being recommended
           more for Adolescents and Young Adults with new cancer diagnoses, regardless of family
           history.

        -  This research study to develop an intervention called AYA-RISE that aims to assist AYAs
           with cancer risk communication and decision-making around their caregivers.

      This research study involves three aims (Aims 1, 2, and 3).

        -  Aim 1, Part 1, which focuses on finding the best format for the study intervention
           (called AYA-RISE); whether AYA-RISE is easy to use; and whether patients, family
           caregivers, and providers find AYA-RISE acceptable.The research study procedures
           include:

             -  Using and reviewing AYA-RISE,

             -  Participating in audio-recorded, 30-minute interviews

        -  Aim 1, Part 2, which is a pilot study of the study intervention (called AYA-RISE). In
           this pilot study, the investigators are looking at whether AYA-RISE is easy to use and
           what participants think of it.

           -- The activities involved in this part of the study are:

             -  Baseline Questionnaire

             -  Using and reviewing AYA-RISE

             -  Follow-up Questionnaire

             -  Brief feedback interviews on AYA-RISE

        -  In Aim 2, participants will be randomized trial into one of two groups;

             -  Group 1: Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit or

             -  Group 2 : Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit and Access to AYA-Rise

        -  Aim 3: Semi-Structured Interviews:

             -  Evaluate implementation outcomes using 28 semi-structured interviews with patients,
                family members, providers, and site principal investigators
