  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will compare the changes in performance, biomechanical and
      clinical outcomes before and after a six-week gait modification intervention. Participants
      with knee osteoarthritis will attend in-lab assessments and practice, while also performing
      daily, at-home walking tracked using a custom sensorized shoe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Greater toe-in or toe-out angles during walking are potential biomechanical management
      strategies for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). Multi-week clinical trials
      demonstrate the biomechanical efficacy and potential clinical efficacy. However, walking
      biomechanics have only been assessed within laboratory environments and performance of the
      modifications during daily at-home walking is currently unknown. Furthermore, the
      modifications have largely been instructed using a specific target, requiring motor learning.
      No study has examined whether a self-directed strategy is feasible and will produce
      significant improvements in biomechanical and clinical outcomes. Moreover, objective
      real-world performance of these modifications is unknown and may explain the previous
      inconsistent clinical results. This study will address these gaps. The investigators
      hypothesize that real-world performance of the modifications will improve over the
      intervention and that both groups will exhibit improvements in biomechanical and clinical
      outcomes at follow up.

    <measure>Change in baseline to week 7 foot rotation angle error during stance - in lab walking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>Foot rotation is the specific walking parameter that will be modified during the intervention. It is defined as the angle between the long axis of the foot (heel to toe) and the walking direction. Foot rotation will be measured via standard marker-based motion capture and sensor-based motion capture during baseline, follow up, and each practice session.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</time_frame>
    <description>Foot rotation is the specific walking parameter that will be modified during the intervention. It is defined as the angle between the long axis of the foot and the walking direction. Foot rotation will be measured via sensor-based motion capture over each week of the intervention. Median and inter-quartile ranges will be taken as the primary summary statistic.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in baseline to week 7 knee joint moment impulse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>Knee flexion and adduction moment impulses will be calculated. Participants will walk on an instrumented walkway (2 force platforms) while 14 high speed cameras track the trajectories of markers placed on boney landmarks. Moments will be calculated using an inverse dynamics approach.</description>

    <description>Validated questionnaire on symptoms and functional limitations related to knee osteoarthritis. The score is expressed in percentage (0-100), with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>
