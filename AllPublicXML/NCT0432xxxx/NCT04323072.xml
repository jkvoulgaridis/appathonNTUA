  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the most frequent primary bariatric
      procedure performed worldwide. LSG is safe and effective in terms of excess weight loss. It
      is a powerful metabolic operation that activates significant hormonal pathways that lead to
      changes in eating behaviour, glycemic control and intestinal functions. LSG is easier
      regarding its technical aspects and does not need any intestinal anastomosis, begin limited
      to the stomach. The most frequent and sometimes dangerous complications are leaking,
      haemorrhage, splenic injury, sleeve stenosis and gastroesophageal reflux. Despite its
      established efficacy and safety, controversy still exists on optimal operative technique for
      LSG: bougie size, the distance of resection margin from the pylorus, the shape of the section
      at the gastroesophageal junction, staple line reinforcement and intraoperative leak testing
      is among the most controversial issues 11[6]. In literature, different authors have adopted a
      resection distance from the pylorus between 2 and 6-7 cm with various reasons 11[6].
      Resections more distant to the pylorus improve gastric emptying, prevent distal stenosis and
      reduce intraluminal pressure, potentially leading to a lower incidence of fistula and/or
      reflux. On the other hand, resections close to the pylorus would reduce gastric
      distensibility and increase intragastric pressure, potentially increasing satiety with less
      oral intake 11(11,12). The primary aim of this randomized monocentric study is to evaluate
      %EWL at 1 and 2 years follow-up after LSG in two Groups: Group A with a gastric resection
      starting from 2 cm from the pylorus with therefore a wide antrectomy and Group B with a
      gastric resection starting from 6 cm from the pylorus with therefore a small antrectomy.
