    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the OR3O™ Dual
      Mobility System. The study will evaluate the outcome of the Total Hip Arthroplasty using the
      OR3O™ Dual Mobility System over a ten year period. Survivorship of THA will be assessed up to
      ten years.

    <measure>Survivorship of Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assess long-term survivorship (10 years after device implantation) of primary THA using the OR3O™ Dual Mobility System. Survivorship is defined as no revision of any of the THA components including OR3O™ Dual Mobility System (liner and insert), acetabular shell, femoral head and femoral stem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survivorship of individual Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) components (OR3O Dual Mobility, acetabular shell, femoral head)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survivorship of the following specific components will be presented individually: OR3O™Dual Mobility System, Acetabular Shell, Femoral head. The endpoint of interest is time to occurrence of a revision of the specific component due to any reason.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Op, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a joint specific score that consists of 10 items covering domains of pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), functional activities, absence of deformity (1 item, 0 or 4 points), and hip range of motion (2 items, 0-5 points). Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five-level EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Op, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L score consists of two parts: a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale. The descriptive system is used to describe the subject's health state and consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels to choose the most appropriate answer: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The subject is asked to indicate his/her health state by marking the most appropriate statement in each of the five areas.
The visual analogue scale records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale.The endpoints on the scale are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

    <measure>Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (HOOS JR.)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Op, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS JR. is a short-form survey based on the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) that specifically focuses on the outcome after THA. HOOS JR. consists of 2 areas: pain (2 items) and function, daily living (4 items). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes - no, mild, moderate, severe, extreme) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. An interval score from 0-100 (0 indicating total hip disability and 100 indicating perfect hip health) is calculated (15).</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments to be made from radiographs will include implant position, implant fixation, heterotopic ossification, radiolucencies, osteolysis, atrophy and hypertrophy</description>

          -  Subject has neuromuscular dysfunctions (paralysis, myolysis and abductor muscle
             weakness) which will cause unstable hip joint or abnormal gait after surgery.

          -  Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability
             or willingness to participate in the study including mental illness, mental
             retardation, drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Subject has an active infection - systemic or at the site of intended surgery.
