    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical study of the commercially
      available TECNIS Toric II IOL. The study will be conducted in up to 150 subjects needing
      bilateral cataract surgery in up to 10 sites in United States (US). The subjects will be
      followed for up to 3-months postoperatively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Minimum 22 years of age;

          2. Bilateral cataracts for which cataract extraction and posterior chamber IOL
             implantation have been planned for both eyes;

          3. Pre-existing corneal astigmatism of one diopter or greater;

          4. Predicted residual refractive cylinder based on toric IOL calculator, considering
             surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) and posterior corneal astigmatism (PCA) must be
             ≤0.50 D;

          5. Potential for postoperative BCDVA of 20/30 Snellen or better;

          6. Clear intraocular media other than cataract in each eye;

          7. Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures and study visits;

          8. Signed informed consent form (ICF) and health insurance portability and accountability
             act (HIPAA) authorization;

          9. Ability to understand and respond to a questionnaire in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Irregular corneal astigmatism;

          2. Any corneal pathology/abnormality other than regular corneal astigmatism or corneal
             instability due to contact lens wear;

          3. Previous corneal or intraocular surgery;

          4. Inability to focus or fixate for prolonged periods of time (e.g., due to strabismus,
             nystagmus, etc.);

          5. Any pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, fixed, or abnormally shaped pupils);

          6. Dilated pupil size of &lt; 6.0 mm;

          7. Recurrent severe anterior or posterior segment inflammation or uveitis;

          8. Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including
             capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration, including
             pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects;

          9. Known ocular or systemic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             visual acuity or require surgical intervention during the course of the study,
             [macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy
             (severe), uncontrolled glaucoma, irregular corneal astigmatism, choroidal hemorrhage,
             concomitant severe eye disease, extremely shallow anterior chamber, microphthalmos,
             non-age related cataract, severe corneal dystrophy, severe optic nerve atrophy, etc.];

         10. Use of systemic or ocular medications (e.g., Flomax) that may affect vision including
             prior, current, or anticipated use during the course of the study that may, in the
             opinion of the investigator, confound the outcome or increase the risk to the subject
             (e.g., poor dilation or a lack of adequate iris structure to perform standard cataract
             surgery);

         11. Patient is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, is lactating or has another condition
             associated with the fluctuation of hormones that could lead to refractive changes;

         12. Concurrent participation or participation within 30 days prior to the preoperative
             visit in any other clinical study.

         13. Planned monovision correction
