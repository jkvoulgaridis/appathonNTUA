  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer has always been one of the leading causes of death in the world, and China is facing
      more and more severe challenges from cancer. Among all the causes of cancer death, lung
      cancer (25.2%) ranks first, among which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about
      80% to 85%, of which about 1 / 3 of the patients have been in the local advanced stage (IIIA
      stage / IIIB stage) at the time of initial diagnosis. For the patients with stage IIIA NSCLC
      who can be operated on, surgery is still the most effective way to treat them. Even so, NSCLC
      in stage I-III undergoing radical surgery is the most effective way 30-60% of the patients
      eventually had relapse or distant metastasis. Therefore, people began to explore a new
      treatment mode, preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to improve the survival rate of NSCLC
      2.

      At present, the NCCN guidelines for the new adjuvant treatment of NSCLC mainly recommend
      platinum based dual drug chemotherapy.

      Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy will be a potential new adjuvant therapy in the
      future, which can improve the resection rate of patients, reduce the recurrence rate after
      surgery, and have tolerable adverse reactions.

                  period of chemotherapy drug treatment to avoid virus reactivation. For subjects
                  with anti HBC +, HBsAg (-), anti HBS (-), and HBV viral load (-), prophylactic
                  anti HBV treatment is not required, but virus reactivation needs to be closely
                  detected.

              21. Active HCV infected subjects (HCV antibody positive and HCV-RNA level higher than
                  the detection limit)

                  influenza; however, it is not allowed to accept the live attenuated influenza
                  vaccine for intranasal medication.

             There are medical history, disease, treatment or laboratory abnormal results that may
             interfere with the test results, prevent the subjects from participating in the whole
             process of the study, or the researchers think that participating in the study is not
             in the best interests of the subjects.
