    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational research approved by the Ethics Committee of the
      Peking Union medical college Hospital. Patients scheduled for elective non-abdominal and
      non-thoracic surgery among age of 19-65 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists
      Physical Status Classification(ASA) I or II were inrolled. Diaphragm ultrasonogram was
      measured pre and post operation. Diaphragm excursion and diaphragm thickening fraction during
      quiet breathing as well as deep breathing were assessed. Neuromuscular monitor was performed
      during operation, after proper calibration.

    <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored thoughout operation based neuromuscular monitoring guideline by an independent investigator. TOF ratio before extubation was recorded. The scale of TOFr range from 0 to 1. TOFr&lt;0.9 indicate existance of residual neuromuscular blockade.</description>

    <measure>Diaphragm ultrasound parameter</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 min after extubation</time_frame>
    <description>Diaphragm excursion and thickening fraction was measured through ultrasonography within 2 min after extubation. Correlation between TOFr ratio and diaphragm parameters was explored.</description>

    <description>If patients cannot breath by themselves after extubation, They need to be reintubated and mechanical ventilation need to be use to sustain their breathing.</description>
