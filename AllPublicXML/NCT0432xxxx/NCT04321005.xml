      In this project prospective data are collected from a representative group of specialized
      clinics performing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) to serve as reference baseline and
      outcome values, as well as the development of prediction models for individual patients.

    <measure>Patient-reported change in shoulder functional outcome OSS</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline and at 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) is a condition-specific questionnaire developed for patients with a degenerative or inflammatory state of the shoulder. It contains twelve items to be answered by the patient independently, which deal with pain (degree, time point) and possible handicaps in private and professional life.
There are five categories of response for every question, corresponding to a score ranging from 0 to 4. Scores are combined to give a single score, with a range from 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of shoulder stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline and at 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>this event was defined as a postoperative restriction in passive shoulder motion diagnosed within 6 months after ARCR in at least two of the motion planes of flexion, abduction and external rotation in 0Â° abduction. Motion restriction is to be assessed separately for each plane</description>

    <measure>Constant Murley Score (CMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient. The scale is from 1 to 100 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-reported shoulder pain on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults.
The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. A Higher Score means a worse outcome. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to the VAS, the NPRS is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) is a validated patient-reported outcome measure (PROM). It's a shoulder-specific instrument designed to assess the outcome of all shoulder surgeries (with the exception of instability surgery). The combined total gives a minimum score of 12 and a maximum of 60. Higher scores in the OSS imply worse functionality while lower scores imply better functionality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SSV is defined as a patient's subjective shoulder assessment expressed as a percentage of an entirely normal shoulder, which would score 100%</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nonrestorative sleep (NRS) to assess Patient-reported quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nonrestorative sleep (NRS) is defined as the subjective experience that sleep has not been sufficiently refreshing or restorative. On a scale from 0-10, 0 is best possible outcome measure and 10 is worst possible outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Return to work, change of working condition</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>

    <measure>PROMIS Depression and Anxiety Short Formto assess level of depression and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient perceived shoulder functionality change, acceptability of own symptom state</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient perceived shoulder functionality change, acceptability of own symptom state are measured with emphasis on minimally clinically important differences as stated in the cited literature with the according scored measurements</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (utilities and general health): EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through EuroQoL version (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. This tool has an overall health scale where the rater selects a number between 1-100 to describe the condition of their health, 1 being the worst and 100 being the best possible outcome.</description>
