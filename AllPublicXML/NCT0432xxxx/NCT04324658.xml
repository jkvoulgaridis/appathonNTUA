  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, open, longitudinal, multicentre study conducted in France.

      The study plans to enrol 119 patients with irritable bowel syndrome who will be included by
      about 50 general practitioners or gastroenterologists consulting in private offices. The
      treatment, Lactiplus® is a medical device, in the form of capsules containing L. gasseri
      LA806. The main objective of the study is to assess the effect of a 4-week treatment with the
      medical device on abdominal pain.

      The study is designed as an observational post-market follow-up study, to confirm the
      performance of the medical device in real life conditions and document its safety profile.

      The eligible population corresponds to the population that could benefit from the treatment,
      according to the MD's instructions for use. Non-inclusion criteria prevent from including
      patients with other pathologies associated with gastro-intestinal troubles, who may
      beneficiate from more adequate treatments.
