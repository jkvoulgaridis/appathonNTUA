      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of DS-MCE with a novel way for
      complete examination in UGI tract and small bowel, compared with EGD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) has been widely used in clinical practice for
      upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract and Small Bowel. However, the complete visualization of
      UGI tract still present challenges due to rapid transit through esophagus and duodenum,
      although technical improvements of MCE are helpful.

      Detachable String MCE (DS-MCE) can control the movement of MCE through the string and MCE can
      start next examination after string detachment, which was proved to be an effective and safe
      method for complete viewing of the esophagus and stomach. In order to improve the duodenum
      visualization, endoscopist separate MCE from the string after finishing UGI examination so
      that can inspect the esophagus, stomach and duodenum under the string and magnetic field
      control.

      This is a prospective, single-centered, self-controlled pilot study. Subjects with or without
      digestive symptoms receiving UGI endoscopy will be enrolled to take DS-MCE and conventional
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 48h successively.

    <description>The subjects swallowed the MCE to investigate the esophagus repeatedly by pulling up or down the string. After completion of the esophageal examination, MCE reached the stomach and was lifted away from the posterior wall, rotated if necessary and advanced to the fundus and cardiac regions, and then to the gastric body, angulus, antrum and pylorus. After finishing the stomach examination, the capsule would enter the duodenum due to peristalsis when the pylorus opened. Then DS-MCE tried to inspect the duodenum repeatedly under the string and magnetic field control, including view of major papilla in the descending part of duodenum and retrograde view of pylorus in duodenal bulb with a &quot;360-degree automatic scanning&quot; mode. After completion of the duodenum examination, the capsule started to view the small bowel.</description>
