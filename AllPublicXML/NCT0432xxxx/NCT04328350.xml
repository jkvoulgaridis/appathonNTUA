  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are being asked to take part in this clinical trial, a type of research study,
      because investigators want to learn more about the social experiences adolescents and young
      adults who are being treated or have been treated for cancer.

      Primary Objectives

        -  Describe differences in social experience variables (peer connectedness, perceived
           social competence, parent versus peer attachment) based on treatment status: on versus
           off therapy.

        -  In on-therapy patients, describe differences in social experience variables (peer
           connectedness, perceived social competence, parent versus peer attachment) based on
           developmental stage: high school versus post-high school.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Assess the social support and peer interaction needs of AYA with cancer as a means of
           determining stakeholder interest and need for psychosocial interventions targeting
           social experiences.

        -  Using qualitative interviews, explore patient perceptions of the impact of cancer on
           social experiences among AYA, particularly with regards to changes in friendships as a
           result of the cancer diagnosis and the role of the hospital in helping or hindering
           friendship maintenance/development.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  Explore differences in social experience by demographic, disease and treatment factors,
           including: gender, diagnostic category (brain tumor, leukemia/lymphoma, solid tumor),
           late effects/symptom burden, and treatment (e.g., treatment intensity, serious medical
           events).

        -  Explore associations between perceived impact of cancer and social experience in AYA.

        -  Explore associations between use of social media and social experience.

        -  Explore associations between social experiences and overall functioning (quality of
           life, distress, coping).

        -  Explore the possibility of subclasses of AYA by using person-centered analyses to
           empirically derive profiles of social experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed-methods design involving questionnaires and interviews will be used to evaluate the
      study objectives. AYA ages 15 to 22 will be recruited to participate. Two cohorts will be
      enrolled: AYA who are on-treatment, 2-12 months post-diagnosis; and AYA who are off-therapy 1
      to 4 years. AYA will complete questionnaires assessing peer versus family connectedness,
      peer/romantic competence, coping, distress, social support, and quality of life. A
      study-specific needs assessment regarding interest in social functioning interventions will
      also be completed. If a caregiver is available, they will be asked to complete questionnaires
      regarding family functioning and quality of life. A subset of 50 AYA (30 on-therapy/20
      off-therapy) will be interviewed to further explore aspects of peer/family connectedness and
      intervention interest. Analyses will focus on describing how aspects of social experiences
      (peer connectedness, social competence, peer versus parent attachment) differ based on
      treatment status (on versus off therapy) and developmental stage (high school versus
      post-high school), as well as potential moderators.

      Two cohorts of AYA with cancer, ages 15-22, will be identified and recruited for the study:
      1) patients on-therapy, 2-12 months from diagnosis; and 2) patients off- therapy 1-4 years,
      and â‰¥13 years of age at diagnosis. AYA from all diagnostic groups - brain tumor, solid tumor,
      leukemia/lymphoma - and developmental periods - high school, post-high school - will be
      targeted, and care will be taken to ensure a representative sample.
