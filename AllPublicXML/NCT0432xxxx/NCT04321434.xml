  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) pathophysiology involves endothelium-dependent (e.g. nitric
      oxide, acetylcholine) and -independent (e.g. adenosine) vascular dilation impairment, which
      have been demonstrated at the level of small coronary arteries, medium sized peripheral
      arteries and subcutaneous microcirculation. Oxygen supplementation, which is frequently
      overused in clinical settings, seems harmful in acute coronary syndromes and increases
      microvascular resistance in myocardial and subcutaneous microcirculation through alteration
      of endothelium-dependent and -independent dilation by an oxidative mechanism. Whether
      endothelial dysfunction, that is well documented at the level of cardiac microcirculation in
      CAD patients, is also present at the level of subcutaneous microcirculation is unknown. Also,
      unknown is whether an acute oxidative stress can be used to probe myocardial microcirculatory
      dysfunction at the level of subcutaneous microcirculation, which is an easily accessible
      vascular bed for an in vivo assessment of endothelial-dependent and-independent function.
      Alterations in cutaneous vascular signalling are evident early in the disease processes.
      Thus, studying subcutaneous circulation in patients with cardiovascular risk factors could
      provide vascular information early in CAD processes. This study will test the following 4
      hypotheses:

        1. Endothelial dysfunction observed at the level of microvascular cardiac arteries is
           readily present at the level of subcutaneous microcirculation in a given CAD patient.

        2. An acute oxidative stress such as hyperoxia can be used to test myocardial
           microcirculatory dysfunction at the level of the more easily accessible subcutaneous
           microcirculation.

        3. Subcutaneous microcirculation of CAD patients has a lesser vasodilatory response to
           acetylcholine or sodium nipride than matched healthy subjects. In addition, CAD patients
           are more prone to dermal vasoconstriction in response to oxygen compared to healthy
           subjects.

        4. Taken that oxygen is still too often given in excess in most clinical settings, the aim
           of this study is to rule out possible pitfalls in coronary pressure and resistance
           determinations in CAD patients receiving unnecessary oxygen supplementation.
