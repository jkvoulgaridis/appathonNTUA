      The objectives of this study are to determine in children allergic to peanut (i) the
      prevalence of sensitization to other legumes, (ii) the prevalence of allergy to each legume
      in patients who are sensitized to it (iii ) the severity of the allergy to legumes other than
      peanut

    <textblock>
      Allergy to legumes is more and more frequent, especially in children allergic to peanut, with
      some severe reactions but little is known about cross-reactivity and clinical meanings of
      legumes sensitization in children allergic to peanut.

      All children with a confirmed peanut allergy and followed at the University Hospital of Nancy
      between January 1st 2017 and February 29th 2020 will be included in order to evaluate the
      prevalence of sensitization and allergy to other legumes in this population.

      In children allergic to peanut and to at least one other legume, we will evaluate the
      severity of the allergy and the sIgE profiles for peanut.
