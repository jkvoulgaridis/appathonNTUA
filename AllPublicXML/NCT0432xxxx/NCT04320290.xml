  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study characterizing the experience of administration of 8 weeks of
      pan-genotypic DAA therapy in kidney transplantation to prevent the transmission of hepatitis
      C virus infection from an HCV-positive donor kidney to an HCV-negative recipient.

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of preemptive and sustained administration
      of pan-genotypic DAA therapy after kidney transplant prevents the transmission of hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection from an HCV-positive donor kidney to an HCV-naive recipient.
