  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune anemia (AIA), including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), EVENs' syndrome (ES),
      acquired pure red aplastic anemia (PRCA), is a kind of anemia disease mediated by
      autoimmunity, which can be primary or secondary to other diseases including autoimmune
      disease, malignant tumor, infection, etc. Glucocorticoid is the first-line treatment.
      However, the recurrence rate is very high and some patients may not response to steroids, the
      latter defined as refractory autoimmune anemia (RAIA). Second-line therapies include
      cyclosporine A (CSA), cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, CD20 monoclonal antibody, anti
      human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG), and even splenectomy. Cyclosporine A is easy to accept
      while some patients may have side effects such as renal function damage, gingival
      hyperplasia, hypertension and so on. Other second-line drugs also have many problems, such as
      low effective rate, slow onset, expensive price, and large side effects, and some patients do
      not response to these treatments. The refractory/relapsed AIA patients have increased
      cardiovascular events, increased opportunities for infections, decreased quality of life, and
      even death. At present, there is still no effective treatment for these patients. Our
      previous retrospective study showed that sirolimus was effective in cyclosporine refractory
      PRCA with an effective rate of 70% and slight side effects. In addition, we used sirolimus in
      refractory AIHA and ES, with an effective rate of 60-70%. However, there are still some
      non-responsive patients. Recently, it has been reported that all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
      combined with danazol was effective in the treatment of refractory immune thrombocytopenic
      purpura (ITP). Therefore, we plans to combine sirolimus and ATRA in the treatment of
      refractory AIA to improve the efficacy. Since both sirolimus and ATRA are cheap and have
      slight side effects, this combination may reduce the economic burden of patients and reduce
      the side effects related to treatment.
