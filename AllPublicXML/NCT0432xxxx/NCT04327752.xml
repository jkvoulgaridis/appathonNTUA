  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biological treatments (BT) are commonly prescribed to treat chronic inflammatory diseases in
      children. Paradoxical reactions during treatment with a biological agent can be defined as
      the appearance or exacerbation of a pathological condition that usually responds to this
      class of drug while treating a patient for another condition. Limited data are available in
      children treated by BT on cutaneous paradoxical reactions, or any other cutaneous adverse
      events occurring during treatment. On the contrary, dermatologists tend to see and manage
      increasing numbers of cutaneous adverse events, including paradoxical reactions. The aim of
      this project is to describe the incidence of cutaneous adverse events, including cutaneous
      paradoxical reactions, occurring in the pediatric population, during a treatment by BT given
      for a chronic inflammatory disease.

        -  For the children already under biological therapy for an inflammatory chronic disease
             : they will benefit of one dermatologic consultation at any time of their treatment.
             Other consultations can be asked by the patient or by his parents if any skin
             manifestation appears beside the planned date of the consultation.

          -  For the children who are going to be treated by a biological therapy : they will
             benefit of one dermatologic consultation BEFORE the onset of the biological therapy,
             and on other one at 4 months afetr the beginning of the treatment. Other consultations
             can be asked by the patient or his parents if any skin manifestation appears beside
             the planned dates of both consultations.
