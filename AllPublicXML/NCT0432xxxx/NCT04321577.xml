  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An incidental gallbladder carcinoma is detected in approximately 0.2% of the cholecystectomy
      specimens removed for presumed benign disease. In patients that meet specific criteria, a
      surgical re-operation is recommended to treat possible residual tumor disease not treated
      with the initial cholecystectomy. The presence of residual disease in the re-intervention
      specimen worsens the prognosis of patient survival, according to several published series.
      Patients with known or high-risk of residual disease may benefit from a specific strategy
      that would improve patient selection before attempting re-resection. A pathology-based score
      has been developed but has not been yet validated in an external series of patients. The use
      of pathological data from the initial cholecystectomy specimen could identify patients at
      risk of residual disease and aid in selecting a specific therapeutic strategy prior to
      attempting surgical re-exploration.

      -  Sample size: 30 (minimum).

        -  Statistical analysis: populations will be compared with chi-square test or Fisher's
           exact test (categorical variables) and Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test
           (continuous variables). A univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will
           be performed to evaluate the predictive factors of residual disease. The Kaplan-Meier
           method will be applied for survival analysis and curves will be compared using log-rank
           test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio will be applied to
           determine the predictive factors of survival. Variables with p values inferior to 0.1 in
           the univariate analysis will be used to perform the multivariate analysis. Statistical
           significance is defined when p &lt; 0.5. The statistical program used will be SPSS version
           23.

    <description>Pathology-based score that uses T stage, grade of differentiation, presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion evaluated in the cholecystectomy specimen to pre-operatively predict the presence of residual disease after radical resection. Each factor is assigned a value. Adding these values results in a total risk score that ranges between 3 and 10 points. The scores are separated intro three risk groups: low (3-4), intermediate (5-7) and high (8-10).</description>

    <description>Radical surgery is proposed to participants with pT1b, pT2 or pT3 tumors in the cholecystectomy specimen without evidence of disseminated disease with staging imaging techniques. A resection of the gallbladder bed or an anatomic resection of the hepatic segments IVb/V is performed. A lymphadenectomy of the hepatic hilum is associated in all cases. Common bile duct resection is performed in patients with involvement of the cystic margin.</description>
