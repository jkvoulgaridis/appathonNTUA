      This is a pilot, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      safety and efficacy study. Subjects will consist of males or females 18 to 90 years of age
      hospitalized for recurrent ADHF with persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 75
      to 90 mmHg for one hour and resistant to fluids), and heart rate 75 to 150 beats/minute.

      Subjects will be enrolled into one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio: istaroxime or matching
      placebo, administered via 24-hour intravenous (IV) infusion. Istaroxime administration can
      begin at 1.0 or 1.5 µg/kg/min; the target infusion rate is 1.5 µg/kg/min. All subjects will
      receive standard of care.

      Approximately 20 sites from North America, South America, Europe, and/or Asia will
      participate in this study.
