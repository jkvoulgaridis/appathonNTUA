  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) may affects obesity development and the development of
      obesity-related diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, steatohepatitis and
      cardiovascular disease. This study aims to examine the involvement of RBP4 in patients with
      diagnosed diabetes, diabetic cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes (pre-DM) and healthy
      controls during the progression of T2DM, and to evaluate the ability of RBP4 to predict cases
      of diabetes with an elevated risk of cardiovascular complications . Along with animal
      experiment.

      A total of 500 Chinese patients admitted to the First Affliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong
      University (Xi'an, China) between March 2020 and March 2022 were recruited to investigate the
      RBP4 profles. Peripheral blood samples are drawn at the initial medical examination, in the
      morning after a fast of at least 8 h, and immediately stored at ‑80˚C until the sphingolipid
      measurements were performed.

      Blood pressure, WC, hip circumference (HC), body weight and body height were measured by a
      trained physician. The participants enrolled in the study provided written informed consent.
