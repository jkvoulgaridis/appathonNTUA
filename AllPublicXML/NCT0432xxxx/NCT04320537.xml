  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have interviewed more than 120+ candidates and recruited 44 chronic marijuana users and 11
      non-user healthy controls: 26 of the 44 MJ users actually participated in the study, 6 of the
      26 MJ participants dropped out after their baseline magnetic resonance (MR) visits and the
      remaining 20 participants completed the study protocol, namely completed three MR visits for
      measurement of brain metabolites (baseline, day 7, and day 21); among the 11 healthy
      controls, 10 completed the study protocol. We are currently analyzing collected data and
      preparing manuscripts for peer reviewed journals.

    <textblock>
      Marijuana (MJ) is the most widely used illicit drug in the US among young adults. A majority
      of those who enter treatment for MJ dependence relapse. However, the mechanism of action of
      MJ on brain neurochemistry, especially in connection with the reported withdrawal symptoms,
      is still not well understood. We hypothesized that brain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and
      glutamate (glu) fluctuate during the transition between active exposure, early abstinence
      (1-2 days since last use), and prolonged abstinence (7 days and more), and an imbalance of
      GABA and glu during MJ abstinence was the metabolic source of the aforementioned withdrawal
      symptoms that make MJ abstinence so difficult for many individuals. The investigator's
      specific aims were to measure MJ abstinence related changes in levels of GABA and glu and to
      correlate the changes in GABA and glu with MJ withdrawal symptoms and clinical measures at
      baseline, day 7, and day 21 into abstinence. The MR measures were conducted at 3 tesla and
      the abstinence was verified by urinary tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels.

        Participants were recruited without regard to sex, race, or ethnicity. Based on prior
        research studies at McLean Hospital, in the northwest suburbs of Boston, we expect the
        number of men and women to be approximately equal, and about 5-15% of subjects to be
        African-American or Hispanic. Overall, these distributions are not very different from the
        population statistics for the Greater Boston Area of 82.6% White, 8.3% African American,
        6.3% Asian, and 2.8% of other ethnic or racial backgrounds based on 2014 census.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Participants must be 21-40 years of age. 2. Women must not be pregnant, planning to
             get pregnant, or lactating. 3. Individuals must meet criteria of chronic, heavy use of
             marijuana to be enrolled in the group of MJ-users. Namely, participants in this group
             may, but do not have to, meet DSM-5 criteria for cannabis use disorder based on the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-5) and they have to have had at
             least one years of reported use of four out of seven days per week, or greater than 25
             episodes per month. An &quot;episode&quot; is defined as an occasion of smoking separated by at
             least one hour from another &quot;episode.&quot; 4. Participants must be able to comply with the
             study protocol, willing to remain abstinent during the 3-week period, willing to limit
             amounts of alcohol and tobacco consumption during the study period, and willing to
             commit the time to participate in the study. 5. Participants must be able to provide
             written informed consent. 6. Participants must be able and willing to complete
             questionnaires during various visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Individuals with significant and symptomatic medical or neurological co-morbidity,

             Disorder, severe medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis, anemia, cancer,
             cirrhosis, heart disease, or kidney disease, or history of head trauma resulting in
             loss of consciousness requiring hospital evaluation. 2. Individuals who have been on
             atypical antipsychotic medications, sleeping medications, or steroid/testosterone. 3.
             Individuals must not have been on stimulant medications or antidepressant medications
             including Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), for at least one year. 4.
             Individuals must not currently hold a medical marijuana certificate. 5. Individuals
             who, in the Principal Investigator's judgment, will not likely be able to comply with
             the study protocol. 6. Individuals meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for current substance use disorder other than MJ 7.
             Individuals who have any lifetime regular use of cocaine, stimulants, or hallucinogens
             more than twice monthly 8. Individuals who smoke more than 10 tobacco cigarettes daily
             9. Individuals who consume more than two alcoholic drinks per day, on average, or
             report binge drinking (4 or more drinks for women, 5 or more drinks for men).

        In addition to the above criteria, the following exclusion criteria apply for subjects
        participating in this MR study:

        MR Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindication to MR scanning, including claustrophobia.

          2. Individuals unable to comply with instructions or procedures of study.

          3. Presence of metal pins or braces in subject.

          4. Evidence of structural brain abnormalities on brain MRI. (Inclusion Criteria and
             Exclusion Criteria for the subjects including controls have been stated in above
