  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate how different painful stimuli are processed and
      modulated in the nervous system. In various pain conditions, including low back pain, often
      no specific source can be identified as the cause of the pain. Scientific findings point
      towards a possible involvement of sensitization processes in the central nervous system
      (spinal cord and brain) that can contribute to the development and persistence of chronic
      pain. There is a need for reliable and well established experimental methods to better
      investigate and understand these processes. Frequently used methods comprise the application
      of thermal, mechanical or electrical stimulations. These modalities are processed in
      different parts of the nervous system, each allowing its own conclusions. This can be an
      advantage, but it also poses a challenge regarding comparability and generalizability of
      obtained results.

      This study aims to apply and compare various experimental methods in people without and
      people with low back pain and shed light on the methodological differences. In the future,
      this could enable better identification and characterization of sensitization processes in
      the nervous system and build the basis for individually adapted, mechanism-targeted
      treatments with better patient outcomes.

    <measure>Temporal Summation of Pain (TSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TSP is measured as the change in perceived pain over time in response to repetitive noxious stimulation. In this study, a series of stimulations will be applied using different modalities (pressure, superficial mechanical, heat or electrical stimuli). Participants will be asked to report the perceived pain in response to the stimulations on an 11-point numerical rating scale (0: no pain, 10: most intense pain) or a visual analogue scale (VAS). VAS will be anchored with 0 (&quot;no sensation&quot;), 40 (&quot;just painful,&quot; defined as the pain threshold), and 100 (&quot;most intense pain tolerable&quot;). Reflex parameters (thresholds in mA; amplitude in uV) will be recorded at start and end of the series. Differences in read-outs (pain ratings, reflex thresholds or reflex amplitudes) at the start of the series compared to the end of the series or the slope of the pain ratings over the series will serve as TSP measures. Greater differences (end-start) or steeper slopes represent a greater TSP.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CPM measures the modulation of a noxious test stimulus by another noxious conditioning stimulus applied at a remote body region. In this study, test stimuli of different modalities (pressure, superficial mechanical, heat or electrical stimuli) will be applied at different body regions before and after or before, during and after a cold water bath or neutral water bath (hand immersion) as conditioning stimulus. Changes in test stimuli read-outs (during-before or after-before) will serve as CPM measure. Negative changes represent inhibitory, positive changes facilitatory CPM effects. For all test stimuli read-outs, CPM effects will be expressed as percentage changes.
Test stimuli read-outs include: pain ratings (numerical rating scale or visual analogue scale, anchors see TSP outcome); perception thresholds (in kg for pressure, nM for superficial mechanical, °C for heat and mA for electrical stimuli); pain thresholds; reflex parameters (thresholds in mA and/or amplitudes).</description>
