  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious diseases remain leading causes of mortality and morbidity in children. Rapid and
      accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases in children is important for developing an
      effective treatment and management strategy. However, the current diagnosis of infectious
      agents mainly depends on culture and molecular testing. Both of the methods either has long
      turnaround times or narrow detection range. Metagenome next generation sequencing (mNGS) has
      been applied to the diagnosis of central nervous system infection, lower respiratory tract
      infection and sepsis, which showed high positive rate, short turnaround time. However, there
      is currently no assessment of the diagnostic efficacy of mNGS in children infectious
      diseases. This study used the DNA extraction and library construction technology developed
      for children's low volume clinical samples to assess the sensitivity and specificity of mNGS
      in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, and the treatment outcome based on mNGS test
      results.
