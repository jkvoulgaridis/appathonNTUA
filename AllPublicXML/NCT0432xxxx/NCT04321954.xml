    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant lenvatinib on
      surgical outcomes of patients with invasive extrathyroidal differentiated thyroid cancer
      (DTC).

      This research study involves a study drug called lenvatinib

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, phase II, open-label study examining the effect of neoadjuvant
      lenvatinib being given to patients with extrathyroidal differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)
      prior to surgery to remove cancerous tumors (thyroidectomy).

      - The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  This research study involves a study drug called lenvatinib.

        -  It is anticipated that 30 people will participate in the study.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved lenvatinib for the specific
      disease of extrathyroidal differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) but it has been approved for
      other uses.

      Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to
      learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      drug is being studied.
