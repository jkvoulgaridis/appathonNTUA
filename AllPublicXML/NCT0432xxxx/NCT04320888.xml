  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II pediatric MATCH trial studies how well selpercatinib works in treating patients
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced), lymphomas, or
      histiocytic disorders that have activating RET gene alterations. Selpercatinib may block the
      growth of cancer cells that have specific genetic changes in an important signaling pathway
      (called the RET pathway) and may reduce tumor size.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with selpercatinib (LOXO-292) with advanced solid tumors
      (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that
      harbor activating genetic alterations in the RET pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with LOXO-292 with
      advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor
      activating genetic alterations in the RET pathway.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of LOXO-292 in children and adolescents with
      relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selpercatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 26 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days, then periodically
      thereafter.
