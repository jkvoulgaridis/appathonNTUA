  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Americans love pets. Nearly 1 in 2 American households (44%) own at least one pet dog and
      more than 1 in 3 (35%) own a cat. The bond people form with their pets can be powerful and
      can provide many mental and physical health benefits. In the case of pet dogs, a strong
      dog-owner bond increases the odds of regular dog walking, which can help owners meet physical
      activity guidelines. When the bond is strong, owners feel a sense of responsibility to walk
      the dog, as well as motivation and social support to walk. Dog walking may be a particularly
      sustainable form of physical activity as dogs require regular exercise throughout their
      lives, across all seasons. Owners less bonded to their dogs are less likely to walk them
      regularly and 40% of owners report never walking their dog.

      Obedience training may strengthen the dog-owner bond. Thus, the proposed study will test the
      hypotheses that obedience training can 1) strengthen the dog-owner bond, and 2) promote
      physical activity among owners. Forty dog owners who do not regularly walk their dog will be
      randomized to a 6-week obedience training course (n=20) or a control group that does not
      receive dog training (n=20). The investigators will assess the strength of the dog-owner bond
      (via questionnaires) and physical activity levels (via a wearable activity monitor) before
      training, immediately after completing training, and 6 weeks after completing training. The
      hypothesis is that the dog-owner bond will strengthen and physical activity levels will
      increase in the intervention group as compared to the control group. As over 50 million
      American households own a dog, support for this hypothesis would support further
      investigation of dog obedience training as a novel strategy for promoting public health.

    <description>The class focused on teaching owners how to better communicate with their dog and covered basic commands (e.g., sit, down, watch), loose leash walking, and polite greetings, among other skills. The importance of dog walking was implied, but not specifically emphasized. Classes were held once per week for 45 minutes, with 5-8 students per class.</description>
