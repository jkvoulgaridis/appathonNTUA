  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate different types of leads (wires) that are connected
      to your pacemaker (an implanted device which assists your heart function) to understand how
      the shape and motion of your previously implanted lead changes in the body.

        The study will enroll at least 160 subjects with one of four different market-released lead
        families identified in the tables below.

        The leads are from all four CIED manufacturers participating in this protocol. A minimum of
        40 leads from each manufacturer's lead family will be required.
