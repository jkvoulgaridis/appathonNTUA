  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a severe cause of undernutrition. It leads to a dramatic decrease of
      weight with an important modification of the body composition. During the renutrition phase,
      disharmonious body composition recovery is a relapse factor. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      is the gold standard to study body composition in children with anorexia nervosa. But, due to
      technical limits, DXA analysis needs to take in account a potential failure to thrive with an
      adjustment on height. Moreover DXA needs an irradiation which does not allow close repeat
      measurements. Since several years, a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiant method for measure
      of body composition has been developed in pediatrics: the air displacement plethysmography
      (ADP). Actually, only one device is available for this measurement: the BodPod®. However,
      feasibility and accuracy of ADP compare to DXA have not been evaluated in pediatric anorexia
      nervosa. The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of BodPod® compare to DXA in girls
      with anorexia nervosa.

    <measure>Accuracy of Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP) for body fat mass measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP) will be compare to Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) according to the percentage of body fat mass measurement.
The hypothesis will be validating if difference in percentage in body fat mass between ADP and DXA is below the 4%.
The measurement will be done two times at 1 year interval</description>
