  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if the digital support and communication platform for
      heart failure can provide patients with heart failure increased knowledge, compliance and
      quality of life and thus affect re-admissions and visit structure.

      To evaluate whether a digital support and communication platform for heart failure patients
      after 6 months can provide:

        1. Improved self-care

        2. Improved quality of life and reduced number of patient-assessed symptoms

        3. Reduction in the number of cardiovascular events, hospital nights, the number of
           hospitalizations or the number of deaths and out-patient visits
