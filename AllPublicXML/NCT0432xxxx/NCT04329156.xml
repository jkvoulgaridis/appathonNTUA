  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare two prosthetic conditioning techniques to
      create natural-like peri-implant emergence profile.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty four patients having a non-restorable tooth will be rehabilitated with flapless
      immediate implant placement after tooth extraction. The emergence profile will be conditioned
      with either a stock or a customized healing abutment. A definitive screw retained restoration
      will be inserted 4 months postoperatively. Peri-implant tissues will be evaluated using pink
      and white esthetic score, radiographs and periodontal parameters at 3,6 and 12 months after
      implant placement.

    <measure>Peri-implant Probing Depth (PD)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Peri-implant probing depth refers to the distance from the gingival margin to the bottom of the sulcus depth. The peri-implant sulcus depth will be measured using a graduated plastic autoclavable periodontal probe. In addition to the aforementioned intervals, it will be measured at the day of final restoration placement. The probe will be held parallel to the long axis of the implant and introduced with light force to the peri-implants sulcus.Measurements will be made at 6 sites around each implant; mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-palatal, mid-palatal and disto-palatal. Probing depth of 1 mm or less will be recorded as 1 mm, and those exceeding 1 mm, but less than 2 mm, will be recorded as 2 mm, and so on.</description>

    <measure>Modified Plaque Index (PI)</measure>

    <description>The presence or absence of plaque around abutments will be scored at four sites of each implant; buccal, lingual, mesial and distal then the mean will be calculated. This will be carried-out by visual inspection with the aid of a mouth mirror and a plastic periodontal probe after air drying of the abutments. The criteria for assessment include:
Score 0: No plaque in the gingival area, tested by running the side of plastic probe along the abutment surface at the entrance to the peri-implant sulcus.
Score 1: Presence of a film of plaque near the gingival margin recognized by running the plastic periodontal probe along the abutment surface.
Score 2: Moderate accumulation of plaque near or within the peri-implant sulcus, which could be seen naked eye.
Score 3: Abundant plaque or soft matter within the peri-implant sulcus and or the mucosal sulcus margin and adjacent implant surface.</description>
