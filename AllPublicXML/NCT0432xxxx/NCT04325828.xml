  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of apalutamide in
      combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist in participants with
      androgen receptor (AR) expressing locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic salivary gland
      carcinoma (SGC).

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR will be calculated among responders from the date of initial documentation of a response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease as defined in RECIST version 1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Concentrations of Apalutamide and its Active Metabolite</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (postdose) and Cycle 2 to 6 (predose) (each cycle of 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of apalutamide and its active metabolite (N-desmethyl apalutamide).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed salivary gland carcinoma (SGC) by local pathology

          -  Androgen receptor (AR) expressing SGC: Local testing of AR-positivity will be
             performed as standard of care for the eligibility confirmation. AR-positivity will be
             defined according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor tissue with at least
             1 percent (%) of cell nuclei staining positive. Tissue should be available for the
             central confirmation of AR-positivity, but the central result of AR positivity will
             not be required for initiating the study intervention

          -  Locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic SGC

          -  Measurable lesion(s) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) version 1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical
             study with therapeutic intent within 30 days prior to first dose. Treatment with a
             drug that has a short half life (t1/2) (for example, less than [&lt;] 1 day) may be
             eligible in accordance with the discussion with the sponsor's medical monitor

          -  Radiographically confirmed brain metastases. In case of history of brain metastases
             that were previously treated and not recurred for at least 6 months, they are
             considered eligible

          -  Toxicities from previous anticancer therapies should have resolved to baseline levels
             or to Grade 1 or less (except for alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and hypothyroidism
             stable on hormone replacement therapy to be Grade 2 or less)

          -  Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding
             disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction

          -  Known or suspected contraindications or hypersensitivity to apalutamide,
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) analogues or any of the components of
             the formulations

          -  Received prior ADT including a GnRH analogue, AR blocker such as bicalutamide,
             enzalutamide or 17alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (CYP17) inhibitor such as abiraterone
             acetate etc. Chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery as part of curative intent therapy
             are allowed so long as prior therapy did not include ADT
