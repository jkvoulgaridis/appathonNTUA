  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common pediatric epilepsy
      syndrome. Affected children typically have a mild seizure disorder, but yet have moderate
      difficulties with language, learning and attention that impact quality of life more than the
      seizures. Separate from the seizures, these children have very frequent abnormal activity in
      their brain known as interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs, or spikes), which we currently
      do not treat. These IEDs arise near the motor cortex, a region in the brain that controls
      movement.

      In this study, we will use a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine the impact of IEDs on brain regions important for
      language to investigate: (1) if treatment of IEDs could improve language; and (2) if brain
      stimulation may be a treatment option for children with epilepsy.

      Participating children will wear electroencephalogram (EEG) caps to measure brain activity.
      We will use TMS to stimulate the brain region where the IEDs originate to measure how this
      region is connected to other brain regions. Children will then receive a special form of TMS
      called repetitive TMS (rTMS) that briefly reduces brain excitability. We will measure if IEDs
      decrease and if brain connectivity changes after rTMS is applied.

      We hypothesize that the IEDs cause language problems by increasing connectivity between the
      motor cortex and language regions. We hypothesize that rTMS will reduce the frequency of IEDs
      and also reduce connectivity between the motor and language region

    <intervention_model_description>Children will receive active repetitive TMS (rTMS) on one day and sham stimulation on a second day. The order of stimulation will be randomized on a per-participant basis.
Children and parents/guardians will not be told if they are receiving sham or inhibitory rTMS on a given day. The research team will know at the time of stimulation, however, as they will have to choose which coil to use. The TMS-EEG files will be coded and the team member analyzing the files for change in IED (spike) frequency and change in connectivity will be blinded to condition.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), sometimes called
             Rolandic Epilepsy. Diagnosis will be based on a history of a focal motor seizure
             (affecting the face or causing hypersalivation) or a history of a seizure out of sleep
             AND an EEG with unilateral or bilateral centrotemporal spike waves.

          -  English-speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prematurity &lt; 35 weeks gestational age;

          -  History of serious neurologic problems (i.e. history of other seizure disorder other
             than simple febrile seizure, head trauma with prolonged loss of consciousness,
             cerebrovascular accident or neuro-inflammatory disease)

          -  Focal deficits on neurologic exam

          -  History of abnormal MRI (with clear gray or white matter abnormality)
