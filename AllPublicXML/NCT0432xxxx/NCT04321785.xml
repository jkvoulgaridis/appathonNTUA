  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of sleep after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Nighttime sleep recordings start around 4 hours after caffeine/placebo intake</time_frame>
    <description>Structure and intensity of sleep is measured by polysomnography. We focus on changes in deep sleep.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of measurements around 45 minutes once after placebo, once after caffeine</time_frame>
    <description>Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we measure blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in the brain during a working memory task. How higher blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity can be interpreted depends on behavioral performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hormonal profile after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Per condition (caffeine and placebo) 8 saliva samples (taken around 250 minutes, 230 minutes, 165 minutes, 115 minutes, 65 minutes and 15 minutes before bedtime, and 490 minutes and 520 minutes after bedtime)</time_frame>
    <description>Hormonal levels are measured in saliva samples. We focus on time of melatonin onset (higher values indicate later time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective sleepiness after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Per condition (caffeine and placebo) 8 times (around 250 minutes, 230 minutes, 165 minutes, 115 minutes, 65 minutes and 15 minutes before bedtime, and 490 minutes and 520 minutes after bedtime)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleepiness is measured by a questionnaire (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS). Higher scores on KSS (range between 1 and 9) represent higher sleepiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective sleep quality after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Per condition around 480 minutes after bedtime</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective sleep quality is measured by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ). Four different scales are evaluated: a) Getting to Sleep (range: 1-100, where lower values represent more difficulties to fall asleep), b) Quality of Sleep (range: 1-100, where lower values represent lower quality), c) Awake Following Sleep (range: 1-100, where lower values represent problems to wake up), and d) Behavior Following Wakening (range: 1-100, where lower values represent more sleepiness after awakening).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in working memory performance after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Performance is measured 3 times in each condition (around 45 minutes, 180 minutes and 780 minutes after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Working performance is measured by accuracy in an n-back task (%of correct responses in 2-back versus 0-back)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in viglance performance after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Performance is measured 3 times in each condition (around 85 minutes, 200 minutes and 730 minutes after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Vigilance performance is measured by reaction time patterns in a psychomotor vigilance task</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in declarative memory performance after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Performance is measured 3 times in each condition (around before 40 minutes before treatment and 210 and 760 minutes after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Performance is quantified by assessing the course of the number of words recalled from a list of words (learned before treatment)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pattern separation performance after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Performance is measured 3 times in each condition (around 20 minutes before treatment and 220 minutes and 770 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance is measured by the lure discrimination index and the recognition performance for repeat items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mental effort during cognitive performance (working memory) after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mental effort is measured 3 times in each condition (around 70 minutes, 200 minutes and 800 minutes after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Mental effort is measured by visual analogue scales targeting satisfaction, concentration, exhaustion and motivation. Scores range from 0-100. Higehr scores indicate higher levels on these scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in well-being after caffeine intake (vs. placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Per condition (caffeine and placebo) 8 times (around 250 minutes, 230 minutes, 165 minutes, 115 minutes, 65 minutes and 15 minutes before bedtime, and 490 minutes and 520 minutes after bedtime)</time_frame>
    <description>Well-being is quantified as mean of three visual analogue scales targeting tension, mood and physical comfort. Scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate better well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cerebral blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>once after placebo, once after caffeine (start of measurements around 60 minutes after treatment once after placebo, once after caffeine)</time_frame>
    <description>Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we measure levels of cerebral blood flow in the brain during rest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Course of caffeine levels and its metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Per condition (caffeine and placebo) 8 samples (taken around 250 minutes, 230 minutes, 165 minutes, 115 minutes, 65 minutes and 15 minutes before bedtime, and 490 minutes and 520 minutes after bedtime)</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of caffeine and its metabolites are measured in sweat and saliva. Higher values represent higher levels.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Expectancy Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>After each laboratory part (around 810 minutes after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Questions regarding the participant's guess in which condition (caffeine vs placebo) they assume to have taken part (categorical: correct [1] vs incorrect [0]), how sure they are (scores range from 1-10, higher scores indicate higher certainty) and open question on reasons/indications for guess.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Craving for caffeine</measure>
    <time_frame>Per condition (caffeine and placebo) 8 times (around 250 minutes, 230 minutes, 165 minutes, 115 minutes, 65 minutes and 15 minutes before bedtime, and 490 minutes and 520 minutes after bedtime)</time_frame>
    <description>Craving for caffeine is measured using a visual analogue scale. Scores range from 0-100. Higher scores inidicate higher craving.</description>
