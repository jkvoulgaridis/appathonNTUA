  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms are among the commonest complaints for which patients
      seek medical attention, with the annual prevalence of dyspepsia approximating 25% . Endoscopy
      holds an important place in the diagnosis of UGI conditions by enabling visualization,
      photography, ultrasonography, and biopsying of suspicious lesions . It gives a better
      diagnostic yield over radiology particularly in the investigation of upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding, inflammatory conditions of the upper gastro-intestinal track like esophagitis,
      gastritis and duodenitis as well as the diagnosis of Mallory Weiss tears and vascular
      malformations .Dyspepsia in the absence of any other symptom was the indication for UGIE in
      the vast majority of patients. Close to 80% of our patients presented with dyspepsia not
      associated with any other symptom and in 50% of the patients the endoscopic findings were
      normal [4]. Other common reasons for UGIE were GERD symptoms, recurrent vomiting, dyspepsia
      associated with weight loss and patients with symptoms of UGI bleeding . Gastritis was the
      most frequent endoscopic finding in our patients, followed by duodenitis .Gastric ulcer was
      diagnosed more frequently than duodenal ulcers . Taking a biopsy is very helpful in diagnosis
      in our study. H. pylori colonization of the gut is the main cause of chronic gastritis and
      the principal etiological agent of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease . Gastric cancer
      was diagnosed, by endoscopy, about eight times more frequently in patients presenting with an
      alarm symptom like recurrent vomiting, dyspepsia together with weight loss or UGI bleeding .
