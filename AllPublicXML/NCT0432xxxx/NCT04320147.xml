  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This paired cohort blinded trial aims to assess the detection rate of clinically significant
      cancer of MRI-targeted biopsy compared to standard 12-core TRUS biopsy in men referred with
      clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who have had no prior prostate biopsy. The
      investigators hypothesize that additional MRI-targeted biopsy will detect more clinically
      significant cancers than standard TRUS biopsy.

      Main objective: To compare MR-target vs. standard 12-cores TRUS-biopsy for the diagnosis of
      clinically significant prostate cancer.

      Before prostate biopsy, all patients be preceded by mpMRI. The mpMRI is read by an
      experienced radiologist according to the PI-RADS version 2 scoring system. PI-RADS scoring
      system is used to assign a degree of doubt prostate cancer. Depending on the PI-RADS score,
      MR targeted biopsy is determined.

        1. MR-targeted biopsy using Artemis device fusion of MRI and ultrasound images would be
           performed. MR targeted biopsy would be performed by radiologist.

        2. Next conventional ultrasound-guided 12-core systematic biopsy would be performed by
           urologist. This portion will be performed without information of the MRI report.
