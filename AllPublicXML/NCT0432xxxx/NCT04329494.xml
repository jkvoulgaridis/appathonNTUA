      This trial studies the side effects of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy
      (PIPAC) in treating patients with ovarian, uterine, stomach (gastric), or colorectal cancer
      that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneal carcinomatosis). Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PIPAC is a minimally
      invasive procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The
      study device consists of a nebulizer (a device that turns liquids into a fine mist), which is
      connected to a high-pressure injector, and inserted into the abdomen (part of the body that
      contains the digestive organs) during a laparoscopic procedure (a surgery using small
      incisions to introduce air and to insert a camera and other other instruments in the
      abdominal cavity for diagnosis and/or to perform routine surgical procedures). Pressurization
      of the liquid chemotherapy through the study device results in aerosolization (a fine mist or
      spray) of the chemotherapy intra-abdominally (into the abdomen). Giving chemotherapy through
      PIPAC may reduce the amount of chemotherapy needed to achieve acceptable drug concentration,
      and therefore potentially reduces side effects and toxicities.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in 2
      groups of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), either due to primary ovarian,
      uterine, or gastric carcinoma (Arm 1) or to primary colorectal carcinoma (Arm 2), based on
      treatment-related adverse events reported by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Efficacy will be assessed by:

      Ia. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), if available, version 1.1 via
      computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline, following the second cycle (week 10), and 6 weeks
      after completing treatment (at 18 weeks/off study).

      Ib. Peritoneal regression grading score (PRGS) via biopsy at each cycle (both preoperative
      and postoperative peritoneal samples will be obtained).

      Ic. Peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) at the time of laparoscopy. II. Post-operative
      surgical complications by Claven-Dindo classification evaluated at 4, 10, and 16 weeks (4
      weeks after each PIPAC).

      III. Progression-free survival. IV. PIPAC technical failure rate. V. Patient-reported health
      state/quality of life and symptoms before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 weeks/off study, as
      measured by the European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire
      (EQ-5D-5L) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).

      VI. Functional status, as measured by the number of daily steps before and after treatments
      (Vivofit 4 wristband pedometer - Garmin Company).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Correlative/translational studies to characterize the tumor microenvironment, subclonal
      evolution, genomics, and pharmacokinetics of peritoneal tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients with ovarian, uterine, or gastric cancer, undergo PIPAC with cisplatin,
      followed by doxorubicin. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients with colorectal cancer undergo PIPAC with oxaliplatin. For cycles 2 and 3,
      patients receive leucovorin intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and fluorouracil IV over 15
      minutes 1-24 hours before undergoing PIPAC. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 3
      years.
