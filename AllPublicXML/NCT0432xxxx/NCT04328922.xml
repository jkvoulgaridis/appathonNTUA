  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators postulate that by determining a patient's baseline microbiome and
      manipulating it through fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) may improve response rates to
      vedolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

      Primary objective: To determine whether manipulation of gut microbiome by FMT pre vedolizumab
      treatment is safe and results in higher remission rates in CD patients.

      Study design: A randomized double blinded controlled clinical trial. Study population:CD
      patients 18-65 YO, men and women, with mild-moderately active disease determined by the
      Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) of 5≤HBI≤15, who were found eligible to commence treatment with
      vedolizumab.

      Study procedure: Study participants will receive FMT within a week prior to first vedolizumab
      infusion.

      All patients will be followed for 46 weeks in 8 visits at the IBD clinic in the GI department
      of the Tel Aviv Medical Center.

      Study design: A randomized double blinded controlled clinical trial.

      Study population:

      CD patients 18-65 YO, men and women, with mild-moderately active disease determined by the
      Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) of 5≤HBI≤15, who were found eligible to commence treatment with
      vedolizumab (screened for tuberculosis and hepatitis B and without an active infection or an
      abscess) will be enrolled in the study.

      Follow-up: All patients will be followed by physician assessment, sample collection,
      anthropometric measurements and questionnaires during the scheduled visits at weeks 2, 6, 14,
      22, and at week 46, on which they will undergo a colonoscopic examination as part of their
      regular clinical followup.

      Side effects (SE): will be monitored by phone, 3 days post intervention and at vedolizumab
      infusion visits at weeks 2 and 6. Also, patients will receive direct contact details of both
      the study coordinator and the study PI.
