  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of Phage
      Cocktail-SPK as an adjunct to standard therapy for the prevention and treatment of burns
      susceptible to infection/or infected by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or K. pneumoniae species.
      It is hypothesized that no adverse events, clinical abnormalities, or changes in laboratory
      tests results related to the application of Phage Cocktail SPK Spray will be observed.

      This is a Phase I, randomized, open-label, active controlled study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a Phage Cocktail-SPK therapy for second degree burn wounds in adult patients.
      The wound will be clinically selected on the basis that it is a second degree burn less than
      10 percent of total body surface area, and that, according to medical assessment, should heal
      without surgical intervention. The study is intended to include one site outside of the
      United States of America, namely the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, in Brisbane,
      Queensland, Australia.
