  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of walking capacity is a key objective of the rehabilitation of children with
      PC. There are different approaches from physiotherapy to address this need, including walking
      on the ground and on treadmill with partial weight support. Currently, there are robotic
      technologies adapted to the functional rehabilitation of patients. Assisted gait training
      with robotic devices such as the Walkbot allows a longer duration of training, at more
      variable speeds, and with a constant gait pattern adapted to the patient. This training,
      based on the intensity and repetition of the movement, has beneficial effects on the recovery
      and improvement of the patient's postural and locomotor functions.

      There are some studies that evaluate walking interventions on treadmill with partial weight
      support, on the ground and in assisted walking robot in patients with PC.

      Currently, there are no studies conducted that report the effectiveness of interventions
      performed with robotic walking training device Walkbot K on PC. However, studies in adults
      with Walkbot S, affected with neurological injury, have reported good results.

      Assisted gait training with robotic devices such as the Walkbot, based on the intensity and
      repetition of the movement, has beneficial effects on the recovery and improvement of the
      patient's postural and locomotor functions. However, due to the little evidence that exists,
      it is necessary to know the effectiveness of the Walkbot assisted walking robot in these
      patients by means of a clinical trial that allows to firmly establish the scope of its
      benefits.
