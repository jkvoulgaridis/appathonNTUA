  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will employ the robot-assisted system to assist patients to perform the grasping
      and releasing movement of both hands simultaneously while mirror priming strategy is applied,
      and, then, perform intensive and game-based finger movement training with the robotic
      assistance. This randomized controlled trial is the first study to explore the benefits of
      combined robotic-assisted therapy and mirror priming strategy in stroke patients. This
      proposed combined approach might be a novel combination of enhancing movement performance,
      daily function and quality of life for patients with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70% to 80 % of stroke patients suffered from upper limb (UE) hemiparesis which
      limited their daily function and quality of life, as well as required considerable demands of
      long-term medical care. Robot-assisted training and mirror priming has been advocated as part
      of contemporary approaches. The robotic-assisted therapy mainly emphasized on the proximal
      part of UE, such as shoulder and elbow movement. While mirror priming strategy has been
      increasingly employed in the UE training, one question has been raised: the affected UE of
      stroke patients cannot complete the same movement as the sounded limb synchronously. This
      project will employ the robot-assisted system to assist patients to perform the grasping and
      releasing movement of both hands simultaneously while mirror priming strategy is applied,
      and, then, perform intensive and game-based finger movement training with the robotic
      assistance. This randomized controlled trial is the first study to explore the benefits of
      combined robotic-assisted therapy and mirror priming strategy in stroke patients. This
      proposed combined approach might be a novel combination of enhancing movement performance,
      daily function and quality of life for patients with stroke. This project will further
      explore the possible neuro-muscular mechanism underlying this combined mirror priming with
      robotic training. This project attempts to compare the cortical activation and neuromuscular
      control of patients with stroke and age-matched healthy adults in terms of
      electroencephalography (EEG) and muscle tone measurement. The findings of this study may lay
      an evidence-based foundation for bridging basic science and clinical application.

    <measure>Change scores of Fugl-Myer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 18 intervention sessions (around 6 weeks after baseline), follow up test (3 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity subscale of the FMA will be used to assess motor impairment. There are 33 upper extremity items measuring the movements and reflexes of the shoulder/elbow/forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. Each score is on a 3-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The maximum score is 66, indicating optimal recovery. The subscore of a proximal shoulder/elbow (FMA s/e: 0-42) and a distal hand/wrist (FMA h/w: 0-24) will be calculated to investigate the treatment effects on separate upper extremity elements. The FMA has good reliability, validity, and responsiveness in stroke patients.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (rNSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 18 intervention sessions (around 6 weeks after baseline), follow up test (3 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The rNSA includes tactile sensation, kinesthetic sensation, and stereognosis. The rNSA is reliable measure of sensory function in stroke patients. For tactile sensation, the patient will be asked to indicate whenever he or she feels the test sensation. For kinesthetic sensations, all 3 aspects of movement will be tested: appreciation of movement, its direction and accurate joint position sense. The limb on the affected side of the body will be supported and moved by the examiner in various directions but movement is only at one joint at a time. The patients will be asked to mirror the change of movement with the other limb. For stereognosis, the object will be placed in the patient's hand for a maximum of 30 seconds. Identification is by naming, description or by pair-matching with an identical set. The object may be moved around the affected hand by the examiner. The rNSA has good intrarater and interrater reliability (Lincoln, Jackson, &amp; Adams, 1998).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 18 intervention sessions (around 6 weeks after baseline), follow up test (3 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT was designed to assess the effects of CIT on arm function after stroke and traumatic brain injury (Wolf, Lecraw, Barton, &amp; Jann, 1989). There are 15 function-based and 2 strength-based tasks. For timed functional tasks, completion times from 0 to 120 seconds are averaged. For functional ability scoring, 6-point ordinal scales are used, where 0 indicates &quot;does not attempt with the involved arm&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;arm does participate, movement appears to be normal.&quot; The clinimetrics of the WMFT has been ascertained in stroke patients.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 18 intervention sessions (around 6 weeks after baseline), follow up test (3 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>We include this test because improvement in UL motor control may contribute to arm swing and help generate forward propulsion at the foot (Tester, Barbeau, Howland, Cantrell, &amp; Behrman, 2012) and may improve mobility and functional ambulation (Lin, et al., 2009). The 10MWT assess mobility function by measuring the time and the numbers of strides required to walk 10 meters under two conditions: (1) with the self-pace of each participant (self-pace); (2) with the speed that the participants walked as soon as possible (Rossier &amp; Wade, 2001). The velocity and stride length of the participant are calculated. Research has validated the 10MWT in measuring mobility in stroke.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 18 intervention sessions (around 6 weeks after baseline), follow up test (3 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be used to assess general cognitive functions. It examines several cognitive domains with a total score of 30 and higher values indicate better cognitvie functions. The MoCA has been shown to be a valid and promising tool to evaluate the global cognitive function in patients with stroke. The psychometric properties of MoCA are good to excellent for patients with cerebrovascular diseases.</description>
