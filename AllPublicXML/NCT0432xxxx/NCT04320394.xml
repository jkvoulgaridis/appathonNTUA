      QuantiFERON Monitor® is an immunological test evaluating the nonspecific cellular response by
      measuring interferon gamma (IFNγ) secretions after T-cell and natural killer lymphocyte
      stimulation.

      This study aims at evaluating sepsis-induced immunosuppression base on QuantiFERON Monitor®
      in patients presenting to the intensive care unit for septic shock. The sponsor expects to
      identify sepsis-induced immunodeficiency in patients through a better understanding of
      cellular and adaptive immune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sepsis-induced immunosuppression phase has recently been characterized and has been
      associated with worse outcomes as well as increased healthcare costs. Furthermore, a marked
      suppression of the immune response has been partially described in patients hospitalized in
      the intensive care setting but its monitoring is not available in daily practice. QuantiFERON
      Monitor® is an immunological test evaluating the nonspecific cellular response by measuring
      interferon gamma (IFNγ) secretions after T-cell and natural killer lymphocyte stimulation.
      Several studies have shown the pertinence of this test, especially in patients with kidney
      failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Patients with lower IFNγ levels were also found
      to be at higher risk of infection.

      This study aims at evaluating sepsis-induced immunosuppression base on QuantiFERON Monitor®
      in patients presenting to the intensive care unit for septic shock. The sponsor expects to
      identify sepsis-induced immunodeficiency in patients through a better understanding of
      cellular and adaptive immune responses. This should ultimately lead to determining thresholds
      for sepsis-related complications and identifying patients most at risk of sepsis-induced
      immuno-depression.
