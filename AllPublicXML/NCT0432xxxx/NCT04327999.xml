  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether administration of preservative free
      artificial tears will decrease the level of detectable radioiodine in the tears and
      nasolacrimal duct system of patients undergoing radioiodine therapy for thyroid carcinoma and
      thus decrease the risk of developing radioactive iodine associated nasolacrimal duct
      obstruction.

      Primary Objective:

      - To assess whether use of preservative free artificial tears following radioactive iodine
      administration will lower the level of radioactive iodine in the tears of patients treated
      with radioactive iodine for thyroid carcinoma.

      Secondary Objective:

      - To evaluate whether artificial tears would be an effective preventative intervention to
      decrease the risk of developing nasolacrimal duct stenosis, which has been associated with
      radioactive iodine administration.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be monitored over time for development of nasolacrimal duct stenosis symptoms, such as epiphora or tear duct infections. Patients will be be assessed in clinic every 8 months for 2 years after radioactive iodine. They will asked about symptoms related to nasolacrimal duct stenosis and will also received tear duct irrigation.</description>

    <description>Day 1, patients will self-administer artificial tears every 15 minutes for 2 hours followed by every 30 minutes for at least 4 hours or until bedtime at night. On Day 2, patients will self-administer artificial tears every 1 hour for 12 hours. On Day 3, patients will self-administer artificial tears four times that day. On Day 4, patients will self-administer tears twice that day. Patients will be instructed to wear their contact lenses throughout their waking hours.</description>
