  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to clinically and radiographically compare the success and survival
      of implants immediately placed in molar fresh extraction socket to delayed implant placement
      at least 12 weeks post molar extraction. The secondary aim is to evaluate the peri-implant
      tissue response around implants with immediate vs. delayed placement.

      Study Population To be included in the study, the subjects must be 22 years of age or older
      and in good general health. They must have at least one nonrestorable more indicated for
      extraction and immediate or delayed implant placement. Subjects who are unable to undergo
      oral surgery procedures, smokers, and women who are (or become) pregnant (or are
      breastfeeding) will be excluded from this study. Additionally, subjects with bone infections
      or compromised health that may affect the ability of the patients' tissues to heal (e.g.,
      uncontrolled diabetes, bisphosphonate use, current glucocorticoid use) will not be included
      in this clinical study.

      15 implants in each group are necessary to provide 90% power with a type I error of 0.05.
      Each subject will be randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups:

      Test Group (n=15):

      The test group will receive immediate molar implant placement in fresh extraction socket with
      nonocclusal loading immediate provisionalization (Straumann BLX 6.5mm).

      Control Group (n=15):

      The control group will receive delayed molar implant placement at least 12 weeks post molar
      extraction with nonocclusal loading immediate provisionalization (Straumann BLX 5.0mm).

      Subject Recruitment Methods and Privacy:

      Subjects who seek implant treatment in University of Kentucky, College of Dentistry clinics.
      Implant clinics is referral base clinic. Once a subject is referred to extract a
      nonrestorable molar tooth and be replaced with an implant, potential subjects will be
      informed with the study. If subjects decide to be part of the study, informed consent will be
      signed prior to screening visit.

      Informed Consent Process:

      The research study will be conducted at the facilities of University of Kentucky, College of
      Dentistry after approval by the Institutional Review Board. All members of the research team
      received training in human subject protection. After each patient has been given verbal and
      written information describing the nature of the study, informed consent will be obtained
      before he or she can enter the study. A copy of the consent form will be given to the patient
      and another retained by the investigator. Patients will not be screened until an informed
      consent has been obtained.

    <measure>Clinical Examination: Implant Success and Failure Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implant success is defined by clinical and radiographic parameters. The success criteria for the implants will be (1) no radiolucency around the implant, (2) no mobility, and (3) no suppuration, pain, or ongoing pathologic process. Implants that do not meet the above criteria fall under the implant failure category. Success rate percentage will be based on clinical and radiographic assessment per implant site.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Regional Cone Beam CT scan imaging for implant sites will be made for research purposes at baseline after implant placement, and 12 months follow up visits. These images are the only way to provide 3 dimensional view of bone around implants (Mesial-Distal, Buccal-Lingual). Marginal bone level changes will be recorded on the mid-mesial, mid-distal, mid-labial, and mid-lingual sites for each implant from the reference line (RL) of the implant platform immediately after implant placement and 12 months follow up visits. All measurements will be made utilizing a coDiagnostiX software used at University of Kentucky College of Dentistry. Marginal bone changes around implants for each site (i.e., Mesial, Distal, Buccal, and Lingual) will be digitally analyzed using the software and statistically analyzed and compared between groups utilizing SPSS software.</description>

    <description>OsstellÂ® RFA (Resonance Frequency Analysis) values will be recorded immediately after implant placement, 3 months, and 12 months follow up visits to report implant stability during the healing time. RFA values for each implant will be statistically analyzed and compared between and within groups utilizing SPSS software.</description>

    <description>At the screening visit, potential subjects will be informed about the protocol and all questions related to the study will be answered. Medical and dental histories will be reviewed and physical evaluations will be performed in order to rule out local or systemic factors that would compromise the outcome of the study. A detailed extra and intra oral examination will be performed. Appropriate radiographic imaging studies will be obtained prior to the surgical visit (per the protocol of the University of Kentucky, College of Dentistry) including CBCT and intraoral scans for treatment planning implant through Straumann Guided Surgery workflow.
The duration of the present study is 1 year including the baseline or surgical visit, 2-weeks postoperative visit, 12-weeks baseline for control group and postoperative evaluations at 3, and 12 months.</description>
