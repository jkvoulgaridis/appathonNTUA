  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perspective of the patient is defined by the patient reported outcomes (PROs). This is a
      main part of the care in psoriatic arthritis. However , PROs can be influenced by
      environmental parameters.

      Ultrasound represents an objective instrument in the context of psoriatic rheumatism (RhPso)
      care because it measures inflammatory activity and structural damage at joint and
      periarticular level.

      it is the first study to evaluate the role of inflammatory and structural ultrasound
      abnormalities as a cause of modification of the patient's perspective measured by PROs in
      patients with RhPso.

      It is an interventional study. Patients will be enrolled in the rheumatology department Of
      Ambroise Paré Hospital in collaboration with the dermatology departments of the hospital.

      All patients with psoriatic arthritis, beginner or established, or patients with psoriasis
      suspecting the beginning of rheumatism who will consult or are already followed in those
      departments and give their approval for the study will undergo

        -  a clinical rheumatologic assessment (number of painful or swollen joints, enthesitic
           pain, inflammatory spinal pain)

        -  an ultrasound assessment (peripheral joints, tendon and enthesitic structures and
           nails).

      Those assessment will be made the same day of their consult in one those departments. They
      will be asked to complete questionnaires (PROs) on the overall assessment of the disease,
      pain, quality of life, tiredness, physical limitation / disability and the impact of the
      disease.
