      1. To evaluate histopathological findings of products of conception in both sporadic and
           recurrent miscarriage.

        2. To determine the prevalence of chronic histiocytic intervillositis in both sporadic and
           recurrent miscarriage.

      Early miscarriage is a term used to describe the loss of pregnancy within the first 12 weeks
      of gestation .This diagnosis concerns 10-15% of all pregnancies and is made based on
      additional tests such as serial determinations of chorionic gonadotropin concentration and
      imaging examinations ultrasonography. Depending on the clinical presentation and results of
      ultrasonography, miscarriages can be divided into complete spontaneous miscarriage, and
      incomplete miscarriage, when the width of the echo of residual tissues in the uterine cavity
      exceeds 10 mm on ultrasonography and is accompanied by the presence of clinical symptoms such
      as vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain .The other type of miscarriage is defined as retained
      products of conception (RPOC) and refers to the state when the gestational sac contains the
      embryo with crown-rump length (CRL) of &gt; 7 mm but embryonic cardiac activity is invisible.
      Empty gestational sac is diagnosed when the gestational sac with a diameter of &gt; 25 mm and
      without an embryo is visible in the uterine cavity on ultrasonography .

      Histopathological examination of products of conception is an integral and a routine
      component of the management of patients with early pregnancy failure . Two important primary
      reasons for such an examination are to confirm the presence of an intrauterine gestation and
      to exclude gestational trophoblastic disease in the form of partial or complete hydatidiform
      mole .

    <gender_description>All of the patients had vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. After vaginal examination , transvaginal ultrasonography findings and serum β‐HCG levels were performed to verify the diagnosis. The cases were classified as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic miscarriage according to the guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (RCOG) on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography[5].
Missed miscarriage was defined as the presence of a non‐viable fetus. An intact gestational sac with an absence of fetal echo was diagnosed as an anembryonic miscarriage. Incomplete miscarriage was defined as the presence of heterogeneous tissues (with or without a gestational sac) distorting the endometrial midline echo by transvaginal ultrasonography.</gender_description>
