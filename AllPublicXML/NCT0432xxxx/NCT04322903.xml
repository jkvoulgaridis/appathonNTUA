  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Passport to Freedom (P2F) Health and Housing is to provide formerly
      homeless women a supportive group to process the impact of trauma on the women's overall
      health and wellbeing, learn strategies to reduce the symptoms of trauma and stress, and
      increased ability to cope with everyday stress while maintaining permanent housing.

      The proposed project will use a mixed method design to examine the feasibility and
      effectiveness of the Passport to Freedom (P2F) Program, an intervention for formerly homeless
      women currently housed through a supportive permanent housing program. P2F involves: three
      2-hr sessions to promote physical and emotional wellbeing through mindfulness techniques and
      health promotion activities; two home visits to provide individualized sessions with a nurse
      and a community health navigator; and a follow-up session 4 weeks after intervention to
      discuss the women's perception of the intervention. By the end of the program, women will
      have improved emotional self-regulation in response to everyday stress, positive perception
      of managing women's overall health, and increased confidence in maintaining stable housing.

    <time_frame>At the time of consent and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Women will report confidence in managing health based on Pre/Post Perceived Health Competence Scale (PHCS) scores. The questionnaire uses the Likert strongly agree to strongly disagree scale to assess agreement with 8 belief statements. Higher scores indicate greater perceived health competence and lower scores indicate less perceived health competence.</description>

    <measure>Change in emotional response to stress as assessed by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of consent and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Women will report level of self-regulation of emotions based on Pre/Post Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) scores. The scale uses a 1-5 Likert scale to assess frequency of emotional regulation. Higher scores indicate a greater difficulty with emotional regulation and lower scores indicate less difficulty with emotion regulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in stress as assessed by the Everyday Stressor Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of consent and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Women will report stress based on Pre/Post Everyday Stressor Index (ESI). The ESI uses a 1-4 Likert scale for 20 questions that assess role overload, financial concerns, parenting worries, employment problems and interpersonal conflict. Higher scores indicate a higher level of daily stress, lower scores indicate a lower level of daily stress.</description>

    <description>During the P2F sessions, the women learn to understand and process the impact of multiple traumas on women's lives and health and learn specific strategies to overcome the symptoms of trauma and everyday stress. Each session will begin and end with a mindfulness exercise to provide different strategies the women can use when these women are in a stressful situation. At the end of each session, the participants will complete a session evaluation. The women will also have a home visit or telephone call with a community health navigator who will conduct a social determinant of health screenings assessment to determine what identified social barriers these women may have. The community health navigator will help with linking the participant to a community agency that addresses the identified problem. Four weeks after the completion of the program, the women will be contacted for a follow-up interview to learn the effectiveness of the program sessions.</description>
