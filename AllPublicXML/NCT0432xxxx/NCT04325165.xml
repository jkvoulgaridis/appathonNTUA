  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition affecting over 1 million individuals in
      North America. SCI often results in severe motor impairments with few available treatments
      options. Recent groundbreaking research has demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of
      the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) greatly improves locomotion in a rat model with
      incomplete SCI. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN - a specific nucleus within the MLR) in
      humans has already been established as an auxillary DBS target in Parkinson Disease (PD), to
      improve motor control and locomotion. DBS of other targets has also been safely used in
      humans with SCI for chronic pain. These findings suggest that DBS of the PPN may have
      potential as a therapeutic intervention in the SCI population to improve locomotion. Our goal
      is to conduct a pioneering study in 5 select motor-incomplete chronic SCI patients that
      cannot functionally ambulate to examine if bilateral DBS of the PPN improves walking

      This prospective repeated measures study of the implantation of bilateral PPN electrodes in a
      small series of chronic SCI patients will aim to examine safety, feasibility, and potential
      efficacy. This research will investigate the effects of electrode implantation, electrical
      stimulation and intensive locomotion training over a 1-year period. Motor assessments will be
      performed at regular intervals with stimulation on and off in a double-blind fashion
      (subjects and researchers will be unaware of stimulation setting), to determine if subjects
      have improved ambulation with stimulation on compared with off, and if their ambulation
      improves over the course of the study observation period with stimulation on.
