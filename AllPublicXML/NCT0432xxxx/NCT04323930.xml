    <textblock>
      Open-angle glaucoma is an ophthalmic disease often characterised by high intraocular
      pressures. Traditionally, glaucoma is treated using medication, however, more advanced or
      refractory glaucoma requires surgical treatment. In terms of surgery, the current
      gold-standard is trabeculectomy. Despite good efficacy, the technique carries relatively high
      rates of complications. The eyeWatch system has recently received CE-marking for the
      treatment of open-angle glaucoma. During its initial clinical trial, the eyeWatch system
      demonstrated good safety and efficacy profile. The present randomized control trial will
      assess its safety and efficacy against the current gold-standard: trabeculectomy.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the change in intraocular pressure (mmHg) from pre-operative baseline to 12-month post-operatively. Intraocular pressure will be measure at each visit using Goldmann tonometry. Baseline intraocular pressure will be defined as the mean of the last two pre-operative measurements.</description>
