      This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed stage II-IV diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors (DAWT) or favorable histology
      Wilms tumors (FHWT) that have come back (relapsed). Drugs used in chemotherapy regimens such
      as UH-3 (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan)
      and ICE/Cyclo/Topo (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and topotecan) work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help doctors find out
      what effects, good and/or bad, regimen UH-3 has on patients with newly diagnosed DAWT and
      standard risk relapsed FHWT (those treated with only 2 drugs for the initial WT)and regimen
      ICE/Cyclo/Topo has on patients with high and very high risk relapsed FHWT (those treated with
      3 or more drugs for the initial WT).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether the addition of vincristine/irinotecan to cyclophosphamide/
      carboplatin/etoposide alternating with vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide improves the
      event-free survival (EFS) of patients with newly diagnosed stage 4 diffuse anaplastic Wilms
      tumor (DAWT) as compared to historical controls.

      II. To evaluate whether the addition of vincristine/irinotecan to
      cyclophosphamide/carboplatin/etoposide alternating with
      vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide improves the EFS of patients with standard-risk
      relapsed favorable histology Wilms tumor (SRrFHWT) as compared to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether the addition of vincristine/irinotecan to
      cyclophosphamide/carboplatin/etoposide alternating with
      vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide improves the overall survival (OS) of patients with
      newly diagnosed stage 4 DAWT as compared to historical controls.

      II. To evaluate whether the addition of vincristine/irinotecan to
      cyclophosphamide/carboplatin/etoposide alternating with
      vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide improves the OS of patients with SRrFHWT as compared
      to historical controls.

      III. To evaluate whether the addition of vincristine/irinotecan to
      cyclophosphamide/carboplatin/etoposide alternating with
      vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide improves the EFS and OS of patients with newly
      diagnosed stage 2 and 3 DAWT as compared to historical controls.

      IV. To establish EFS and OS for high-risk (HRrFHWT) and very high risk (VHRrFHWT) relapsed
      favorable histology Wilms tumor treated with ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide alternating
      with cyclophosphamide/ topotecan.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe renal toxicity of ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide in HRrFHWT and VHRrFHWT
      patients using conventional and novel biomarkers of renal toxicity (urine NGAL, cystatin C
      and Kim1) in the context of the chemotherapy regimens used on this study.

      II. To collect and bank serial blood and urine samples in patients with newly diagnosed DAWT
      or relapsed FHWT and tumor tissue in patients with relapsed FHWT, for future analysis.

      III. To assess the impact of p53 gene and protein expression on outcome for patients with
      newly diagnosed DAWT.

      IV. To determine EFS/OS in the subsets of patients with newly diagnosed DAWT or relapsed FWHT
      who undergo gross total resection at all disease sites at diagnosis or after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      V. To describe the rate of regional lymph node sampling at the time of nephrectomy with the
      use of a pre-operative surgical checklist for patients with newly diagnosed DAWT.

      VI. To determine the feasibility of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with central
      quality assurance (QA) monitoring to reduce radiation induced toxicity to the heart, thyroid,
      breast and solitary kidney for children with lung and liver metastases (part of an
      overarching aim in this study and across frontline favorable histology Wilms tumor studies).

    <description>For Strata 1-3, the primary analysis of EFS will consist of a one-sample, one-sided log rank test versus a historical control cohort (or representative distribution) with stratum-specific type I error levels.

    <description>Incidence of grade 3-5 renal toxicity will be monitored for Stratum 4 as part of a prospective safety monitoring plan.

    <description>For patients with diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors (DAWT) (Strata 1 and 2), p53 will be assessed, and rates of p53 mutations described overall and within each stratum. Degree of anaplasia as a predictor of p53 mutation status will be analyzed in logistic regression models, and association of p53 status with EFS and OS will be analyzed in Cox regression models, stratified by disease stage. Possible interactions between p53 mutation status and degree of anaplasia in outcome models will be explored.</description>

    <description>The number of lymph nodes examined at the time of primary nephrectomy and number of positive nodes will be collected for all DAWT patients who enroll to Strata 1 or 2. The association of the number of nodes examined with EFS and OS will be explored in Cox regression models stratified by disease stage. For each of these analyses, association will be expressed either as a single hazard ratio if the effect is found to be linear, or as continuous functions on the hazard ratio scale if the effect is found to be non-linear. Similar models will be fit to examine the association between ratio of positive nodes to nodes examined and outcomes. Confidence intervals or bands will be reported for all quantities.</description>

             enrolled on AREN03B2 and have initial risk assignment results available prior to
             enrollment on AREN1921. Enrollment on AREN03B2 is not applicable for patients with
             relapsed favorable histology Wilms tumor

          -  Patients with the following diagnoses are eligible for this study:

               -  Newly diagnosed stages 2 - 4 diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumor as confirmed by
                  central review

               -  Favorable histology Wilms tumor at first relapse. Relapsed FHWT patients must
                  have previously achieved remission for their initial FHWT diagnosis to be
