  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to a large disease heterogeneity, the proper management of childhood asthma may be a
      challenging task. Despite the screening of lung function is a fundamental tool, spirometry
      alone may not allow a reliable prediction of the disease prognosis, such as treatment
      response and asthma exacerbations.

      Recently, it has been shown that the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in
      exhaled breath (Breathomics) is able to predict asthma exacerbations and to discriminate
      children with persistently controlled asthma from those with uncontrolled asthma. These
      studies have been realized through gas chromatography / mass spectroscopy techniques, which
      also provide information on specific compounds useful for pathophysiologic research; however,
      they are expensive and time consuming.

      An alternative approach, scarcely adopted so far, is based on cross-reactive nonspecific
      sensor arrays (e-noses), which may provide valuable information on disease status through
      pattern recognition algorithms or discriminant analyses of the global sensor response pattern
      (breath-fingerprint). In particular, the Pneumopipe® (European patent 12425057.2, Rome,
      Italy) is a recent and innovative device allowing direct absorption of VOCs on a cartridge
      after an individual has normally breathed in it for 3 min. It is a very simple and cheap
      procedure, suitable for non-collaborative populations. Moreover, cartridges may be preferable
      over sampling bags in terms of preservation and transportability. This modern breath sampling
      system provides repeatable measurements, and negligible overlap has been observed with
      information provided by spirometry.

      The main objective of the present study is to assess whether baseline (pre-treatment)
      spirometry and e-nose measurements may predict asthma prognosis in persistent asthmatic
      children, in terms of response to the prescribed treatment with inhaled steroid (ICS), and to
      provide simple rules for discriminating treatment responders and non-responders. The
      secondary aim is to assess e-nose ability to predict asthma exacerbations, disease control
      and adherence.
