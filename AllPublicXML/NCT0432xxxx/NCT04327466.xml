  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of non-invasive high frequency oscillations applied via a
      highflow nasal cannula ('Osciflow') compared to highflow nasal cannula without oscillations
      (HF) on desaturations and bradycardia in premature infants. It uses a crossover design.
      Infants are randomized to begin the study with either Osciflow or HF. Both modes are applied
      for 4 hours. Infants are monitored with an oximetry sensor to measure peripheral oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate, and with a transcutaneous CO2-transducer. Further
      measurements include respiratory rate and 'Bernese pain scale' evaluated by nursing staff and
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in a subset of patients.

    <description>Bernese Pain-Scale for Neonates (BPSN): a 9-item multidimensional pain assessment tool that includes behavioral and physiological indicators. The instrument consists of seven subjective (alertness, crying, consolation, skin color, facial expression, posture, and changes in respiratory rate) and two physiological (i.e. objective) (changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation) indicators. Each item is rated on a four point Likert scale (0, 1, 2, and 3). Higher scores indicate greater pain-related distress, and a total score of 11 or higher is considered to indicate pain.</description>

Nasal injury is defined as stage 0-skin intact; stage 1-nonblanchable erythema of intact skin; stage 2-partial thickness skin loss involving epidermis, dermis, or both; stage 3-full thickness skin loss involving damage to or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue; stage 4-full thickness skin loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis, or damage to supporting structures.
Lowest Score: 0. Highest Score: 4. A higher score indicates more extensive nasal injury.</description>
