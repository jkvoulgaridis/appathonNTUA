      The investigators will conduct a phase II clinical trial of autologous murine anti-CD19
      chimeric antigen receptor T cells treating refractory or relapsed B acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia children in Beijing Boren Hospital. The study will be approved by the institutional
      review board of Beijing Boren Hospital, and informed consent will be obtained in accordance
      with the Declaration of Helsinki. All these participants will be matched the diagnostic
      criteria for (r/r) B-ALL according to the WHO classiÔ¨Åcation and complete morphological
      evaluation, immunophenotype analysis by flow cytometry (FCM), cytogenetic analysis by routine
      G-banding karyotype analysis and leukemia fusion gene screening by multiplex nested reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Participants will be eligible if they are
      heavily treated B-ALL who failed from re-induction chemotherapy after relapse or continued
      MRD+ for more than three months, and had positive CD19 expression on leukemia blasts by FCM
      (&gt;95% CD19). After CAR T-cell infusion, clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS),
      Disease-free survival (DFS), adverse effects and relapse will be evaluated.

    <description>CAR-T cells were manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected by leukapheresis and frozen for multiple uses. Before each CAR T-cell infusion (day 0), patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy composing of Fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and Cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2/day) on days -5 to -3. No bridging chemotherapy was given between enrollment and infusion. In CD19 T cell clinical trials, CAR-T cells was given once. All patients underwent bone marrow (BM) biopsy examination and radiology studies on days 30 and every month to determine the response and remission status. Bone biopsy, MRD status by FCM and RT-PCR (if the patient had fusion gene), and EMDs evaluation by CT/MRI/PET-CT were also conducted before CAR-T cell infusion to determine the disease status.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were diagnosed as primary refractory or relapsed B-ALL. All the patients
             matched the diagnostic criteria of ALL according to the WHO classification and
             conducted morphological evaluation, immunophenotype analysis by flow cytometry (FCM),
             cytogenetic analysis by routine G-banding karyotype analysis, screen of 56
             leukemia-related fusion genes by multiplex nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase
             chain reaction (RT-PCR), and quantification of fusion genes by real-time PCR with ABL1
             as reference. Extramedullary diseases (EMDs) were confirmed CD19+ by FCM and evaluated
             by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), CT, MRI or
             ultrasonography. The patient relapsed during chemotherapy or failed from re-induction
             chemotherapy (including first and second-generation TKIs) after relapse or had a
             persistent positive minimal residual disease (MRD) for three months. Patients had
             positive CD19 expression on leukemia blasts by FCM (&gt;95% CD19 positive);

          -  Age from 0 to 18 years old;
