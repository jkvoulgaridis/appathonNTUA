  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the safety of up to 3 dose levels of a study drug called PEP in patients who have
      had a recent (within the last 12 hours) heart attack.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) who undergo percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) at least 4 hours (but no more than 12 hours) after onset of heart attack
      symptoms will be treated with a single dose of PEP within 20 minutes after stent placement or
      post-dilation (whichever is last). Subjects will be screened at the time of emergency room
      presentation. From the emergency room, subjects will proceed to the cardiac catheterization
      laboratory where the PCI will be completed and PEP will be administered. Subjects will be
      followed for one year after PEP administration through clinic visits and a follow-up phone
      call.

    <measure>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a single dose (10 mL) of PEP at escalating concentrations of extracellular vesicles delivered at a single time point (during PCI for AMI) for the treatment of downstream sequela of AMI.</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-14 of the study period for each study participant.</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities are possibly, probably or definitely related to PEP and are defined as:
Signs of infection present in the judgement of a reviewing physician.
CTCAE Grade 2 or higher bronchial stricture.
CTCAE Grade 3 or higher:
New or reoccurring angina after infusion with PEP.
Elevated ALT, AST, total or direct bilirubin, unless due to procedural complications or complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Decreased hemoglobin or platelet level, unless due to procedural complications or complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Sustained ventricular arrhythmia during PEP infusion
Hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis during PEP infusion.
Any other grade 3 or higher adverse event.</description>
