  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known from post-mortem histological studies that a significant portion of individuals
      who undergo cochlear implantation (CI) have scar tissue form around the implanted electrode
      array over time. This scar tissue affects the electrical performance of the cochlear implant,
      affecting how the implant stimulates the auditory nerve. It is possible that if this scar
      tissue was detected, the implant programming could be adjusted to account for the changing
      tissue properties. As part of another study, a computational modeling approach for
      patient-customized simulation of cochlear implant stimulation is being developed. The
      simulation approach uses as input CT images and electrophysiological measurements from the
      cochlear implant device to simulate stimulation by the cochlear implant. These computational
      simulation models also provide a way to estimate tissue growth around the array. Tissue
      growth estimates are optimized in the computational model so that electrophysiological
      metrics simulated by the model match measurements acquired from the patient's implant. In
      this study, the aim is to collect data necessary to validate these model predictions.

      While the existence of tissue growth around the implanted array is not typically known for
      most patients, a subset of cochlear implant recipients need to undergo revision surgery when
      a device failure or poor placement is suspected. For these individuals, the existence of
      tissue growth around the array in the base of the cochlea can be visualized in the operating
      room by the surgeon. Individuals will be recruited who are undergoing CI revision surgery at
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center to participate in this study. In surgery, the presence
      of scar tissue growth will be evaluated by visual confirmation by the surgeon.
