    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, two-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial with
      cardiovascular surgical teams as the unit of randomization. Eligible teams with written
      consent are randomized to the intervention or control arm by random number generator.
      Computer-based, multicomponent intervention targeting on reduction of perioperative
      antimicrobial use will be delivered to teams in the intervention arm. Teams in the control
      arm will continue with usual clinical care.

      The aim of the EPIC trial is to assess if a multicomponent computer-based system incorporated
      into the workflow can reduce days of therapy (DOT) per admission after cardiovascular
      surgeries in the intervention surgical teams compared with controlled surgical teams, over a
      one-year period. This trial is an open-label, two-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial
      with cardiovascular surgical teams as the unit of randomization. Eligible teams with written
      consent are randomized to the intervention or control arm by random number generator.
      Computer-based, multicomponent intervention targeting on reduction of perioperative
      antimicrobial use will be delivered to teams in the intervention arm. Teams in the control
      arm will continue with usual clinical care. The intervention includes re-evaluation alerts
      and decision support for the duration of antimicrobial treatment, re-evaluation alerts and
      decision support for the choice of antimicrobial, and quality control audit and feedback.
      Nine teams per arm with an average size of 1185 admissions will be recruited. Primary outcome
      will be the overall systemic antibiotic use measured in DOT of systemic antibiotic use per
      admission. Secondary outcomes include a series of indices to evaluate antimicrobial use,
      microbial resistance, perioperative infection outcomes, patient safety, resource consumption
      and user compliance/satisfaction.
