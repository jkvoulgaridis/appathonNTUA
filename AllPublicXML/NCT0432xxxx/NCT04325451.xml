  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin barrier impairment and familial atopy have been implicated as crucial risk factors for
      the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). Additional risk factors have been explored,
      including gestational weight, height, age, familial smoking habits, proximity to urban
      centers and others. However, a comprehensive study focusing on the entire spectrum of risk
      factors has yet to be undertaken. Such a study could enable predictive capabilities able to
      inform medical professionals as to a newborn's inherent risk to develop AD, and potentially
      recommend appropriate preventative modalities to prevent or delay disease onset.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A healthy newborn delivered in a hospital setting more than 24 hours prior to
             enrollment &amp; less than 120 hours prior to enrollment

          2. Mothers must be aged &gt;18 years

          3. Parents' ability to complete questionnaire(s) at defined times throughout study
             duration

          4. Parents or legal guardian provide informed written consent

          5. 30% of enrolled participants are to have average forearm TEWL reading of &gt;8.50 g/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Preterm birth (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation)

          2. Neonate has undergone major surgery or intends to undergo major surgery in the coming
             14 days

          3. Neonate has an existing widespread skin condition that would make the detection and/or
             assessment of eczema difficult

          4. Neonate has been administered oral or parenteral antibiotics from birth until study
             enrollment

          5. Neonate has a serious health issue which, at parent or investigator discretion, would
             make it difficult for the neonate or parents to take part in the trial

          6. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from
             participating in the study or compromise the patient safety
