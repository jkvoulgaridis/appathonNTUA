  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test and confirm the safety and effectiveness of the study drug
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) that contains the correct gene to make Factor VIII so that the
      body can make its own Factor VIII that functions properly. Only one dose of valoctocogene
      roxaparvovec is being given in this study, and this dose has been previously studied in
      another clinical trial in patients with hemophilia A. This is a phase 3 study that is meant
      to show that the study drug with prophylactic corticosteroids is safe and works to help treat
      hemophilia A. The study will see if liver cells are able to make Factor VIII that functions
      properly after receiving this study drug. The study will also examine the effects that the
      study drug has on how much Factor VIII concentrates patients have to inject into their veins
      and on their bleeding episodes after the study drug has been administered. Finally, the study
      will see if and how the body responds to the study drug - for example, whether liver cells
      become inflamed or whether the body makes antibodies (something the immune system makes to
      protect itself against things like bacteria and viruses) against the vector or the new Factor
      VIII gene.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males ≥ 18 years of age with hemophilia A and residual FVIII levels ≤ 1 IU/dL as
             evidenced by medical history, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Must have been on prophylactic hemophilia therapy for at least 12 months prior to
             study entry. High-quality, well-documented historical data concerning bleeding
             episodes and hemophilia therapy over the previous 12 months must be available.

          -  Treated/exposed to FVIII concentrates or cryoprecipitate for a minimum of 150 exposure
             days (EDs).

          -  No previous documented history of a detectable FVIII inhibitor, and results from a
             Bethesda assay or Bethesda assay with Nijmegen modification of less than 0.6 Bethesda
             Units (BU) (or less than 1.0 BU for laboratories with a historical lower sensitivity
             cutoff for inhibitor detection of 1.0 BU) on 2 consecutive occasions at least one week
             apart within the past 12 months (at least one of which should be tested at the central
             laboratory).

          -  Detectable pre-existing antibodies to the AAV5 capsid.

          -  Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder, including HIV
             infection.

          -  Significant liver dysfunction with any of the following abnormal laboratory results:
