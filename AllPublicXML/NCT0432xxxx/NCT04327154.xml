    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and report in human preliminary safety and device
      performance data of the TISSIUM™ Nerve Coaptation Device for the repair of digital nerve
      discontinuities where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. The study will
      be conducted at up to 4 centres and will enroll up to 12 subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient undergoing a primary repair of a digital nerve (multiple digital nerve injury
             cases may be recruited);

          -  100% transection injury to the nerve under test;

          -  Gap closure between the nerve ends can be achieved by flexion of the extremity without
             excessive tension;

          -  Clean surgical wound with sufficient healthy soft tissue that enables primary closure
             without adjunctive soft tissue procedures;

          -  Subject willing and able to provide a signed Patient Informed Consent Form;

          -  Subject willing and able to follow the study instructions and likely to complete all
             required study procedures and visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with a known allergy to the constituent polymer of the investigational
             device;

          -  Any patient with a known diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy;

          -  Any injury requiring revascularization due to critical ischemia from damage to the
             blood vessels;

          -  Any patient taking neuromodulator medication;

          -  Any patient with a life expectancy less than 1 year;

          -  Any patient with a history of neuropathic pain;

          -  Any patient with a history of injury to the nerve being studied;

          -  Any patient missing the contralateral digit or with a history of injury to the
             contralateral digit (comparison control area);

          -  Any patient unwilling or unable to follow postoperative instructions;

          -  Any patient with concomitant intake of systemic immunosuppressive medications,
             steroids (&gt;20mg of prednisone /day or equivalent) and chemotherapy;

          -  Any patient with a prior radiation therapy to the operating field;

          -  Pregnancy detected by a blood or urine positive pregnancy test or planned pregnancy

             discretion of the investigator);

          -  Any patient currently participating in an investigational drug or another device trial
             that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the
             current trial endpoints; Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that
             were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials
