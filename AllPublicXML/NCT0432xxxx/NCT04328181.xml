  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study wants to determine to which extent SPCCT allows obtaining images with
      improved quality and diagnostic confidence when compared to standard Dual Energy CT (DECT),
      both with and without contrast agent injection.

      Depending on the anatomical structures/organs to be visualized during CT examinations,
      different scanning protocols are performed with quite variable ionizing radiation doses.
      Therefore, in order to obtain the most extensive and representative results of the
      improvement in image quality between SPCCT and DECT that will be performed CT imaging on
      several body regions and structures, including diabetic foot, diabetic calcium coronary
      scoring, adrenal glands, coronary arteries, lung parenchyma, kidney stones, inner ear, brain
      and joints
