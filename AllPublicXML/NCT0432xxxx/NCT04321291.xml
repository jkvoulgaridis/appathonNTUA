  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis, currently treated or about to be
      started with anti-TNF original drug adalimumab or etanercept will be included and randomized
      to either &quot; information leaflet only &quot; or &quot; information leaflet + nurse information &quot; arms,
      just before they see their rheumatologist for periodic assessment of disease and treatment.

      Patients from the &quot; information leaflet only &quot; arm will be distributed individually a
      dedicated leaflet with written generic informations about the use of biosimilars in rheumatic
      diseases (individual and societal advantages, pharmaceutical development, scientific efficacy
      and safety results).

      Patients from the &quot; &quot; information leaflet + nurse information &quot; arm will be delivered the
      same leaflet, and additionally offered to have a dedicated individual interview with a
      specialist nurse, who will orally discuss informations about biosimilars based on a
      standardized talk, completed by answers to any questions by the patient.

      The rheumatologist will then propose, unless inappropriate based on clinical evaluation of
      the patient, a change in the treatment of patients from the original drug to the
      corresponding biosimilar.

      The primary outcome will be the observed proportions of patients actually receiving the
      biosimilar drug at the 6-months follow-up visit in the 2 compared arms.

      Secondary outcomes will be average time spent by the nurse to adequatley inform the patient,
      the proportion of patients from the intervention arm who have actually asked for the nurse
      information interview, and the reasons for refusal of biosimilars, when appropriate.
