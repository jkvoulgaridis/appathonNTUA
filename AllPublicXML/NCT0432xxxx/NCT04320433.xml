  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to determine the inter-day reliability, by using indirect
      calorimetry, of the post-prandial macronutrient oxidation and energy expenditure after
      consuming oral glucose load solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maintenance of blood glucose concentrations and the oxidation of carbohydrate after
      consuming carbohydrate is related with a low risk of mortality and morbidity from
      cardiometabolic diseases. The oral glucose tolerance test is a diagnostic test widely used in
      the clinical field. However, its inter-day reliability has not been deeply studied.
      Therefore, it is of clinical interest to study the inter-day reliability of the diagnostic
      test oral glucose tolerance test using indirect calorimetry and monitoring the response of
      the glucose levels.

      20 young adults will undergo two trials visit with 7 days of separation between conditions.
      Each evaluation day will conform to the following tests:

        1. Basal metabolic rate assessment through indirect calorimetry.

        2. Basal heart rate variability through heart rate monitor.

        3. Intake of the corresponding glucose load solution.

        4. Postprandial nutrient oxidation and energy expenditure assessment through indirect
           calorimetry

        5. Glucose monitoring through Glucose meter.

    <description>Participants will undergo two trials visit (with a week of separation). During the visits they will ingest an oral glucose load solution (oral glucose tolerance test) and gas exchange will be measured over the following 3-hours. The glucose levels will be monitored through a Glucose meter in different time frames.</description>
