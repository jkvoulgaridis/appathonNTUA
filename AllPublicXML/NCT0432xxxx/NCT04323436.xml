    <textblock>
      A double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of capmatinib (INC280) and spartalizumab (PDR001) combination therapy versus
      capmatinib and placebo as first line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with MET exon 14 skipping (METΔex14) mutations
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capmatinib in combination
      with spartalizumab in treatment naive patients with EGFR wild-type, ALK rearrangement
      negative advanced NSCLC, harboring METΔex14 mutations.

      A run-in part (Part 1) will be conducted to determine the anti-tumor activity and safety of
      capmatinib in combination with spartalizumab. Upon review of safety data and confirmation of
      anti-tumor activity in Part 1, the randomized part (Part 2) will be initiated to compare the
      efficacy and safety of capmatinib plus spartalizumab to capmatinib plus placebo.

      Combined treatment of METΔex14 mutated NSCLC with capmatinib and spartalizumab is expected to
      result in improved efficacy compared to each single agent due to direct targeting of an
      oncogenic driver (MET) as well as more efficient stimulation of an anti-tumor immune response
      than with PD-1 blockade alone.
