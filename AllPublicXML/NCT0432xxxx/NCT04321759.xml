  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare two evidence-based treatments, Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) and Social
      Skills Training (SST) that have been shown in meta-analyses and in our own research to be
      effective to improve community functioning. The investigators will test the impact of CET and
      SST on community functioning, with special attention to their relative effectiveness for
      patients differing in baseline cognitive skills and age. The research uses a cluster design
      in which different mental health service centers are randomized to one of the two treatments.

      Aim 1. The investigators will test our hypothesis that CET will be associated with greater
      improvements than SST in both the primary outcome: community functioning (SAS, QLS), and the
      secondary outcomes of neuro- and social cognition (BACS and MSCEIT) and social skills (SSPA).
      . For study Aim 1,the investigators hypothesized that CET will be associated with greater
      improvements than SST in both the primary outcome: community functioning (SAS, QLS), and the
      secondary outcomes of neuro- and social cognition (NIH Toolbox and MSCEIT) and social skills
      (SSPA). Aim 2: The investigators will explore differential effectiveness of the two
      interventions by baseline cognitive functioning and age. For Aim 2, the investigators
      hypothesize that patients with less impairment in cognitive functioning at baseline will
      demonstrate relatively larger treatment gains in SST compared to those in CET than those who
      are initially more cognitively impaired, and that younger patients will benefit more from CET
      compared to those in SST than those who are older. The results of this study will address a
      key knowledge gap in the field and a decisional dilemma for clinicians.

    <description>CET's group-based exercises are delivered for 1.5 hours each week in a group of 6-8 participants led by a clinician and an assistant, for one year. During each of three modules (basic concepts, social cognition, CET applications), the groups focus on acquisition of adult social milestones in perspective-taking, social context appraisal, and other aspects of social cognition, with psychoeducational lectures, homework assignments, and in-group exercises. Weekly supervision sessions for the clinician trainers will include review of how patients respond to the different demands of computer-based training and group-based exercises and guidance about improving engagement in both.</description>

    <description>The psychosocial component involves weekly skills training classes delivered over one year, with modules including &quot;Communicating Effectively,&quot; &quot;Making and Keeping Friends,&quot; &quot;Making the Most of Leisure Time,&quot; &quot;Healthy Living,&quot; &quot;Using Medications Effectively,&quot; and &quot;Making the Most of a Health Care Visit&quot; (Pratt et al., 2008). Participants attend two sessions each week (normally morning and afternoon of the same day): a 90-minute session focused on a specific skill and a 60-minute session in which the specific skill is used in role-play exercises.</description>
