      This study will determine whether resting beta cells (cells in the pancreas that produce
      insulin) for 2 weeks will improve the ability of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) to make insulin. Beta cells can rest by giving patients insulin shots. The study will
      also examine how teenagers with T2DM feel about having diabetes and explore differences
      between young people with and without T2DM.

      This study includes patients 12 to 25 years of age with T2DM who are overweight and who were
      diagnosed within 2 years of enrolling in the study. Healthy individuals of normal weight or
      who are overweight are also eligible. Candidates are screened with a medical history,
      physical examination and laboratory tests.

      Participants with T2DM are assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 takes an anti-diabetes
      medicine called metformin and follows a diet prescribed by a study staff dietitian for 2
      weeks. Group 2 takes metformin, follows the prescribed diet, and receives insulin through a
      pump under the skin for 2 weeks. During these two weeks, all participants have the following
      tests:

        -  Frequent blood sugar checks.

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (routine diabetes test in which blood samples are drawn
           before and several times after the subject drinks a sugary solution).

        -  Arginine stimulation to test the response of the body to arginine, a normal ingredient
           of food that stimulates the release of insulin. Two catheters are placed into veins in
           the arms, one to administer a liquid containing arginine, the other to draw the blood
           samples.

        -  Ultrasound of the blood vessels in the neck to check for hardening of the arteries.

        -  Metabolism test to measure the amount of oxygen used during rest. The subject breathes
           normally during rest while wearing a canopy over his or her head for about 20 minutes.

        -  MRI scans of the abdomen to examine the amount of fat in the belly (at the beginning and
           end of the study)

        -  DEXA scan to determine percent body fat.

        -  Tests to explore quality of life and feelings about health, work or school, friends and
           family.

        -  Exercise testing on a treadmill or stationary bicycle.

        -  Genetic studies for information on diabetes and obesity.

      Normal volunteers have blood draws, oral glucose tolerance testing, MRI scan, DEXA scan,
      psychological testing, exercise testing, and genetic testing.

      Background:

      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition characterized by insulin resistance and
      progressive failure of the insulin-secreting beta-cells. Previously considered a disease of
      adults, it is now becoming increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents. Patients with
      childhood onset T2DM are at very high risk for diabetes-related morbidity and mortality, due
      to a longer life-time duration of diabetes, as well as possible increased rapidity of
      Beta-cell failure.

      Aims:

      In this study, we will address the following aims:

        1. To characterize hormonal, metabolic, and behavioral traits in patients with youth-onset
           type 2 diabetes. These will include:

             1. Assessment of Beta-cell function and insulin resistance

             2. Psychological, demographic, and socioeconomic assessments

             3. Assessment of the physiology and pathophysiology of incretins and other gut
                hormones

             4. Identification of early biomarkers of diabetes complications, especially
                cardiovascular disease

             5. Validation of new methods for studying glucose metabolism

        2. To serve as a recruitment and development tool for hypothesis-driven pilot studies,
           discussed in the appendices of this protocol.

      Methods:

      Children and young adults ages 8 to 25 years with type 2 diabetes will be studied in a
      cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. Two control groups without diabetes will be studied
      for comparison purposes: healthy lean controls, and overweight/obese controls. Methods used
      to study participants include routine blood sampling, oral glucose tolerance testing, mixed
      meal testing, arginine stimulation testing, DEXA, MRI, carotid ultrasound, questionnaires,
      exercise physiology, and measurements of energy expenditure. Patients with type 1 diabetes
      will be studied using oral glucose tolerance and mixed meal tests in a pilot study of
      artificial sweeteners.

        -  DIABETIC SUBJECTS:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus as defined by:

               1. Fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL OR postprandial blood
                  sugar greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (either during OGTT at NIH or as
                  previously documented on outside medical record).

               2. Since subjects may already have been started on treatment with hypoglycemic
                  agents at the time of enrollment, they may have blood glucose levels in the
                  impaired glucose tolerance range (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL and postprandial
                  140-199 mg/dL). This is a sign of adequately controlled diabetes, rather than an
                  incorrect diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, prior documentation (on outside
                  medical records) of blood glucose values documenting diabetes will be acceptable
                  if the subject has impaired glucose tolerance rather than overt diabetes
                  according to screening results at NIH.

               3. Absence of insulin autoantibodies (in insulin na(SqrRoot) ve patients only)

             Or

          2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (for Pilot Study only)

             And

          3. Age 8-25 years at enrollment

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Normal OGTT at NIH (fasting blood glucose &lt; 100 mg/dL AND 2 hour blood glucose &lt; 140
             mg/dL)

          2. Significant comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigators, will increase risk
             to the subject(specific obesity-related comorbidities are explicitly permitted,
             including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea and non-alcoholic
             steatohepatitis)

          3. Positive urine pregnancy test

          4. Psychiatric or cognitive disorder that will, in the opinion of the investigators,
             limit the subject's ability to comply with study procedures

        NON-DIABETIC CONTROLS:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Two types of volunteers will be recruited:

          1. Overweight and obese volunteers who will be BMI matched with study enrollees who have
             T2DM during analyses

          2. Normal weight (BMI between 5th and 85th centiles for age) volunteers

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Diabetes

          2. Significant comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigators, will increase risk
             to the subject (specific obesity-related comorbidities are explicitly permitted,
             including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea and non-alcoholic
             steatohepatitis)

          3. Current use of drugs that alter glucose metabolism (e.g. metformin)

          4. Current use of prescription or non-prescription weight-loss drugs

          5. Positive urine pregnancy test

          6. Psychiatric or cognitive disorder that will, in the opinion of the investigators,
             limit the subject's ability to comply with study procedures
