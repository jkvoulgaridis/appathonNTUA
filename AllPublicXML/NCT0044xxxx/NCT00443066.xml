      The investigators propose to prepare for clinical trials where SMA patients are asked to join
      the research effort. The visits will include questions, physical exam, blood drawing, and
      sometimes X-rays and a skin biopsy. The investigators will use modern computer methods to
      process the information during which the investigators will plan a clinical trial. Once the
      clinical trial begins, the investigators will offer SMA patients participation if they meet
      the criteria for that trial.

      Identifying an effective SMA treatment is very important because there is currently none.
      Clinical trials are the only way to decide whether a new treatment works in SMA patients or
      not.

    <textblock>
      Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is one of the most devastating neurological diseases of
      childhood. Affected infants and children suffer from progressive muscle weakness caused by
      degeneration of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. Clinically, four
      phenotypes are distinguished within the continuous spectrum of disease severity based on the
      age of onset and the highest motor milestone ever achieved. SMA is caused by homozygous
      deletion of the survival motor neuron-1 (SMN1) gene. A related gene, SMN2, produces low
      levels of full-length SMN protein due to inefficient splicing. There is an inverse
      correlation between SMN copy number and disease severity, presumably mediated by levels of
      full length SMN protein. Therefore, increasing the amount of full-length SMN protein is a
      promising treatment strategy. Several drugs targeting splicing efficiency have resulted in
      increased SMN protein in preclinical assays and are now awaiting clinical testing.

      With the future objective to conduct clinical trials in SMA, the proposed project has 3
      specific aims: 1) To establish a web-based database that will serve to enroll the patient
      population and that will facilitate timely recruitment for future clinical trials; (2) to
      plan for clinical trials by a) developing reliable outcome measures, and (b) establishing the
      infrastructure needed to carry out efficient clinical trials, (c) convening meetings of
      preclinical and clinical researchers involved in SMA drug development to select candidate
      drugs, and (3) to characterize the patient population from a clinical and molecular point of
      view.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy

          -  Genetic diagnosis of SMN gene deletion

          -  Parents or if applicable subjects must give informed consent

          -  must be capable of complying with the study procedures

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo pregnancy test prior
             to radiological studies

          -  Diagnosis of SMA before age 19 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable medical condition precluding participation

          -  Significant respiratory compromise that would interfere with safe travel to site of
             evaluation. (The clinical site PI decides when air travel is not recommended and when
             the patient's location is not within a reasonably safe driving distance (upper limit
             150-250 miles)
