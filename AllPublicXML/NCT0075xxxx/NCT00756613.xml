    <textblock>
      CSP #465, &quot;Glycemic Control and Complications in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2,&quot; was a randomized
      unblinded clinical trial comparing tight glycemic control to standard glycemic control. Tight
      glycemic control consisted of giving patients appropriate diabetic medications to lower the
      patient's HbA1c to around 7%, whereas standard control attempted to lower the patient's HbA1c
      to between 8% and 9%. The study was conducted at 20 VA medical centers. 1791 patients were
      randomized over the 2 year accrual period and then followed for an additional 5 years.
      Follow-up averaged between 5 and 7 years depending upon when the patient was enrolled in the
      study. Patients were seen on average every three months in the VA Outpatient Clinics. High
      blood pressure and elevated cholesterol were aggressively treated in patients in both
      treatment arms. Education regarding diet, exercise, smoking cessation and management of very
      high and very low glucose was also provided. Data were collected throughout the study on the
      patients' physical status, adverse and serious adverse events, concomitant medications, and
      study end points including mortality, heart attack, stroke and surgery to fix the arteries in
      the heart, legs or neck. The study consisted of broad use of all anti-diabetic treatments
      commercially available between 2000 and 2008 including oral medications and insulin. Study
      required medications and all study clinic visits were provided free of the usual VA co-pay.
      Active clinical follow-up of the sample ended on May 31, 2008. With the end of the clinical
      trial the patients were transitioned back to usual patient care services, treatment regimens
      were adjusted where appropriate and future treatment will be dictated by the patient's health
      and his/her health care provider.

      It is important to clarify that with the completion of the active clinical trial and
      transitioning of patients to this observational trial, all responsibility for the care,
      treatment and oversight of the study patients will become the responsibility of the patients'
      Primary Care Physician. The Long Term Follow-up will not collect adverse or serious adverse
      events, or actively treat or have any &quot;hands-on&quot; care responsibility for the study
      participants.

      The proposed Long Term Follow-up Study will consist of centralized computer database searches
      and annual survey questionnaires related to quality of life and self-reported events
      pertinent to the CSP #465 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem in the U.S., especially in the VA population. The
      majority of diabetics are Type 2, and they are at risk for microvascular (e.g. eye, kidney)
      and macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular) complications. It is probable that many of the
      macrovascular and microvascular complications potentially prevented by the 5-7 years of good
      Glycemic control achieved in the VADT (median follow-up 6.25 years) will occur years after
      completion of the VADT experimental protocol. This follow-up study will provide the
      opportunity to see if this holds true up to 9 years following the end of 465.

      The results will help the VA in evaluating most appropriate treatments and costs of such
      treatment.

      This is a longitudinal observational follow-up study of CSP #465, &quot;Glycemic Control and
      Complications in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2&quot;,the VA Diabetes Trial (VADT) NCT #00032487. The
      objectives are: 1) to determine the long term effects of intensive glycemic control in type 2
      diabetes on major cardiovascular complications (primary outcome), and 2) to determine the
      long term effects of intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes on four secondary
      outcomes: a) cardiovascular mortality, b) major microvascular complications, c)
      health-related quality of life, and d) total mortality.

      All patients active at the end of VADT will be approached for participation in VADT-FS. The
      only exclusion reason will be failure to receive consent for participation. Consented VADT-FS
      patients will be followed until the end of the study unless they withdraw their consent.
      Patients will be sent a short, standardized self-administered survey annually. Information
      collected will include: 1) self-reported health status; 2) occurrence of study endpoints; and
      3) VA or non-VA outpatient visits, hospitalizations and procedures. A variety of data sources
      will be searched to verify endpoints. These sources include: 1) VA and non-VA medical
      records; 2) data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); and 3) VA and US
      death records. Patients who do not respond to 3 mailed surveys will be contacted by phone.

      If still unsuccessful, their designated surrogate will be contacted. Certain endpoints will
      be adjudicated by the same committee that was utilized by VADT. Endpoints that will be
      adjudicated will include: 1) cause of death; 2) reason for amputation; and 3) cardiac-related
      non-VA hospitalizations. Endpoints of interest in this study include: 1) mortality; 2) acute
      myocardial infarction requiring hospitalization; 3) stroke; 4) new onset congestive heart
      failure; 5) coronary revascularization; 6) amputation; 7) peripheral revascularization; 8)
      renal insufficiency; 9) severe visual impairment; and 10) self-reported health status
      (diabetes-related quality of life).
