  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol posting deals with objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase at one
      month post-Dose 2. This Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) will collect safety data on the use
      of human rotavirus vaccine in at least 3000 evaluable infants in Korea. This study involves
      male or female infants from the age of 6 weeks at the time of the first vaccination. The
      vaccination course must be completed by the age of 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol posting has been amended to reflect the two new vaccine presentations that have
      been launched in Korea. The current PMS will thus collect safety information from subjects
      who have received either Rotarix or Rotarix liquid formulation (oral suspension or prefilled
      syringe) in the course of their routine clinical practice according to the prescribing
      information in Korea.
