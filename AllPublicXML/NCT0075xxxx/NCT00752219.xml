    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Response at the Test of Cure (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Test of cure visit: 2 weeks post-therapy (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs and symptoms of the index infection. No further antimicrobial therapy or surgical or radiological intervention was required. This clinical response was measured in participants who were microbiologically evaluable (ME) at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 weeks after last dose of study treatment (up to a maximum of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 6 weeks after last dose of study treatment that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Response at the End of Intravenous (IV) Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>End of IV therapy: From Day 5 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs and symptoms of the index infection. No further antimicrobial therapy or surgical or radiological intervention was required. This clinical response was measured in participants who were ME at baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Response at the Late Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Late follow-up visit: 4 to 6 weeks post-therapy (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs and symptoms of the index infection. No further antimicrobial therapy or surgical or radiological intervention was required. This clinical response was measured in participants who were ME at baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Microbiological Response at the Test of Cure Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Test of cure visit: 2 weeks post-therapy (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological response was defined as eradication of pathogen identified (absence of causative pathogens from appropriately obtained specimens at site of infection) or presumptive eradication of pathogens (absence of material to culture in a participant who had responded clinically to treatment). This clinical response was measured in participants who were ME at baseline.</description>
