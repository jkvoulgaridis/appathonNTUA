  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the traditional Chinese herbal compound
      (Huo-Luo-Xiao-Ling Dan, or HLXL) is effective in treating OA of the knee in addition to
      participants current OA of the knee treatment(s) and also to determine the best dosage of
      HLXL that is safe and well tolerated.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To determine whether HLXL improves pain and/or function in patients with OA of the knee
           who continue to have symptoms despite receiving standard analgesic and/or
           anti-inflammatory treatment,

        2. To identify an optimal dosage of HLXL, among two dosages, as determined by pain relief
           and/or functional improvement, in a dose-escalation, placebo-controlled double-blind
           randomized phase II clinical trial, in conjunction with indicia of safety and
           tolerability in patients with OA of the knee who are receiving standard analgesic and/or
           anti-inflammatory treatment,

        3. To explore mechanisms of action of HLXL, correlating changes in biological markers of
           suppression of systemic inflammation with changes in clinical response

The placebo was made from a list of FDA approved ingredients/excipient that matched the color and taste of the real HLXL herbal extract, instead of just white powder used in other placebo trials. Same size and color of capsules were used for the placebo and herbal extract. The equivalent number of capsules used in the treatment group at each dose level were administered to patients assigned to the control group.</description>
