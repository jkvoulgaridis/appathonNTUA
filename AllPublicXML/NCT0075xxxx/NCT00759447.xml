    <textblock>
      A perspective non randomized, noncontrolled, multicenter pilot study enrolling a minimum of
      60 female subjects. The purpose of the pilot study is to compare the images acquired from two
      Hologic tomosynthesis systems. Information obtained from the study will be used to determine
      endpoints for a future larger study. Study participants are enrolled in one of three groups,
      the group in which they are enrolled wil determine which tomosynthesis system images will be
      acquired upon.
