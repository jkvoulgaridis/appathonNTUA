  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of experimental
      treatment matuzumab and ECX chemotherapy, with ECX chemotherapy. Participants invited to take
      part have metastatic cancer of the esophagus (gullet) or stomach.

    <description>Objective response was defined as having a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). Response assessment was performed using modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. CR: disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion. PR: greater than (&gt;) 50 percent (%) decrease from baseline in sum of product of diameters of index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion.</description>

    <description>Objective response was defined as having a CR or a PR. Response assessment was performed using modified WHO criteria. CR: disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion. PR: &gt;50% decrease from baseline in sum of product of diameters of index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion. Duration of objective response was defined as time from first appearance of CR or PR to time of PD (PD: &gt;25% increase in one or more lesions, or appearance new lesions) or death. Duration of objective response was to be assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of PD or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD: &gt;25% increase in one or more lesions, or appearance new lesions. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality of Life (QoL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Post Baseline (Up to 3 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/QoL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from EORTC QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL was linearly transformed and ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score at baseline and best overall change from baseline (throughout study) are reported.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality of Life (QoL) Score</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/QoL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from EORTC QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL was linearly transformed and ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score at baseline and best overall change from baseline (throughout study) are reported.</description>

A maximum of 8 cycles of ECX were administered and after 8 cycles, matuzumab alone was continued until PD, unacceptable toxicity, death, or consent was withdrawn. An observation period of at least 1 hour was specified between the end of the matuzumab infusion and the start of epirubicin administration when these treatments were given on the same day.</description>

          <title>Best Overall Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality of Life (QoL) Score</title>
          <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/QoL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from EORTC QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL was linearly transformed and ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score at baseline and best overall change from baseline (throughout study) are reported.</description>
