  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the efficacy of treatment with divalproex sodium (DS) vs.
      placebo in childhood/adolescent autism fulfilling DSM-IV and Autism Diagnostic Interview
      (ADI) criteria. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for this disorder, although
      behavioral and educational therapies and a variety of medications may play a role in the
      management of some autistic symptoms.

      This study compares divalproex sodium and placebo in the treatment of autistic disorder.
      Twenty six child or adolescent outpatients, with age ranges from 5-17, will be randomized
      into a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel treatment study. During the 12
      weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist and assessed by an independent
      evaluator (IE). The IE will perform study assessments while remaining blind to medication
      regimens (including possible tapering) as well as any side effects. Study assessments will be
      administered at designated time points

    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point improvement scale. Ratings of 1 or 2 (responders) indicate a substantial reduction in symptoms. A rating of 3 (minimally improved) on the CGI is defined as a slight symptomatic improvement that is not deemed clinically significant; patients with such an improvement were not considered responders. Two versions of this test were used, one focused on irritability (primary outcome measure) and a general version CGI-I-autism focused on all symptoms including core symptom domains. The CGI-I irritability took into consideration the scores from the ABC-Irritability subscale, the OAS-M aggression and irritability subscales and information from open-ended questioning related to the degree of interference, nature, and range of behavioral problems at school and at home</description>

    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behaviors as Measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Study (week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist is designed to objectively identify five behavior sub scales through observation by the primary caregiver: irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech. The ABC was filled out by parents on a scale from 0-3 for each category. (0 being not a problem, 3 being severe problem). Scores from all sub scales were added (scoring 0-45 for Irritability subscale, 0-48 for Lethargy subscale, 0-21 for stereotypy scale, 0-48 for hyperactivity sub-scale, and 0-12 for inappropriate speech sub-scale) to obtain a total score.</description>

        <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point improvement scale. Ratings of 1 or 2 (responders) indicate a substantial reduction in symptoms. A rating of 3 (minimally improved) on the CGI is defined as a slight symptomatic improvement that is not deemed clinically significant; patients with such an improvement were not considered responders. Two versions of this test were used, one focused on irritability (primary outcome measure) and a general version CGI-I-autism focused on all symptoms including core symptom domains. The CGI-I irritability took into consideration the scores from the ABC-Irritability subscale, the OAS-M aggression and irritability subscales and information from open-ended questioning related to the degree of interference, nature, and range of behavioral problems at school and at home</description>

          <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point improvement scale. Ratings of 1 or 2 (responders) indicate a substantial reduction in symptoms.

        <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist is designed to objectively identify five behavior sub scales through observation by the primary caregiver: irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech. The ABC was filled out by parents on a scale from 0-3 for each category. (0 being not a problem, 3 being severe problem). Scores from all sub scales were added (scoring 0-45 for Irritability subscale, 0-48 for Lethargy subscale, 0-21 for stereotypy scale, 0-48 for hyperactivity sub-scale, and 0-12 for inappropriate speech sub-scale) to obtain a total score.</description>
