      The findings from this project may result in pain reduction and improved mobility in pregnant
      women with pelvic girdle pain in their second and third trimester.

      The primary objective of this unblinded randomized controlled trial is to determine whether
      superficial cryotherapy results in improved Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores among
      pregnant women with posterior pelvic girdle pain. The investigators hypothesize that
      superficial cryotherapy, in addition to receipt of an educational pamphlet, will result in
      improved NPRS scores compared to receipt of an educational pamphlet alone.

      This study will include English-speaking pregnant women presenting to Loyola University
      Medical Center obstetrics or rehabilitation clinics in their second or third trimester with
      posterior pelvic girdle pain, defined as an NPRS score &gt; 2 onset within the past 3 months and
      pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the
      vicinity of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ). The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can
      also occur in conjunction with/or separately in the [pubic] symphysis. NPRS scores will be
      measured as a continuous, numerical integer ranging from a value of 0 (No pain) to a value of
      10 (Worst possible pain).

    <intervention_model_description>Study participants will then be randomized to cryotherapy + education vs. education alone. The education portion will consist of a handout that will be provided to each patient describing specific exercises. These exercises include descriptive information along with pictures on ways to improve posture and protect the lower back in pregnancy good posture.
Those randomized to the intervention group will receive a 20-minute topical cryotherapy treatment (using Medline Deluxe Cold Pack) at this initial visit where they will be monitored for any adverse response as well as for any immediate change to the NPRS and PGQ. The participant will place the icepack over the low back region and the sacrum if the pain is bilateral. If the pain is unilateral will place the icepack over just that side.</intervention_model_description>
