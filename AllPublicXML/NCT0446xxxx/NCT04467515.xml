  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 multi-center, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to
      evaluate safety, tolerability, dosimetry, pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of the targeted
      radionuclide therapeutic CAM-H2 in patients with progressive, advanced/metastatic
      HER2-positive breast, gastric, and GEJ cancer with disease progression following anti-HER2
      standard of care treatment. The study duration for each phase will be up to 18 months. The
      study is comprised of a Treatment Period, consisting of a maximum of 2 cycles (12 weeks per
      cycle) of study drug, and a 12-month Long-Term Follow-Up Period.
