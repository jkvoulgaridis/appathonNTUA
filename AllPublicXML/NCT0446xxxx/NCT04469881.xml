  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      watching streamed videos through virtual reality (VR) goggles during surgery.

      The results of this study will be used to evaluate whether video-streaming services on VR
      goggles are worthwhile additions to standard anesthesia care during total knee surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usual anesthetic care for total knee replacement involves intravenous sedation as well as
      spinal anesthesia. In this study, participants will receive usual care, and in addition, will
      be asked to wear VR goggles once they arrive in the operating room. Participants will choose
      from a selection of 10 shows and movies to watch for the duration of the surgery
      (approximately 2 hours).
