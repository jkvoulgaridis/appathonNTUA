  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobile health technology can track reliever and inhaled steroid use, activity levels,
      nighttime awakenings, exhaled nitric oxide, and symptoms in the home environment. The
      hypothesis is that researchers can transform the way asthma control is determined, the impact
      of asthma on quality of life, and responses to biologic therapy.

      Objectives

        1. Develop new definitions of asthma control. Researchers will measure the following using
           mHealth technologies: reliever uses, steps per day, amount of exercise per day, sleep
           duration and the number of awakenings per night, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO),
           and self-reported asthma symptoms. Researchers will use threshold values and changes in
           slopes of measured variables to assess trends for each individual. These values will be
           compared and correlated to traditional measures of asthma control collected at month 0,
           3, and 6 study visits, including reports of significant asthma exacerbations (SAEs),
           lung function (FEV1), and standardized surveys (ACT, SAQ, HADS). Working hypothesis:
           Using mHealth technology, researchers will detect asthma control more accurately and
           easily than traditional measures.

        2. Using new definitions of asthma control, better determine response to therapies.
           Researchers will use new definitions of worsening or improving asthma to measure
           responses to biologics in the real world. Working hypothesis: the study platform will be
           more sensitive and accurate in detecting positive clinical responses to biologics.

        3. Using new definitions of asthma control, better determine the impact of asthma.
           Researchers will use new definitions of worsening or improving asthma to better
           determine the impact of uncontrolled asthma on quality of life. Working hypothesis: Many
           asthma patients have decrements to quality of life not fully appreciated, but will be
           better detected by the study methods. Moreover, researchers will better identify
           uncontrolled patients in the real world setting than the clinic office visit model.

    <description>Researchers will enroll 50 moderate-to-severe asthma participants and measure variables in the home environment using mHealth technologies. Using a power of 0.8 and alpha error of 0.05, researchers calculated that ~30-50 participants would be needed to detect 10% changes in digital inhalers, Fitbit, Spirosure, Health Storylines App, INCA device, HealthBeacon device.</description>

    <measure>Using new definitions of worsening and improving asthma, assess response to biologic therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers will enroll an additional 100 asthma participants in the outpatient clinics of National Jewish Health (NJH) that are newly prescribed a biologic therapy and follow each participant for 12 months. Researchers will use the new definitions of worsening or improving asthma to measure responses to biologics in the real world. The goal is to create a composite symptom score based on more than 1 of the mHealth technology variables, with a range of 0 to 25. Using the ACT as a model, where a change of 3 or more is considered a clinically significant change, researchers calculated that sample size of 16 participants would be needed to detect differences. Since there are 4 major biologics prescribed at the NJH (mepolizumab, dupilumab, benralizumab, omalizumab), researchers chose a total sample size of 100 (25 in each group).</description>
