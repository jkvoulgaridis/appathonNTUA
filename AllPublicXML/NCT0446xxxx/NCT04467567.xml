  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the consistency between a dosimetry protocol using a large
      field of view CZT-camera and the dosimetry protocol used for recordings acquired with a
      conventional camera. Therefore, with the conventional camera, recordings are acquired on the
      &quot;high energy&quot; peak of lutetium 177 (208 keV) using a medium energy collimator. With the
      VERITON-CT™ CZT camera, recordings are acquired using the low energy peak of 113 keV. A
      second objective is to compare results between the dosimetry calculated using 3 measurement
      points (24h, 96h and 168h) and the dosimetry calculated using 2 measurement points (24h and
      168h), obtained from the SYMBIA T conventional camera and the VERITON-CT™camera,
      respectively.

    <textblock>
      177Lu-DOTATATE has been proven to be an effective therapy for treatment of neuroendocrine
      tumors. Treatment with [177Lu]-DOTA-TATE consists of 4 cycles, with an infusion of 7.4 GBq
      (200mCi) every 8 weeks. An imaging protocol to study dosimetry throughout the cycles is
      essential to determine the average dose absorbed by critical organs and by tumor lesions. The
      critical organs studied in association with [177Lu]-octreotate treatment are predominantly
      kidneys and the bone marrow. In this open-label trial, 15 patients undergoing Lutathera®
      treatment could be enrolled in the study. Patients will have an abdominopelvic SPECT / CT
      recorded using a conventional Anger camera, followed by a whole-body SPECT / CT recording
      using a CZT camera. Recordings will be acquired at 24 hours, 96 hours and then at 7 days
      after the Lutathera® infusion that is administered during one of the 4 treatment cycles. The
      correlation between the dosimetry results and the appearance of possible grade 3 and 4 side
      effects will be established.
