  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective multi-center, randomized, controlled trial of 150 patients
      conducted to assess the impact of individual use of the Apple Watch compared to the Fitbit
      Inspire on patient-reported and clinical outcomes at 6 months and up to 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a a randomized, controlled trial to determine the impact of the Apple Watch Series 5
      compared to the Fitbit Inspire on both patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization
      over 6 months and up to 1 year. Our research method will employ a patient-centered health
      data sharing platform (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 150 total
      patients after they receive elective direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for treatment of
      atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter, if they have a history of atrial fibrillation). A
      total of 50 patients at each of 3 clinical sites, Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Mayo Clinic,
      and Duke Health before they undergo DCCV. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive
      the Apple Watch Series 5, while half will receive a control device (Fitbit Inspire). Patients
      will then be queried about specific symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and medication
      adherence monthly. This project will provide novel and needed post-market data about the
      Apple Watch Series 5 ECG and irregular rhythm detection notification features and, on a
      larger scale, help delineate the impact of an innovative digital health technology on
      real-world patient outcomes.

      Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of using the Apple Watch ECG and irregular rhythm
      notification features on patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization after patients
      receive cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter, if they have a history of
      atrial fibrillation).

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the accuracy of the Apple Watch ECG compared to physician
      interpretation of 12-lead ECGs obtained in routine clinical care.
