  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dosimetric studies suggest that radiotherapy with protons has a potential to reduce side
      effects compared to treatment with photons for patients with anal carcinoma (AC). There are
      so far no studies comparing these treatment techniques in a randomised setting. The aim of
      this study is to compare side effects following photon therapy versus proton therapy within
      the framework of a randomised controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal carcinoma is a disease in which modern therapy is reasonably successful in achieving
      tumour control/cure. Both acute and late side effects are substantial. Proton radiotherapy is
      hypothesised to have the potential to decrease the incidence/severity of some acute side
      effects from certain organs at risk e.g. bone marrow and intraperitoneal bowel. By sparing
      the dose to these organs it is also possible that late effects might be less evident. Sparing
      of the bone marrow may lead to fewer septic events and dose reductions of chemotherapy which
      may, as a consequence, improve tumour control. The primary aim of this study is to find ways
      to decrease acute side effects primarily to alleviate some discomfort from the patient during
      and after a usually painful treatment experience. It has also been concluded by others that
      reduction of acute side effects is a relevant aim and end point for the evaluation of new
      treatment techniques and both patient reported and physician reported data are assessed

    <description>Costs and QoL as well as clinical outcome measured as survival time will be considered. The results of the health-economic part of the study will be expressed as cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) saved of one intervention in comparison with the other.
All relevant costs should be identified, quantified, and valued. Also indirect costs related to loss of production when patients cannot work due to the disease.
All types of resources associated with the two treatment arms during the follow-up should be considered. E.g. costs for treatment of side-effects, costs for surgery when performed, and travelling costs for patients. Costing will be performed at the end of the study.
For evaluation and analysis of the study results, a relatively simple health-economic model will be developed. This model will be used for evaluation of the two treatment arms from inclusion into the study until 5 years of follow up or death.</description>

             without connection to the anal canal are not included. The patients may have primary
             tumour, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM)-stage T2 (&gt;4 cm) -4,N0-1c,M0 (UICC 8th

             status 0-1

          4. The patient must be able to understand the information about the treatment and give a
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with cancer of the perianal skin without involvement of the anal canal
             (ICD-O-3 C44.5) are not eligible.

          2. Patient judged to have any other treatment than radiotherapy with concomitant
             chemotherapy as the preferred treatment

          3. Concomitant or previous malignancies. Exceptions are, adequately treated basal cell
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or, other previous malignancy with a
             disease-free interval of at least 5 years.

          4. Two or more synchronous primary cancers in the pelvic region at time of diagnosis

          5. Previous radiotherapy, surgery or chemotherapy that may interfere with the planned
             treatment for the present disease, as judged by the investigator.

          6. Co-existing disease prejudicing survival (expected survival should be &gt;2 years).

          7. Pregnancy or breast feeding

          8. When prosthetic materials (e.g. hip prostheses) are present close to the target volume
             it must be considered if this may introduce uncertainties in dose calculations that
             precludes especially, proton therapy.

          9. Patients with pacemaker/ICD are not eligible.
