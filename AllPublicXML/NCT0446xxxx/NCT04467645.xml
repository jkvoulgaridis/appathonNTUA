      This study was conducted in Batıkent Family Health Center of the Ministry of Health between
      May-December 2018. The sample of the study consisted of 72 postmenopausal women. The data
      were collected by using the Introductory Information Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and
      Fatigue Severity Scale. A total of 12 reflexology sessions were applied to the postmenopausal
      women by the researcher twice a week. No intervention was applied to the postmenopausal women
      in the control group.
