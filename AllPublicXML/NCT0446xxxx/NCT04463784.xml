  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be a randomized controlled study in which 500 treatment-naive HIV
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to Efaviren 400mg v.s. 600mg combined with lamivudine and
      tenofovir. The whole cohort will be followed for two years. Efficacy and safety of each
      regimen will be evaluated throughout the study.

    <textblock>
      As efaviren has been commonly used as the first-line therapy in HIV infection worldwide, its
      major side effect i.e. the mental effects have been noticed and has a major influence on the
      adherence and efficacy of ART regimen. Mental effects of efaviren have been especially
      critical in Chinese patients, as the effective and toxic ranges of efaviren plasma
      concentration in Chinese patients are very close to each other.

      In this study, 500 treatment-naive Chinese patients with a body weight &lt; 60kg will be
      screened and recruited. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to efaviren 400mg v.s. 600mg combined
      with lamivudine and tenofovir. All patients will be followed regularly for 2 years, at 0, 2w,
      4w, 3m and every 3 months. Virological and immunological measurements will be done at each
      visit. Meanwhile, various mental scales will be performed at each visit to evaluate the
      mental effects of each arm.

    <description>Measure statistically significant difference in perception of dizziness by administering the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) between two groups at different time point. The 25-item tool comprises three sub-scales: physical (DHI‒P; 7 items), emotional (DHI‒E; 9 items), and functional (DHI‒F; 9 items) and each item is scored from 0 to 4. Grading standard: 0-30 points is defiend as minor obstacles, 31-60 points as moderate obstacle, and 61-100 points as serious obstacle with high risk of falling.</description>

    <description>Measure statistically significant difference in perception of depression by administering the Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) between two groups at different time point. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) has a total of 24 items. 14 items were scored from 0 to 4, and 10 items were scored from 0 to 2. The total score that less than 8 points is defined as no depression, 8 to 20 points as may be depression, scores that more than 20 is defined as mild or moderate depression, and more than 35 points as severe depression.</description>

    <description>Measure statistically significant difference in perception of sleep quality by administering the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) between two groups at different time point. PSQI was used to assess the sleep quality of subjects in the last month. It consists of 19 self-evaluation items and 5 other evaluation items, of which only 18 self-evaluation items participate in scoring. 18 items constitute 7 components, and each component is scored according to 0 ~ 3 grades. The PSQI total score ranges from 0 to 21. The higher the score indicates the worser sleep quality.</description>
