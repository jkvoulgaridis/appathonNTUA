  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well the Remotivation Process in an occupational therapy program works
      in improving adherence to lymphedema treatment programs in patients with breast
      cancer-related lymphedema. Lymphedema treatment programs are well developed and effective,
      but adherence to these programs are an issue. The Remotivation Process is a series of
      techniques that helps guide discussions between occupational therapists and their patients
      based on their level of motivation. This study uses the Remotivation Process by gathering
      patients' thoughts about their experience with lymphedema and occupational therapy services
      to determine their motivation and learn about the barriers they face in order to improve
      adherence to these programs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. How does remotivation process change daily performance of the lymphedema management
      techniques? (Quantitative Study) II. How does the Remotivation Process affect the client's
      manifestation of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL)? (Quantitative Study) III. How does
      the Remotivation Process affect the client's occupational participation and quality of life?
      (Quantitative Study) IV. What are the perspectives of patients with BCRL about the
      self-management program after participating in an occupational therapy using the Remotivation
      Process? (Qualitative Study) V. What are the perspectives of patients with BCRL about their
      arm after the occupational therapy program? (Qualitative Study) VI. How do patients with BCRL
      describe their daily life after occupational therapy? (Qualitative Study)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in a discussion with an occupational therapist via videoconferencing
      over 15 minutes once weekly (QW) for 4 weeks about their experience with lymphedema and the
      occupational services they received. After 4 weeks, some patients may also participate in an
      interview with an occupational therapist via videoconferencing over 60 minutes. During the
      first week of the study, patients also receive occupational therapy per standard of care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <description>Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to establish significance and compare the pre-test and post-test girth of the affected arm as well as compare the difference between the affected and non-affected arm at pre-test and post-test. Non-parametric tests will be used should the study not meet the assumptions of parametric test. For non-parametric tests in this case, Friedman's analysis of variance will be used to compare girth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by the Lymphedema Quality of Life Inventory. Will be compared using paired t-test. Pearson correlation will be used to determine the correlation between the score from the Model of Human Occupation Screening Tool and scores from the Lymphedema Quality of Life Inventory. Non-parametric tests will be used should the study not meet the assumptions of parametric test. For non-parametric tests in this case, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test will be used to compare the pre-test and post test scores. The Spearman's ranks tests will be used to determine the correlation between the score from the Model of Human Occupation Screening Tool and scores from the Lymphedema Quality of Life Inventory. The qualitative phase follows a descriptive phenomenological design. Thematic analysis will be used to analyze data.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unilateral upper extremity lymphedema following procedures to address breast cancer,
             able to communicate in English and participate in discussion sessions and follow up
             for the duration of the study of eight weeks

          -  Women will be able to participate in work, household responsibilities, and possible
             child-rearing responsibilities. These are necessary components of quality of life and
             occupation, which are the primary concepts of interest of the study. The study will
             include women with varied levels of functional performance status and life expectancy
             as long as they are willing to participate in a 15-minute discussion once a week in
             addition to their scheduled occupational therapy sessions at City of Hope (COH)

          -  The effects of Remotivation Process on the developing fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for six months following duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the
             trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent

          -  The participant should also be receiving occupational therapy services at COH for BCRL
             during the first week of the study. The participant can be an on-going patient
             receiving customary occupational therapy services, or a new patient who will be seen
             for occupational therapy initial evaluation. The study will include patients with BCRL
             regardless of any other medical treatment they are receiving in addition to
             occupational therapy. Some participants may only need less than 4 weeks of customary
             occupational therapy in order to meet their intervention goals. In this case, the
             participant will still be asked to return at the end of the fourth week for follow up.
             Data obtained from the outcome measures will be included in quantitative analysis. The
             participant will also be included in the list of names that will be randomly selected
             for the 60-minute interview

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active
             infection such as cellulitis

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study
