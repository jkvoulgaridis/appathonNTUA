  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open water swimming is a swimming discipline which takes place in outdoor water such as open
      oceans, lakes, and rivers. Elite swimmers are exposed to hypothermia when swimming in cold
      water, especially in long duration races, such as the 25-km race. The objective of this study
      is to evaluate the change in body core temperature in swimmers with continuous temperature
      monitoring during a 25-km race. The secondary objective is to identify the predictors of
      hypothermia and hypothermia-related drop-out.
